{"name": "Resident Evil 4 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-4-recensione.html", "text": "The unbearable heaviness of converting Strongly different from its predecessors, before its release Resident Evil 4 had initially left all purists of the survival horror genre very perplexed, presenting game mechanics much closer to a third-person shooter. Jumps, climbs, crowds of enemies simultaneously on the screen, weapons of all kinds: but where was Resident Evil? Any doubts were then largely dispelled when the game made its appearance on the shelves and proved to be a true masterpiece in terms of level design, playability, graphics (at the time the best ever seen on consoles) and longevity. Acclaimed by critics and with six million copies sold in just one year, the Capcom-branded action-horror was then announced on PC, where after three very long delays (initially it was scheduled for winter 2006) it finally managed to arrive after more than a year. A bit of history In Resident Evil 4 you go to impersonate Leon Kennedy, an old acquaintance of the series since he already appeared as one of the two playable characters in the second chapter, when he was still a simple cadet of the police academy. Six years have passed since the destruction of Racoon City and the bankruptcy of Umbrella, and now Leon, despite his still young age, is a veteran of the special forces of the army. His mission is to rescue none other than Ashley, the daughter of the President of the United States held captive by a mysterious sect in a small village lost in the mountains of Spain. Is there any correlation between this strange settlement and Umbrella? Who are the shady figures at the head of this sect? And how do they so effectively plagiarize the poor villagers, to the point of resetting their will and controlling them like puppets? Dive into the nightmare The first big difference from the past that any fan of the saga can see as soon as Resident Evil 4 is launched is the completely 3D environment with a fixed third-person view, placed directly behind the shoulders of the protagonist who always remains in the lower right corner. left of the screen (this type of view was then adopted by other games, such as Gears of War). Such a choice is certainly not usual for the survival horror genre, and in fact it already begins to channel playability towards something that is halfway between an action game and a first person shooter. The camera can be managed to a limited extent, being able to make an excursion of about 180 in each axis, as if to emulate the movement of the head. The second substantial difference is the nature very oriented towards the action shooter genre: the enemies, contrary to what has been seen in the past, are fast, intelligent and capable of using weapons, tools and interacting with elements of the scenario such as stairs, doors and so on. The quantity of shady figures that must be faced simultaneously, sometimes more than a dozen, is also initially a bit disorienting, something absolutely unheard of in the previous chapters. Such an approach to gameplay has naturally required a certain agility and dynamism applied to the character, who can now use scenery objects, block passages, climb or even jump down from some windows. the amount of shady figures that you have to deal with at the same time is sometimes more than a dozen, something absolutely unheard of in the previous chapters Dive into the nightmare The arsenal of weapons available is more supplied than ever, and in this PC version it reaches levels of excellence, starting from at least five or six different types of pistols up to bazookas and sniper rifles. The clashes are always very funny and varied, so much so that until the end the level of interest will always be very high. Given the more ~action~ nature of the game, the puzzles have gone a bit into the background, but instead more battles have been introduced with the famous ~end-of-level bosses~, epic and spectacular. The game was created around an analog joypad, so this is the most suitable controller, but the keyboard can still be used and, with a special patch that we report a few lines below, also the mouse. Testing the game with the Logitech Rumblepad the controls proved to be more than good, even if they didn't return the exact same feeling of the console versions. With two different PlayStation 2 joypad adapters, however, things went very badly: the commands given with the analog sticks were executed with at least a second delay, making everything unplayable. The game is very long-lived: completing the adventure the first time takes about 20/22 hours, there is a fair rate of re-playability and all the extra modes included (even superior to those seen on PS2) ensureno several more hours of fun. Unfortunately there is the absence of a mode for multiplayer. For the mouse diehards For those who don't really want to hear about an analog joypad, this unofficial patch that enables the use of the mouse in Resident Evil 4 comes in handy. By running this executable before launching the game, you can aim with the mouse and also map different functions in its buttons. We have personally tested this patch and we assure you that it is functional and safe, but in any case Multiplayer.it assumes no responsibility for any damage it could cause to your computer. You can download the patch from our Files Area. Graphics and sound The visual impact is not the most comforting, and in fact it is the graphics that are one of the most penalized aspects of this approximate conversion. In addition to not offering any of those beautiful effects to which the PC player has become accustomed for years, including simple pixel shaders, Resident Evil 4 even comes with a neutered lighting system, resulting in many ways worse than the GameCube version and even of the PS2 version. For the rest, the polygonal mass is exactly that seen on the console, but paradoxically the higher resolutions of which the PC is capable seem to worsen the visual rendering, causing the landscapes (especially the woods) to appear extremely confused and ~mixed . The sound is naturally identical to the original version, with excellent speech in English (or Spanish in the case of villagers) and Italian subtitles. Good music and sound effects. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Operating System: Windows XP Processor: Pentium 4 1.4 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: Direct X 9.0, 128 MB, Shader 2.0 Disk Space: 4.6 GB Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 2.4 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB Video Card: Direct X 9.0 compatible, from ATi X1800 and GeForce 7800 with 256 MB Disk Space: 4.6 GB Test Configuration: Processor: AMD Sempron 3500+ RAM: 1 GB Video Card: Ati X1600 Pro Monitor: Dell 24 Conclusions A masterpiece ruined by a conversion that is not up to par, which instead of improving the excellent graphics seen on the console degrades it, and presents some problems in the control system, failing to offer the precision and feeling of the original version. A game that is still intrinsically valid, and that no true lover of the series should let slip away. Purchase absolutely not recommended, however, for those who have already had the opportunity to play the title in question on consoles. Pros Very long-lived and full of additional modes Fun and challenging Competitive price Cons Indecorous conversion Technically poor It greatly loses the appeal of the original The unbearable heaviness of converting When you see yourself assigned a review of a game that you know inside out, you immediately start thinking about all the things you can tell, explore, communicate to readers. This also happened to me in the case of Resident Evil 4 - a game that I played both on GameCube and on PlayStation 2 - but when I got to try this PC version directly, the bitterness took over. As many enthusiasts feared, the porting was in fact rather approximate, even managing to diminish even a universally recognized masterpiece like this. But let's proceed step by step. Resident Evil 4 is the most recent chapter of one of the most famous saga in the history of video games, first released on the Nintendo cubic console and a few months later on the black monolith from Sony.", "date": "2007-03-14", "grade": null}
