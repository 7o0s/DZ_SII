Especially in recent times this genre has benefited from the spread of laptops, PCs in the workplace, Facebook, low-priced arcades and smartphones and has once again established itself as one of the most interesting, recording dizzying sales. In short, a global success that has also rewarded the Bejeweled series, played by millions of players every day, and whoever develops it, the American PopCap also behind other incredible successes, such as Plants against Zombies. It is therefore not surprising that the company still focuses on a saga that not only launched the software house a good ten years ago, but which has also received several awards for its quality and has proven itself capable of generating constant profits through a quantity of different systems. The four main modes On the one hand Bejeweled 3 is always focused on making combinations of 3, 4 or 5 precious stones and firmly continues the tradition of the saga by focusing on combos and timed challenges, but on the other it enriches the formula with numerous extra elements. Elements that include new gems, such as the devastating supernova that requires a combination of six stones, but also new modes, a long series of objectives and even some changes to the historical options which obviously, Classic mode included, return in full. On the side of the challenge, the Blitz mode undoubtedly checks out, or the lucky timed mode of the latest versions of Bejeweled which has consecrated the Popcap title on Facebook and on smartphones. But this time the competitive variant is called Lightning and has some surprises in store such as the time gems that replace the multiplier gems. These are special elements that charge a time bonus when combined or exploded and radically change the gameplay allowing for stratospheric scores. The only reason for disappointment is that there is no integration with Facebook: the choice probably derives from the priority, within the planetary social network, reserved for Bejeweled Blitz which has evolved apart by including new bonuses that can be purchased with currency sound or earned through the now classic advertising interactions of social networks. In this third chapter the Endless mode also returns - here called Zen as in Bejeweled Twist - and gives us the possibility to play endlessly without time limits or obstacles of any kind. A type of enjoyment devoted to relaxation that returns in a more charismatic form with a series of options, such as the sound of seagulls and human breathing, which seek to transform the title into a relaxing meditative experience. However, it is difficult to evaluate its quality both in terms of gameplay and meditation, and even if the audio is certainly of a good level, we find the pleasant standard soundtracks more compatible with the title which combine effectively with the sound effects of the gems, explosions and bonuses. Finally we come to the brand new mode of Bejeweled 3. Let's talk about the Quest Mode which allows us to tackle 40 missions based on dozens of variations of the basic gameplay. And four of these variants are also unlockable as main modes by completing specific tasks in the initial four modes. Quest mode: a multifaceted experience The Quest Mode obviously includes the good old time bombs and time trials of all kinds but by tackling the 40 missions available we also find some rather complex and innovative gameplay variations. Variations often based on chance and radically different from the classic Bejeweled modalities, but which are capable of elevating its complexity and depth and of justifying those 20 euros in price which are certainly not a huge amount but are not even a few for a puzzle game. And here are some examples related to the various challenges of the Quest mode: Butterflies: some butterflies, designed as gems with wings, cross the board advancing each turn. A hungry spider awaits them on the other side of the playing field. Obviously the butterflies must be combined or hit by an explosion before they reach the arachnid. The level of challenge is quite high, the soundtrack incredibly spot on and also from an aesthetic point of view it is one of the best variants. Gold rush: causing the explosion of the gems that rest on the layer of ground below it is possible to reach some gold nuggets. An alternative version of this mode asks you to combine gems in particular areas of the board that are covered in sand to uncover a variety of ancienthe relics. Avalanche: the gem board is partially empty but several gems fall from top to bottom every time we hit a combination. The aim is to match enough gems before the screen fills up and of course it's not enough to just match 3 gems. Ice Storm: Some ice bars grow from the bottom up but break as gems are combined along the way. In fact, the objective is to prevent the same bar from reaching the top of the board twice, interrupting the game. This is perhaps the most difficult mode of Bejeweled 3, with the columns gradually becoming thinner and faster. Poker: combinations of a specific gem produce a card depicting it which is placed in a pile to the left of the board. Obviously you have to combine the cards according to poker points ranging from pairs to flushes and having to wait for the right gems somehow really recreates the wait of poker. The straight is missing but in its place is the Spectrum, or a hand made up of five cards. Creating special gems allows the related card to give us bonus points. The combinations of several gems give cards with double value. The hypercube instead creates a wild card Miscellaneous: Quest Mode features all sorts of timed modes that require you to make specific combinations of gems within a time limit or even color the entire board by combining gemstones along a specific line or column to dye it gold. Tight challenge or brooding relaxation? Unsurprisingly, the four unlockable modes are also the four most refined and complex gameplay types in Quest mode. We start from the aforementioned Butterfly mode, which requires careful planning of the moves, and we arrive at the Ice Storm via Poker and the Diamond Mine. The latter allows us to dig into the ground as happens in the Gold Rush, proceeding from level to level ever deeper, even finding absolutely useless artifacts and bonuses of all kinds. Poker, on the other hand, is a more peaceful mode with no time limits, while Ice Storm doesn't allow even a second of reflection and is undoubtedly the most difficult to tame. Said of all these variants, pleasant additions to the main offer, the queen mode of Bejeweled 3 undoubtedly remains the aforementioned Lightning Mode, at least in terms of tight and competitive gameplay. And the new time gems further increase the depth of this which, although limited to just one minute at the start, is designed to allow frightening escalations. In fact, Lightning is also played while the screen explodes and a single slowdown can compromise the entire game. Furthermore, the percentage of possible combos is significantly higher than the other modes of the Popcap title and in this third chapter it is even higher than in Bejeweled 2. But if on the one hand more combos and greater speed increase spectacularity and scores, on the other they also increase the difficulty in planning the moves that must be achieved quickly to guarantee bonuses and multipliers. On the other hand, even if time is now the key element and there are no more specific gems to raise the multiplier, the latter is the fundamental factor for making sense of the more complex combos, allowing us to reach record scores. In short, Bejeweled 3 is extremely varied and is therefore able to offer a range of experiences based on very different timings that can give us both 10 minutes at gun cotton and hours of relaxed leisure. The Zen mode is proposed as a pure pastime while the Quest Mode is more articulated and sets goals to be achieved which could, among other things, also involve those who do not appreciate the standard modes. And if that weren't enough, the Popcap title also includes 65 objectives, here called badges, which are now essential to add a pinch of challenge to every video game. The basic badges are simple to obtain and it is enough to try more or less all the disciplines of Bejeweled to obtain them in a short time. Less simple the elite ones even if the assiduous players will not struggle to conquer them. Not all that glitters is gold The aesthetic innovations are numerous and several also concern the part of the screen outside the box that contains the gems. Suggestive animated backgrounds, alchemical laboratories and decks of cards that are made up enrich the general look of the title which in any case can count on the central box in which glitters and explosions in high definition are almost never missing. But if modes like Lightning can make the most of the new gem animations, lighting, laser beams and new explosions,the same does not happen in the classic mode which is more subdued and shows the side when compared to other graphically more lively and inspired puzzle games. Furthermore, the effects such as the columns of ice, the spider waiting for the butterflies on the edge of the screen and the ground or sand that populate some modes are certainly not the non plus ultra in terms of drawings or animation quality. Among other things, the engine is not very light and with an outdated computer the most agitated modes can cause some slowdown which is absolutely not compatible with the frenetic gameplay of the timed variants. Fortunately, the scalability is good and it is possible to reduce various parameters in addition to the resolution, in order to run the title even on modest hardware. Moving on to the sound, the synthesized music stands out, clearly inspired by famous pieces, which are of good quality and above all are engaging and hypnotic enough to keep you glued to Bejeweled 3 as much and more than the game itself. The sound effects, the voice that comments on our exploits and the sound sector of the zen mode are also excellent even if a few more bass for the explosions would not have hurt anyone.", "date": "2010-12-13", "grade": "8.5"}
