Many have tried to reproduce this type of challenge on iOS devices, but only the Bike Baron here can boast of having approached Trials HD both in terms of quality and in terms of sheer perfidy... Bio Park! Bike Baron is a title that gets lost in small talk: by launching the application you don't even go through the main menu, but you are thrown directly into the heart of the action, in this case in the last level faced. As anticipated at the beginning, we are talking about an emulator of Trials HD, or a game that puts the user on the saddle of a motorcycle and requires him to complete a whole series of stages (44, to be exact) reaching the finish line to obstacles that are gradually becoming more and more complicated. Everything takes place on a two-dimensional plane, so it is necessary to deal ~only~ with acceleration, braking and the inclination of the motorcycle: the quotation marks are a must, given that such a simple structure on paper becomes incredibly complex if accompanied by a design up to it. Something that Bike Baron absolutely does not miss: the on-screen controls are comfortable and responsive, the physical routines that regulate the movements of the two wheels are convincing and the levels can boast excellent production values in terms of variety and ingenuity. Once the first stages have been cleared with relative simplicity, situations are soon reached that require the user to carefully measure the few inputs made available: between loop-the-loops, millimeter jumps and barrels of dynamite ready to explode at the slightest touch, what at first glance it may appear as a rosewater version of Trials HD brings out all its nastiness with no holds barred. Therefore, if initially Bike Baron may appear to be the ideal filler for the short dead moments of the day thanks to its immediacy, in the more complex levels the product turns into a dark vortex capable of stealing tens of minutes for overcoming a single obstacle and of transforming the quieter than users in a bloodthirsty beast. As is well known, the line between a high rate of challenge and pure frustration is very blurred, and Bike Baron often and willingly crosses it, exaggerating with extreme stages in which it is already difficult to overcome the first meters of the route, let alone obtain the relative stars to various objectives (finish in given time, collect all coins, avoid crashes and so on). At least the donation of these prizes is so generous in the initial stages of the campaign as to allow you to easily unlock all levels of the game, but the fact remains that the second half of the experience offered by the title can hardly be defined as enjoyable in the literal sense of the word. term. A solution to this problem can be represented by the presence of a convenient and powerful route editor, which goes hand in hand with the ability to download user-created content, which is already very numerous at the time of writing this article. The developers then immediately started off on the right foot by offering a free update that added a nice handful of Halloween-themed stages, which bodes well for future updates. Finally, from a technical point of view, Bike Baron defends itself really well: the graphics, while remaining extremely functional, are very pleasant, especially as regards the behavior of the bike and the animations of the rider, which are hilarious during accidents. The sound is also good, thanks to the convincing noise of the engine, the mutterings of the protagonist and a musical theme from a tavern that says it all.
