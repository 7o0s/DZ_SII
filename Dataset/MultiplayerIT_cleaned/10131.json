Years of the Cold War, of proximity to countries with growing hostility, the apparent lack of control of an enormous, vast and oversized military apparatus in terms of armaments, must have left their mark on the collective imagination of this immense nation. And the results are visible in a large part of the intellectual properties born in Russian territory, with video games that do not seem to be outdone: if we take into consideration the best productions of this form of entertainment made in the former USSR, we cannot ignore the common thread represented right from the nuclear holocaust. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. in particular, but also a more niche title like Cryostasis, they base a large part of their narrative on some disaster linked to unspecified nuclear explosions. And today here comes Metro 2033, a video game created by the newborn 4A Games, which has several links with Shadow of Chernobyl (part of the lead designers and programmers are departments of GSC Game World, the software house behind the troubled S.T.A.L.K.E.R.), based on the massive and eponymous novel by Dmitry Glukhovsky. An absolutely linear and exclusively single player first-person shooter, without any role-playing ambitions that arrives like a bolt from the blue on PC and Xbox 360, thanks to the visionary publishing of THQ. It probably won't be a masterpiece remembered in the years to come, but there are several factors that could make you want to play it in one go and we will try to analyze them in the course of this review. We are alone in these tunnels of terror Metro 2033 opens with a small prologue that also serves as a tutorial and then develops into a long flashback that comes full circle after 8 days of wandering inside the Moscow underground tunnels. The game is divided into seven chapters, with the exception of the first and last, which are rather short, each one is made up of at least 6-7 missions of extremely variable duration and settings. The epilogue of Artyom's journey, the protagonist that we will be invited to check, can be reached in 10 abundant hours of gameplay and consists of two alternative endings. It is essential to understand that Metro 2033, as already mentioned above, is a pure and raw FPS, a first person shooter without any such deviation, almost a sort of ideal mix between a Half-Life (the first) and a Call of Duty any: the game is linear, all the focus is on the atmosphere injected by the developers into this fascinating underground world and on the narrative that allows the player to follow in Artyom's footsteps gradually discovering the multiple realities of lives who, sadly, still populate a world devastated by atomic fallout. The scripting is there but it is reduced to a minimum, it is never invasive or annoying and even the respawn is practically absent, except for a couple of situations where it is required by the story. But there are a handful of elements that positively distinguish 4A Games' debut project, starting with its variety within a usually well-confined gameplay. In fact, Metro 2033 manages to offer all the typical situations that we have experienced in the shooters of recent years. We will have solo sections with a more or less marked horror component, exploration parts where we will move inside the subway tunnels without perhaps encountering any enemies, moments in which we will have to defend a position strenuously in the company of other militiamen, or go to the assault of fortifications using a group military structure. There will be some puzzles, even some platform moments or those based on small sequences in quick time events (unfortunately to be forgotten quickly) and the classic track scenarios where we will find ourselves shooting with a fixed turret mounted on some means of locomotion and even with a flamethrower. Nothing is left out, even some atmospheric flashbacks that tend to recall F.E.A.R. and the only apparent feeling of freedom instilled in Metro 2033 takes the form of the sporadic phases of entering a camp of enemy soldiers. In fact, here we will be able to choose whether to adopt a stealth tactic or a pure and simple frontal attack. In the first case we will have a small visibility indicator mounted on the arm and which will immediately show us how much we risk being seen by the enemy. We will be able to interact with the lights to turn them off or deactivate them, it will therefore be essential to avoid any explosive or noisy traps and possibly kill the soldiers.policemen on patrol with silenced weapons. On paper these sections could work well but an excessive initial difficulty (especially when you don't have weapons equipped with a silencer), a rather deficient artificial intelligence that tends to ~wake up~ the patrols sometimes for absolutely unknown reasons and above all a rather anomalous, they almost force the player after a couple of attempts to advance with the rifle leveled. In fact, the game automatically saves even on PC when certain points are reached, the problem is that often these are also quite distant from each other and it will not rarely happen to sneak into the camp, lose several minutes to defuse some trap, carefully avoid shattered glass so as not to make any noise, take a position behind a crate ready to throw a knife at the enemy and then spectacularly fail the shot. Which might not be a problem if it weren't for the fact that that very knife, perhaps ending up against a wall at a great distance from the opposing soldier, leads to the instantaneous activation of an alarm with a consequent assault by the militia. Inevitably you die and just as inevitably you find yourself forced to redo the whole sequence, increasing your degree of frustration hand in hand. The book Metro 2033 is directly based on the book of the same name by Dmitry Glukhovsky. The work was born out of ten years of work by the young author who began writing it at the age of high school, taking advantage of the time he used every day to reach high school by subway, living in the poorest and most distant suburbs of Moscow. After numerous sketches, the book was born, first released free of charge and then, finally, in a printed version and sold in all bookshops. Metro 2033 has already been translated into many European languages, is currently being evaluated for a film adaptation and will also arrive in Italy at the same time as the game's release thanks to the translation by Multiplayer.it Edizioni. It is a substantial volume of almost 800 pages sold at the recommended price of 17.90, which you can find in the best bookstores and video game stores. Let's get physical, physical The other innovative and extremely positive component of Metro 2033 is the sense of physicality and involvement that it continuously manages to convey to the player. It is not only the claustrophobic atmosphere and the perfect alternation of sections inside tunnels where it is even difficult to breathe, with the few outdoor sections in a spectral and frozen Moscow alternating with the sporadic moments of relaxation inside the camps friendly humans. It is precisely the gameplay that returns a constant feeling of realism and effort in wearing Artyom's shoes. The weapon models are extremely well done, as are their animations. The remaining ammo itself is often viewed through a protruding magazine minimizing the need for an on-screen interface. Periodically during our wanderings in the dark, we will have to take out a pocket dynamo to keep the flashlight or night vision device constantly charged. The small notepad equipped with a compass that allows us to immediately remember what our goal is and to constantly follow the correct direction must be physically pulled out of the belt and, in dark situations, illuminated with a pocket lighter. The interaction with the gas mask is also exceptional: this will be worn outdoors or when the gases and poisons will be unbearable. The vision will tend to blur if we stay too long on the icy streets of Moscow, our breathing will become more and more labored and we will have to constantly keep an eye on the clock to see how much time remains before it is necessary to change the filter. All these elements add up, making Artyom's in-game behavior much more lively and interactive. And the same game world also gains depth through a rather credible economic system. In Metro 2033 the currency is represented by the old pre-nuclear bombing military cartridges. They are rarely found around (they are almost a reward for exploration), sometimes some key characters will give us some but more often we will find them on the bodies of killed soldiers who will always have to be meticulously looted to flesh out our equipment. These cartridges can be used to buy new weapons or ammunition inside military camps but they can also be concretely equipped to increase the firepower of our machine gun. In doing so, however, each shot is equivalent to a monetary expenditure, making that feeling of survival palpablethe horror that often distinguishes the game. Artyom will be able to carry knives, two types of dynamite, a pistol, an automatic rifle and a shotgun or a pneumatic weapon for launching darts. Each of this type of paraphernalia will have different variations on the theme, for example we will be able to buy a revolver with a longer barrel to increase the damage, or equipped with a silencer. It will not be possible to customize a weapon according to one's needs, that must be understood, but there will be enough alternatives to satisfy the fighting style of every player. All this gold doesn't glitter so well And it is precisely starting from the paraphernalia that we feel obliged to describe the negative sides of Metro 2033, until now only incensed in its fascinating peculiarities. The 4A Games creature exudes incompleteness in many respects. It seems that development has been terminated prematurely or that there is a lack of adequate testing period. Perhaps to take advantage of a rather poor FPS period or to avoid the clash with the sacred monsters of autumn 2010, it was decided to give up the crucial six months of polishing and optimizing the gameplay and unfortunately the result is noticeable. Some aspects of the game are rough or unfinished. Even if the economic system works on a conceptual level, it actually has several problems: it is never clear if and when a weapon is more powerful than the one being worn, especially when one is deciding whether to take it from a downed enemy as often it is not understandable the type of ammunition used by a weapon and this creates many problems in the equipment phase, also thanks to the fact that once you leave the camp, it will not be possible to go back. It will not infrequently happen to buy a lot of ammunition of one type, except to discover only in the combat phase that you do not have any weapons that use those cartridges. But the real problem of the game are unfortunately the fights, just the shooter soul that distinguishes the genre to which it belongs. First of all, there is a lack of feedback sensation when hitting the enemy: outside of a small splash of blood, there are no animations or textures that change to indicate that we have actually hit our opponent. He will continue to move as if nothing had happened, to attack us or outflank us; it will simply out of the blue fall to the ground after a certain number of hits. The sensation is that of shooting blanks and, especially when the enemies are numerous, the result is rather disconcerting because it will be tiring to focus on the opponent perhaps in more critical conditions. As if that weren't enough to complicate our lives there is also the view. Most of the enemies are mutants who move on all fours and who will tend to attack us in melee, up close, by taking us from behind or jumping towards us and then clawing at us. The tendency will therefore be to keep the camera always rather low but on the one hand the lack of the above feedback, on the other the constant movement of our view caused by the mutants taking blows towards us, will have the tragic result of make aiming extremely complex and artificial. This is particularly valid on Xbox 360, thanks to the innate slowness of the analog and the final rendering leads to a feeling of frustration in the most chaotic combat situations, in particular the furious ones near the endgame. And it is unfortunately evident how harmful it is for an FPS to be deficient in shootings. Xbox 360 goals Metro 2033 has 39 objectives, 9 of which are secret, for a total of 1000 points. About fifteen are related to the plot and will be acquired naturally by finishing the game while most of the rest are related to combat, such as the various objectives related to the killing of various types of mutants, or try to stimulate the player to explore, such as those related to the collection of all historical ammunition. Also noteworthy are a handful of objectives related to the stealth sections to entice the player to complete them both by remaining hidden and by advancing with the rifle leveled. The new visual standard? The sense of incompleteness also permeates the technical aspect of Metro 2033. The game has a management of lights, fumes and volumetric mists that to date has no equal both in the console field and, in particular, on PC. On Xbox 360 the game also runs smoothly, except for a couple of situations where the particle struggles with a rather chaotic action. The developers were clever in taking advantage of the indoor setting which tends to eliminate a whole series of problems related to the visual horizon and the elements", "date": "2010-03-19", "grade": "8.5"}
