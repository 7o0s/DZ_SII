Then the game is launched, the presentation is attended and all the possible preventive constructs fail, leaving us rather disoriented but definitely amused. On the other hand, the Dutch development team is not new to such operations, and indeed Awesomenauts seems to fit perfectly into the work of reinterpreting the strategy that began with the previous Swords & Soldiers, with which this title shares style and general setting in terms of gameplay and graphical representation. The most striking feature in both titles is the two-dimensionality, a choice that crushes the classic depth of real-time strategy games into two dimensions, necessarily bending the mechanics towards more action and immediate meanings, a real ~flattening~ in a spatial sense that however, it proves to be free from negative connotations, rather paving the way for new hybridizations with the action genre and for decidedly captivating stylistic solutions. Here then is that the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena manages to pass from the cult status in the most hardcore circles of PC users to the console public humorous, even passing from the more purely playful and immediate channels of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, or Live Arcade and PlayStation Network . While falling precisely within the definition of the genre, Awesomenauts manages not to be derivative in the slightest and makes it clear right away, presenting itself with an animated cartoon introduction that seems to come directly from Cartoon Network, colorful graphics and a splendid platform characterization 90s that manages to give the game a very particular identity, which is not easy to achieve in a MOBA. Let's not be misled, however, since the stylistic choice does not only underlie a desire to bastardize the genre and bring it to a wider audience. The Ronimo game is based on precise, deep and well-structured mechanics and its use requires a calibrated dosage of skill with the controller and strategic ability. Drilling platform As befits a MOBA, the matches take place within extensive but well-defined maps, in which we find ourselves fighting by controlling, as in a sort of platform/shooter, a character (a ~hero~, in the standard of RTS) capable of jumping, shooting and using special abilities. The maps are characterized by two focal points of interest corresponding to the drills, huge machines used for the extraction of the Solar, or the primary energetic matter in the Awesomenauts universe. In essence, the aim of the game is the protection of one's drill and the destruction of the opposing one, a fundamental mechanic that refers to that typical of team multiplayer with bases. Two teams made up of three main characters each line up on the field, each characterized by certain specific skills but deeply modifiable thanks to the upgrades that can be purchased directly on the battlefield at your base, by spending the accumulated Solar. Three more are added to the three basic characters as the game progresses, a not huge number but sufficient to cover the classic basic stereotypes (tank, healer, long and short range attack) with all the possible evolutions that follow the several choices made in terms of skill tree, the latter being quite complex and varied. To tell the truth, there is a certain imbalance in favor of the three unlockable characters who are superior to the basic three, which can lead, at first, to a certain difficulty for novice players who find themselves in the game against others who already have advanced fighters, as there is no filter to establish a handicap on this aspect. The main characters are joined by armies of automated drones that advance towards the opposing base and huge turrets placed at the access points on the way to the bases and which constitute the main hubs of the battle, the points where the most furious clashes take place, these being the main obstacles to achieving the goal. Once weakened and then destroyed, turrets cannot be rebuilt, so it is of fundamental importance to protect your own and try to destroy the opposing ones. Drones can be used to weaken enemy defenses and as mobile shields, letting fire focus on them as we get closer to the objective. Xbox 360 goals 12 achievements for 200 total points are present in Awesomenauts. Given the nature of the game, the objectives are limitedhealthy above all on the cumulative performance of the player in the various matches, linked to the amount of victories achieved, kills made and awards obtained in the standings. A good harvest requires dedication, as always with Awesomenauts. Two dimensional depth Although the initial impression may give the idea of a confusing game mechanic, more brought to shooter-style action, Awesomenauts instead rewards the reasoned approach to the clash. The hero's energy is limited and the reset of this, although it does not represent the closure of the game, determines the return to the capsule and the initial landing sequence before being able to re-enter the action, with a substantial loss of precious seconds which can be fatal to the game's power shift, as well as forcefully releasing copious amounts of Solar at the mercy of enemies once you're - momentarily - eliminated. It is therefore preferable to act with caution and use the teleport to return to the base and heal yourself, in case there are no available kits. Even teleportation must be handled carefully, however, because it takes a few seconds to activate, during which we are completely vulnerable. Given the strategic load and the need to coordinate team action, it is clear that the best way to play is certainly in multiplayer with human companions and opponents, also playable in split-screen (although with occasional slowdowns in this case, in the most chaotic). However, the game structure is set to three-on-three PvP and in the absence of players, the CPU replaces them with bots, but the uncertain artificial intelligence of the latter does not allow for the elaboration of coordinated team strategies, as well as obviously not reaching the level of engagement and challenge that the human mate or adversary is able to provide. The reiterated structure focused on mechanics that basically don't allow huge variations on the theme tends to trigger a sense of monotony after long sessions, and the presence of only three maps (at least for the moment) makes itself felt on this point too, but it is however difficult not to be kidnapped by the perfect game mechanism and constant evolution of the characters, so as to make it difficult to abandon Awesomenauts. Another note that can be made to Ronimo is on the general pace of the matches, which often drag on for a long time despite the balance of forces being inexorably defined once they get to a certain point, tiredly lengthening the agony of a team without this having any effect possibility of overturning the result. Perhaps the imposition of a time limit would have helped on this front.", "date": "2012-05-18", "grade": "8.0"}
