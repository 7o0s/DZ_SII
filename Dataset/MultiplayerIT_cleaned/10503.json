The second installment, released a couple of years later, was nothing more than a revised and corrected version of the chronicles of the Martian miners; once again, there was no shortage of approval. Technological evolution has subsequently resized the main feature of the THQ title, so as to persuade the programmers to rethink the game structure from scratch, however still exploiting a very valid brand. The creatives of Volition have decided to bring one of their most successful creations up to date by transforming it into a real GTA sand-box. In Red Faction: Guerrilla the camera moves behind the protagonist, and the levels disappear in favor of an open and (almost) completely explorable space right away. Even the technical sector has been revolutionized: the physics engine, the real workhorse of the first Geo-Mod, has been sensationally entrusted in this version to the tested and reliable Havok. Of the old Red Faction, however, the settings (Martian soils) and protagonists (rebel miners grappling with the ruthless corporation) remained. Another ~feature~ that unites the third chapter of the saga is the release date for PC, which, as happened in the past for the first two titles, has been postponed by a few months compared to the console versions. Therapeutic destruction The gameplay, tested and intuitive, while leaving the player a fair amount of freedom, remains linear: the main missions assigned by the Red Faction to our alter ego aim to weaken the EDF (the ~good guys~ of the first chapter) and decrease the its control over one of the six sectors of Mars in which we are operating. They are decidedly more intriguing and varied, with often quite original gimmicks - from the simple demolition of buildings to the destruction of transmitters in a vehicle in the race, pursued by dozens of enemies - than the side quests, all aimed at reducing the influence of 'EDF and to increase our fame: the gratitude of civilians will lead them to lend us a hand in firefights and at the same time we will have to be very careful not to harm our allies or presumed such to avoid becoming a little too unpopular. The side missions are quite similar to each other: destruction of plants and buildings or support for rebels attacked by the EDF in completely random places and times. The transition to the Windows standard has allowed the use of the mouse/keyboard combination: the freedom of movement thus released does not immediately guarantee confidence with the controls, since the viewfinder is not located in the center of the screen but unusually on the right, and the what could leave you disoriented especially in the most agitated situations. However, a few games will be enough to practice, even if someone might be tempted to enable the automatic aim, perhaps using the Xbox 360 controller which is perfectly supported. However, the true leitmotif of the saga remains total annihilation, which is at the discretion of the player: you can pounce on a farmhouse and start tearing down all the walls, or hit that single, realistic point that is the cornerstone of the whole structure . A couple of hits, and an entire building will collapse in front of you. There are no precalculations, it's all in real-time. Bridges, towers, vehicles - everything falls apart when hit by hammer blows, controlled explosives, rockets, lasers and more. A tasty element which, among other things, fits perfectly into the pure action gameplay of Guerrilla: a well-placed bomb is enough to bring down a bridge under the feet of our pursuers, leading them to certain death. A building full of EDF guards will kill them all, if you aim for the pillars, destroying them before your opponents can escape. A devastation under the complete control of the player, even in multiplayer mode: the online component of Guerrilla is well structured even before playing, full of options to customize your games, and proves to be a fun pastime between one mission and another. sometimes exhilarating. The PC version supports the Microsoft Live client which turns out to be slightly more cumbersome than the Xbox 360 counterpart. The proposed game modes, for up to sixteen players, are variants of the classic one-on-all or team deathmatch or the typicalCapture-Flag. In addition, Volition has studied rather atypical methods in which it is necessary not only to demolish, but also to rebuild some buildings, relying on teamwork and an intriguing strategic component. Considering the destructive aspects of the gameplay, which are combined with some bonuses that guarantee invisibility, temporary levitation and more, the online mode of Red Faction: Guerrilla is definitely a plus. You can't have everything in life As for the technique, Red Faction: Guerrilla does not look bad compared to the more famous titles, while not making you cry for a miracle. The positive news is that in these three months of waiting the programmers of Reactor Zero, the company entrusted with the conversion, have been able to optimize the Geo-Mod 2.0 engine, smoothing out the initially high requirements and allowing even ~non-hardcore~ systems ~ to maintain an adequate frame-rate with all details maxed out. We can say, after our tests, that a multi-core processor with at least 2.6 GHz frequency and a video card comparable to the GeForce GTX 275 can handle without worries a resolution of 1680x1050 complete with sumptuous 8x Anti-Aliasing active. For those with Windows Vista there is the possibility of activating some special effects available only with DirectX 10 (the title also runs under XP), such as Ambient Occlusion and Sun Shaft which guarantee a better rendering of the lighting by increasing in general the appeal compared to the consoles, even if there are clearly structural limits. Mars doesn't exactly offer a great deal of visual variety and as a result our wanderings through the Guerrilla colonies certainly won't surprise us as most of the locations tend to look a bit too similar. The Volition designers wanted to tread realism and therefore Mars appears to us like this, naked and raw, without infamy or praise. On PC, the enthusiasm for the physical apparatus, spearhead for Xbox and PlayStation, is unfortunately dampened: the Havok and PhysX software have already been dictating the law for some time, and those who are accustomed to games for Windows have already opened their jaws against titles such as Company Of Heroes, or remaining in a more action-packed environment, with Advanced Warfighter 2, in which different structures could be blown up thanks also to the power of the dedicated Ageia card. Thumbs down instead for the flat and aseptic design of the various vehicles and rare mechs that you can steal and drive, as well as the characters, starting with the protagonist Alec, truly anonymous and aesthetically banal. Even on the sound side we remain perplexed: the dubbing, even if it has been transposed into Italian here, remains sloppy and unconvinced, the music dull and repetitive, while the sound of collapses and explosions is damningly convincing. What's cooking again? The DVD-9 of the PC version is integrated with the 3 DLCs (two of which are already available for consoles, for a fee) that Voltion had anticipated in June. The first additional content is Demons of the Badlands: it is a short single-player campaign set between Red Faction II and Guerrilla, and has recently been reviewed on these shores. The second novelty is the map pack which adds two multiplayer modes, Bagman and Team Bagman: the first player who manages to retrieve a bag hidden in the map starts accumulating points by losing the ability to use weapons - apart from the bag itself - but in compensation earns the loving attentions of the other participants. As icing on the cake we also find eight new maps. The third DLC, currently exclusive to Windows, features 2 new levels for online and 6 for the Demolition Squad, a type of game that enhances the Red Faction philosophy to the max, rewarding the player who razes the largest number of buildings in the least time.", "date": "2009-09-29", "grade": "7.8"}
