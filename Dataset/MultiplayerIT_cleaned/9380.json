The great bounty, however, is suddenly disturbed by the arrival of the Wikus, small aliens with an extremely tender and peaceful appearance but irreparably guilty of a simple fact, namely disturbing the spatial stillness of Waka and, even, filling the splendidly arid planets that form a home with luxuriant vegetation, an unbearable affront for our hero, whose numerous hands begin to itch at the sight of so much life... And then the counterattack of the monstrous protagonist in question starts, a carefully considered and strategically detailed operation, that is to slap all the Wikus who are within reach of the four hands, traveling between the planets and freeing the galaxy from the scourge of overcrowding and vegetation. The concept is therefore extremely simple and sees us move Waka on the surfaces of the numerous mini-planets - small spherical levels that recall the typical structure of the Super Mario Galaxy planets - simply by tilting the iPhone, pressing on the screen at the point where we want to get the slap (provided it is within reach of Waka's long arms, of course) and trying in this way to hit the little invaders, who for their part will try in every way to make our task as difficult as possible. There is no story progression nor a particular purpose for continuing through the many levels that make up the game, simply a slow but inexorable increase in difficulty and the carefree pleasure of giving up loud slaps left and right. It seems strange, but that's enough to come back again and again to wander the planets of Get Outta My Galaxy! Galactic handfuls The structure is therefore simple and intuitive, assisted by a well-functioning control system which, by exploiting the tilt sensor for movements, makes these movements particularly easy, leaving the touch screen free for a more complete view and for attacks to be carried out simply by touching the ~ enemies~ on the screen. Hitting the latter, however, is not easy. Although the start is easy and soft, the variables soon increase, the diversionary elements emerge and everything gets complicated: the Wikus are not all the same, but they come in different categories which require different approaches. There are those who hide, those who multiply, those who make vegetation grow, which slows us down or can even injure us in its most dangerous variety (it is indeed necessary to keep an eye on Waka's energy) and those who jump literally in the air. The planets themselves start as simple rocky and deserted spheroids but later become mini-labyrinths bristling with obstacles, teleporters, secret passages and switches that require some effort to be fully explored. The graphics of Get Outta My Galaxy! it is of excellent workmanship, if we also consider the budget with which it was produced, equipped with an original and pleasant characterization, even if somewhat simplistic and slightly derivative, in particular as regards the concept of the mini-planets which will not fail to refer to Mario Galaxy. The cartoonish characterization is able to give a certain specific identity to the game, making it incisive in distinguishing this game from the large competition from the App Store, both in terms of the scenarios and the bizarre characters that populate it. Despite the price set at 79 cents, there is therefore an undoubted value behind the development of this Ookoohko Oy production, which also makes us look forward to the next titles scheduled for the team.
