{"name": "Sanity: Aiken's Artifact", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sanity-aikens-artifact.html", "text": "Mens sana in corpore sano Story of the game: in a mysterious place a mysterious artifact is mysteriously found that Doctor Aiken mysteriously manages (ok, that's enough ^_^) to manipulate, obtaining the key to unlock that mysterious area (again!!) of the brain which allows the 'human being to obtain and control almost boundless psionic powers, a good for humanity which as usual backfires ... the usual scoundrels who have decided to do something more than cook toast with the power of thought, they begin to spread terror among ordinary people and at that moment, the supra-super-national intelligence decides to create the DNPC, or the special police department within which elite members chosen for their physical and mental skills militate to counteract the spread of mental delinquency. Except that after a while Dr. Aiken's bug turns up, meaning that with the immoderate use of mental powers you end up with your brain in a pan and the disbanded policemen end up combining mass massacres too. And here you enter the scene, the bully of the policemen's suburbs, the super maranza who must be redeemed... exactly you have carried out a massacre of innocent people and to show that you have now changed and ~you won't do it anymore giurin giurello~ you do voluntarily implant a chip in your head, which will serve to inhibit your vital functions (kill you) if you commit acts of violence against people without any reason. You're back on duty, dear Agent Cain, ready to nab the bad guys. Things? A game where you lead? Yes and no. In the sense that in the good tradition of video games there will be no shortage of action and clashes, but they will take place with the contribution of your powers, through what is the strong point of this game .. the possibility of using mental ~talents~ instead of weapons conventional. Arresting criminals will be more beautiful and fun if you can shoot hot fireballs in their faces, or cause small earthquakes, summon supernatural creatures... it will be more intriguing being able to read people's minds and so on. The beauty is that you will acquire these powers as you progress in the game, in the form of cards (those who play Magic: The Gathering know something about it) that will provide you with knowledge. There are therefore different ~TOTEMs~ or if we want categories of talents, divided into fire, illusion, sun, science, demonology, death, storm and truth. Morale about eighty different talents!!! A really fun system to not miss the interest and the desire to go to the end. Basically Sanity is a third-person action game, as apart from a few daycare puzzles that will pinch your neurons, here there is a lot of banging. The events and dialogues flow fluently and rapidly, in short, the life of a policeman is not that of a lawyer! Speaking of dialogues... in the Italian version the original voice actor of Cain was kept, i.e. the legendary (perhaps more for American boys) Ice T. The famous rapper seems suitable for dubbing the policeman in question and the gangsta-like speech rapper will immediately make you like this special agent who addresses a thousand charismatic jokes even to the biggest boss he will face. In addition there is also a song titled ~Sanity~ made by the aforementioned rapper with his Body Counts. This is to understand that the game is full of extra-game goodies. Among the many, I also point out the possibility, by connecting to the official site, of downloading new talents to use...and being able to exchange them via the web with friends! Sorry if it's too little... Back on streets Playing with Cain will be very fun and we will find ourselves roaming everywhere, from the slums to the palaces of power in more than 20 game levels, linked by a plot to be discovered. Yes, because if there will be very little interaction with non-player characters (occasionally you can pull out your badge...), there will certainly be no shortage of twists, you can rest assured. The classic plot twists, but which are always good. The game engine that drives everything is the good old LithTech Engine, which impressed us so much with titles such as Blood2, Shogo etc. and that will still accompany us with titles to come and as usual makes a good impression. Despite being dated only at the registry office, it pampers us with a remarkable fluidity and attention to detail, as well as a really nice and pleasant choice of colors, especially for lovers of ~cartoony~ or those who, for example, have seen the film Dick Tracy ( where hues of all kinds mixed on the screen). The same goes for effects such as explosions, transparencies, etc. Not a flaw, really good. Let us also remember thatyou can zoom in on the character as you want, even if it should be noted that the view is yes in third person, but slightly different from that which usually characterizes this genre, it is a little higher, and this will almost always force us to keep the ~bird's eye~ setting to be able to see what is happening around us well. While we're at it we want to talk about minimum requests? On the package is reported P2 300Mhz with 64 of RAM and a nice 400 MB of space on HD plus 8 mb 3d card. I confirm and add at least another 8 MB to the video card for a good performance, all in all...certainly the non plus ultra comes with a nice GeForce 2 (ok, I admit it, I'm the hook because I mounted it on my PC! ^___^'). Report to the police station Surely we can record that ~S. - A.A.~ it's a nice game, which however may leave some of you unhappy, precisely because of the linearity of the events and the almost obligatory interaction with objects and people. For my part, I tell you that I have no prejudices against games that suffer from this flaw, as long as they are well done from all other points of view. That is plot (here it is linear, but you feel that there is), technical realization (see above) various goodies. Of course, by now we're used to feeling freer in our actions and movements, but let's also consider that every now and then it doesn't hurt to turn off our brains and delight our eyes with the sound of pressing buttons. Definitely a title that makes console fans happy, given the setting. But we could say that a pc-ophile would feel happy to have Sanity, if only to range a bit between the genres of his private game library. Orion said. And now Antonetto is going to shoot himself the digestif. Mental cooking Purpose of the review: to point out how a game that has been released for a few weeks can find a place under your Christmas tree. Well yes, here we are, the reindeer are pawing and Santa Claus is getting ready to leave... but if you have pen and paper at hand, you still have time to write to him to bring along Sanity (renamed Aiken's Artifact for the European market). The writing on the box reads the phrase ~Survival is a state of mind~; beyond the various interpretations that can be given, if it were really like this I'd already be doomed... swollen with panettone with mascarpone I finger these fluttering characters between one reflection and another, and try to focus my psionic powers on the review. OK, let's give it a tryoooooohhhmmmmm(I meditate with arms crossed)..SPZOOOT! BLAM! oops, I half cooked the cat with this ball of fire that started from my hands.", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
