Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. There are no doubts about the genius of the concept of ~Family Guy~, in Italy ~Family Guy~, the animated series created by Seth McFarlane and has now reached its twelfth season without apparent drops in quality, indeed managing from time to time even to stimulate the attention of the general press (see the recent event of the ~death~ of Brian). Such a popular franchise could not remain neglected for long by the producers of casual mobile games, and so FOX has seen fit to entrust TinyCo with the creation of Family Guy: Mission for Glory, a simulation for iOS and Android devices featuring particularly immediate and accessible, full of references to the cartoon and all the characters that appear in it, as well as strong attention to the jokes and typical humor of McFarlane, which as you know is anything but ~politically correct~. The incipit, narrated through a very funny and well done sequence, is definitely spot on: Peter Griffin and the giant chicken he usually fights give life to yet another fight to the death on the streets of Quahog, completely devastating the city. The feathered opponent is defeated once again, but at what cost? Peter looks around and realizes the disaster, but he doesn't give up and decides, little by little and with the help of his relatives and friends, to rebuild the various neighborhoods. It could have been a good casual game, but Family Guy: Mission runs out of pros in minutes A successful clone The similarities between Family Guy: Parsley and its direct rival, The Simpsons: Tapped Out, are frankly excessive. Beyond the belonging of the two titles to the same genre, that of casual simulations, the fact that they start from the exact same expedient (the reconstruction of the city, in the case of the Simpsons destroyed by an accident with the nuclear power plant) is emblematic of a resounding lack of ideas. Of course, the first sequences of Mission to Glory are really exciting, even more so if you are a fan of the cartoon, and the game itself is full of animations for the characters, which are produced in strange greetings, butterfly hunting, cookie sales and even lapdance. The point is that, however, putting these small touches aside, what remains of the gameplay appears terribly linear and, above all, subject to very heavy restrictions regarding the adoption of the freemium model. There are the usual quests that must be completed by giving certain orders to the characters and which involve the use of virtual currency and/or hard currency (shells), after which the minute counter starts and you stay there waiting to be able to make the next move ... unless you decide to reach into your wallet and unlock some elements, or an extra (strictly Mexican) worker to carry out the reclamation more quickly. The elements that should constitute the right reward for the completed quests, i.e. small scenes with the character on duty, are however ruined by an Italian translation that is not up to par, which loses puns along the way that could have adapted well in our language.", "date": "2014-04-19", "grade": "4.0"}
