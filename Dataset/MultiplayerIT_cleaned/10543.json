A series experienced through sci-fi visors, exploded between flickering rays, protected by futuristic suits and lived in fantastic worlds. Hours and hours of battles against space pirates and exploration for clues condensed into one disc! Call for Samus Aran Nintendo is now a master of marketing (but are we so sure that it wasn't even in the past?) so much so that it has created a product that succeeds in attracting both new users born with the Wii and those who have followed it for a long time. The former have already been able to appreciate the new course imposed by the use of Nunchuck and Wiimote and now they can finally play two of the most beautiful and profound titles of last gen. The latter instead get a desired update to 16:9 and a renewal of the commands so as to have the pretext to relive unforgettable moments. For those who have never tried any of the three episodes, this disc should be practically mandatory. It starts from the progenitor Prime who carries all the solitude, at the time the prerogative of the series, on a particularly evocative world and still focused on elementary clichs such as ice, earth and fire. The Chozo, mythical and ancient beings tell their story of annihilation and allow us, by donating their powers, to continue our adventure: not a simple shooter, but a real first-person experience. The second episode called Echoes complicates things, introducing a dualistic world of light and darkness, imbued with an atmosphere that transforms solitude into a dark anguish, chased by a dark nemesis and by beings called Ing. The Third, Corruption, revolutionizes the controls, simplifies them, gets closer to the modern canons of shooters, increasing the speed and the presence of companions. You move to multiple planets and you are alone because you are small against an entire hostile world. Quite a special edition So let's start to see what this special edition offers. The importance given to the narration is immediately evident upon opening the silvery disc packaging, given that together with the instructions and some graphic studies there is a booklet that informs us of the events narrated in the three chapters. This is one way of telling us that the adventures of Samus Aran represent a single, essential corpus and to be best appreciated only if experienced all in one breath. The main features of this collection are the 16:9, the Corruption commands extended to the first two chapters of the saga and the addition of many tokens, coupons and prizes to unlock the extras present massively and composed as in the third chapter by drawings , preparatory sketches and sound motifs. Also present is the multiplayer mode already seen in Echoes. From a graphic point of view the two episodes for the GameCube still make a splendid impression. Prime and Echoes are still tremendously evocative with light effects, textures and framerates which, already at very high levels in the past, benefit further from greater cleanliness and from the possibility of connecting via component cable in 480p. Too bad in Prime for the loss of some small effects: inexplicably the ripple of the water and those of weapon overload have disappeared. The new 16:9 aspect ratio, on the other hand, is implemented very well, it enlarges the central part but at the same time offers a much more natural and game-friendly display, almost as if the two titles had been studied in that way and then adapted to 4:3 . The revised controls and with the new controllers respond beautifully on a par with those of Corruption. The ~click clack~ of that splendid dance on the backbones which the GameCube pad forced and some gameplay subtleties are lost, especially against some bosses as they are closely linked to the previous ~vertical locked~ view. These small leaks make it clear how the new system is different and not better than the old one, but perhaps this is a point that only those who have fully appreciated the previous one can make. Mission accomplished A large green pointer now stands in the center of the screen and you can act on the type of command by blocking the aim with the view as already happened in Corruption. The selection of weapons and visors takes place in a natural and simple way, better than in the past, and the graphics of the various huds have also been revised. Finally, the music has not lost its impact in the slightest and landing on the surface of Tallon IV or slipping into the territories of Aether always makes you dream like in the past. Tokens and coupons, on the other hand, turn out to be a pleasant addition, but a rather superficial one given the situationamount of information, curiosities and insights to which the numerous scans lead us. Corruption has obviously not changed and always allows you to feel the jump, more in the commands than in the graphics to tell the truth, compared to the past. The mere fact of being able to pilot the shuttle by ~touching~ its keys gives an idea of how the project was born and evolved from different bases. Replaying the three chapters in their entirety, one after the other, and following the evolution of each aspect and its concatenation into a unicum step by step, is as priceless as seeing the entire Star Wars hexalogy all together and not at a distance of two years between episodes.", "date": "2009-09-09", "grade": "8.8"}
