In fact, the 11 bit studios title proposed an ~inverted~ mechanic, in which within the stages the player did not have to manage the towers with respect to the advancement of enemy troops, but to move the troops themselves and dynamically change their structure to deal with any kind of situation that may arise. The idea behind this concept was very simple but terribly effective at the same time: using the mouse wheel it was possible, at any time, to change the path of the units on the map based on the perils of the turn, then press the low spacer to change the order of vehicles, upgrade those at your disposal, buy new ones or sell them. In real-time action, a courageous foot commander coordinated the work, dropping power-ups onto the ground that repaired convoy damage or were designed to distract enemy turrets and provide them with a fake target for a few seconds. The same scheme was adopted for Anomaly Korea, an episode released last December 20 only on tablets and smartphones (and converted for PC exclusively for those who have booked the second chapter, therefore not on sale separately), which has been able to raise the level quality of the experience and establish itself as the absolute best RTS experience on mobile devices (refresh your memory). Now it's up to Anomaly 2, back on the Windows platform, to do something better. Will he succeed? In the heart of the anomaly As we had already been able to experience on the occasion of the trial, the new episode of the series created by 11 bit studios introduces us to the novelties of the gameplay through a level that also acts as a narrative prologue for the plot and in which, in fact, a real own tragedy. Then we move on to a new commander and new troops, more determined than ever to eradicate the threat posed by the mysterious alien metal towers that are devastating some areas of the planet. One of the peculiarities of Anomaly 2 is that not only have the developers changed all the units at our disposal, from the first to the last, but they have also equipped them with a transformation system that modifies their functionality and equipment. The first vehicle we will deal with, the Assault Hound, can in fact transform into a mech and switch from the default ~progressive~ machine gun (which increases the rate of fire as it hits the target) to a powerful double flamethrower, ideal for dealing with sieges. The second unit, the Hammer, instead switches from a ~tank~-style configuration, with a powerful cannon that however only fires at targets that are in front of it, even if distant, to a quadrupedal robotic form equipped instead with a rocket launcher freely orientable. And again: the Guard looks like a slow and medium-strength crawler, capable of emitting impulses that slow down the action of the alien towers to facilitate their elimination; or it transforms into a sort of helicopter that protects adjacent vehicles through an energy shield. In short, a considerable work has been carried out in terms of renewal of the vehicle fleet, and their ability to transform adds a further strategic substrate to the gameplay, given that making quick configuration changes often becomes essential to solve very complicated situations on the fly. The novelties are less consistent in terms of upgrades, but even in this sense there is no shortage of new ideas, such as the impulse that ~turns off~ the enemy towers until they suffer the first damage, giving us the undoubted advantage of the first move, or the target that allows us to focus attacks (and amplify their power) towards a particular target. And speaking of towers, even the ranks of the ~bad guys~ have undergone a complete makeover: the positions we already knew have been modified to boast new functions, while many others have been introduced, including those that sprout from the ground to suddenly when we pass through a ~risk~ area. The technical sector of the game reflects the air of change thanks to redesigned graphics and much more detailed and evocative scenarios than in the past, an element that clearly reflects on the usability of the product on notebooks that are not equipped with a sufficiently powerful graphics card, at least wanting to keep the adjustments to the max. The sound is also excellent, thanks in particular to truly epic, cinematic music. Single and multiple The single player campaign forms one moreonce the core of the experience offered by Anomaly 2, with a total of fifteen missions that can be tackled according to four different degrees of difficulty. In our specific case we opted for the ~normal~ level and it took us about eight hours to complete everything, even if we must consider the multiple attempts in some particularly difficult stages (and a probable double ending). One of the perplexities also raised for the previous episodes of the series, i.e. the progressive increase in the duration of the missions, has been handled reasonably well in the new chapter, given that the times actually expand only in the more advanced stages of the campaign, ergo the lack of a instant save system does not create who knows what failures. If you have played Anomaly: Warzone Earth, then Anomaly Korea and finally this new chapter it is clear that, despite the news listed above, you will not feel who knows what differences in terms of mechanics and indeed you could find yourself tackling the story mode with a little enough, but it must be recognized that the concept conceived by 11 bit studios does not lend itself to who knows what variations, like indeed the sub-genre to which it belongs, and therefore the developers have not had who knows what room for maneuver to innovate the dynamics, which despite everything they managed to do. Expectations were therefore high for the other big news of Anomaly 2, or the implementation of a competitive multiplayer mode. Two players can challenge each other in increasingly larger maps (to be unlocked) by impersonating the attack team or the alien towers and using what they learned in the single player to put their opponent in difficulty. The goal is to destroy (or protect) a series of cores through gameplay that includes pauses for unit path changes but instead lets the action flow when the ~good~ faction wishes to change the structure of their own convoy. We experimented with multiplayer with a friend (unfortunately verified the current lack of online opponents), particularly curious about how towers work. When you control the ~bad guys~, in fact, the rules become those of a classic tower defense: you can place your units in boxes adjacent to the nucleus to be safeguarded, with new towers that are unlocked depending on the duration of the game and of the enemies we manage to eliminate. Even aliens have power-ups, in this case it is possible to use an extra shield for a tower, regenerate its energy or send it into ~berserk~ mode to amplify its attack power. The competitive online sector therefore appears in line with expectations, it is not a feature that we consider ~central~ but certainly enjoys great potential if passionate and tenacious opponents are found. Involving a friend or finding one on Steam appears to be the best solution. Anomaly 2 is a sequel of great value, strong gameplay that holds up well in the long run", "date": "2013-05-17", "grade": "8.0"}
