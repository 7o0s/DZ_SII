Just reading this name, players who have now arrived in the ~enta~ cannot help but recall masterpieces such as Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island, for which we must thank the game designer who has now joined Double Fine Productions. Place where among other things we find another person capable of generating rivers of nostalgic tears, namely Tim Schafer. We owe the idea behind The Cave, the adventure with which Double Fine opens 2013, not to the latter but to Gilbert. By the end of the year, however, the studio will also churn out Double Fine Adventure, a project that has become famous for being the first boom game on Kickstarter. But let's focus, as it should be, on The Cave: combined over the months with various titles including Maniac Mansion itself, together with LittleBigPlanet and the recent gem Trine, this game finds itself opening a particularly important period for the genre which it belongs. Goal achieved? Only three enter As soon as the game starts, The Cave introduces us to its protagonists. Seven to be precise: the three mentioned in the title to which we must also combine a mountain man, a time traveler, an adventuress and two twins (who are worth one). Among these, only three are those that the player can choose to descend into the tunnels of the Cave. The latter entity that we can define as the eighth (non-playable) protagonist of the game: it is in fact a magical place, within which the most bizarre places and creatures come to life, but also endowed with the possibility of giving those he ventures what he seeks, up to the very meaning of life. Of course, provided you overcome the many obstacles along the way: to do this, the player must make the trio of his choice overcome the puzzles posed by The Cave, or a series of puzzles that place this game in the purest adventure genre, seasoned with basic platform elements that boil down to jumping from one platform to another. Compared to Monkey Island and the like, the characters cannot count on an inventory, thus having the option of carrying only one object at a time: a choice that accentuates the need for teamwork to advance inside the cave underground, which can also be tackled in a local cooperative mode that is very reminiscent of that of LittleBigPlanet. Each protagonist has his own special ability: the mountain man, for example, is able to hold his breath underwater longer, while the knight can enjoy invincibility. Single abilities that greatly influence the replayability of The Cave, also thanks to the fact that each of the seven characters has an area of the Cave that only he can be able to access, using his special ability: thanks to the mountaineer, for example, we will end up in the middle of a street fair, while the knight will take us to a medieval castle. By making a rapid division between the total number of characters and the number of selectable ones for a single game, you will have already understood that The Cave pushes us to replay the entire adventure at least 3 times, leading us to visit all the areas dedicated to the protagonists to get to know their stories, absolutely not trivial. More caves for everyone The air you breathe inside The Cave is perhaps a bit stuffy, but above all it has the flavor of dear old graphic adventures. With the involvement of Ron Gilbert, moreover, it could not have been otherwise: his unmistakable hand permeates the whole atmosphere of the game, characterized by a type of humor attributable only to the creator of Monkey Island. All elements end up undergoing this influence: from the design of the characters, to the intuition of making the Cave a being capable of reason (it is she who narrates the story) and make sadistically funny comments, passing through the way in which the (actually few) exchanges between characters recall ancient videogame experiences imprinted in our minds. We are certainly not at the level of duels with the sword master with insults seen in Monkey Island, but some ideas are worthy of the classics of the genre. Too bad that the opportunities are not many and that The Cave from this point of view overall gives the feeling of being a bit tied up, when it could instead have taken flight. After so much enthusiasm, after all, we had to find some flaws. Firstly, the control system sometimes flounders, not performing actions the way you'd expect due to a bit of imprecision. To present the biggest problems is the jump, which requires a little 'additional patience to avoid the risk of ending up crushed to the ground when moving from one platform to another. But noDon't worry, because inside the Cave you don't die and respawn is practically immediate nearby. The real problem with The Cave, however, is backtracking: it happens too often that you find yourself having to retrace even quite long game areas, to solve a puzzle or more simply to bring the 3 protagonists together before proceeding. In reality, an automatic meeting system would also be envisaged for the latter, but unfortunately it is activated too few times compared to what is actually needed. Returning to the puzzles, we can say that their design follows a logical thread that allows you to keep away the frustration, lurking in titles of this genre, almost always managing to entertain and reward the player. Puzzles with style The setting of The Cave is beautifully done. Despite being set up as a classic 2D platformer, the models and objects in the foreground can count on three dimensions, while the clean and colorful style of the background is appreciable, in which it is always possible to identify some design gem. The protagonists of the story are naturally the masters, together with the various areas dedicated to them. These are rightly different from the others, in order to give breath to what would otherwise be a monotonous succession of tunnels and at the same time entice the player to explore them all, starting over as we have already said a new game with different characters. The sound is also excellent, within which the narrating voice of the Cave stands out, able to elicit more than one smile with his way of talking about topics also loaded with a certain importance. The spoken part is in English only, while the written part is also available in Italian. Activate Italian The Cave menu and subtitles are also available in our language. Strangely, at least for now it is not possible to activate Italian from the menus, so you have to resort to a little trick: from the main directory where the game is installed, go to the DataConfig folder that is inside it. Open the Language.cfg file with notepad and change the first line to language = 'itIT'. Once the game has started, the menus will immediately be in Italian, while the subtitles must be activated in the Audio section of the settings.", "date": "2013-01-25", "grade": "7.9"}
