{"name": "Supraland Six Inches Under: la recensione del sorprendente metroidvania in prima persona", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/supraland-six-inches-under-recensione.html", "text": "The first work of Supra Games UG, Supraland, was received very positively and it was therefore reasonable to expect a sequel that would carry this project forward. And so it was, 4 years after the first chapter, Supraland Six Inches Under arrived, a game that actually landed on the market last year, but which has reached a larger audience in recent days thanks to its publication on Xbox Game Pass . For those unfamiliar with what has now become a saga to all intents and purposes, it is enough to know that both titles are based on metroidvania mechanics strongly inspired by products of the caliber of Zelda, Portal and Metroid. Of course the comparison may seem rather high-sounding, but Supraland Six Inches Under manages to surprise both for its simplicity and for the mix of genres and styles that distinguish it. In this review of Supraland Six Inches Under we have returned to the underground of Supraland to discover the many new features introduced, including more complex puzzles and more balanced and easily manageable fights, without forgetting a vast game area to discover. Six inches below Are you ready for a new Red vs. Blue adventure in Supraland: Six Inches Under? As the title suggests, in Supraland Six Inches Under we will literally move 6 inches under the ground, in other words just over 15 centimeters if we use our metric system. In the first chapter we brought peace between the people of the blues and the reds, but after a catastrophe that is told at the beginning of this sequel, we will find ourselves underground again and grappling with a new dispute to face. With this expedient the team of Supra Games UG has offered us a completely new area to explore, more elaborate and extensive than the previous one, full of details and details that make the exploratory component fun and never redundant. The developers themselves define Supraland Six Inches Under as a game divided into 55% exploration, 40% puzzles to solve and 5% combat; with such numbers, the attention placed on the game world was therefore fundamental and we were pleasantly surprised that every expectation, even with respect to the first Supraland, has been abundantly exceeded. If we add to all this the continuous breaking of the fourth wall, with sparkling jokes on the game mechanics, the respawn and the positioning of the objects useful for the progression, we have the perfect mix to spend the approximately 10 hours for the completion with a smile printed on the face. To be precise, the timing to complete everything, absolutely everything, doubles, but Supraland Six Inches Under offers extreme freedom of approach and if you only follow the main mission you can get to the end credits even in just over 5 hours . Of course, by doing so you would lose the many goodies that the game offers and we are not referring only to the playful tone of the script, but also to most of the puzzles that make up the experience, one of the most successful and undoubtedly improved sectors compared to the previous chapter. Puzzle and Fighting In Supraland: Six Inches Under, even the underground can hide many mysteries The developers had started with a precise idea for Supraland Six Inches Under: to create a rich expansion for their first creature. The inspiration and creativity, however, got the upper hand and soon the team concluded that all the news could not be contained in a single DLC, thus giving life to a new underground adventure. We have to admit that the choice was the right one, precisely because all this meant that a product that was faithful to the original came out, but full of innovations capable of reinforcing the good things already created. Hence the drastic reduction in combat sessions, but also the increase in environmental puzzles which, as mentioned above, represent one of the best sections of the entire game. Environmental puzzles remain the strong point of Supraland: Six Inches Under The puzzles we had to deal with were all well thought out, never exhausting and based on logic in a simple and extremely intuitive way. In fact, it is not the difficulty that makes them pleasant, but the fact that they are interconnected; to give a practical example, an area of the game is accessible only through badges that must be of a specific color and, thanks to well-placed clues, we understood that we could color the object with paint and go further. Too easy? No, because we get to having to ingenuity to find the color we need, until we find it in rather bizarre places or features. In some cases, however, the radio we carry with us becomes a dispenser of advice, so much so as to announce - before wasting time - that some areasthey are not usable at the moment because we are missing a key object. It may seem like an extreme simplification, but on balance this balance between exploration and rebus maintains the enjoyment of the title in each of its sections, flowing smoothly without running into something that could break the rhythm of the game. The beauty comes to an end The scenarios in Supraland: Six Inches Under are never banal, on the contrary, they are always able to elicit a smile The developers wanted to create a structure that allows extreme freedom of approach in completing the game. Maybe even too much. In fact, by completing only the main objectives, there is the risk of losing much of the content that this sequel offers: some of the best puzzles, for example, are unlocked only after completing the main ~mission~. Granting this freedom is right, but the developers could have integrated these sessions into a wider path, so as to invite players to linger on secondary sections, which are also as pleasant as the main ones. This could lead to consuming this product too quickly, with the high risk that many users abandon the title without having fully enjoyed it. Net of this, those who already know the first Supraland will certainly appreciate the new derivative, but the sensation of ~already seen~ will mark the time spent with the title, although there are many innovations capable of mitigating this sensation. Those who approach the work of Supra Games UG for the first time will find a hilarious game world, colorful and full of jokes that will keep them glued to the screen until the adventure is completed.", "date": "2023-06-06", "grade": "8.5"}
