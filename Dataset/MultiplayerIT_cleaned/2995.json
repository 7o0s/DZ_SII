{"name": "Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rock-of-ages-3-make-break-recensione.html", "text": "The Chilean software house Ace Teams created Rock of Ages almost by divine inspiration (the wine certainly has something to do with it, while the rest is pure and simple hyperbole). After Zeno Clash he evidently felt the need to look in a completely opposite direction. After all, the studio that had created one of the most convincing first-person fighting games ever, placing it in a world that seemed to have come out of a picture painted together by a surrealist and a symbolist, then boiled in a pot of magical realism and served on of a metaphysical tray, he could not stand still and monetize by exploiting what he has just done (he will try with Zeno Clash 2 with poor results). The money available wasn't very much, but Zeno Clash had still sold well, making the studio financially solid, and the ideas were many. Who knows what brainstorming gave rise to a concept as bizarre as it was successful: a mixture of Marble Madness, a racing game and a tower defense in which historical and mythological characters, represented through their classic iconography transfigured into Monty Python-style comedy, make their stone warfare...literally. The objective of the game is in fact to throw a boulder along a more or less tortuous path, in order to hit the gate of the opponent's stronghold. Whoever manages to crush the other first wins. Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break, the subject of this review, does not deviate very much from this formula, indeed it takes it up in full, but translates it towards a more modern vision of the video game, and probably more conformist, which indicates as the fulcrum of the package no longer the campaign, but the level editor, then the sharing, as well as the accumulation of modes. After all, it is already the subtitle ~Create and Break~ that suggests that something has changed. For all the time spent playing the impression was that of a title with competitive ambitions, in which the narrative elements, while present, have been transformed into a kind of signature of the dead, for an experience that has only become support, although the touch of ACE Team is undeniably present. In a sense, Rock of Ages 3 is pure survival instinct: the work you expect from those who have tried to remain themselves but in doing so have been rewarded with very poor sales and often unjustified criticism. Gameplay Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break consists of a single player campaign and a large number of multiplayer modes. The campaign is a long and entertaining story, written with great taste, starring characters such as Polyphemus, Montezuma, Caesar and many others. It forms the backdrop for a series of missions of increasing difficulty which, in fact, serve to illustrate and unlock all game modes. So we have the classic and already described challenge of the boulders, as well as pure tower defense situations, in which you simply have to place the defenses in the path of the opponent's boulders in order not to be destroyed. There are also skill tests, such as the Humpty Dumpty mode in which you don't have to destroy the boulder / egg you are driving, or the classic timed races, which require you to reach the end of the course before your opponents or make time improve. In reality, the only distinction that should be made is that between the methods in which the boulder is controlled directly, with all its variations, and those of pure tower defense, which require you to place some traps along the way, including catapults , walls, cows and so on, spending the available resources and scraping together more. The tracks themselves are the usual glittering festival of fantasy that ACE Team has accustomed us to, among icy scenarios, Chinese mountains, volcanoes, rural landscapes and many other oddities. They are all filled with decorative objects of the most disparate nature which help to characterize them (and sometimes form real obstacles). As already in Rock of Ages 1 and 2, launching yourself at breakneck speed, only to find yourself in some abyss, is really fun, but it is undoubtedly an experience already lived. Level editor and problems If you limit yourself to the novelties, Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break is not exactly exceptional. Here comes the level editor, which gives everyone the ability to build their own maps easily and painlessly, infinitely expanding the duration of the game. In fact, the editor is the only real innovation of the ACE Team title. It is a powerful but intuitive tool, which allows you to indulge your creativity. Convincing layouts can be made in minutes, although more time is required to produce something more elaborate. Naturally, even those who do not intend to use it will benefit from it, since they will be able to scaricare the maps made by the community without spending anything. As you may have understood, the main problem of Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break is only one: it seems to be an episode put together just to justify the presence of the editor. The basic game mechanics remain in fact identical to those of the previous chapters, with all their merits, but also with some defects that after three episodes can no longer be justified, such as the substantial monotony of the proposed objectives and a pleasant progression of difficulty. with some modes being much more difficult than others and occurring randomly between missions. The campaign is much less articulated than that of the second episode, a sign of a certain reluctance in realizing it, while the fundamental mechanics have not undergone any substantial revision, so much so that we could have reported what was written for Rock of Ages 2 without fear of making a mistake. Even from a technical point of view we are on the same level: on average the graphic elements are very well done and, although there is nothing that really stands out in terms of polygon count, there is no doubt that Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break is able to give more than a few beautiful landscapes. Let's say that the style very much compensates for the lack of resources, which is almost a philosophy for the ACE Team. It's fair to specify that we're not talking about a bad game, far from it, but just one that struggles to find its place, if not among the most ardent fans.", "date": "2020-07-21", "grade": "7.0"}
