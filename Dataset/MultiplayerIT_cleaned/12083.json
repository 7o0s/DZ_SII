{"name": "Brain Juice Energy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brain-juice-energy.html", "text": "Once upon a time there were only crosswords, now it is possible to try your hand at pastimes that are equally challenging for the mind but much more attractive in the interface. It is obvious that the famous Brain Training for Nintendo DS has led the way to the genre, which now seems to have established itself on portable devices and which almost every month offers us valid alternatives, which from time to time are refined in appearance and mechanics . Brain Juice Energy is therefore only the latest product of this type, and gives us the possibility to use twelve minigames divided into three categories: mathematics, visual recognition and memory. The most interesting aspect of Digital Chocolate's new title probably lies in its positioning as an organized training for the mind. This means that the game boasts a ~layered~ structure that is revealed day by day, depending on the results obtained (in fact, not all minigames are available right from the start), and stores our daily performance by translating them into a graph which makes us understand if and how we are progressing. And it's all very simple, just start the ~daily exercises~ to be faced with the first of a sequence of minigames, with text instructions and a demo to fully understand how it works. Using the numeric pad and the joystick of the mobile phone, numbers and requested data are entered, paying attention to the time limit bar, which is reloaded after a certain number of correct answers. The goodness of the final result is therefore a mix of speed and skill. In addition to the ~daily exercises~ mode, you can access the individual minigames unlocked (without the performances being stored, however) and try your hand at races involving up to four players. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, Brain Juice Energy looks very good. The game boasts some essential but well done graphics, characterized by a clean and tidy style, with a choice of colors functional to the action and without problems in displaying data and numbers. There is also a nice sound commentary, which is limited to a musical intro and a series of simple effects during the exercises. As for the control system, you mostly interact with the numeric pad and therefore it is necessary to have some familiarity with the position of the numbers in order not to accidentally give wrong answers. The input method, however, allows us to be quite quick and almost never represents a ~bottleneck~ with respect to our speed in reacting to queries. PRO Very well done Twelve minigames A convincing ~training~. AGAINST Not very original Some minigames are simpler than others", "date": "2007-08-02", "grade": "S.V."}
