{"name": "Africa e sangue", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/170765-resident-evil-5-africa-e-sangue.html", "text": "That Capcom is a famous company (also) for the ability to squeeze the most out of each of its successful brands to optimize production costs and earnings is now known all over the world. And that the Resident Evil saga is in this sense its goose that lays golden eggs is now an established fact: in fact, there is no occasion in which the Japanese company does not try to insert the characters or stories of its terror series, proposing them again in every sauce and on every console. In line with this philosophy, Capcom decided months ago to publish the last three titles of the regular series on the new consoles so, after Resident Evil 6, it's the turn of Resident Evil 5 to return in a remastered version at 1080p and 60fps on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, plus all the extra content released after the launch of the original, enclosed in 15.8 GB to download to your hard disk. Resident Evil 5 returns in a special edition for next generation consoles Lethal virus Even if the game is now known by everyone, it is necessary to make a quick summary of what are the main mechanics and the plot for those few who don't have the slightest idea of what it is like. Resident Evil 5 is not a survival horror, but a modern action game whose mechanics are clearly linked more to shootings and fights than to the phases of exploration, puzzle solving and real moments of tension. The setting is therefore the same as many products of the genre, as with the rest of the previous chapter (in part) and the following one, with a third-person view behind the protagonist, a good amount of bullets available and a fair variety of weapons. All elements that allow the user to explore levels full of enemies, which mostly arrive in waves, except in the boss fights that mark the progression between the levels, without excessive worries of mind. This does not mean that Resident Evil 5 is easy, mind you, but only that by learning to use the paraphernalia at one's disposal, and to adequately exploit the help of the companion and the level design of the various scenarios, one can experience the adventure with a lesser tension than perhaps in the first episodes of the saga, when ammunition was scarce and you never knew what was waiting for the protagonist around the corner. In any case, the fast pace of the adventure is fulfilled in the various action sessions often seasoned with quick time events, and in the combat system. This involves the use of the weapon pointer to precisely hit enemies in their weak points, as well as interacting when possible with particular elements of the scenario to do more damage. Not forgetting the ability to use your hands in furious melee attacks when you find yourself locked in a corner. However, to limit the effectiveness of these moves, however, the character's control system intervenes in spite of it, characterized by a certain underlying cumbersomeness that does not allow fast movements and sudden dodges, as well as aiming a weapon and shooting on the move. And this can be particularly annoying against those opponents who are themselves armed and very aggressive. In this sense, the African continent becomes the ~homeland~ of various types of infected and monstrous aberrations, generated by the madness and action of unscrupulous men on the local population. In fact, the title tells of Chris Redfield, a former member of S.T.A.R.S. joined the special group of fighters B.S.A.A., specifically created to keep the risk born with the proliferation of bio-organic weapons at bay, which is located in the African region of Kijuju to investigate a terrorist called Irving, together with a new companion, the sensual Sheva, managed in game by artificial intelligence or, if desired, by another player. Soon, however, the mission takes on more dramatic contours, in an escalation of nightmarish events that overwhelms the couple until they are forced to fight for their survival. Playstation 4 trophies There are 71 Trophies in Resident Evil 5 for PlayStation 4, including those of the various DLCs. In fact they are the same as the original edition and can be obtained, depending on the mode, by completing the main adventure or the individual expansions, eliminating a certain number of enemies with a proximity bomb or performing certain combos, just to give two examples , up to Platinum, which is obtained as always by collecting all the others. The contents of the new edition As for the ~news~, there is little to say, given that the analyzed edition is limited to including all the downloadable content already published in its previous versions. We therefore have the expansions Nightmare without exit and Una fudesperate game, a competitive mode, some extra characters and four costumes. With Nightmare without an exit, gamers can experience first-hand a sequence that in Resident Evil 5 can only be seen through a flashback, controlling Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine in a scenario that recalls the first episodes of the saga, also in terms of gameplay. Of the two extra contents related to the main adventure, it is the more successful, if only because it manages to evoke the classic spirit of the series, with the Spencer home to visit, the decaying rooms to be explored with caution, and so on. The other, in fact, A Desperate Escape, is a decidedly action scenario that sees Jill Valentine and Josh Stone, the black BSAA agent, join forces first to help Chris and Sheva in the final stages of the regular adventure, then to escape from Kijuju. All through three adrenaline-pumping scenarios, the last of which is timed. Added to these contents is the Merciless mode, previously exclusive to the PC version, where you have to face an above-average number of infected in time, almost always, among other things, with an attached parasite, which can reach up to thirty in some screens. forty enemies at once, and Mercenaries assembled. The latter, taken from the Gold Edition, offers a higher level of challenge than the classic mercenary mode, as well as new costumes, characters (Excella Gionne, Josh Stone, Rebecca Chambers and Barry Burton) and alternative moves depending on the partner: in practice based on the adventure partner with whom the user decides to face the game session, he will end up with more powerful melee attacks. So to have some real news, you have to look at the technical sector, where, however, we say it right away, we don't find anything exceptional or that we haven't already seen in the past PC version. In this sense, Resident Evil 5 on PlayStation 4 offers 1080p graphics with a frame rate of 60 frames per second compared to the 720p/30 frames of the old consoles, so as to return a more defined and globally sharper image to the eye. However, if we exclude the increase in resolution and a better general fluidity, the graphics of the game have remained substantially unchanged compared to that of the PlayStation 3 / Xbox 360 editions, especially in terms of textures. On this front, by eye, we would say that perhaps a few new ones have been added, positioned ad hoc in certain points, but nothing more. We think that Capcom could have made an effort to do so, and perhaps improve some of the movements of the characters to make them less rigid in certain situations. Yet thanks to an original well-made base, to the variety of level design that ranges from the typical dusty African village to underground ruins, then passing through scientific laboratories, villages in the jungle or by the sea, and much more, at the intelligent use of light sources and that of particle effects, the title is able to give the same some fascinating glimpses. No upheaval even for the audio sector, which offers a good dubbing in English, with Italian subtitles, and a beautiful soundtrack that knows how to accompany every single moment of the adventure properly, adequately underlining the most chaotic or tense phases. compared to the slightly quieter ones. The sound effects are excellent, from the almost delicate ones that form the background to the moments of exploration, to the more ~noisy~ and wild ones of the sessions in which dozens of monsters, infected or deformed creatures come out with their moans, roars or terrifying gurgles, determined to eliminate the protagonists.", "date": "2016-06-30", "grade": "7.5"}
