In its first incarnation for the dual-screen portable console, Modern Warfare, presented itself strong with a robust and efficient engine, capable of guaranteeing an excellent frame rate and therefore supporting in the most appropriate way the controls entrusted to the stylus and the touch screen. The conversion of Black Ops, recently released for all platforms, evidently turns out to be heavier than usual and therefore puts a brake on the extreme fluidity we were used to, in any case maintaining the fast and pleasant action. The control system hasn't changed: you have to move the stylus on the lower screen to aim, use the d-pad to move the character and press the back button L to open fire with the equipped weapon. The various operations concerning the change of weapon, the collection of new objects, the launch of grenades and so on are present in the form of an icon on the touch screen, together with the option that allows us to better aim (which can also be activated via a double tap). The developers have also included a standard variant of the controls, with the main buttons of the DS acting as a second d-pad but, as already happened with GoldenEye 007, this solution proves to be impractical and reliable. Alternative missions The story told in this portable reduction of Call of Duty: Black Ops differs from that seen on other consoles: the scenarios and events are roughly the same, but we will not face them as Alex Mason, but we will take turns commanding supporting characters . The gameplay is simplified and in many ways linear, even if there is certainly no lack of variety in the proposed situations: in some moments we will have to make our way without paying attention to the noise, shooting everything that moves until we have reached our goal; in others, it will be necessary to move silently and eliminate enemies with the knife to avoid triggering alarms. Weapon handling is good, there are the usual two slots available and the ability to pick up anything along the way. The fact that the ammunition runs out relatively quickly protects us from an excessive simplicity of the missions, but the reverse of the medal is represented by enemies who very often resist our bursts more than necessary. Headshots can make all the difference at this juncture, but getting some on such a small screen, and with such a limited resolution, is not easy at all. The presence of a touch screen button to ~aim~ reflects a generally more thoughtful approach than the typical philosophy of Call of Duty. It will often happen to stay behind cover and eliminate one opponent at a time, in fact, also because it will not be easy to survive more than a few moments once exposed to enemy fire. More than the single player campaign, in the end quite short and limited, it is the side modes that constitute the real strength of Call of Duty: Black Ops. From this point of view the developers have outdone themselves, inserting an arcade variant of the story mode, a large number of challenges with different objectives, timed training in the Killhouse and even the Zombie mode. But that's not all: via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, it is possible to face the aforementioned Zombie mode together with another player, as well as access a large number of battles (single or team deathmatch, single or team capture the flag , sabotage) for up to six participants. We have had the opportunity to play a few games online and it must be said that everything works perfectly, without problems attributable to the lag. The technical realization of the game is excellent, with fairly detailed scenarios and discrete polygonal models. Unfortunately the frame rate, as already mentioned, is not as fluid as could be expected and often shows the side of some uncertainty, while the low resolution inevitably ends up making the targets in the background hardly distinguishable, especially from a distance.", "date": "2010-12-08", "grade": "8.0"}
