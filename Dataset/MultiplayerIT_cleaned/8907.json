It's not about the dinosaurs on the loose on Isla Nublar, but about the video game adaptation of Jurassic Park developed by Telltale. An adventure full of tension and genuine amazement could be drawn from a highly successful film that relied on the atavistic terror that man feels in the face of an overwhelming nature - in this case dinosaurs cloned from fossil remains. Instead it's as if the project suddenly ran out of funds and what was left of it, four raw episodes, were pressed together into one release. They are sold separately on iPad only. The first disappointing aspect of Jurassic Park: The Game is the story, which explores an element left overshadowed in the original script. The Dennis Nedry of the film had in fact stolen dinosaur embryos on behalf of a competitor company of InGen (the one that financed the park with the cloned dinosaurs) and what happened to those test tubes after he was killed by a dilophosaurus remained a mystery. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes of play to discover that there isn't enough material for an episode of Stargate, because the embryos ended up trivially on the ground and are still safe inside the shaving foam can in which they had been hidden. From here on, it's a series of characters who perfectly embody the trite clichs of cinema: the first is Nima, the South American guerrilla who has never learned English well, but who everyone understands when she curses in her mother tongue, with task of finding the embryos and that in the end he will take the right side. Next we find a father and teenage daughter, with her making him feel guilty with phrases such as ~Mum doesn't love me~ and he trying not to make her feel the separation from his wife. Still others are added in the course of the episodes; you have the tedium of discovering them. Furthermore, it is impossible to identify with one of them: the game jumps from one character to the next without giving us the opportunity to get to know them thoroughly. The player, tossed from one point of view to another, can't identify with any of the cast. This way of telling a story works very little in video games (or novels) but is typical of cinema. And here we come to the essence of Jurassic Park: The Game , from which all its gameplay derives. Trained players On Telltale's website we read: ~65 million years to make [the game]~. A nice boomerang if this is the result. In order to maintain a cinematic cut at all costs, the player is no longer given the possibility to move the character freely on the screen. No exploration then, just a constant flow of moving images during which we are called to intervene by means of some Quick Time Events. This system has illustrious predecessors, such as the historic Dragon's Lair, released in 1983, or the more recent Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain by Quantic Dream. Let's take an example: a dinosaur is chasing us, help! Nima runs through the jungle. Heck, a branch. Arrows appear on the screen: they are the keys that we must press in order within the time limit. In some cases we will instead have to press the same key repeatedly until a circular indicator is loaded (you can admire this interface in the image on the side). If we succeed Nima jumps the branch and runs away, otherwise we have to overcome a bigger obstacle or in the worst case, we end up in the jaws of a dinosaur or off a cliff. We hope we have given you an idea of what a Quick Time Event is and how it works. If we complete a sequence without making any mistakes, we'll have earned a gold medal, otherwise we'll get silver, bronze, or nothing. This should be an incentive to repeat passages of the game over and over, but we'll see shortly why it's very unlikely you'd want to. Outside of the Quick Time Events, Telltale has decided to simplify the solution of the puzzles too much. If our life is not in danger we will have to investigate the game screen. This translates into pressing on the symbols with the magnifying glass or at most doing it in a certain order. To overcome these moments of difficulty it is sufficient to be four years old. Not even the dialogues, dull and devoid of bite, are saved from the prevailing simplification. We can choose any option; the sense of the discourse will always be the same and the story will proceed in any case in the pre-established direction. In these moments it is possible to move the camera slightly in the four directions to widen the field of view and find new interactive points, promptly signaled. No inventory, in any case. Unfortunately you can only reject all aspects of the game, and it's a shame. But before issuing the sentence, let's make a judgment. The most dangerous animal is man The story, flat and devoid of personal development of the characters or some strong questions to answer, undermines the very idea of adventure. The characters do not remain in the spotlight long enough to give us the opportunity to know anything more about them, beyond the stereotype they represent. The game therefore fails to establish any emotional link between the player and what is happening on the screen, so that even the death of a character has no effect, except to bore us all over again with the same sequence until we memorize the order in which to press the keys. The trouble is that, whatever our choices, history moves effortlessly in the same direction. It's like watching a movie that occasionally freezes if we don't press a button on the remote. The puzzles take seconds to solve and the proposed scenes defy any suspension of credulity: a little girl locked in a jeep thrown away by a T-Rex that escapes its bites is as believable as Cthulhu in the refrigerator at home. This is simply not Jurassic Park. Moreover we are talking about a film that aroused admiration for the use it made of special effects, and instead we are faced with what seems like a mediocre spin off of the film with poor and starched animations, a lush jungle like the tundra in December and dinosaurs so little fearsome enough to arouse our compassion. In the end we would like to eat all the characters in one bite. Telltale can do better and had to do better. The attempt to always look for new approaches to gameplay is commendable, but this seems like a home-made test. A casual game like this, with simplistic episodes that play out in less than an hour, could make a fortune on a tablet. Let's hope it's just a misstep, but you take some advice and forget about Jurassic Park: The Game . There is so much better around.", "date": "2011-11-25", "grade": "5.7"}
