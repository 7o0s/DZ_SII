{"name": "EVE Echoes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eve-echoes-recensione.html", "text": "A review of EVE Echoes is not easy, considering that it is a truly large MMO, one of the closest to the classic experience on PC transported in the mobile environment and therefore it would take a long time to have a very in-depth overall view of its mechanisms. Especially since it is a free-to-play with all the dynamics underlying this monetization model, between optional subscription and the presence of micro-transactions, therefore a precise assessment of its balance and its possible drift towards pay-to -win takes time, even if some elements emerge quite clearly from the first days of testing. We begin our journey as a clone of an original individual who evidently met an untimely end during a mission and find ourselves having to recap the fundamentals of spaceflight and take the first steps in the complex economic system of EVE, which is reproduced here below many aspects similar to the original, even if the classic structure of the simulation is ~cut~ to fit better in this type of mobile game. We can choose the race and the faction to which we belong but these initial choices serve more to create a connection with the lore of the series than to determine specific characteristics capable of channeling the course of the game along specific paths. In fact, the development of the character continues in a rather autonomous way beyond some initial statistics or some propensity for trade, combat or otherwise. EVE Echoes is an MMO that allows us to explore a vast space quite freely made up of different points of interest, jumping from one place to another and carrying out different activities, all with a structure that combines the characteristics of classic MMORPG and simulation space to the idle game, one might say. In fact, most of the time we find ourselves carrying out some quick mission from one point of the universe to another and then perhaps waiting for the evolution of the character's skills, leaving the game in the background, in case we don't want to choose the path of the micro -transactions, to then return to the action and continue with another session of missions and evolutions between progressive levels, with the rhythm that encourages you to leave and resume the game several times. Space citizen The central element of the game is the space ship, a subject that always remains in the foreground in all situations and an indispensable vehicle for carrying out any action in the world of EVE, as well as the true object of every progression, which is visible in the shape and characteristics of the shuttle. We start from rather modest means and we get to unlock and buy ever larger and more powerful ships, expanding our hangar with different solutions also depending on the careers we decide to undertake. The ~quests~, so to speak, lead us to carry out various actions in different points of interest that can be reached in space: it is a question of launching one's ship from one place to another to devote oneself to the collection of resources on mining planets, carrying out recoveries in risk areas, deliveries for different clients and, of course, fight pirates or other threats in different sectors of the universe. All these actions bring loot and gains, both from the point of view of experience and upgrades and simply monetary, given that the economy is basically the basis of the entire EVE universe. EVE Online is already a very complex game full of menus in itself, so it is logical to expect that its free-to-play mobile version will also take up these characteristics, which have now become a standard for titles of this type also on smartphones and the like . Indeed, EVE Echoes lives up to expectations: there is considerable freedom of action in the simulated universe, but this above all translates into touching various menu items and sub-menus full of information, icons and options, which can become even difficult to consult on rather small screens. Conversely, it must be said that the graphic style adopted for the interface is a bit anonymous but perfectly functional and rather elegant, only that the writings can be really too small to be read on a smartphone screen. These are problems that disappear once you have mastered the numerous game systems, only that you really need to invest a great deal of time studying every aspect of the MMO to understand precisely what to do at all times and what all the menus and options are for. therefore, a rather long period to invest for a complete understanding of the many facets of the game always remains to be taken into consideration. It should also be noted that among the prophost Italian is not present. Mitigating this problem is a comprehensive tutorial that teaches at least the basics of travel, combat, and interplanetary commerce, but the idea remains that much of EVE Echoes remains a mystery much of the time and is needed anyway. a great dedication to achieve a complete knowledge of the game universe. Economy and space adventures The enormous weight of the menus and options in which we will find ourselves spending a good part of the time is counterbalanced by a very valid representation of space and interstellar flight: with the shuttle always at the center of attention, we find ourselves admiring planets, stars , nebulae, asteroid belts and space stations in a remarkable variety of different conformations, giving the idea of a universe really rich in different places, objects and situations. Everything is illustrated with excellent profile 3D graphics and with optimal performance even on not necessarily very advanced hardware, which makes EVE Echoes extremely pleasing to the eye and helps even the less inclined to approach its complex world, simply through the charm of the simulated space . The fights are the moments in which the game proves to be more spectacular and in many respects also accessible, given the simplified and semi-automatic control system which however also allows you to manage the ship completely, with the possibility of distributing energy resources to the various equipment compartments (weapons, shields, defensive systems) and to choose the strategy to adopt. These, together with free-roaming, are aspects that the game can leverage to appeal to those unfamiliar with the world of EVE, before enmeshing them in the intricate economics that can either lead to total addiction to this particular simulated world or repulsion. Constant progression is the founding element of EVE and therefore also of this mobile interpretation. This is reflected in the evolution of character and spaceship between levels of experience, unlocking of skills and evolutions of these, but also in the continuous accumulation of wealth and objects, found in the loot to be conquered during the various missions. It is somewhat the typical structure of many MMOs, but even in this case it can become a perverse mechanism when forced pauses and micro-transactions come into play, because it clearly triggers a different speed in progression when resorting to payment, both of single currency packs or mini-subscription and this can create an imbalance in the competitive elements of the game, representing the most dubious element of the whole operation.", "date": "2020-08-20", "grade": "7.5"}
