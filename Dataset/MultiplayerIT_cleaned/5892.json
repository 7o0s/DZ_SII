Grimm Bros is in fact a small independent company whose members are located in different geographical areas, from Los Angeles to Bankok, passing through Chicago and London. The project was financed, at least in part, through a crowdfunding campaign launched in March 2014 with an initial goal of only $24,000. At the end of the month of financing, the amount reached exceeded 119,000 dollars and was sufficient to guarantee multiplatform development. Given the logistics, it took about two years of work, coordinated entirely via the web and without an operational headquarters as a fixed point of reference. For the moment the game is available on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Steam and Humble Bundle, but in the future the marketing has already been planned also on Xbox One, Mac, iOS, Android and Linux, as confirmed by the relative logos present on the official site. Dragon Fin Soup is essentially a tribute to the tactical RPG genre with a top-down view but also to the Roguelike mechanics, which determine the high level of challenge and the considerable degree of punishment. Grimm's interest in action-adventure dynamics and Japanese-style role-playing drifts has led to a fusion of the two genres, combined in the context of a procedural architecture that embraces the construction of the quests as well as the formulation of the scenarios. Given that some members of this new reality boast over fifteen years of experience spent in the development of video games, one might have expected great things, but having tried the entire offer first-hand, we were rather indifferent. Dragon Fin Soup has a role-playing imprinting that is combined with Roguelike dynamics Playstation 4 trophies Dragon Fin Soup has twenty trophies, eleven of which are silver and eight are gold. Some are tied to the main campaign, others to completing additional modes or mini-games. Robin the drunk The fantasy world outlined in this RPG tells of a deity known as the Dragon Turtle, on whose back lies the magical world that players have the opportunity to explore. Due to a war between humans and the Wesen race, life aboard this creature was in danger of capitulating forever. Now, thousands of years after those events, an interstellar planet has entered a collision course with the aforementioned entity and thus another era has begun, made up of new deeds and heroes. These trivial premises are the pretext to introduce us to the adventure whose protagonist is the young Red Robin, defined as none other than a cheerful drunken mercenary. Perhaps it will be the fault of amnesia, or perhaps of alcohol abuse, the fact is that our improbable heroine has completely lost her memory and has forgotten her previous past, although the past is destined to peep out again, somewhat in the manner of good old Geralt of Rivia. As we have said, the peculiarity of this product is that each map of the main mode is generated in a procedural way, both for setting the settings and in the structure of the quests and even in the related animated sequences. The two different difficulty levels allow you to choose up to which point you intend to be subjected to severe punishments: the Classic mode allows you to reload the save file in case of death, while the Hardcore mode does not grant any privileges and, in case of defeat , deletes all the progress accumulated up to that moment. The combat system boasts a tactical approach, which however does not rigidly break the progression of the attack phases. The assignment of movement points is missing, while through the left analog stick it is possible to move seamlessly in any direction. The greater the movements made, the larger the incursions engineered by the enemies will also prove to be. However, the procedural dynamics did not excite us more than necessary, especially after spending several hours of play completing short-term and all too similar tasks. The defects that have emerged are more or less usual when this development philosophy is contrasted with the level design planned by the human mind, and can be summarized in one word: monotony. Yes, because if it is true that there are different chromatic variations and a large amount of corridors and areas mixed together with each new assignment, this same flatness of content soon ends up being anbore the eye and reduce the propensity or desire to explore every corner in search of objects, recipes and secrets. Added to this is also a limited dynamism of the movement system, which appears too little fluid and somewhat mechanical. The action slots located in the lower part of the screen contain a range of attacks and potions that can be equipped and progressively improved as the level increases, while the weapons allow both ranged engagement and melee approach. Although the movements are rather free, there is the possibility of taking all the time needed to make the next move, without being conditioned or having to act instinctively. The only strategic advantage over the opponents concerns the diagonal attacks carried out from the medium distance, which can be exercised exclusively by Robin and are useful for cutting off the advance of the forces controlled by artificial intelligence. Within the menus, a large number of objects and functions are then available to manage, from crafting weapons to enhancing skills and potions, from personalizing one's equipment to selecting one's arsenal, which includes bows, rifles, bombs and powers that must be unlocked with the completion of quests. The creation of your own support team passes from the selection of some animals that can be taken with you at any time, or you can opt for the help of other mercenary warriors, who will lend a hand only after a generous fee. Also in the case of the interface there are more or less obvious flaws that should have been treated more carefully, above all due to the inconvenience in dragging and selecting consumable items and in the preparation of powers. Also for the tasks to be carried out they are never particularly fun to complete, revealing themselves all too often anonymous and lacking in variety, also due to the slowness with which the main quest is addressed. The challenges continue beyond the story Two supplementary modes have also been included to support the main campaign. The first is Survival, which allows you to discover the world of Asura even more deeply, starting in a forest with a basic experience level and very limited resources. Thanks to free exploration, you can gain access to secret areas, always generated in a procedural way, full of threats but also of puzzles to solve. For this side of the game, Roguelike contaminations were especially taken into consideration and consequently this is also the mode that boasts the highest level of difficulty. Alternatively, there is the so-called Infinite Labyrinth, a structure that must likewise be tackled with limited resources and an increasingly complex approach. In both cases, exactly as in the aforementioned Hardcore mode of the campaign, death leaves no way out: save revoked and goodbye to your liver. These two alternatives are functional in extending the overall longevity of the game, even if in our opinion the same problems encountered on the main side remain a clear deterrent to further study, above all by virtue of a sporadic amount of stimuli and the absence of those necessary precautions in the combat system or in the management of the user interface. On the other hand, the presence of the Italian localization of all texts is positive, including the introductory manual which compensates for the absence of an initial tutorial. The soundtrack, on the other hand, seemed uninspired and afflicted by the same monotony that accompanies the whole work.", "date": "2015-11-16", "grade": "6.5"}
