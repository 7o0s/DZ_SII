{"name": "Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-to-boruto-shinobi-striker-recensione.html", "text": "Thanks to Bandai Namco, lovers of successful manga and anime series can sleep peacefully: sooner or later the publication of a themed video game will emerge, with a more than fair quality (with rare exceptions). Among the most powerful arrows supplied to the publisher's bow, it is obviously impossible not to mention Dragon Ball and Naruto, series that continue to offer respectable productions almost annually. As for the famous ninjas, it is impossible not to remember at least some sequences taken from the very valid Ultimate Ninja Storm, a series that currently stopped with the fourth chapter, which even if on purpose did not conclude the main narrative arc. But the Naruto manga, as fans will know, continues: it has only changed its name and protagonists, with Boruto: Naruto's Next Generation. Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker represents this delicate moment of transition between generations very well, with a hybrid nature that, despite some defects, still managed to convince us. Gameplay: Real Ninjas are social and play online A premise is necessary, Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker is not Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 5, neither for the atmospheres, nor for the genre or even for the depth. Lovers of the series will therefore have to pick up a nice cup of chamomile tea and sit very calmly before reading this review, because the contents and game modes proposed by the title could displace them. Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker is first and foremost (and above all) a game designed for online mode, both cooperative and (and much more) competitive. You take part in quick encounters by challenging other players, even better you leave your membership for the Ninja Tournament (seasonal) and try to climb the rankings match after match, battle after battle, until you really become the best on the net with the coveted S1 Rank (and there are 25 ranks in all, so good luck). The direction taken, therefore, is the one already seen and tested by Bandai Namco with Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, in the face of the complete elimination of the story mode, which we will talk about later. However, the Dragon Ball Xenoverse are very useful as a term of comparison, because they share with Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker not only the online multiplayer soul, but also the deep customizable component and the social dynamics. Never before have the Ninjas of the Naruto franchise been modernized: the player thus spends the first half hour of the game with a rather substantial editor in which he must select every smallest detail to create his alter ego, from the villages of origin to the color hair, from overcoat to accessories, as well as one of four main game classes (melee attack, ranged attack, defender, healer). All this, of course, because it will have to distinguish itself clearly from the myriad of other online ninjas created by as many players who aspire to reach the highest rank of all. As if that weren't enough, the main HUB takes care of reminding us at all times that Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker is the most social social network possible: the internet connection to each new game, while a business card at the top left of the screen reminds us of the name of our avatar, the level reached, titles and rank; it is also possible to call up the appropriate context menu to learn more about the details, with the number of games won, missions completed, KO suffered, and somewhere there will also be the number of seconds spent in the dressing room to change the Ninja's hairstyle. All this customization, however, what will it ever be aimed at? To a decidedly solid action game, yes. Playstation 4 trophies Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker has a shiny Platinum Trophy that will surely appeal to Trophy Hunters. Obtaining it is not an impossible undertaking, but potentially boring, since it will require a huge level of grinding; everything can then take more or less time depending on the skill of the individual player. In fact, there are 100 games to win in each of the online game modes present, 1000 games in total to play (regardless of the result), all VR Arena missions to complete and all available ninja teachers to level up ( which requires lots and lots of extra lots). A solid action game and faithful to the series Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker has to pay for the presence on the market of four illustrious predecessors belonging to the Ultimate Ninja Storm series: if they didn't exist, it would shine in its own light, and it would also shine a lot. Unfortunately the ghosts of the titoils of the past force it to shine, if anything, with reflected light or the enthusiasm of the fans, making it appear like a simplified action game. In reality, although it does not reach the levels of depth and excellence of the fighting games in the series, Naruto to Boruto: Simplified Shinobi Striker is not at all. And to be honest it's not even a fighting game: it's an action game divided into various missions, some more successful than others, but all still fun and functional to allow the player to immerse himself in a world he loves and already knows Very well. It is probably also for this reason that any story mode is missing: the developers have taken it for granted that the plot of the manga is already known in practically all its aspects, and that the title is purchased by those who want to impersonate their favorite ninjas and above all give them for good reason online. Particular attention has been paid to the vertical development of the levels, allowing for example to climb any solid surface thanks to the chakra, with incredible fidelity to the original work. The combat system is intuitive enough, and a couple of tutorial missions will help you get used to it very quickly: the ninjas have a heavy and a lighter attack, a chakra-enhanced jump mechanic (long press of R2), a couple of special techniques that can be activated with the back buttons, and the super final move. The difference is made by experience in combat, the study of the various types of classes available, and the right equipment: the latter is divided into consumables, weapons and accessories of various types, which will either be purchased through the game currency or found (with a little luck) among the rewards of the various missions. The story mode is completely absent: it replaces the new VR Arena where it is possible to ~simulate~ the most important events and clashes of the past, a nice but not very elaborate way to propose a mix of situations and characters in a cauldron of missions which, despite what it might seem, it still does its job. The game HUB (which we recall is the access path to the online arena) completes a library where you can select your Master Ninja (to unlock peculiar and gradually more powerful moves), a Tavern run by Sakura (here you can change the appearance of your alter ego) and the Ten Ten shop, where you will buy new consumables and weapons or simply redeem your mission rewards. Probably the most ~correct~ way to have fun with Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker is to complete all the VR missions available at various difficulty levels, thus becoming familiar with the game mechanics, then unlock your favorite moves through the Ninja masters , and then go online. Which on balance always remains the beating heart of the production, as well as the right playing area in which to seek the due satisfaction.", "date": "2018-09-08", "grade": "7.5"}
