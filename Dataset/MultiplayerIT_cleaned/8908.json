Now it's up to Mario & Sonic here at the London 2012 Olympic Games to demonstrate whether it was a momentary success or if the sporting partnership between the plumber and the hedgehog is really solid. The Olympiad is on the table If one excludes its candidacy as the game with the longest title in history, Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games presents itself without any great novelties compared to the 2008 edition set in Beijing, and sincerely - also considered the descending parable of Wii- we would have been surprised otherwise: we are therefore always talking about a pure party game, which does not concede anything to the single player and which allows up to four local users to try their hand at a variety of mini-games inspired by the Olympic disciplines. Throwing realism out the window, the title aims to offer an immediate and enjoyable experience especially to a casual or particularly young user, and it almost always succeeds even if it certainly cannot be said that it starts off on the right foot. In fact, intuitiveness is not at home in the SEGA product, given that the instructions and rules of the individual activities are delegated to really badly made and incredibly unclear text screens, which often forces you to have a couple of preliminary games before to understand what to do. The fault also lies with the minigames themselves, which on several occasions exploit the Wii control system in an unnecessarily bizarre way, weighing down the play structures which in themselves would be absolutely simple. At least in terms of quantity, Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games does not miss the target, putting on the plate the beauty of 20 characters to be exploited in the context of 21 events, many transferred necessarily from the first episode (the Olympic disciplines are those, you can't escape) which join a handful of inevitable new entries, in truth not always up to the situation: well-made minigames such as those dedicated to football and beach volleyball are therefore accompanied by activities such as show jumping with horse and the badminton they really leave the time they find. Even one of the strengths of the previous editions, the so-called Dream Events which constitute extremely imaginative ~poetic license~ on some selected sporting disciplines, reappear here in a non-impeccable state of form: of the ten units that make up the total, only a couple prove to be truly inspired, while the others prove to be a bit short of breath. Walking around London As a slightly more complex alternative to the mere execution of individual events, Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games offers the so-called London Challenges mode, in fact a sort of board game that integrates the Olympic disciplines with other activities and mini-games. In essence, users move their characters on a (very) stylized map of central London, with the aim of reaching the end of the match with as many stickers as possible, obtainable by excelling in the various challenges. It is certainly a pleasant multiplayer experience, which unfortunately is far from free from even rather unpleasant problems. Some of the minigames that accompany conventional sporting events are weak and superficially made, the flow of the game is continuously interrupted by cutscenes and uselessly verbose and boring text boxes and the dynamics of collecting stickers are subject to bizarre and poorly balanced rules: just think that a player who has dominated throughout the game can see his entire loot stolen in one go (and perhaps in the last round) by another who will have received a bonus with this effect by pure chance. The playful package is completed by a section dedicated to scratch cards that are obtained as a prize after each event: here too the rules are explained in an all too nebulous way, but the fact is that it is possible to unlock a whole series of extra contents such as costumes, objects and music. From a technical point of view, Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games does the homework without committing too much, carefully avoiding supporting Balance Board and Motion Plus and offering undoubtedly pleasant but also very tacky graphics to the eye as regards the interface and look of the menus, accompanied by a sound that does its duty, stopping one step before becoming annoying and repetitive.", "date": "2011-11-25", "grade": "6.7"}
