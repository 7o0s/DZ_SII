In the year in which the Tour de France will once again pay homage to London with the stage on 7 July, destined to finish in front of Buckingham Palace, for Pro Cycling Manager the number of springs (and summers) spent assumes increasingly most important: it was in fact 2001 when the cycling manager appeared on the market for the first time, never to abandon it again. Since then, Cyanide's effort has remained the only representative of its genre, which we could define as a niche within a niche: if it is notoriously true that managerial games do not enjoy the same popularity as first person shooters, at the same time dedicating a game cycling of this type remains a rather courageous choice, especially in times like these where the discipline suffers from the estrangement of a part of its less loyal fans. A numerous hard core, however, resists undeterred in following the exploits of the greatest mountain climbers, remaining glued to the television for the most competitions, such as the aforementioned Tour and our Giro d'Italia. With the usual, perfect timing, Pro Cycling Manager 2014 has arrived again this year in the highlight of the cycling season: let's find out together what the developers have prepared for us this time. Pro Cycling Manager 2014 is what every cycling enthusiast could want, but there's a but For this year, don't change The central mode of Pro Cycling Manager remains the Career also in this edition, thanks to which you can step into the shoes of the director of one of the numerous teams that make up the international circuit, divided between CYA World Tour, Continental Pro and Continental in a waltz of licenses that it still still has some shortcomings. Also due to the absence in cycling of a union similar to FIFPro, present instead in football. While we can therefore enjoy some names that correspond perfectly to their real counterparts, for other cyclists we are forced to deal with the usual mispronunciation of names, such as the one that transforms Bradley Wiggins into Waggons and Chris Froome into Vroome; not bad actually, because thanks to the game editor, enhanced since last year, online fan communities can easily remedy, offering their own database updates. Those familiar with the Cyanide series will find little new features in the remaining modes offered by the game: in fact, it is still possible to tackle a single event, or embark on races on a closed track, Olympic-style, while the multiplayer mode continues to leverage the so-called Armada, based on a card system very similar to FIFA's Ultimate Team. If this is not of interest to you, you can also challenge your friends in Tour mode, drawing from the official teams loaded into the game database. Accessibility issue For years, Pro Cycling Manager's Achilles heel has been the lack of effort put into bringing those who don't eat bread and pedals closer to this series: the good news is that Cyanide has finally decided to implement a tutorial in Career mode, but the bad news is that unfortunately we are not there yet. In many cases, the guide proposed by the developers ends up paradoxically leaving the player even more uncertain than before, in taking his first steps between menus and various options. Apart from the introduction, in which we are advised to choose one of the strongest teams for our first game (thanks a lot!), the elements of the interface remain rather obscure for those unfamiliar with the Pro Cycling Manager series, not talk about the approach to be taken at the various stages of the season, practically unknown. It is therefore up to you to learn once again on your own skin how to properly prepare cyclists for the races to come, fortunately counting on some improvements, both in the interface and in some aspects such as that of transfers. The latter has been revised by Cyanide to be more interesting in the eyes of the player, also subjected to a greater challenge from the CPU to grab the cyclists. Among the other innovations in terms of management, the possibility of making agreements with suppliers of technical equipment stands out above all, in order to create a real research and development department, thanks to which to create prototypes that can be used to allow one's own team to make a difference on the track. More or less similar speech also for the 3D race, in which the tutorial enters the field in the same way as described above: in this case, the main help for the players consists of the new options that allow you to outline a strategy for each ofthe cyclists engaged in the race, before it starts. Also useful is the possibility of setting the behavior of a single runner to automatic, to ensure that this is managed by the artificial intelligence while we dedicate ourselves to providing crucial indications (even with several consecutive actions) to one or more of the other members of the team. our team. Bugs, patches and endless(?) joy The release of Pro Cycling Manager 2014 was accompanied by a series of bugs, which in several cases seriously threatened the gaming experience. From problems in transfers to the impossibility of progressing in Career mode, up to crashes in the stages of loading the stage and in the race with 3D engine, among other things still afflicted by a certain heaviness, which allows maximum performance only on machines equipped of more powerful hardware. Faced with the complaints of the players through the appropriate forums, Cyanide has recently published the 1.2.0.0 patch, intended to fix the main problems encountered within the game, including those mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph. In the extra time we took to test the patch, it seems that the most pressing fixes have actually been made, but of course the actual presence (or permanence) of bugs can only be assessed over the next few weeks, given the complexity of the game .", "date": "2014-07-04", "grade": "7.0"}
