The initial minutes of the game act as a tutorial which, being such, shows a bit all the standard commands and situations in which we will find ourselves fighting. Well, it is clear from this stage that there is very little simulation (actually it was clear from the title... the word action is never used casually): the controls are practically the same as for an FPS: WASD to move, left mouse button to fire the cannon, right mouse button to use the machine gun, plus two more buttons to give orders to the troops. That's all? That's all. If we want there is also the key that allows you to view the current mission, you can use the mouse wheel to switch to a view placed above the turret of the vehicle and you can use binoculars to request an aerial bombardment (very convenient when the enemies are many). This does not change the fact that the control system is simple and very intuitive, and allows all players to get into the battle without any problems. In fact, one is immediately at ease and it takes very few moments to learn to control the wagon which, by its nature, is not exactly very agile (however, it makes up for in resistance). A quick look at the graphics and the mini-map, on which the objectives, enemies and the ~refreshment areas~ are indicated, a few minutes to get the stomach used to the motion blur (it can also be deactivated) and off we go, slow like satraps towards the enemy. the fulcrum of the game is certainly made up of the numerous battles in which we will find ourselves involved Tracked and around The things to do during the different, very long, missions are many (protect fuel tanks, blow up bridges, reach and control strategic positions, support the troops inside the besieged cities, destroy enemy convoys and various other little things that would be too long to mention) but they can all be solved in the same way: destroy the enemies that are in the target area by turning them into fertilizer for the fields or smoldering metal. In fact, the core of the game is certainly made up of the numerous battles in which we will find ourselves involved. Lights and shadows The massive presence of enemies in the territories will often require us to use our skills as gunners, allowing us to experience the firepower of our vehicles on several occasions. It is at this stage that Panzer Elite Action's first attempt to spice up the action with more than just aim, shoot and boom emerges. In fact, it is necessary: to aim, wait for the turret to position itself in an ideal way, and then fire trying to hit the enemy. It seems like a minimal difference from normal but, in reality, it is substantial because it assumes that you have to take into account the type of terrain you are maneuvering on and because it will require greater care in choosing the targets to shoot at. Thus, finding ourselves on uneven ground with enemies in front of us, it will be our skill to have to position the tank in an ideal way to be able to shoot, choosing the targets so as not to be too penalized, in terms of speed and accuracy, when we have to move to the next target (the fire, of course, is not continuous and a few moments will pass between one shot and another). As already mentioned above, more often than not we will not be alone: other tanks will come with us to which we will be able to give simple commands (make them aim at a specific target, make them stand still in one point, attack from the flanks... in short, the usual things) . In truth, most situations can be solved simply by exploiting the additional firepower (and rather accurate aiming), without having to resort to overly elaborate tactics (only in a couple of cases have we found clear advantages in doing a little of planning). Lights and shadows In the course of battle, it may happen that you receive too much damage or run out of ammo (the machine gun has infinite ammo, the cannon does not). What to do? Obviously, just go next to one of the workshops (they are those indicated by the wrench on the mini-map) and next to one of the ammunition depots (they are indicated with a bullet) to be recharged with energy and weapons and also to allow your troops to regenerate (very simple and, at the same time, very functional). The answer is blowing in the wind One of the features most incensed in the press releases is that of the destructibility of all buildings. This issue is somewhat controversial given that it is true that most buildings are destructible, but it is alsoIt is true that this does not apply to everyone and that, above all, in this way some ~absurd~ situations are created which are difficult to overlook. First, buildings and objects have damage levels that determine their deterioration. This means that all similar buildings are destroyed in the same way even if they are hit in very different points. Probably by exploiting a latest generation physics engine, better and more likely effects could have been obtained. More irritating, however, is the impossibility of destroying certain elements that appear more fragile than others. For example, why in a city in ruins can't you do more damage by destroying some of the ruined buildings? Paradoxically, right there where the game world appears more ~crumbly~ it is impossible to destroy anything. And we who already looked forward to playing football above the smoking ruins of Stalingrad (ahem... this is pure delusion of omnipotence... don't pay attention to it). The answer is blowing in the wind Another flaw of the game, more substantial than the others, is that the different tanks hardly differ from each other in terms of gameplay. That is: some are more or less fast and can carry more or less projectiles; but the truth is that the differences are often imperceptible and irrelevant. From a technical point of view, Panzer Elite Action is doing quite well: the game maps are quite vast, the textures of the terrain and the different objects that make up the scenarios are well done (although a little more variety would not have hurt) just as the models of the different tanks are very convincing. The effects of the explosions are also good, making the various fights truly spectacular (especially in the case of a chain effect). The motion blur deserves a separate mention: at the beginning you can hate it for how it has been implemented (in a sincerely excessive way) but, getting used to it, it will become the ideal complement to the spectacular firefights. For the audio part, little to report: the usual sampled effects (very good... but now, in the digital age, only the bad ones cause a sensation) and the usual period music distributed among the menus and interludes. all similar buildings are destroyed in the same way even if they are hit in very different places Hardware boxes To play Panzer Elite Action you need a 1.4 GHz Pentium 4 processor (or equivalent), at least 512 MB of RAM and a 32 MB graphics card. To play better you can also bring the processor to 2.8 GHz, the RAM to 1 GB and the graphics card to the penultimate generation. Tested on a P4 3.4 GHz with 2 GB of RAM and a GeForce 7800 GT, the game did not give any problems with fluidity. Final comment Panzer Elite Force is a good action title that can be played without giving peaks of excellence but without ever falling short. The three campaigns together with the multiplayer mode should guarantee him a good longevity, also by virtue of a high difficulty in some moments (especially in the advanced stages). If you manage to notice it, you will also discover that the title has narrative ambitions and that a story is linked to each campaign that can be followed by reading the intermission screens between the missions and the dialogues between the troops. We honestly played without paying too much attention to this feature, which takes a lot of second place to the rest given how secluded it is (this is why we only mentioned it in the comment). In short, if you are looking for a solid and well-made action game you know which title you have to turn to, also by virtue of the rather competitive price, which earns it a few more votes.Pros In some moments, between explosions and screams, it really seems stand on a battlefield Graphically very good Tough enough Cons Fifteen tanks offer no sensible difference Why can't we destroy everything? Those who love fast action stay away from them these are still tanks. Old age A fully action-focused WWII tank game. This is Panzer Elite Action, the latest effort by the Slovenian Zootfly, in which you will find yourself driving the most impressive beasts (fifteen in total) that faced each other during the Great War, over the course of three campaigns of variable length. A few words said everything, one would say. There is actually something else to say (also because otherwise QuakeMan scars my new car with a screwdriver signed by Carmack). Hitler, various associates and their deeds have now been largely stripped from video games to get everything possible in terms of scenarios and backgrounds. Now not even archive footage used as an interlude has the effect it once did. It is old age that incombe with his first ailments. What are you going to do. However, apart from the pessimism of accentuated baldness, let's go down for the umpteenth time to the most famous battlefields in contemporary history and see what they have to offer.", "date": "2006-04-19", "grade": null}
