We have some little information in this regard (ops!), but it is too early to fantasize about exactly what this new trilogy will be, and if it will keep the gameplay foundations intact within the Action-RPG genre. In any case, the Japanese developer has not forgotten his latest creature, and after several months the first expansion dedicated to Dark Souls III is finally available, with the subtitle Ashes of Ariandel, the ashes of Ariandel. The cost is 14.99, which becomes 24.99 for the Season Pass including the second expansion provided for the game; to access it you need to reach the Cathedral of the Depth - the fifth setting available with the travel option - precisely at the second bonfire positioned in the Chapel of Purification. On the right side of the altar there is a new character who after a short dialogue will allow you to reach The Painted World of Ariandel in which you, once again ashes, will have the task of rekindling the flame and freeing it from the horror that envelops it: after experienced firsthand, of course. From our point of view, the contents are sufficient in terms of quantity and duration, but in general there is a lack of grit and moments capable of making this DLC memorable without any reservations. The review of Ashes of Ariandel, the first expansion of Dark Souls III The horror inside a painting Ariandel's Painted World offers a mainly cold and snowy setting, immediately highlighting what could be the characteristics required to get the better of your character. Aptitude for the use of fire, but also resistance to it and to frost, because several opponents do not skimp on the use of attacks imbued with these elements. In this context, the developers have introduced a multitude of unpublished creatures, including a pack of wolves, animated trees and giant knights; most of these adversaries focus indiscriminately on power and agility, and fit perfectly into an adventure that requires a certain familiarity with the dynamics of Dark Souls III and the changes made compared to the previous chapters in terms of response to commands and use of the roll. We have counted at least ten new types of opponents, to which must be added two dark spirits and as many bosses, one of which is optional: in the first case we can be satisfied, in the second less so, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. At least the final boss is evocative, has several combat phases, integrates perfectly into the story and is challenging especially if it is faced without resorting to the help of other players. The optional one, on the other hand, is more anonymous and relatively easy to deal with but still has an important value because it allows you to access the PvP part of the game, which we talked about extensively in a previous preview. Once you have obtained the appropriate object, you must burn it at the Altar of the Bond, the central hub of Dark Souls III, in order to select the type of game and then access a single arena theater of clashes. The present modes offer duel, multi-player melee, team combat of up to three players, during which only the overall winner receives the benefits. While enjoying an excellent fiber connection, we recognized a lag that is far from being ideal for tackling such technical fights as those of Dark Souls III: we enjoyed it, but most of the modes are oriented more towards the ~mess~ than to the exaltation of PvP. Furthermore, a single arena, even quite flat in terms of conformation, makes itself felt in terms of longevity. The best mode therefore remains that of the duel, which in a separate environment allows you to test your skills and dabble against the most disparate opponents who play the From Software title. Returning to the main adventure, the design of the levels offers some elements already seen in the past, such as the descent downwards through some ancestral branches or crumbling bridges; in general there is a good glance but few new elements that manage to surprise those who have already spent several hours in the world of Dark Souls III. From Software recommends playing Ashes of Ariandel with a level of at least 70, we did it at 90 and in any case we had our fish to fry, above all due to the presence of rather tough enemies, fast in their movements and perhaps positioned innarrow spaces, following the usual trick of the developer in making things even more complicated. After about 6 hours we had almost everything there to do including exploring the optional areas; there are sixteen additional weapons, the bonfires are generous and positioned not too far from each other, the different titanite slabs allow you to upgrade part of your arsenal to the maximum level, for a rather rapid use of the adventure and with little need to go back to your own steps. That said, numerically we are in full sufficiency in relation to the purchase price, as mentioned, the defects are to be found in the overall quality that never manages to take off or stand out compared to the contents of the basic title. From a graphic point of view, the engine is obviously the exact same as the original title, the creation of most of the enemies inspired and interesting as in the case of the Nordic knights and those with claws; patch 1.08 also arrived together with the expansion: there are many new features, mainly aimed at balancing some spells and weapons, a rethinking of balance, more consistent animations and improved hitboxes, joy and pain for the most hardcore fans of the series. From what we have been able to see firsthand, there are some tangible improvements in the combat phase, which, being available even for those who do not have the DLC, are untied from the evaluation of the latter.", "date": "2016-10-27", "grade": "7.8"}
