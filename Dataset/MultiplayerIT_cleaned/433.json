{"name": "Camera Caf 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/camera-cafe-2-recensione.html", "text": "very little to be considered a sequel A dirty job A system to immediately identify the position of all the characters would have been of great help, since often each mission is a race against time, but above all the limited interaction allowed with the environment remains a major limitation of the Nobilis title. There are very few elements on which to intervene and conversations that do not refer directly to the goal of the day only bring dry and flat answers. The only real reason of interest lies in the use of cameras to spy on your colleagues and discover their every intimate habit, in order to extort favors of various kinds from them. We are well aware that when you spy on the private habits of ~honest citizens~ you always discover unimaginable foibles and fortunately Camera Caf 2 does not save money on this, offering a healthy, merciless irony. A dirty job The attempt to come up with intriguing goals is commendable but it collides like a full speed formula one car into the office wall, literally. In fact, it is not possible to play in areas other than those present on the two floors of the company and please ask ourselves what that processor is doing in our homes, if we then have to reduce ourselves to checking small pixels seen from above that would have been nice eight years ago. Were at least prompted by a brilliant series of puzzles one could say that technique is not everything, but the greatest difficulties are represented by the lack of clarity on how to complete a goal. Sometimes the greatest difficulty consists in identifying a tiny book with the mouse that finally has a name for that particular mission. Above all, the game structure is so similar to the first Camera Caf as to hardly justify a second outing, in which once again you will end up taking toxic ~espresso~ products from the office machines to give them to a colleague to maneuver, until the end of a campaign too short to be considered as such. Just to underline how the laziness of the developers greatly undermines the thickness of Camera Caf 2, just mention the return of the free mode in which you will now have to play tricks on the other workers, such as tampering with the screensaver or sabotaging their work. Not really to be considered a sequel. Losing team... Apparently it doesn't change. If you have read the review of Tagliaferri's Camera Caf you won't find much new in the following pages, and I could limit myself to a brief update (Pierpaolo joke. No, you don't need a gun. I'm serious). Instead, let's take our time to delve into the mystery (yes, this time it's a real mystery), which hovers in the gray days of Luca and Paolo. In fact, it seems that behind the installation of television cameras in the offices and along the corridors there is a petty and unconstitutional plan, which naturally involves the great boss De Marinis, who in turn seems to be fighting with the top leaders of the city council. If everything will turn out to be nonsense or not, I'll let you find out for yourself by participating in the mission mode. Losing team... It may happen for a very short period of time that the word Sims flashes in your mind, but an effect of this type must be treated as a mirage or a sign of withdrawal, because no, not even by chance, Camera Cafe 2 does not even look like it a bit. Too bad I think, despite being a detractor of the repetition of ideas already seen. Unfortunately all those nice little employees offer a very limited and trivial interaction, which is why the mission mode is to be considered a thought-busting adventure, tremendously similar to the mode already proposed in the previous episode. The only common thread is represented by the attempts of Paolo, Luca, Gaia and Alessandra to find out what the top management of the company are plotting, to subvert an Orwellian situation at least disturbing, especially for the typical laundering employees very well represented by the first two. Naturally Camera Caf 2 is the sequel to the video game based on the television series of the same name, but if you needed someone to remember it, forget one of the tiny reasons that could attract you. Closed the parenthesis, now we come to real life, where a white collar trade unionist can make a difference. Okay, maybe it's not real life. The failure of the average man There is only one thing that I appreciated in this Camera Caf 2, and that is the grotesque, but all too plausible representation of the life that animates the typical work environment with all its frustrations and annexed neuroses, which are often reflected in life private. There is no shortage of heavy jokes and a humoura little adult, with clear sexual references, without however reaching who knows what fine peaks of irony, please. It's just that in the abyss to which this Camera Caf 2 seems relegated, even a small torch of light like this stands out. Naturally you must have already had a taste of this world and the word precariat must sound like the fanfare of the revolt, otherwise you can cross out the positive sides even the trade unionist jokes. The failure of the average man If only the graphics engine weren't a sloppy and dull representation of three-dimensional models, some of which at least animated with a minimum of softness, the technique could at least be saved. Instead nothing, Nobilis leaves us no way out but we are generous and we want to give advice to the developers: if all the dialogues had been dubbed by the actors of Camera Caf we could have been close to sufficiency despite the dense gaps. Too bad, only a faint little music and background noises, which in the tertiary gray do not sound like flaming swords or spaceship reactors. Better next time? Maybe yes, but Camera Caf is enough. Final comment There are no valid reasons to buy Camera Caf 2 and I say it lightly. Rarely does a title offer so little and with such superficiality. The slightly perfidious irony that characterizes it remains in our hands but for this reason Italy boasts excellent satire experts, if you know where to look. In summary, even if the basic idea could offer the starting point for a bizarre adventure, the paucity with which it was made undermines any good purpose. To make matters worse, the fact remains that what was said for Camera Caf 2 has in turn already been said for the first episode. Pros Adult humor Luca and Paolo do not disappoint... Cons ...but they don't look anything like the real ones Repetitive and limited Poor in every component Hardware boxes Unpretentious also from the point of view of technical requests. A Pentium 1.2 GHz or equivalent, 128 MB of Ram and a GeForce3 or Radeon 7500 video card are sufficient. The game was tested with an Athlon 64 3000+, a 128 MB Geforce 6600GT and 1 GB of RAM. We found no problems of any kind. A dirty job Exactly as happened in the first Camera Caf, the ~hard~ work day is divided into two time slots spaced out by a lunch break. Watch in hand, or rather on the screen, you will first have to complete a minimum of office tasks in order not to receive a recall. In fact, if you get to the fourth corporate warning you can say goodbye to the world of Camera Caf. In theory these small, extremely repetitive and futile chores, such as making photocopies, participating in the daily meeting or working on the PC, should represent an additional difficulty for what are instead the main objectives, directly connected to the plot. In reality they are almost an annoying trifle to be completed as soon as possible so that you can dedicate yourself to the actual game. Not only are they boring and purposeless, but they also seem poorly fitted into the overall game mechanics. However, let's earn our daily bread and make interpersonal relationships with colleagues, much more numerous in this second episode and spread over two floors, even if it remains incomprehensible how practically all the furnishings of the previous chapter have been relocated identically in Camera Caf 2. Again however, once we will alternate between four of the main characters of the series, who will have to do the work for their colleagues or talk to them about pleasant topics to win their sympathy, in order to obtain objects or favors that contribute to the fulfillment of their objectives.", "date": "2006-06-21", "grade": null}
