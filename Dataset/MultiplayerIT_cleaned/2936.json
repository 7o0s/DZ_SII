{"name": "Control: AWE", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/control-awe-recensione.html", "text": "We approached the Control: AWE review full of anticipation about the long-awaited return of Alan Wake. Fans have been asking for it for years and somehow Remedy Entertainment wanted to satisfy them, although in reality the concessions present within this second expansion are very few. We have no problem admitting it: we nurtured the hope that this package really represented an Alan Wake Experience, and for this we were inevitably disappointed. The protagonist writer of the 2010 action shooter of the same name makes his appearance and narratively connects his universe with that of Control, it is true, but beyond this there are only promises about the future of the franchise. Exciting, sure, but so far very, very vague. History To access the Control: AWE missions you must have completed a large part of the basic campaign, reach the Central Executive and then head towards the usual elevator. Along the way, Jesse has a vision: it's Alan Wake speaking to her, but from where? To find out, the new Director of the Federal Bureau of Control will have to explore an unprecedented area of the map, the Investigation Sector. With the Hiss still firmly in command of many points in the headquarters, however, reaching the source of the messages will not be easy. Reinvolved in the mind-trip represented by the corridors of the Oceanview Motel, Jesse opens a door and again sees Alan Wake engaged in a kind of confrontation with himself. How are things really? Apparently the writer is trapped in the dark dimension that has enveloped Bright Falls, but something has managed to emerge from this darkness: Dr. Emil Hartman, author of the book ~Creator's Dilemma~, transformed into a creature as powerful as it is creepy that now found in the Oldest House. Structure It is therefore Dr. Hartman that we will have to hunt down in the main missions of Control: AWE, which will keep us busy for something like three or four hours depending on the side quests with which we decide to try our hand. As per tradition, exploring the scenarios and collecting the files will strengthen the list of available tasks, which however will remain optional even with respect to the completion of the expansion. But let's go back to Hartman, the protagonist of three different boss fights from the usual, in which the mechanics of the contrast between light and dark, fundamental in Alan Wake, becomes the key to solving the environmental puzzles necessary to expose the monster's vulnerabilities from time to time and allow us to drive him away or injure him. Of course, being able to understand what to do and how to do it while the Sibilo agents continue to shoot at us will not be easy this time either. Gameplay Where you are wondering, the answer is no: in Control: AWE there are no missions nor short interludes in which we will be able to take on the role of Alan Wake. The presence of the character remains ~hidden~ for the entire duration of the expansion, although some mechanics so dear to the now classic title developed by Remedy Entertainment are introduced into the gameplay, namely the use of lights to destroy barriers of darkness and unlock thus doors and objects essential to move forward. The developers, however, have not gone too far: Jesse is not equipped with a torch or is faced with enemies that must first be illuminated and then destroyed. The more concrete innovations are all linked to the original Control formula, in this case a new module has been introduced for the Service Weapon which fires three bullets to be detonated whenever we want, as well as a Launch enhancement which allows you to grab three different objects for throw them at our adversaries. Among the ranks of the Hiss there is also a new type of agent, the Ranger, who will not fail to give you a hard time since he promptly manages to dodge the first attack and must therefore be taken for exhaustion. The point is that he never acts alone and loves company: be prepared to fight clearly outnumbered and to accept the fact that a few hits can drain almost all of your life energy. Ultimately the AWE package manages to achieve a good balance between clashes and environmental puzzles, the latter more present than usual. In addition to the secondary tasks, to further enrich the expansion we find a series of extra modes accessible through 80s-style coin-ops, which provide a considerable challenge by asking us to survive several waves of enemies, eliminate a certain amount of them within a time limit and so on. Technical realization If Alan Wake's involvement in Control's second expansion wasn't what we hoped, the developers of Remedy Entertainment could certainly have recalled the settings of the game and, in general, tried to build a certain type of atmosphere that would bring us closer to the adventure of the unfortunate writer lost in Bright Falls. Well, even this hope was unfortunately disappointed: the The Investigative Sector re-proposes the design of the many areas of the Oldest House that we have already visited, and beyond the sporadic visions we will not be able to admire scenarios other than the usual. There is no doubt that, from this point of view, the previous expansion, The Foundation, dared more with its caves and the unprecedented verticality of some sections. In conclusion... Control: AWE is a decent expansion, with a couple of interesting new features and a good amount of side activities that can extend the duration of the pack substantially. It is also the first step in the direction of the Remedy Connected Universe, a narrative universe shared by all the intellectual properties of the Finnish team, as well as a real prologue to a new, possible adventure by Alan Wake. we expected: the role of the writer in the story is marginal and on the gameplay front very little is granted to those who wish to try their hand again with those specific mechanics. In short, it is difficult to define it as a crossover: in many ways the feeling we had was more that of a sop.", "date": "2020-08-27", "grade": null}
