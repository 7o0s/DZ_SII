{"name": "Atomic Heart", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/atomic-heart-recensione.html", "text": "Atomic Heart's retro-futuristic art design could not leave sci-fi and dystopian enthusiasts indifferent, attracted by a product that promised to catapult the user into a world in which the Soviet Union, during the 1950s, is erected as the first world power, thanks to an unprecedented technological development. There are many other reasons that have recently contributed to giving visibility to the production of Mundfish, a rookie team working on their promising creature since 2017, some of which are all nothing but positive. From the accusations of having passed off vertical slices as gameplay trailers, to those of having forced employees into intense phases of crunching, passing through the sinister and dystopian inference according to which the game is exclusively used to collect data for the Russian government, the project went through several critical moments. Without wanting to go into the merits of issues that have very little to do with the quality of the experience in and of themselves, but which nevertheless do not deserve all the attention of the case in other forums, limiting ourselves to having to analyze Atomic Heart we cannot than to define it in all respects as a debut title, with so much potential, but also the ingenuity that a first work inevitably carries with it. We are talking about a respectable debut, of course, but it is undeniable that behind the rather shiny and thick patina, there is a sometimes lame FPS, a game with style and absolutely able to entertain, mind you, but at the same time imperfect and inconsistent. In this Atomic Heart review we will explain in detail what works and what doesn't in this FPS which, in any case, will inevitably attract the attention of fans of the genre. Better to read than to experience There's no denying that Agent P-3, star of Atomic Heart, has his charms. But he's even too foul-mouthed to be, theoretically, a highly trained soldier and well-regarded member of the Soviet Union. Atomic Heart outlines the boundaries of a ukronia in which the Soviet Union stands as the first world power in the middle of the 1950s, a domain made possible by unprecedented technological development. We are not talking about simple super computers that arrived in history before their time. The nation of which Agent P-3, the protagonist of the adventure, is the proud inhabitant, boasts flying cities, robots capable of autonomously completing any task, gigantic machines capable of digging underground tunnels with extreme simplicity. The one offered by the Mundfish game, in short, is a retrofuture in all respects, a golden age in which the conquest of the Solar System is one step away and, more than anything else, the unification of the entire humanity in a sort of hive mind, in perfect synthesis with the androids, thanks to the Kollectiv, a neural network, which while maintaining the individuality of each one intact, is one step away from being put into operation just when the real adventure own starts. The idyll is broken as soon as Agent P-3 sets foot in Structure 3826, the flagship of the Soviet Union, as well as the main industry for the production of robots, an immense laboratory where new technologies are studied, a museum center which contains and certifies the power and foresight of the Communist Party. Sent on a simple routine mission, ours will have to face an unprecedented crisis that risks discrediting his country in the eyes of international states, as well as destroying the good intentions of the Kollectiv. There are no narrative crossroads, but many Atomic Heart dialogues still offer more answers that will allow you to have more information about what is happening and, in general, about the game world The robots, in fact, without any reason are in revolt and have exterminated most of the technicians, scientists and civilians who lived in Structure 3826 which, winding through several buildings connected to each other by magnetic levitation roads and railways, represents in all throughout the game map. The plot, or rather the narrative management of Atomic Heart, is the aspect of which it is easier to recognize the immense potential, but also the many flaws and inconsistencies of the production. From this point of view, you can clearly draw a line between what works and what leaves something to be desired. The adventure of Agent P-3, his desperate struggle in an attempt to save what can be saved, struggles and not a little to convince. There is no shortage of twists, of course, but from this point of view all of Mundfish's inexperience is evident, perfectly at ease in conceiving brilliant ideas, less so when there is a need to give them a tangible and concrete form.digital direction, to begin with, tries in every way to flaunt its own style, made up of distorted shots and sudden zooms, but ends up being uselessly chaotic, unable to underline the most significant passages with due pathos. Atomic Heart never veers into horror, but still has several moments that are simply creepy The script itself often trips over itself. Agent P-3, though partially justified at one point in the story, rather than a staunch citizen of the Soviet Union, acts and mostly talks like the most carefree Yankee bad ass of any action film of the '90s. 90. Furthermore, the characters that revolve around him do not pierce the screen, but are configured as mere specks subjected to a story that develops in a confused and incomplete way. An overwhelming proof of this is the sentient glove worn by the protagonist, who continuously offers explanations at every step, enunciating with suspicious omniscience thoughts, actions, motivations of the other characters brought into play, soon creating a narrative paradox difficult to accept. Nevertheless, the world of Atomic Heart remains extremely fascinating and not only thanks to a convincing art design, capable of giving life to reassuring and at the same time extremely disturbing robots, claustrophobic military bases, museums with retro design at the right point and wide panoramas dominated by splendid structures and annihilating statues due to the gigantic dimensions they flaunt. In fact, the enveloping emerging narrative takes care of saving the game plot. Each scenario bears witness to the horror that took place in Structure 3826, each holographic computer expands the imaginative boundaries of the world created by Mundfish, captions, texts, vocal notes combine to illustrate the technological achievements of the Soviet Union, the consequences of the Second World War, the successive evolutionary stages that humanity is preparing to make in these alternative 50s. Overall, the end result is controversial. On the one hand, interest in the intricate and poorly explained conspiracy behind the Kollectiv is almost lost. On the other hand, one is continually intrigued by a world that is extremely coherent with itself, well conceived, excellently rendered through small testimonies that describe a lively, suggestive, credible world. When the mace is better than the rifle In Atomic Heart hand-to-hand combat is so much fun, that you'll often prefer to hit a robot with a club rather than shoot it from afar A similar ingenuity also invests the gameplay that can only nominally be compared to that, far more usual and profound, of the first Bioshock, a term of comparison with which Atomic Heart has often been compared. The basic assumption, briefly, is the same. We explore, solve puzzles, fight based on supernatural powers that the good Agent P-3 develops by exploiting Polymers, a compound which, through the aforementioned glove, allows ours to freeze, lift, slow down the enemies hit by his jet. Unfortunately, as we will say shortly, even in this case not everything works properly. Compared to the first Bioshock, Atomic Heart focuses on a fairly large map that can be freely explored. A large part of the weapon upgrades, for example, are linked to very specific secondary missions that will ask you, more often than not, to poke your nose where you really shouldn't and also to carry out a minimum of backtracking. Each area is patrolled by androids, robots of different shapes, cameras which, even if destroyed, can be repaired by automatons designed for this purpose. The prevailing sense of urgency, of constant insecurity gives a particular aftertaste to the exploratory phases of Atomic Heart, but this feeling does not seem to be completely innate with the gameplay offered by the experience. The few menus that manage the growth of the Atomic Heart character certainly don't shine for ease of navigation. You must first make an eye to understand exactly how to move Especially on the higher difficulty levels, ammo is a rarity and it doesn't take long to run out of juice. Not bad on most occasions, a real nightmare when you end up running into a semi-boss with whom melee is anything but effective. Yes, because melee attacks are by no means secondary in gameplay of the game. Not only are there more blunt objects that you can unlock and use, but more often than not you will have no other opportunity than to beat your hands to knock a particularly tough enemy upside down. From this point of view everything works great. Although from time to time the orientation is lost, each slash releases the gThe right feedback and animations allow you to understand when the damage has been inflicted and when, instead, the objective has been completely missed. To make the pair with the fights with white weapons, then they take care of very scanty stealth phases. In theory, you can always leap behind your opponents for silent and deadly takedowns. If in the open world phases it is an additional strategy from time to time effective and useful to the cause, in the main missions, much more linear, it becomes really difficult not to be discovered also and above all due to the scarcity of shelters to hide behind. In practice, there is a constant feeling that this feature was introduced in a late stage of development, when most of the level design was already planned. There is no shortage of cutscenes to mark the progression of the Atomic Heart plot, although most of the time you will experience first-hand the events involving Agent P-3 and his mission to save the Kollectiv Similar feeling for the much vaunted crafting, which during the presentation of the project seemed to give extreme freedom to the gamer. Unfortunately, when tested, everything is resolved in a series of upgrades and pre-packaged weapons that can be obtained at the price of a certain amount of resources, recovered by exploring the settings and eliminating the enemies. Between shotguns, maces, submachine guns and pistols capable of exploding electrified projectiles, Atomic Heart certainly does not stand out for the fantasy of its arsenal, but the many available upgrades still instill a pleasant progression in character enhancement. Fun, but clumsily chaotic Even the weapons, with the necessary upgrades, can be loaded with flaming or freezing bullets, a significant plus, all the more effective with certain types of enemies Agent P-3, as anticipated, also enjoys a series of unlockable powers through a complex, and slightly unclear, skill tree. Beyond bonuses for life and athletic skills, which will make it easier to explore and escape from robotic patrols, ours can also increase the affinity for the use of Polymers. By selecting up to two skills at a time, the avatar can freeze enemies, create a defensive shield, slow them, and use telekinesis to pin them inches above the ground. Using the powers in combo you can create some pretty good effects, but unfortunately, unlike what happened in Bioshock, you will rarely use these supernatural abilities. Recovery times mortify the gamer's potential strategies, but what's worse is that often these skills offer a very limited advantage. Although above all at the higher difficulty level it becomes essential to exploit the elemental weaknesses of the opponents, the pace of play, often furious, does not go well with a mechanic which, however trained and ready one may be, requires a minimum of tactical preparation to give its fruits. Using the abilities of Polymers and the elemental properties of weapons is the best way to enhance the qualities of a gameplay feature that unfortunately never fully shines Atomic Heart, in fact, reveals a double soul. At first everything works almost perfectly, with a well-marked progression and manageable clashes both by shooting and by facing enemies from a short distance. After halfway through the adventure, unfortunately, the game chooses to become Doom Eternal, exaggerating of course, pitting Agent P-3 against hordes of enemies who attack without ever allowing a breather. Unfortunately, the gameplay suffers, bent by mechanics clearly not designed to hold certain rhythms. Melee becomes confusing, using Polymers correctly becomes difficult, the chronic shortage of bullets makes everything even more frustrating. The same I.A. which manages the enemies, does nothing to improve the situation, outstretched and limited as it is to throw any threat present within range headlong. In short, there is a lack of balance, also thanks to a level design that flattens enormously, also due to environmental puzzles that become simpler and less brilliant. The feeling that one gets, after halfway through the game, is that the developers had finished a good ideas, but who absolutely did not want to give up a longevity that offered more than twenty hours of entertainment, the time necessary only to complete the main quest. Once the types of enemies to be sent to the front are finished, Mundfish has decided to submerge the user with hordes to face one after the other. Once the level design ideas are finished, we find ourselves exploring corridors and large rooms of anonymous underground bases. Lost the bu", "date": "2023-02-20", "grade": "7.5"}
