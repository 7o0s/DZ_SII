Kids have no idea why there is a link between a pencil and an audio cassette, how bulky and heavy CRT TVs were, what it meant to call a friend's house and make an appointment in a certain place, with the however, it was impossible to warn him on the street of a possible change of plans. In the same way, many gamers of the last hour, or almost, do not have in mind the stormy period in which developers had to deal with the transition from bitmap to polygonal graphics, trying to reinterpret genres that were very popular but really difficult until then to render in three dimensions. No, I mean, does anyone remember Fighting Force? Precisely. Tomb Raider was not born in that historical moment, but almost; and effectively invented a genre. Or rather, reinvented it after action-packed adventures like Prince of Persia, Another World, and Flashback had all been said and done. Go inside a scenario, observe its characteristics, find the right path, activate switches, jump from one platform to another and climb a handhold... this is what Tomb Raider did, in the context of polygonal graphics, before everyone else. And not happy with this, it also introduced one of the most famous characters in the entire gaming industry, that recently redesigned Lara Croft thanks to the excellent reboot signed Crystal Dynamics, but which in 1996 was practically the female version, extremely busty by Indiana Jones. Of course, with two pistols instead of a whip, which is not a bad change. Tomb Raider I arrives on iOS with a technically perfect conversion, but the controls are abysmal Yesterday Today Tomorrow The hat was a must, considering that Tomb Raider I for iOS takes us straight back to that pioneering atmosphere, with a practically perfect reduction of the PC version (which included the Unfinished Business expansion), enhanced thanks to Retina resolution, a frame higher rate and a resampling work carried out on the textures. This is to say that the game is still quite nice to see on iPhone and iPad today, net of a modest polygonal count and frankly ugly CG kinematics, which unfortunately have not been redone from scratch for the occasion. If you have played with the original Tomb Raider, you know how the developers moved to make the most of the digital controllers of the time (analog sticks were still something unknown to most, especially those who had never seen a Nintendo 64), through a ~blocky~ construction of the scenario and Lara's ability to move left or right slowly, walk, run and jump, all with the agility of a bulldozer. Something unthinkable for a modern third-person action game, seriously. Despite this, the charm of such an engaging and exciting title was and is undeniable, capable of incredibly frustrating and at the same time giving great satisfaction. Thinking that an adventure of this kind, with improved graphics and even extra levels, is sold on the App Store for just 89 cents can only amaze. Unfortunately, however, all that glitters is not gold, and in the case of Tomb Raider I the enthusiasm for the beautiful conversion, for the price and for the extras literally crashes against a touch control system that defining cumbersome is an understatement, and which already in the intermediate levels represents an insurmountable obstacle to a dignified fruition of the experience. Let me be clear: the controls were wooden even on PlayStation in 1996, there's no doubt, but transporting them to the touch screen hasn't made them more digestible in any way, on the contrary it has added to the inevitable weight of the years a load of additional disappointment, due to an optimization that would certainly have been possible, also in terms of the interface.
