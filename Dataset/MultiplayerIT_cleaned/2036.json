The last big block of expansions had made us taste Skyrim again, made us visit iconic places in the series and intrigued thanks to a really tasty storyline based on werewolves and vampires. Our Argonian has seen it all and, even if he doesn't play devotedly and in pure hardcore style, the adventure on TESO proceeds in the best possible way. Precisely this being able to be resumed at will is the engine that has prompted millions of players to become attached to the title, for a project that today is one of the very few MMOs to continue its growth in terms of active users. In preparation for the big, new, June season, we have therefore returned to tread the lands online to see the promised changes to the classes and delight in two new dungeons ready to pave the way for the Gates of Oblivion chapter. Having taken possession of the DLC thanks to the usual 1500 crowns, with a small extra sum to add the Mournhold Packrat (the inventory space is never enough), we filled the quiver of arrows and jumped into the adventure: let's see how it went in The Elder Scrolls Online: Flames of Ambition review. Enemies and flames Before starting, it is important to know that this new content will only open the doors for you from level 45 in the group finder, a necessary condition to approach the dungeons and be able to collect the precious new loot that they hide. Of the two new instances, the one that is certainly more interesting in terms of pure fighting is Black Drake Villa, where the narrative will lead us to explore the dungeon to recover an ancient tome in the company of Eveli Sharp Arrow. The external appearance of the setting recalls the Roman villas of the classical era, with the huge gardens and the imposing ruined columns of what were, most likely, once places of worship. The raids then transformed it into the perfect lair for the True Sworn mercenaries, accompanied by goblins and beasts of various kinds, a perfect warm-up to stretch your bones in view of the first real boss of the new DLC, a huge Minotaur ready to make us fight pieces thanks to his huge club. The fight, which can also be tackled in hard mode, like all the bosses of the Black Drake Villa, alternates phases of pure DPS with sections in which it is necessary to dodge bullets from some totems and quickly dodge dangerous area effects. An interesting and dynamic fight, capable of requiring commitment from the entire party who will have to manage bosses and minions in unison. Once the boss has been killed, we continue to descend to the lower floors of the villa guided by Eveli between environmental puzzles and manuscripts to deepen the lore, while the mercenaries continue undaunted to show up in our path in order to avoid letting us reach one of their leaders positioned in the middle of an arena for a fight once again based almost entirely on positioning and movement. The fiery beasts faced up to this point were only the appetizer of what stands as captain of the mercenaries, decided, given our intrusion, to set the entire structure on fire by burying ourselves under a mountain of ash. As usual, the final boss consists of several phases, with the need to decide when to move from one floor to another of the fight through special teleporters so as to avoid ending up charred, similar to what happened in the Blackreach battles, for an adventure tough to deal with but also quite stimulating. The Elder Scrolls Online: Flames of Ambition: Zaudrus in all his might Less interesting, although still of a good level, is the dungeon The Cauldron, part of the storyline of Flames of Ambition and starting point to discover something more about the Order of the Awakening Flame, this time in the company of Lyranth and Drathas, dark elf desperate for missing citizens from a nearby village. Before being able to free the prisoners, however, the usual plethora of enemies awaits us including cultists, a handful of new bosses Dremora soldiers and obviously Daedric beasts will be defeated, in a dungeon divided into three main macro areas. As we said initially, however, the challenge in this dungeon is not as stimulating as in its twin, given that the dynamism acclaimed before fails and already in the first boss fight, against the pestilential Oxblood, the situation is quite manageable and only when come face to face with Viccia, the elven boss of the instance, things tend to come alive more with diversified phases and a strategy made of hit and run to bring home the fur. The setting is dark and at times suffocatingof The Cauldron opens a window when lava rules it with the parti that inexorably drags itself towards the last fight. The other bosses in the middle fail to shine or make the experience more lively, which only explodes vigorously in the final moments when the immense Baron Zaudrus stands in front of our path. In a reddish-colored dungeon, the enemy in question will show off his powerful melee shots, flailing the party with massive area shots and causing pillars to emerge from the ground from which to keep away. A continuous wave of flames will then force the team to move continuously sideways, for a fight based heavily on the healer's sustain and healing abilities. Received the fatal blow Zaudrus will collapse to the ground and you can finally enjoy the fateful loot.
