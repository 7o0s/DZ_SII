{"name": "Motorbike GP", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/motorbike-gp.html", "text": "Once upon a time there was Hang-On, an arcade title developed by Sega and released in 1985 which for the first time reproduced motorcycle racing with a great sense of speed. And with a hint of romanticism, which was revealed in the change of scenery every time a certain distance was exceeded. Since then the racing game genre has made great strides, but there are productions that still have to refer to the classic Sega for a number of technical reasons. On mobile, in this case, we still cannot ignore the two-dimensional / three-dimensional mix that contrasts the sprites of the motorbikes and mobile objects in the background with a vector path, whose main task is to scroll away very quickly. But how everything is handled in practice, well, that's another matter. Motorbike GP gives us the opportunity to try our hand at fast races or in an entire Moto GP championship. Since the Kitmaker title is an unofficial product, we will have drivers and teams with modified names, but this will not change the substance of things and above all the nature of the various circuits, designed in the image and likeness of the real ones. As much as possible, sure. The game has no simulation ambitions and indeed has a strongly arcade connotation: no free practice, no qualifications, we set off and away, with the opponents who only initially distanced us (in Hang-On they immediately detached us and then we had to catch them on the way. .. very unrealistic, but fascinating) and that we have to overcome within the laps of the track that we have planned to do. The problem, common to many low-level productions, is that the opponents appear on the screen suddenly and we have to avoid them if we don't want to fall, which occurs in most cases also due to a control system that is too cumbersome and rigid completely unsuitable for this kind of application. Having somehow overcome the obstacle of the other bikes to avoid, we can finally concentrate on the race and in particular on the curves, which are indicated to us by an arrow on the screen and which we can also tackle at full throttle, just anticipate them slightly. As far as the technical realization is concerned, Motorbike GP unfortunately has all the air of an amateur production: the motorcycle sprites are not exceptional and boast very few ~animations~, even badly done. A greater effort in this sense would have made the overall experience more edifying, also because it would have been possible to notice the opponents from afar (in the presence of smaller sprites for that type of situation) and plan a change of direction to avoid contacts. Otherwise, there are very few moving elements and the layout is sparse but rather fast in scrolling. Finally there is a background image which varies according to the track and which moves to simulate a minimal effect of depth. The control system, as mentioned, makes it very difficult to avoid collisions but performs decently when it comes to cornering, thanks largely to the arcade spirit of the game. Of course, it's a case of using the joystick only to go left and right, pressing the 2 key on the number pad to accelerate.
