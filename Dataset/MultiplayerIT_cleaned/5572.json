Hatred, beyond its technical realization, was a title designed almost exclusively to arouse scandal and controversy, furthermore the components of the software house have in the past been at the center of some controversies related to certain neo-Nazi groups. Director Jarosaw Zieliski has emerged from controversies by declaring that he reads certain sites only because they are the ones that ~tell the truth about what is happening in the Middle East~. Zieliski has never denied that he believes ISIS is a group of madmen managed by those who really control the situation in the Middle East, and that if the caliphate has not yet been swept away it is because someone needs it. Political fictional analysis aside, the fruit of this contempt has materialized in a fairly simple game, a little content project whose communicative implications are far greater than its actual videogame value. We played IS Defense, the video game against the caliphate. Beautiful or just a tool to argue? One man in charge IS Defense could be defined as a video game of political fiction and bad military strategy. After ravaging the Middle East, ISIS forces are finally ready for a full-scale attack on Europe. One would expect a titanic clash between two armies, something in the Command & Conquer style but no, Europe has decided that to eradicate the extremist threat a poor man is enough with a stationary machine gun, occasionally helped by a few soldiers, air raids and missiles. So what could have been yet another RTS is nothing more than a clone of Cabal or Operation Wolf, those old arcade classics of a time when our alter ego was represented on the screen by little more than a crosshair and the enemies they ran towards us shooting, more and more, more and more evil, until our inevitable defeat. That's right, the paradox of IS Defense is that while it is a game ~against~ ISIS, it basically describes NATO's inevitable capitulation in the face of the caliphate's unstoppable horde of soldiers, trucks, suicide bombers and landing craft. The clash takes place on three different scenarios: the coasts of Sicily, a Spanish port and the Croatian hinterland. To access the next scenario you must first meet the requirements of the previous one, or kill a certain number of terrorists and blow up enough enemies, which obviously will accumulate session after session. This is undoubtedly the first flaw of the game: honestly, the unlock requirements seemed a bit high for a title in which the average session is about five minutes, after just a few repetitions we felt the tedium of being able to fight in one setting and we struggled to access the second. If you really wanted to be inspired by the great classics, it would have been better to predict some form of player advancement through various schemes and not the inevitable defeat in just one. You just got promoted! A certain form of progression consists of experience, which will be accumulated with kills and will unlock skill points that we can spend in four different categories. The first concerns our character's health and within it we will be able to obtain the ability to slowly recover energy over time or by killing opponents, increase life points and so on. The second category concerns the primary weapon: here we will be able to spend points to increase stability, rate of fire or obtain explosive bullets. The third is instead dedicated to the secondary weapon, or rather the missiles, and as mentioned above we will be able to improve the damage, the speed or make them incendiary. The last slot is that of the aids that we will be able to exploit: the points will be spent to make the soldiers stronger, the bombings longer and so on. Yes, because although NATO loves us so badly that it has left us alone, as already mentioned, we will be able to count on some temporary aid. On the left side of the screen there is in fact a vertical bar that increases over time and gradually unlocks more and more useful things. The first step is supply crates, which can be ammunition for the missile launcher or healing bonuses: unfortunately the choice is random, so it will happen too often to receive rockets when you are about to die or a full health medkit. The second upgrade are ground troops that will help us with enemy soldiers: they are probably the most useful help in the game, given that we will hardly be able to control the whole situation with our machine gun alone. Be careful though, there is friendly fire. The third is a decidedly inaccurate artillery bombardment, which also threatens to killour allies, so useless. The fourth is an airstrike, which is the same thing, but with fewer random casualties. And finally we have another very useful support: a support helicopter that will stay on the battlefield for about a minute and will wipe out everything in its path. As for the enemy forces we will have very normal soldiers, kamikazes, to be eliminated before they approach, pickups with heavy machine guns and armored hummers. Occasionally you may need to rotate the turret 90 or 180 to defend against sudden and inexplicable attacks from behind, but the biggest threats tend to come from the front. In the first level it is quite easy to hit the rafts full of soldiers trying to get close to the coast and the landing craft, but already in the second scheme the situation becomes more complex because some of the enemies attack from the side and are so small that you have to do a lot to find them attention and it takes very little to be surrounded. In short, this great gesture of rebellion against ISIS, this act of condemnation against European laxity is all here: a crude game in terms of mechanics and contents which is nothing more than the modern version of some great classics, too bad the world is moved on.", "date": "2016-04-15", "grade": "6.5"}
