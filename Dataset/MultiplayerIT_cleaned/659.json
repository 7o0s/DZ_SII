Ready to go and the title immediately seems to creak on what has always been his strong point: the official FIFA license. The completeness and accuracy of the rosters and of the various alloys in fact reveal some inaccuracies. Several clubs are not present with their official logo and name, and some valuable pieces of the last transfer market are still linked to the now ex-teams (Gilardino still at Parma, Toni in the rosanero, Vieira at Juve but substitute, etc.). The game modes are numerous as usual: in addition to the classic friendlies, championships and cups among the most varied, there is an interesting career mode that allows you to try your hand at coaching over a period of time of several years, during which we should achieve the team's seasonal goals. On the basis of the team's results, you are evaluated and as a result you earn or lose particular prestige points, which are useful for evaluating your work as a Coach. Of note is the inexplicable and frankly annoying procedure for saving game progress, which forces the player to turn off the console every time. Taking the field for the first time we notice how pleasantly simple it is to become familiar with the control system, which compared to previous editions for GBA can be enjoyed on two additional front keys (X and Y), which offer the title a feeling very similar to that of the major consoles. The layout of the keys is in fact the same that you would have holding a DualShock for PS2. The touch screen plays only a marginal role: during the game you can change tactics on the fly, but to do so you necessarily need to use your fingers, the icons to touch are small and the answer is not always ready. Improvable. FIFA06, as fun as it is, fails to recreate a football game in a completely plausible way Bomber or Mister? The game of football is based on slender balances that FIFA06 struggles to respect. It follows that the game, however entertaining, fails to recreate a football match in a completely plausible way. There are numerous aspects that would need more attention, starting with the physics of the ball, which generally exhibits little credible behavior. AI routines also appear crass both individually and collectively; goalkeepers, for example, too often produce unholy exits from the poles, while the teams controlled by the CPU denounce obvious limitations especially in the offensive phase, where they are quite sterile, but also defending, with naive movements of the defensive line, often very high and easily drillable with one-two central and trivial raids. By raising the level of difficulty, the situation seems to improve almost exclusively on an individual level (the matchmakers become more aggressive). From the player's side, we notice how it is simpler and more intuitive to carry out offensive actions compared to defensive ones, although some perplexities arise when executing crosses, regarding which it seemed difficult to calibrate strength and direction of the shot. Even the management of free kicks is not fully convincing, and in fact continues to be one of the Achilles heels of the series. Too bad, above all because in our opinion EA could have developed an execution system that exploited the touch screen. A portable and all 3D FIFA, we said, for which the curiosity to see the graphics engine at work was great, which at first glance earns a narrow enough sufficiency. The polygonal models of the players are rather poor, and as was easily predictable they are now difficult to recognize at first glance, as is the case in the editions of the game intended for home consoles. With the exception of a few superstars who have received privileged treatment (see Ronaldihno who at least stands out with his ponytail), all the others are hardly different from each other, and if they do it is only thanks to obvious differences of height or skin pigmentation (moreover not always faithfully reported). As for the attention to detail, it must be said that this portable FIFA06 seems to suffer as much from the reduced hardware power of the DS as from the limited resolution of the LCD screen; some particular accessories, such as the personalized names on the back of the shirts and the sponsors on the chest, are in fact also present in this edition but are almost illegible. Also from the point of view of fluidity, the title does not prove to be free from criticisms, mainly due to conspicuous drops in framerate during corner kicks or more generally in the most crowded situations of the game. In general, however, the playability is not particularly affected.Mention of merit for the creation and management of the replays, which although they cannot be saved in any way, are very well made and pleasantly usable at any moment of the match. Comment Considering the fact that it is the first and for now only football title for the Nintendo handheld, FIFA06 is not to be despised. Even with the numerous limits just illustrated, the game is still fun, and the different game modes guarantee a good longevity. We were not convinced by the possibility of varying the difficulty at any moment of the game, as well as the modest use of the distinctive features of the DS. While waiting for other and more delicious opportunities to materialize (read Winning Eleven), FIFA06 represents a game recommended for football fans in withdrawal, provided they can turn a blind eye to a somewhat coarse reproduction of their cult sport.Pro Numerous game modes Tons of teams Technically sufficient Cons Unrealistic Outdated FIFA license Seldom used touch screen The punctual and powerful FIFA franchise, which has been raging on all gaming platforms for more than ten years (including mobile phones), does not miss the opportunity to make its debut on Nintendo DS as well, and does so as usual at the turn of the Christmas period. Until a few months ago there was no way to play a football video game on the train comparable to the ones that cheered us in the living room in front of the TV, with all due respect to the various ISS and the 2D milestones that preceded it. Tedious technical issues deprived football fanatics of this pleasure, but with the release of the new Nintendo portable and Sony PSP the obstacle of limited hardware resources has been broken down. EA Sports restarts by immediately dropping its aces: over 10,000 militant footballers in 25 different leagues, the tested classic game modes among which the coach mode stands out and a tantalizing wireless multiplayer, even with a single cartridge. FIFA06 is the first three-dimensional football game for a portable console from the Grande Enne, but it is clear that to fully convince you will need much more than a handful of polygons and an exclusive appetizing license. The peculiarities of the DS, then, should offer interesting solutions for the videogame transposition of the game of football, at least on paper.", "date": "2006-01-03", "grade": null}
