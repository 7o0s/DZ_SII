And in fact the water under the bridge, in these summer months, has not passed without changes, now in terms of content now for improvements, from the point of view of some aspects of the title. But the other important news is that Minecraft: Dungeons is now also available in shops in a packaged version (the so-called retail), at a price of 29.99 euros with all the additional content included. We've had the opportunity to thoroughly dissect this definitive version of Minecraft on Nintendo Switch, so we'll pay particular attention to the peculiarities of the hybrid console. The Nintendo Switch version: the advantages The Nintendo Switch version of Minecraft: Dungeons has its pros and cons, like any title that - already available elsewhere, we have already proposed the review of Minecraft: Dungeons on PC - you choose to buy right on the Nintendo hybrid console . Let's start from the top, that is, from the points in its advantage over the others (content being equal): portability. Only on Nintendo Switch you will be able to play this dungeon crawler set in the world of Mojang blocks wherever you are, and that's no small thing. Indeed for some it is everything, the only aspect that could really justify the purchase (or perhaps a second purchase, to be added to the one on other platforms). The advantages do not end here: in fact, the possibility of connecting a second Nintendo Switch Pro Controller or individual additional Joy Cons is also excellent for playing local multiplayer, up to four heroes present at the same time. The entire adventure, including the story lines of the expansions, can be played in the company of your friends. The technical sector If every pro has its cons, the main flaws of Minecraft: Dungeons on Nintendo Switch can undoubtedly be attributed to the technical sector. Let me be clear: on the Nintendo console the title is not bad to look at, nor does it have bugs that make it truly unplayable, the situation is far from tragic. And yet there is no doubt that the performance is lower than all the other versions on the market. Starting with the frame rate, which has been sacrificed to ensure fluidity in every situation and therefore remains anchored to 30FPS always and constantly, even in screen videos. However, not everything seems to have gone the right way, and you will notice it immediately (especially in portable mode) with the introductory videos of each level that seem to ~click~ from time to time, quite perceptibly. After all, even the fluidity of the same adventure sometimes shows the side. Not in the first two or three levels of the game, of course, when the situation is still manageable and there aren't dozens and dozens of enemies on the screen: but in boss fights, in the most crowded dungeons and dramatically in online multiplayer sessions or in local, Minecraft: Dungeons struggles to handle all those on-screen elements on the Nintendo Switch. An obvious difficulty which (only in very rare cases, however) directly blocks the application. This actually happened to us a couple of times in the first seven hours of the game. The contents Minecraft: Dungeons on Nintendo Switch represents, from the point of view of content, an excellent opportunity to recover the title if you have missed it to date. The price of 29.99 euros is particularly fair, if we consider that the packaged version includes, in addition to the basic version of the game, some not bad trinkets (a couple of player skins, a hero cape, a chicken that will follow you in your raids) and above all the two DLCs released to date, namely the summer Jungle Awakens and the September Creeping Winter. Considering that the basic Minecraft Dungeons single-player mode offers ten levels, from the Squid Coast to the Obsidian Pinnacle, it is clear that the longevity of the production has only to be gained with the additional island realms (i.e. with the jungle-themed DLC and snow). In fact, the latter add content upon content: weapons, enemies to eliminate, spells, and much more. Revised mechanics: merchants and challenges Minecraft: Dungeons will allow newcomers to familiarize themselves with recently revised mechanics, and of course already included in the physical version on Nintendo Switch. To begin with, the functioning of the basic merchant and the blacksmith has been completely revised: now in the main square of the game hub you will unlock many more characters to interact with.The Luxury Merchant sells high-end items at arguably high prices, the Mystery Merchant sells random items that you can pay up front with no refunds (he's effectively taken over from the old and only merchant), and the Standard Village Merchant sells a certain number of items, depending on the daily challenges completed. The latter are indicated on the main game map and require you to complete usually simple tasks, which require more grinding than skill. Finally, the blacksmith finally allows you to upgrade your Minecraft: Dungeons arsenal, but even here there is a price to pay in gems, in addition to completing some secondary challenges. All this should be enough for you to spend at least 30 hours alone within the title, and potentially a much higher number in the company of friends.", "date": "2020-09-17", "grade": "7.0"}
