{"name": "AVICII Invector", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/avicii-invector-recensione.html", "text": "AVICII Invector is permeated with an involuntary underlying melancholy which ends up affecting the whole experience and therefore cannot be completely excluded from the review. It was inevitable that this was the case, since it is an officially licensed game by AVICII, a very famous DJ who committed suicide last year. From this point of view, the game is ambivalent, because it does everything to detach itself from the dramatic news events that involved it, but at the same time it does nothing but remember them right from the title, where the name of the character was added at a later time for celebratory purposes (the game has already been released on PS4 under the name of Invector). The cover itself has been modified by inserting his face, a face that also returns in the loading screens. The substance is that what on paper should be a very simple rhythm game, in which in each level you follow the rhythm of one of AVICII's songs, has been transformed into something slightly different and much more funereal, in which I remember, looting and celebration blend into the gameplay more than we intended. Let me be clear: that's the game and probably the death of AVCII didn't affect the general project one iota, but his suicide is an unavoidable stone guest. AVICII Invector is very easy to describe: it is a classic rhythm game in which you have to press the right key at the right moment, that is when our avatar, a spaceship with a nice girl called Stella on board, reaches one of the icons that follow one another on the paths that make up the levels. From time to time the gameplay is broken up by phases of free driving, in which you have to be able to pass through some obstacle to get bonuses, be they higher speed or extra score. The goal of each path, twenty-five in total, for twenty-five AVICII tracks, all playable at three levels of progressive difficulty, is not only to reach the end, an obvious fact, but above all to not make too many mistakes: if the percentage of correct keystrokes drops too much, you have to play the level all over again. Not bad, since they don't last long (the time of a song) and are incredibly well done, between electronic landscapes, futuristic cities, lasers everywhere, mountains, luminous crystals and lights of all kinds. Controller in hand, AVICII Invector works well, even if you are not a DJ fan: the songs have the right rhythm, the response to our requests is very precise and we have never made mistakes because of the game, but always because our. Everything is obviously bound to the rhythm, including jumps, ramps and rotations of the corridors. However, the problem with the title of Hello There Games is another: it's all here. Beyond the beauty of the circuits and the songs, AVICII Invector does nothing to detach itself from the canons of the genre or to differentiate itself a little from its competitors, which it follows slavishly. Moreover, once the twenty-five songs are over (about two and a half hours of play) there is little else to do, except replay them at a higher difficulty level (the last one is a real nightmare). As mentioned, the higher difficulty level is really arduous and requires absolute concentration to succeed. Add that to the lysergic frenzy of the circuits and you'll understand why we don't hesitate to call it all stunning. If we wanted to sum up AVICII Invector, we could describe it as a short night at the disco. In short, you play more to have a strong sensory experience than to hone your skills. The matter changes a bit if you have friends to play with, because it is possible to do it all together on the same system via split screen. Obviously friends don't bundle them to you.", "date": "2019-12-06", "grade": "7.5"}
