{"name": "Dead Rising", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-rising_a.html", "text": "Released here in September 2006, Dead Rising is still one of the most engaging and technically spectacular titles for Xbox 360. The story clearly refers to the film ~Dawn of the Dead~ (simply renamed ~Zombi~ in Italy), with an entire city being overrun by zombies, especially the huge shopping mall. Frank West is an ~action photojournalist~ looking for the scoop of his career, and decides to be flown to the scene by helicopter, to collect photos and testimonials. What he will face, however, will be a real hell on earth: the living dead feed on people, and those who survive the bites turn into a zombie in turn. There are many refugees in the mall, and under Frank's command we will have to try to save as many as possible, using anything as a weapon: sticks, umbrellas, sports equipment, televisions, musical instruments but also guns, swords and, in general, all that is sold in the numerous shops of the complex. While fans are waiting for a sequel (which unfortunately hasn't been officially announced yet and on which ~rumors~ abound), looking with curiosity at the imminent conversion for Wii, Dead Rising is back in the spotlight with a mobile reduction that takes up the original story and adapts it to portable use. The game consists of seven chapters, each of which must be completed by achieving a certain goal. We will find ourselves controlling the usual Frank West in a two-dimensional context, with the sprites seen from above, and as in the Xbox 360 version we will be able to use a large number of weapons to make our way through the zombies: guns, clubs, swords, lawnmowers and so saying. Each works differently: firearms must be activated remotely, with a sort of automatic aiming system that allows us to hit the target without too many compliments, while for blow weapons you have to press the 5 key when you are in proximity of an opponent. Finally, automatic tools allow us to mow down zombies simply by walking towards them. Each weapon has an energy bar, as does Frank, and it is possible to pick them up by pressing the 9 key. The possibility of taking photos has also been inserted: by pressing the 7 key, the camera viewfinder appears on the screen, while with 5 the image is captured. Too bad it has no use in the game... The technical realization of Dead Rising amazes, there is no doubt. It is surprising because it seems to be in front of a mobile game from two years ago, with sprites bordering on the essentials, without details, with few animation frames, which move within bare and repetitive scenarios. Unfortunately it seems that the big software producers in the console and PC fields, such as Capcom, do not have the slightest idea of the progress that has taken place in the mobile sector in recent months: apart from games with polygonal graphics, we have witnessed the birth of 2D titles very good, with an exceptional design, full of style and substance. It is therefore difficult to believe that experienced and capable developers have not managed to do better: much more likely they wanted to focus on maximum compatibility, making sure that Dead Rising could also work on older phones. Pros: A good number of internships Lots of usable weapons Simple simple Against: It looks like a game from two years ago Technically mediocre Rough combat system", "date": "2008-10-11", "grade": "8.6"}
