In retrospect we can say that we have witnessed the implementation of an excellent strategy by Capcom, which voluntarily misled the players, awakening their interest in this franchise even with some controversy, before revealing the real nature of Resident Evil 7 biohazards. An essence that we were able to get to know a little at a time in the following months, beginning to appreciate it and to let ourselves be more and more intrigued by it until the last encounter that took place before this review, dating back to about a month ago. Marketing strategies aside, Resident Evil 7 biohazard would probably have talked about it a lot anyway, given the situation in which one of the most representative series of the entire gaming world found itself exactly twenty years after its birth. Leaving aside the disaster of the spin-off Umbrella Corps, the choice to abandon zombies and other classic canons that had proved successful in the fourth chapter ended up pushing Resident Evil little by little to abandon its nature of survival horror, until the cinematic experience on a global scale of Resident Evil 6. The latter was evaluated between lights and shadows by critics, ending up being little appreciated by players who then clamored for a return to the atmospheres and dimension of the first chapters, with which this saga has built its own fortunes. We anticipate that Resident Evil 7 biohazard does it and also well: we just have to see how. Welcome to the Baker house, where horror runs in the family and enjoys playing with your wife! Tell Aunt Rody Forget Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy and all the special agents known in the previous chapters, because Resident Evil 7 biohazard puts us in the shoes of Ethan Winters, an ordinary man who for the past three years has believed Mia, his wife, dead. We are a few years after the events told by Resident Evil 6, with which however this new chapter has no connection: the story begins when Ethan receives a video in which Mia appears alive but in an evident condition of danger, to ask her husband to forgive your own lies and stay away from her and everything else. Obviously ignoring the request, the protagonist sets out in search of his wife, following the clues that lead him in the middle of the bayou, in Louisiana, to the Baker family home. The merry gang has already been widely presented to us in the past, thanks to the famous dinner scene in which Ethan appears tied to a chair with a severed and stitched hand, getting a stab in the face from the head of the family Jack while his son Lucas throws remains at him humans inviting him to eat them. To add further discomfort to a very little reassuring situation is the old lady of the family, who doesn't say a word but simply appears out of nowhere in various places in the house. Returning to dinner, the arrival of a sudden distraction leads the hosts to get distracted by their new guest, who can thus free himself to go in search of Mia, at the same time discovering all the secrets hidden by the family. Apart from a few elements on which we keep silent so as not to spoil the surprise, the very first part of Resident Evil 7 biohazard presents very few clues that can connect it to the series to which it belongs, focusing much more on cinematic atmospheres such as that of the dinner just described, evidently inspired by the one seen in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a classic of the horror genre dated 1974. Little by little we are therefore allowed to discover that the Bakers are not only crazy murderers, but that they actually possess supernatural gifts that allow them to being able to count on a strength out of the ordinary, in addition to the nice ability to regenerate one's tissues, appearing for this reason immortal. In fact, Jack, Marguerite and Lucas represent the bosses we are called to confront in the first part of Resident Evil 7 biohazard, in which the members of the Baker family enjoy playing cat and mouse with Ethan, tormenting and threatening him in various ways before reaching the final challenging and rewarding battles. When you don't find yourself having to deal with the merry family, the protagonist has to fight against the so-called Mycomorphs, already sighted in the past thanks to the specimen present in the Beginning Hour demo. These are creatures with humanoid features but apparently without organs such as nose, eyes and ears, completely black in color due to the strangesewage-like substance of which they are made. The Mycomorphs are present in three different main types, the first of which is represented by the monster that stands on two legs, prefers the close attack and becomes lethal after being provoked, while the second is more similar to an animal, stands on four legs and makes faster movements making it difficult to hit. The last type of Mycomorph is the huge one that spews sewage, slow in movement but extremely difficult to put down. As you may have already guessed, the rumors according to which Resident Evil 7 biohazard would have been nothing more than an Outlast clone are definitively wiped out after a few hours of play. Back to the ancient Those who asked Capcom to bring Resident Evil back to its origins will perhaps be disappointed not to see zombies circulating inside the Baker's house, but can only be happy with the way in which the latter has been developed by the developers. The place where Ethan is taken prisoner is permeated by a terrifying atmosphere, in which danger can always be found around every corner but even the appearance of an old woman in a wheelchair is enough to send a shiver down the spine of whoever has the controller in hand. The so-called ~jumpscares~ are present and there are even more than one, but for the most part Resident Evil 7 biohazard plays quite clean, constantly keeping the player's emotional state in training. The decision to move the first person view does not affect the spirit of Resident Evil at all, but rather inevitably contributes to the player's identification in Ethan's shoes. To make his way through the Baker house, the protagonist must solve various types of puzzles, always connected from a logical point of view and for this reason able to give a healthy feeling of satisfaction when solved. Sometimes it is a question of using the right object at the right time, while on other occasions we are asked to play with the shadows of some sculptures on the paintings in the house, finding ourselves involved in the process much more than one might imagine. The areas that are initially closed to us can be unlocked with the use of special keys, with clear reference to those known since the first Resident Evil. The game phases alternate in an exemplary way, thus always involving those who are in front of the screen: we pass from moments where exploration is the master to others where instead you have to take the gun in your hand and shoot, and then put it again aside by making the brain work. The parts of Resident Evil 7 biohazard that differ the most from the experience just described are those relating to the VHS cassettes that we can find during the adventure: in one of them, in the role of Mia, for example we have to hide from Marguerite, while in a he other occasion almost seems to be inside Saw - The Riddler. We won't reveal anything else so as not to spoil the pleasure of discovering everything firsthand, but what we can tell you is that we have enjoyed what we have seen throughout the duration of Resident Evil 7 biohazard. The only exception is perhaps represented by a small drop in the central part, which in any case does not affect an overall experience of the highest level. In the final part, after the change of setting (that's right, you don't stay alone at the Baker house), there are moments in which the game almost seems like a ~walking simulator~, but they don't last long and are in any case functional to the atmosphere designed by Richard Pearsey, the first western screenwriter to work on Resident Evil, already working on F.E.A.R. and Spec Ops: The Line. At the end of the games the counter marked eleven hours, which we believe could be likely as the total duration of the Resident Evil 7 biohazard adventure: we did not run and we also invite you not to do them, dwelling on the details present in generous quantities to learn more details about the secrets of the Baker family and its ties to the Resident Evil saga. Once completed, Resident Evil 7 biohazard encourages the player to go back to work again, thanks to collectible items, unlockable elements, but above all to the Asylum mode: it all starts again with increased difficulty, but not only. Also in this case we leave you the pleasure of discovery. Playstation 4 trophies Resident Evil 7 biohazard has a total of 36 trophies, divided between 25 of the normal type and 11 of the hidden type. Among the normal ones we find a platinum one, related to the conquest of all the others, accompanied by 2 gold, 6 silver and 16 bronze. The objectives range from the passage between the various chapters of the story of Ethan and Mia to various aspects related to collectibles, up to the inevitable ~run~to complete the adventure in less than 4 hours of play. Recorders, backpacks and trunks The desire to return to the origins that is satisfied by Resident Evil 7 Biohazard also passes through the game's save mode, which can only be carried out in the rooms where the cassette recorders meet. In the same places there are also typically trunks, to be used to store objects that we do not need immediately, thus remedying the lack of space in Ethan's inventory. The latter is made up of cells intended individually for each light object, while to carry the heavier ones the game requires double the space inside the backpack. The boxes available to us are obviously never as many as we would like, considering that inside them we must carry the objects necessary to solve the various puzzles, thus subtracting the space available to transport weapons and ammunition. Speaking of the latter, starting from a simple knife Ethan can count on a respectable arsenal, which includes classic elements of the series such as pistols of various types, a rifle and a machine gun, but also more devastating weapons such as a flamethrower - essential in part where we're up against some nasty bugs - and a grenade launcher. Weapons can be obtained in various ways, which include solving ~side~ puzzles and using the special coins that are found over time. Although it seems to us that Capcom have decided to be a little more generous with their ammunition than in the past, Resident Evil 7 biohazard takes up the classic canon according to which every single bullet has its own weight, so instead of shooting the crazy it is better to do it little and in a reasoned way. Going from a situation in which you are in possession of a reassuring arsenal to one in which weapons are scarce is a matter of a moment, the one necessary to find yourself in a panic after a couple of missed shots and a monster on your heels. By finding the right ~ingredients~ you can actually rely on the crafting system to create additional ammo, but again you have to be careful because the items to combine are in common with the part dedicated to Ethan's health. By combining the famous plants with particular fluids, it is possible to create medicines capable of increasing the protagonist's life points, the level of which can be measured in the amount of blood present on the screen or through the heartbeat meter located on the left wrist. Welcome to the world of virtual horror An atmosphere of anxiety and horror like that of Resident Evil 7 biohazard could not stand without adequate support from the technical sector, entrusted by Capcom to the newborn RE Engine. In a general sense, even on PlayStation 4 Pro, the level of graphics does not make you scream at the miracle, but the history of some triple A titles teaches us that we must still appreciate the absence of visual problems of any kind, including the polygonal interpenetrations found during the our test from a month ago. The profuse attention to detail makes every corner of the Bakers' house a source of power for the deep feeling of unease that permeates our every movement, to which some of the animated scenes present in Resident Evil 7 biohazard contribute. Especially in the initial phase, the game proves to be decidedly not suitable for those with a stomach not used to witnessing dismemberments, cuts and amputations of various types: if what you see disturbs you beyond a certain threshold, don't tell us we didn't warn you. We have already dedicated a special to the suggestions of the bayou, which we invite you to read if you haven't already done so. As far as the audio is concerned, this factor undoubtedly plays its part too, starting with the soundtrack, not very present but precisely for this reason of extreme effect when some music comes into action. Aunt Rody's tune, with which you get to the initial menu, is destined to remain in the player's head for all the ten-odd hours of the game, and even beyond. Except for some hesitation in the initial exchanges, overall the performance of the Italian dubbers is quite good, but we still recommend the English language setting to those who can follow it. Before the final comment, we remind you that Resident Evil 7 biohazard can be played entirely in virtual reality via PlayStation VR, thus allowing the experience to reach a completely new level of identification and fear. The downside is represented by the decrease in graphic detail for image management in the viewer, in addition to the usual motion sickness problem for those who are particularly predisposed", "date": "2017-01-23", "grade": "9.0"}
