It is immediately clear that Cenega's production certainly does not focus on originality... But what is the reason that will push us to face 30 different locations, move to other dimensions, face the most infernal and demonic creatures in existence? It all begins with a letter that the protagonist receives from his brother: there is talk of supernatural forces capable of subverting the established order of things and unleashing incredible cataclysms but above all his help is required! Our bold young man (light version of the classic truzzoni like Duke Nukem and Painkiller) doesn't think about it for a moment and finds himself in an abandoned village in Central Europe, until an angel appears at his sight who starts making very strange speeches about wars between gods and other abstruse indecipherable affirmations. What is certain, however, is that if we want to save our heros brother we will have to face a long journey (the game lasts about 30 hours) between evil and inhospitable lands in 4 distinct universes (Present, Middle Ages, Ancient Egypt and the Mysterious World of Shadows Do they also remind you of something, or am I wrong?) to recover artifacts capable of releasing some entities with incredible energy. However, there is something strange in the words of this angel that does not inspire us all this trust but only as we continue on our journey will we understand that he is not a friendly figure like Virgil in Dante's Comedy (and so I also did the erudite quotation). As previously mentioned, Shade  Wrath of The Angels moves on the most classic action platform coordinates: kill the enemy (with simple blows or with some combos that are most often superfluous), find the key or solve some decidedly elementary enigma, jump platforms by taking the right measures. The quality of the fights is decidedly mediocre (not even the ~bosses~ at the end of the level represent who knows what challenge ...) and the same can be said for the just mentioned component of the adventure (it is difficult to find such a linear title). On the other hand, the platform situations prove to be excellent with some highlights worthy of the great masterpieces (the prince and the ninja clearly) which require that pleasant, decidedly successful mix of reflexes and dexterity so much as to invite programmers to think of a pure platform for their next job On the other hand, the platform situations prove to be excellent with some highlights decidedly worthy of the great masterpieces Even from a technical point of view, the judgment is rather mixed. On the scale of the merits we must undoubtedly place the rather monumental scenarios which remain impactful despite the technique of ~an infinitely multiplied texture~ being used very frequently but on the other hand the final visual result is undoubtedly pleasing to the eye of the gamer. Even from a technical point of view, the judgment is rather mixed The light effects are also good and the animations sufficient. To balance the weights, a series of really annoying graphic bugs think about it since not only aesthetically seeing the characters set themselves in the scenarios or have interactions with the void is certainly not pleasant but sometimes these problems have repercussions on our own game actions and I assure you that the lack of free saves (we opted for the use of checkpoints) in some situations will easily make you curse the programmers. Among the unconvincing points must also be counted a decidedly arid character design of innovation and variety with spiders, insects, mummies and zombies that do not shine even for a detail of any kind. Normal sound without peaks of excellence but not with any drop in style. Comment Can the PCists finally have in their hands a worthy answer to the never too much idolized Ninja Gaiden? Unfortunately, the answer is absolutely not: Shade - Wrath of The Angels slavishly follows the most traditional canonsi of the action platform without leaving its mark with the decidedly mediocre adventure and combat components while the platform situations shine with some highlights worthy of the great masterpieces of the genre. Even from a technical point of view, the judgment is rather mixed. On the scale of the merits, the rather monumental scenarios must undoubtedly be placed (which remain impactful despite the technique of ~an infinitely multiplied texture~ being used very frequently) to which, however, the many, too many, graphic bugs that they also affect the gameplay. Despite everything, playing Shade is a pleasant experience and if you have a certain degree of tolerance to the various defects listed, it also has a decidedly high longevity and hardware requests that are anything but expensive. The sufficiency, torn from the limits, is also due to the chronic lack of games of the genre on PC. Certainly a budget price for a ~minor~ production would have made Wrath of The Angels much more inviting. Thus it is intended for those who still have a longing for not having Ninja Gaiden in their soft library and will be able to settle for an ultimately acceptable surrogate. Pros: Excellent platform component Evocative and pleasant environments Duration above average Cons: Full of graphic bugs Mediocre fights and puzzles Definitely repetitive and linear When XBOX was in the pipeline years ago, many more or less high-sounding names in the videogame industry and critics announced, without a shadow of a doubt, a de profundis for the PC as a gaming machine. These funereal predictions never turned out to be wrong, so much so that the arrival of the Microsoft console instead marked an increase in productions destined for our personal computers even in those genres that seemed up to that moment to be the undisputed domain of exclusively gaming machines. There would be many examples to give but I need this incipit to introduce an exception to this trend, namely the fact that in the field of action/platforms, productions intended for our hard disks, have not been decidedly frequent in recent years and in the head at the moment, I can only remember the excellent Prince of Persia  Sands of Time and Legacy of Kain: Defiance as well as the controversial latest episode of Tomb Raider. Could Shade therefore be a valid answer to the never too idolized Ninja Gaiden? I warn you that unfortunately it is not like this (maybe) but the production of Black Software is not to be ruled out a priori So how about getting to know it better?", "date": "2004-10-14", "grade": null}
