{"name": "Duke Nukem Manhattan Project", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/duke-nukem-manhattan-project-2.html", "text": "Old gameplay We avoid giving you the storyline of the game, since it is really reduced to a minimum: the duke's usual enemies, the pigs, led by Mech Morphix, have once again appeared in America, ready to fill our women with radioactive bombs. Could our hero ever allow such brutal action towards poor defenseless girls? Obviously not and here he is ready to fragg.... um, kill all the enemies who will have the misfortune to find themselves along his way, saving all (or almost) the very unfortunate puppets. A few minutes of play, less than 3, will be enough to notice how this Manhattan Project definitely winks at the first, historic, episode of the saga, an old-fashioned 2D platformer where jumping and knocking down enemies is the order of the day, just like in the famous Contra saga (Probotector in Europe), developed by Konami; what changes in this product is the graphic sector, made with inevitably three-dimensional graphics but, as mentioned a few lines further up, the gameplay is totally two-dimensional, even if sometimes the virtual cameras will give the impression of being able to move the action of game even in depth. The Duke is able to use different weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, bombs, as well as the classic jetpac, a must for aficionados. Oh yeah, there's always the option to kick those damned pigs, plus the ability to zoom in on the playing area. Between one shootout and another, you will have to give ample demonstration of great jumpers, given that there will be no shortage of platforms, especially those to be reached with the double jump (Revenge Of Shinobi anyone?), as well as expert climbers (on poles attached to the ceiling and anything else), perhaps with a lot of fearsome flames puffing from below or enemies ready to take advantage of this moment of greater vulnerability. Each level is chock full of secret areas which, if found, will reward you with extra weapons, medkits, jectpacs and so on. Some ~puzzles~ obviously could not avoid proposing themselves in this ARUSH Entertainment production, although these are trivial things, such as finding keys or activating switches. Great fun then, aficionados of 2d platformers will have a lot of fun, for sure. Graphics and sound Duke Nukem Manhattan Project requires, as minimum requirements, a P2 350, 64 mb of ram (with Win 9x/ME, 128 with Win 2k/XP) and accelerated video card (but perhaps it was understood these days) with 8 mb of ram. However, the manufacturer recommends a P3 500, 128 mb of ram (198 with Win 2k/XP) and an accelerated card with 192 mb of ram. The undersigned instead indicates a P3 700 with 256 mb of ram and GeForce 2 the ideal PC for the maximum performance obtainable with this fun platform, with the PC used for the test (P3 933, 256 mb of ram and GeForce 3 Titanium 200), yes could also enable Anti Aliasing, as the Transform & Lighting functions of the GeForce have consistently reduced the processor workload. It is also possible to play using Direct 3d or Open GL. The level of detail is very good (even with the zoom), the backdrops vary from sufficient to well done; flames, explosions, gas leaks and other special effects are decidedly remarkable, the sprites are made in a discreet way, even if the variety is not the master here. The music is decidedly mediocre, after a few minutes you will hate it; thumbs up for the great sound effects, great quality in most situations. The sample of digitized sentences of our favorite tamarro disappoints a miccino, both for the acting that is far from convincing (in the prequel it was one of the strengths of the game), and for the phrasebook, far from rich. Conclusions Duke Nukem Manhattan Project is a fun platformer, with well-calibrated difficulty and more than fair longevity, provided, of course, that you don't play 5 hours a day, on pain of solving everything in a short time. From this point of view, the statistics at the end of each level that indicate how many pigs you forgot to send to the creator and how many secret rooms you didn't visit help a lot. Normal graphics and sound, but not for this reason contemptible, on the contrary, they complete the picture of what 3dRealms would like, that is a surrogate, of excellent workmanship, for heaven's sake, waiting for Duke Nukem Forver ..... assuming it really comes out. In the meantime, take a look at this fun platformer with roots perhaps from other times, but with the fun, fortunately, very present. The Return of the Duke E3 2002 has now passed, showing, without any denial, that the PC video game market is still ~alive and kicking~; in fact, although very important titlesimi like Devil May Cry 2, Castlevania Harmony Of Dissonance and Virtua Fighter 4 we will hardly see them attract us from our trusty monitors, with big hits of the caliber of Doom 3 (jawbreaker, to say the least), Neverwinter Nights, Unreal Episode 2 and others , there's no good reason to stop upgrading our trusty computers and get excited about great gaming productions. A confirmation, however negative, comes from 3d Realms, the software house that years ago gave birth to the fantastic Duke Nukem 3d, a very funny first person shooter, full of touches of class scattered everywhere and a sense of humor which seasoned perfectly what would become one of the most acclaimed games in history, still in the hearts of millions of gamers today (complete with a fast approaching conversion for Game Boy Advance). The sequel to this game has been awaited for years, that Duke Nukem Forever (initially driven by the graphics engine of Quake 2, then that of Unreal) which promises to bring a breath of fresh air to the world of first person shooters, not made a fine show of itself within the most important video game fair ever, leaving all of us sadly discouraged, given that we are talking about a wait that has lasted for about 5 years. . So what to do? To forget it? Shall we throw out all the posters of the duke kicking the damned pigs ass with beautiful women ready to worthily reward (err..) the hero about to save them? Duke Nukem Manhattan Project is a fun 3d-looking but hard-hearted 2d platformer that wants nothing more than...to entertain you; forget all the spin offs of the main saga, all those more or less silly platforms seen on PC, Nintendo 64 and Playstation, this is a video game that must be played .... and, soon, we tell you the reasons.", "date": "2002-07-02", "grade": null}
