Our dear Mr Onions thinks so, and he usually goes by bike to do the shopping every morning. On his way, however, he often finds obstacles that can cause him big problems, overturning the bike basket in which he keeps the baguette, the piece of cheese and the ever-present apple he just bought. Our task is to help him return home safe and sound, expenses included, through twenty very short but gradually more complex and full of pitfalls internships. The game control system uses both the accelerometer built into the Apple device and the touch screen. To control the protagonist of the game, therefore, we have to tilt the iPhone left or right so that its weight affects the rear or front of the bike, then touch the areas of the screen in the lower left and lower right respectively to brake and accelerate. Obstacle race As a good exponent of the arcade genre, Mr Onions boasts a truly immediate and essential gameplay, which however at the same time requires a certain patience and a good level of precision. The two-dimensional context in which the character moves, aboard his inseparable bicycle, is in fact regulated by a far from negligible ~inertia factor~, capable of transforming accelerations and braking into potentially dangerous situations, with the bike it can topple forward or backward. The point is not so much to be able not to fall (which turns out to be quite simple), but to ensure that the three objects contained in the basket (precisely bread, cheese and fruit) remain where they are and are not thrown on the ground. In fact, each internship can be completed in the time we want and cross the finish line unscathed, but you must necessarily do it with all the shopping still in place or you will not be able to access the next level. The situations that alternate within each challenge are increasingly complex: at the beginning you simply have to overcome ramps and adjust the speed of the bike so that it doesn't take too many jolts, while later on things get much more difficult, with obstacles of different shape which inevitably cause a kickback on our fragile vehicle. Particularly noteworthy are the windmills, present from a certain point onwards, with the character climbing on the moving blades and therefore requiring continuous adjustments to maintain balance. The problem is that the three objects that make up Mr Onions' shopping cannot in any way be recovered if even just one of them comes out of the basket, so the gaming experience soon turns into a rapid sequence of targeted trials and errors to memorize the pitfalls present in each location in order to be able to act accordingly. The technical characterization of the game clearly recalls a certain ~trash~ aesthetic and presents us with a bizarre and essential character, who moves within deliberately rough and repetitive scenarios. The background music accompanies the action in a nice and unobtrusive way, while not remaining in the lead after the game. The controls immediately appear quite precise and reliable, with the inclination of the iPhone which produces instantaneous and well controllable reactions, as well as a punctual response of the touch screen to every touch.
