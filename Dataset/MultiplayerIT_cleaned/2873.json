You are indeed in 1985, and the Commander '85 review talks about your days, spent between playing a video game and exploring the external network through the modem with which the new computer is equipped. The goal of The Moonwals' work is undoubtedly to tickle the strings of all the nostalgics linked to the 80s, pulling into it elements from many of the works created in that period. The main source of inspiration is how we are about to see Wargames, a film that has entered the collective imagination for its cold war scenario unleashed by a kid with a PC. But the film with Matthew Broderick represents only one of the many references with which Commander '85 tries to immerse the player in the atmosphere of those times long gone, putting here and there a few quotes that the most attentive will not struggle to grasp. Sitting in front of our computer, we were therefore busy for a few days dealing with the phantom Commander '85, to write the review of this title funded on Kickstarter. The plot: war games As already anticipated, the story told by Commander '85 is very close to that of the film Wargames, accompanying it with some elements related to the classics of the period that appears in the name of the effort of The Moonwals. The protagonist is a teenager who spends most of his days locked up in his bedroom, busy using his new computer, getting absorbed by its artificial intelligence to the point of even skipping school. One of the first operations we are called to perform with our Commander '85 is to enter the school server to alter the attendance register data, before realizing that something is not going the right way. In fact, a dangerous virus manages to penetrate the system, not even allowing the boy to force the reset or shutdown operations of the machine. Over time, the malicious program will repeatedly attempt to take full possession of the computer's processing power, even using it to break into government computer systems and unleash a nuclear war. The primary objective therefore becomes that of trying in every way to slow down the effect of the software, resorting to some strategems to subtract system resources from the virus. At the same time the boy must try to understand what happened and what continues to happen around this mysterious Commander '85, with the help of a couple of friends reached through the ever-present walkie-talkie. Three different endings give the adventure a minimum of replayability, but it must be said that the plot runs on largely predictable tracks, without giving the player particularly significant moments. The Gameplay: Hacking 101 Commander '85 includes a short initial phase in which the player can familiarize himself with the computer and its system commands, installing games from floppy disks and interacting with artificial intelligence. Whoever is in front of the screen is therefore called to all effects and purposes to use a PC within a PC, typing commands from their own keyboard to feed them to the protagonist's Commander '85 and thus perform various types of operations. For example, you can control active processes, possibly using the kill command to force them to close, or connect to remote computers where you can use hacking techniques to access login-protected data. The terminology of Commander '85 draws liberally from the IT environment of the real world, for example also putting us in front of the contents of the /etc/shadow files of the systems we are attacking with passwords to be decrypted by hand, or alternatively through an attack in brute force. To be better appreciated, Commander '85 therefore requires a minimum of technical knowledge and a habit of working with command prompts, thanks to which the player can avoid getting lost among the many options at his disposal. There is actually a simplified mode that allows you to access the list of commands that can be given to the operating system at any time, but often you still need to refer to the user manual to understand what is correctly interpreted by the prompt. Most of the dynamics concern the use of Commander '85, with a surrounding environment therefore intended to act more as a side dish than as a real element of the game. It is still necessary to take the walkie-talkie from time to timeto communicate with friends, organizing their moves both in the real world and in the virtual one with short dialogues. Staying all this time closed in the room in front of the computer will attract the attention of the protagonist's mother, who on various occasions will open the door to try to get him off his desk by assigning him some tasks. In addition to reminding us of the times when all this possibly happened to us, this aspect of the game shouldn't be underestimated: if we don't listen to the mother, she will in fact punish us, preventing us from using Commander '85, thus risking the virus gaining precious time. gameplay terms Commander '85 perhaps suffers from wanting to take itself a little too seriously at times, thus placing an important barrier for those who, as we said, are not accustomed to certain aspects of computer science. There are also too many downtimes to which we are subjected to wait for the occurrence of an event that will keep the adventure going. Graphics and sound: shadows and lights From a graphic point of view, Commander '85 certainly does not cry out for a miracle, above all due to textures that are in some cases not very detailed and some missing animations that make the few characters we see rather clumsy. The real problem, however, is linked to a general feeling of lack of optimization, which culminates in an annoying bug that causes the elements on the protagonist's desk to remain glued in his hands, thus preventing any subsequent action from taking place. The only solution is to save your game and go back to the main menu to reload your save, thus finding the object correctly placed with the possibility of continuing. We add the presence of a not very intuitive interface, which with its use of mouse and keyboard ends up confusing the player instead of directing him towards the action he would like to perform. most guessed aspect of Commander '85: the presence of some songs with sounds strictly related to the 80s is in fact the aspect that best allows the player to immerse himself in the atmosphere of the game, using the radio located in the protagonist's room to listen to the excellent songs that make up the soundtrack.", "date": "2020-09-30", "grade": "4.5"}
