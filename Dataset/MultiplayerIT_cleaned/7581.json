{"name": "Traffico satellitare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/123918-real-world-racing-traffico-satellitare.html", "text": "The genre of top-down driving games certainly has a large number of admirers, whether they are nostalgic or simply people who enjoy a certain type of challenge. It is a trend that by now has said it all, yet probably no one had ever thought of making it more interesting by working on the scenarios in a certain way, or by using satellite footage to create settings that are faithful to reality, with a design that is plausible because it is actually ~true~. of curves and straights that could be those of any car competition with an urban background. This is the bet of Playstos Entertainment, an all-Italian team that with Real World Racing wanted to bring this type of experience to PC in an affordable package (11.99 euros on Gamersgate, 12.99 on Greenmangaming, hoping to succeed to also land on Steam), characterized by a considerable amount of tracks (over fifty) and cars (over eighty), the latter inspired by really existing models. The idea behind Real World Racing is fascinating, but its practical application let us down Matter of feeling Using the keyboard or the fully supported Xbox 360 controller, Real World Racing allows you to play a quick game in arcade mode, access online multiplayer (with matches for up to sixteen players, but challengers are hard to find at the moment), or devote himself to the core of the game, his career. Made up of six increasingly complex ~leagues~, which start from a series of driving tests and go all the way up to tournaments for professionals, this mode offers a series of pre-set cars which unfortunately are not the best in terms of speed and acceleration, but which can soon be replaced by more performing models to be purchased in the appropriate shop, using the credits earned with each victory. As it is easy to imagine, balance is essential in a driving game and even more so if it is a top-down racer, so the developers have tried to limit the differences between one car and another to avoid to make the races too easy. The point is, however, that this attitude has not produced great advantages, effectively making the vehicles excessively similar to each other and reducing the differences to nuances that can only be appreciated in certain situations. The behavior on the road also seemed very peculiar to us, with the cars acquiring great lateral acceleration when launched into corners, to the detriment of a drifting maneuver which most of the time proves to be counterproductive (although making us earn some money, given that the tricks are rewarded) and completely losing acceleration at the moment of any impact, as if the driver does not know how to downshift. Unfortunately, this has an enormous weight on the gameplay, because in practice a minimal mistake is enough to make a performance that was perfect up to that moment fail. Here too the choices relating to balance have to do with it: the opponents are too fast, the checkpoints are too distant, the lap times are too tight. In short, the challenge, instead of gradually increasing, immediately seems to be shot at the ball and then kept constant throughout his career. The satellite problem The Real World Racing control system is very simple and immediate, and the game allows you to select a fixed or rotating view with respect to your car (but the graphics options stop there: the title runs at 720p without further adjustments), which distinguishes itself from the others in the competition thanks to a sort of fairly plausible ~neon effect~. The problem, in most cases, is represented precisely by what is the peculiarity of this production, or rather the satellite maps. Some work has been done on the photos, adding polygonal elements and lighting effects that give the scenery some personality, but there are just too many practical problems with such a solution unless it is modified in favor of the visibility and practicality. Let's try to explain ourselves better: often the roads in which we compete are surrounded by trees whose branches occupy part of the track, reducing its visibility and putting the user in difficulty because he cannot know which elements produce an impact and which do not. In other cases, the streets are instead narrower than themselves, and bouncing from one obstacle to another unfortunately does not benefit us as in Gran Turismo, but rather produces the slowdown we mentioned earlier and an almost certain defeat, given that it is practically impossible to recover the lost ground. In general, then, the ~split~ aspect of the contours of the roofs of the buildings does not create a good thingeffect, indeed contributes to a feeling of poor definition. If we also add a far from excellent realization of the cars, which are unable to ~blend in~ with the surrounding environment and indeed stand out like foreign bodies, the picture is not the best. In short, the idea of satellite maps was interesting but used in this way it seemed counterproductive.", "date": "2013-10-03", "grade": "6.0"}
