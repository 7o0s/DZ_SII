Their latest effort came out of the Early Access phase on May 29 after several months of testing and we at Multiplayer were able to get to work right away. There are so many things changed compared to the original title that defining it as a simple sequel would be an understatement. The most obvious aspect obviously concerns the Blancpain GT license, a category perhaps still little known but endowed with great charm: therefore a small summary is in order for those who do not know what we are dealing with. We are talking about a championship conceived by the organization of gentleman driver Stephane Ratel (majority shareholder of the old Pirelli World Challenge) and officially supported by the FIA, which governs the technical regulations. Gran Turismo cars homologated according to GT3 specifications are admitted and it unfolds among ten historic European tracks, equally divided into Sprint and Endurance events. In the first two races are held, preceded by the respective qualifying sessions, lasting one hour each; the latter, on the other hand, take place in 3 hours, with the exception of the one at Paul Ricard in France (6 hours) and the queen event of the calendar, the 24 hours of Spa. Obviously, the game allows for the widest customization, so you can set shorter periods. Where to start? Kunos' title offers numerous modes. The most emphasized is the Career, where you start by entering the Lamborghini talent program which in practice is a brilliant tutorial. After a welcome presentation given by general Mirko Bortolotti (winner of the 2017 championship) three free practice sessions must be completed on the Brianza track: the first in optimal conditions, the second in the rain and the last at night. Depending on the times obtained, the computer will suggest the level of difficulty and the driving aids; you then proceed to select one of the available cars and form your own team, which also requires you to create a second and third driver. In fact, the Blancpain GT foresees that each of the sprint races is contested by two drivers, who have to take turns during the mandatory pit-stop whose window opens after about half time; in endurance competitions, three drivers must take turns driving the vehicle at the end of each hour of competition. By obtaining important placements it is therefore possible to arouse the interest of the most famous teams in order to finally be able to write one's name alongside that of Mirko Bortolotti and Raffaele Marciello, another excellence of Made in Italy as well as reigning champion of the category . This mode, which should represent the flagship of the single player, didn't excite us that much: it almost seems to have been placed there as an enhanced version of the Championship, but it doesn't have dynamics like those seen, for example, in the counterparts of Codemasters in F1. The single-player offer is completed by the classic Practice, the Single Race (in which you can choose the track and sessions to take part in) and five pre-set scenarios in which to try to overcome the objectives set by the programmers, challenging the stopwatch in hotlap, hotsint and Superpole. 300 Spartans Anyone who comes from Assetto Corsa knows that one of the strengths of that title, in addition of course to the driving model, was the vast fleet of cars fleshed out over time through DLCs released on a regular basis. In Competizione, the roster was inevitably reduced to the Gran Turismo cars that took part in the 2018 GT championship: we are talking about 13 cars in total. The names that count, however, are all there: Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, Jaguar, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Honda, Nissan, Lexus, McLaren, Bentley and Aston Martin. Even the tracks, despite being only 10, are among the most iconic in the history of motorsport: Monza, Misano, Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Hungaroring, Zolder, Paul Ricard, Barcelona, Nurburgring and the aforementioned Spa-Francorchamps, by far the most loved in online matches. Assetto Corsa Competizione offers two servers for multiplayer: the public one has no limitations and anyone can host a custom game or join an ongoing session, naturally before the red lights go out. The competitive one prevents you from joining if the qualifications have already started and above all requires that the player is in possession of a certain evaluation, necessary to keep the level of the challenge high. This allows us to deepen the profile of the pilot, whose total rating(unfortunately it is not yet possible to compare it with that of other users) is provided by seven categories, such as knowledge of the track, constancy in obtaining always similar laps, skill in not losing control of the car, prudence in avoiding collisions with other cars. All values that are updated as you run, regardless if against the CPU or other people, by the unquestionable judgment of the computer. Fast and furious Let's now focus on the focus of Kunos' game, namely the driving model. It is clear from the first lap of the track with the Lamborghini Huracan Super Trofeo that Assetto Corsa Competizione is configured as a real simulation, capable of putting even professional drivers to the test with the right settings. The work done by the proprietary physics engine is excellent and you can see it right from the pit exit, when you understand that you can't be too aggressive on the curbs because the tires are not yet in the right window and only after one or two warm-up laps manage to provide maximum adherence; in the same way, always being too impetuous when braking can lead to overheating of the brakes with the need to lift your foot to let them breathe before being able to push again. The mass of cars is there and feels perfectly; the handling of each GT3 is characterized with maniacal care and the differences in the change of direction in the Ascari style between a Bentley Continental and a Ferrari 488 are noticeable even by the less experienced user in terms of simulations. In the pits you can get your hands on an endless number of parameters, such as the incidence of the rear wing or the inclination of the front spoiler; the stiffness of the springs, the camber of the tires, the mapping of the ECU, the travel of the shock absorbers, verifying with the telemetry how the modifications affect the wear of the tires and the lap time. Only professionals will be able to juggle it immediately, while simple enthusiasts will be able to start with more basic modifications (such as the height of the front end or the distribution of braking) to appreciate how the slightest change translates into a significant change in the behavior of the car . Obviously, in order to enjoy so much good things properly, you need a steering wheel, even better than a dedicated workstation. However, the programmers have also included joypad support: in this way the title becomes usable as long as you activate some aids, such as traction control, and set the view on the nose of the car (or on the asphalt), but the difference between the two devices remains marked and assessable in terms of lap time. We did the litmus test on a technically affordable track like Monza, again using the tutorial from the Lamborghini Youngster Programme. Our best lap obtained on the Huracan with the Xbox pad was 1.58, while holding the Logitech G920 it dropped, with the same trim, by about a second and a half. However, the times remained well above those of the CPU, which nonchalantly dished out a 1.53, but the humiliation was a little more contained. We are all Muhammad Ali Thus we arrive at the analysis of artificial intelligence, which can take on any value between 80 and 100. In the latter case, get ready to face real war machines that are almost never wrong and have lap times worthy of the Lewis Hamilton's hammer time: in order to compete at this level, you really need a track handler. Aggressiveness can also be set on the same scale: however, we recommend avoiding extremes because the adversaries go from being the waters of the Red Sea that open when Moses passes to real kamikazes, capable of letting for candid virgin also the ~old~ Versbatten. On the other hand, sensational accidents between drivers controlled by the CPU are rarely seen, and they occur above all in the rear, at the beginning or at the end of the first two laps, when the group is still compact. The computer is also a very severe judge when it comes to evaluating the player's driving style: sometimes passing a wheel over a curb (as can happen in the second Lesmo, or at the Eau Rouge exit) causes the cancellation of the round; still others, a simple correction coming out of a chicane is seen as a driving error and forces you to repeat the lap to get a better consistency score. Wasted Youth Up to now we have talked about a simulator that every enthusiast should have in their library, but we cannot overlook some defects which, at present, make the experience not always pleasant. Let's goor from the graphical interface which, despite having been made more user-friendly compared to Assetto Corsa, is still a bit cumbersome and requires the use of the mouse in order to be managed quickly. Some bugs force you to repeat selections: for example, exiting the car selection screen for a single race we happened to find ourselves in the multiplayer lobby; in other cases the changes made to driving aids have not been implemented; certain menus have not yet been translated and joypad key mapping is not allowed. Nothing particularly dramatic when compared with the real big problem of Competizione, namely the stability of the servers. In a sample of 10 games started we were able to complete less than half of them, and in one of these the hud had completely disappeared: we ran for twenty minutes waiting for the engineer to inform us of the arrival of the last lap, without knowing either the position occupied, or the gap from direct opponents, or the fuel level. In most cases, however, we encountered crashes: sometimes an error window appeared, others the title was released directly to the desktop, in a couple of cases the PC crashed and it was necessary to restart it with the power button . The problems appear randomly during the race weekend: sometimes while taking to the track for free practice, others just a few laps from the end. You can imagine the frustration of seeing the motionless screen after spending an entire race in third position just seconds from finishing in place: situations that are obviously not acceptable. Beautiful despite everything The impression is that there is a problem on the server side, given that in some moments of the day (around 7 in the morning for example) things seemed to run more smoothly. To this we add other complaints not personally verified but collected during the chats: the momentary lack of support for the triple monitor, the poor quality of the VR version, some blocks in the Career and Championship modes that force you to restart from the last save (these last flaws happened also during our rehearsals). Despite everything the online races are memorable; as previously mentioned, the most popular track is Spa, where the driver's ability is given maximum prominence, but Monza also fares well in the classifications of preference. More than pure speed, which is still the fundamental aspect if you want to aim for first place, continuity and concentration count a lot in Assetto Corsa Competizione, given that a small distraction can end with a spin and several seconds of advantage gone up in smoke. The Grands Prix against other real opponents, unlike the offline ones, are a riot of yellow flags, with the result that we race up to the last corner with hands shaking in the hope that whoever is in front of us will make some mistakes ( and often happens). Even defending one's position (we have always found very correct opponents) becomes a game of nerves. Try holding off a Mercedes for a couple of laps (even in this category they excel) much faster than you and you will be able to get an idea of what Hamilton and Ricciardo have been through for over an hour in the last two years at Montecarlo. First person driving We have arrived at one of the most talked about choices of this production, namely the abandonment of the proprietary graphics engine in favor of Unreal Engine 4. A very versatile software that does not disdain automotive competitions (we had also seen it at work in DAKAR 18 ), although it was developed with other genres in mind. The step forward compared to Assetto Corsa is evident, it is useless to go over it: the level of detail has increased considerably and climatic factors, such as rain, nightfall or the shadows of the trees projected on the track which disturb the view, add a further dose of realism (and difficulty). The tracks border on photorealism and have been reproduced down to the smallest detail, such as the small bumps that lead to the Elf curve in Barcelona, or the various types of asphalt at Brands Hatch. Everything is then processed by the physics engine and returned in the form of force feedback through the steering wheel; even the marbles that form when the GT3 passes off the ideal trajectory are present and temporarily modify the grip of the car that passes over them. A fabulous audio compartment stands out in this technical magnificence: the sound of the 600 horsepower racing cars deserves to be listened to at maximum volume, even better if with headphones. What about the other noises, such as the crackling of pebbles collected in an off-piste excursion that are ejected or the contact of the bottom of the", "date": "2019-06-03", "grade": "8.5"}
