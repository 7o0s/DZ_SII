{"name": "Col piede a tavoletta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72996-driver-col-piede-a-tavoletta.html", "text": "The job of undercover cops is tough, and Tanner knows something about it: his being a former professional pilot makes him the perfect man for the kind of dirty jobs that are popular in the city, and so it is easy for him to get ~hired~. by some criminal boss to spy on their movements and create the conditions for a large-scale raid. The main mode of the game, re-proposed on iPhone and iPod Touch by Gameloft, sees us face a series of stages in which we have to act as couriers, transport ~hot stuff~ or escort people belonging to the gang. In a nutshell, this basically translates into moving from one area of the city to another, stopping at the places indicated on the screen in time to complete the mission. A timer forces us to proceed at increasingly high speeds, but at the same time we must pay attention to the police patrols, who will not hesitate to give chase if they see us exceeding the limits. In the end, being chased becomes practically the norm, the important thing is to find the right starting point to lose the cops and lose track of us in time to make the delivery on duty. Something new... Driver therefore returns to the scene and does it brilliantly, adding a series of extra challenges to the original missions of the PSone version that revolve around the various situations that we will face during the story: chases, escorts, stakeouts, etc. The graphics of the game have been adapted to the times, as well as to the standards of the Apple device, and so we have a decidedly richer polygonal count compared to the 1999 original, more detailed cars, a greater number of elements to characterize the city districts and a frame smooth and stable rate. Too bad only for the characters that we see occasionally moving from one vehicle to another (really angular and with poor quality animation), as well as for the damage system of our car, far from spectacular. Nothing to say as regards the sound, however: at the top of the screen there is a selector that allows us to change the radio station among those available, each ~themed~, and the dialogues (in English) appear well recited. The atmosphere of the 70s was made to perfection, in short. ...and something old The problems of this new incarnation of Driver lie mostly in the control system. Driving using the accelerometer, i.e. tilting the iPhone to the right and left, is impractical and not very precise: there is a certain latency from the moment in which our solicitation starts to when the car changes direction on the screen, and this is difficult to marries with the need to make maneuvers at the last second, such as when you're in the middle of a chase. The virtual d-pad behaves much better, but by its very nature it presents itself as a ~piecemeal~ solution, which prevents us from maintaining a smooth ride or using the handbrake (unless you manage to press both appropriate buttons on the touch screen at the same time). Furthermore, the position of the button relating to the turbo is completely wrong and leads to unwanted curves rather than rocket starting. The results in terms of frustration are easily imaginable.
