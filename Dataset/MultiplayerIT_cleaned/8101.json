{"name": "Moss: Book 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moss-book-2-recensione.html", "text": "Fairy tale, adventure and action can coexist in virtual reality: Polyarc already demonstrated this to us four years ago, with the first book by Moss. The boys from Seattle were exceptional in crafting a title capable of capturing, transporting far, but at the same time entertaining both adults and children, provided you want to put - which is theoretically forbidden - a helmet on a child's head. Anticipating a After what you will read, we confirm that yes, we are facing another center of Americans who fearlessly throw their hearts over the obstacle and repackage an exciting, pure, candid but fun journey, practically able to double the first book and project the little mouse Quill into what is now akin to a small virtual reality franchise. If you have PlayStation VR and we've intrigued you enough, find out with us why you should add this title to your wishlist in our review of Moss: Book 2 for PlayStation VR. Quest against the Arcanum A new adventure awaits Quill in Moss: Book 2 Quill's new adventures begin where the first book ends: having defeated Sarffog and recovered his uncle, it is finally time to challenge the Beyonder, the archenemy, the supreme evil. Quill has never lost heart: she didn't do it in the first epic, short but full of emotions, she won't do it now, determined more than ever to listen to our advice and overcome the varied environmental puzzles together. Moss: Book 2 takes us back to an enchanted land, with the aim of recovering the crystal necessary to fight the enemy and does so with all the grace and sweetness that characterize the anthropomorphic mouse. New characters, situations, expressions, ideas and enemies make their appearance, enriching that design, childish in expression but mature in conception, which is Moss: Book 2. Aware of the potential success of this sequel, Polyarc has wisely chosen to take time and calmly develop a product that would take the reader by the hand again and accompany him on a journey about twice as long as the previous one, provided that you also find the collectibles hidden here and there. The hope is that this second book can be read by even more players and thus carry on the franchise, full of increasingly mature potential in its artistic and playful expression. This time there are three The team has wisely chosen to enlarge the game formula, making the progress much less repetitive than in the first chapter Fortunately, Moss' form hasn't changed: on the one hand we have Quill's movements, on the other our virtual self who observes, helps, solves puzzles, controls enemies. Only this time to the relative simplicity of the moveset of the sword of the first book, Polyarc triples the weapons by adding hammer and chakram, which translated reads: medium speed weapon, slow but powerful weapon and fast ranged weapon, useful for keeping fauna at bay hostile more or less resistant, more or less rapid that stands between us and the objective, but that's not all. The Seattle team could not limit itself to mere use in combat, therefore - as per good Nintendian tradition - each weapon carries characteristics useful for solving environmental puzzles. Creating a copy with the hammer, breaking parts of the scenery with the chakram, taking shots to overcome otherwise insurmountable abysses: it is clear that the team did not want to go too far in instrumental complexity, but if nothing else, the playful palette of Book 2 is more varied than the first episode, perhaps the victim of a bit of basic repetitiveness. Advancing through the world of Moss is therefore more fun, varied and perhaps satisfying thanks also to a refresh given not so much to the enemies, but to the way in which the reader's possession works, guaranteeing a certain diversity to some interesting and less trivial playful situations than the expected. The relationship with the DualShock is generally good and responsive: the management of the inputs has been slightly refined and the radiant flower-like menu is a nice find of style, even if not very comfortable given the change frequency. Even some elements related to controlling the player action globe aren't as responsive as we'd like - not so much at first, but later on as the do's and don'ts start to build in volume. Nothing unplayable, but they are those touches of class in the refinement that perhaps Polyarc will improve in a possible third chapter. A book of fairy tales The artistic inspiration, the choice of colors and textures take Quill on an even more satisfying journey for the eyes Moss: Book 2 brings a nice improvement to environments, inspiration and geometry of our helmet. Polyarc's new work is even more beautiful to see at firstperson, experience it through our heads savoring every corner of the storybook world designed by the team. Forest, medieval, snowy environments, the fantasy of the textbook fairy tale has no boundaries: the game environments have been designed with skill and passion, adding details, colors and filling scenes with very appreciable little touches of class. Moss: Book 2 is in excellent shape, perhaps also thanks to the greater familiarity with the Sony hardware involved and the desire to continually amaze with more sophisticated play structures than the first book, almost metroidvania, therefore also more interesting to study, albeit sometimes confusing. The team also honed their expression shaping skills, granting Quill and the supporting cast personalities, a nice fairytale warmth continuously transmitted through the looks and faces of the little mouse. The same thing cannot be said of the enemies, certainly made - and understandably - with less painstaking care in the animation park.", "date": "2022-04-06", "grade": "8.7"}
