He practically never stares into the eyes of the interviewer, but he runs away with his gaze, nervously observing the corners of the room in which he is and constantly giving the impression of thinking of something else. This man with an awkward demeanor and good face, however, is in all probability the living demonstration of how enormous nonsense Lombroso's theories were (perhaps excluding only the connections between genius and madness): from his mind came titles whose imaginary at times it would startle the most disturbed of individuals, and all within structures even more twisted than the worlds where this vision develops. It may be precisely for this reason that the arrival of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice surprised everyone a bit, and gave birth to too many unpleasant Internet mutterings: a title set in feudal Japan with a ninja as a protagonist seemed too simple for someone like the good Hidetaka and for From Software, so much so as to have suggested a secondary role, or even a direction in name but not in fact, actually entrusted to someone else within the well-known development team. Well, after dozens of hours playing this game, countless deaths, and more than one hard to describe experience, we can assure you that the rumors were totally unfounded. Sekiro is a game that proudly bears the signature of Hidetaka Miyazaki, and respects all the canons that one might now expect from a From Software work, with however a long list of enormous differences that leads it to significantly detach itself from the subset of ~Souls~ as it is commonly understood. We want to explain to you why all this is a great thing in this review, but also to warn you, because the video game we are talking about is not a tame animal, nor with a totally impeccable pedigree. A story surrounded by fog Anyone who decides to tackle Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice will find waiting for him an experience nourished by the same minerals that give sustenance to all the other works of From. The stylistic code of the software house and the director is immediately recognizable, and a huge number of superstructures are identical re-propositions of ideas already tested with the Souls, starting from an environmental narrative of enormous complexity that must be carefully explored, analyzed and reconstructed to be appreciated fully. However, if on the one hand the game still keeps most of the most interesting elements of its background hidden, the same cannot be said of the main plot, which has never been so clear in a work by Miyazaki (he himself explained that he finally gave to its developers all story elements during development, whereas in earlier works it tended to keep even them partially in the dark). And it is precisely a pleasant story that of Sekiro, who sees you in the role of a skilled and taciturn shinobi in the service of a young gentleman endowed with a mysterious power; it just doesn't take long before the themes get more raw, and what seemed like a linear epic full of battles turns into something darker and more multifaceted. In short, we see in the adventures of the Wolf and Kuro a strong influence linked to some great seinen manga - Basilisk and The Immortal above all, but they are clearly not the only ones - and to the themes most loved by its author, from the power of blood to the horrid transfiguration of man in search of absolute power. Each event therefore flows with an excellent rhythm, and the general plot is enriched by the presence of as many as four different endings (some of which are rather difficult to obtain), and by the maniacal refinement of the setting: a Japan in the midst of the completely ~revised~ Sengoku era in a dark fantasy vein. Sekiro's is once again a wonderfully rich world worthy of being explored, which at times even touches the heights reached with Bloodborne, although it is slightly less fascinating due to its greater clarity. Iron on iron It's not just in the narrative approach but the diversification of this game from what preceded it. In fact, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice immediately makes it clear that it is not a soulslike, thanks to a tutorial phase wittily built to make the player absorb all the main innovations, and allow him to gradually learn the system and its complexities. Right from the start, for example, you will have the opportunity to swim and jump freely, while the absence of weapons will not lead you to a desperate search for an instrument of death with which to defend yourself, but to the use of stealth to avoid enemies and listen their speeches (often full of important clues) from the relative safety of thethe shadow. However, the way of the silent ninja is not the fulcrum of this title, although its importance is undeniable and closely linked to the way certain situations are handled; the combat system is the central element of the production: a set of carefully mixed mechanics that enormously changes the player's approach to dangers, and forces you to discard a good part of the habits acquired by the Souls. In Sekiro there is no stamina but, despite the remarkable speed of movement of your alter ego, trying to approach the game as if it were a Japanese version of Bloodborne represents sure suicide. The beating heart of the entire system is in fact the parade, since Sekiro combines the life point bars with an additional indicator dedicated to ~posture~, and bases the vast majority of his more complex fights around it. More specifically, this is a bar that indicates the breaking of the guard like those found in many fighting games; curiously, however, Sekiro precisely from this genre absorbs its most useful defensive mechanics, which is nothing if not a perfect parry defined here as ~deviation~. To clarify: anyone hit during the guard animation will see their posture rise, regardless of whether it's you or your enemy (and humanoid enemies tend to parry almost any frontal blow); the complete filling of the bar involves an imbalance, which allows you to perform a coup de grace on the opponent and eliminate him instantly. The perfect management of the aforementioned parries is the key to the clashes, since keeping in defense constantly makes one vulnerable, but pressing the guard button the instant in which one is hit does not, and causes one's posture indicator to remain stable while that of the opponent fills up. All this is obviously accompanied by the presence of numerous mini-bosses and bosses with multiple bars of life points, whose patterns must be memorized and contrasted to perfection, and a long series of brilliant techniques and gimmicks that offer multiple options in battle. The many means of the ninja Dodge, in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, is simply not the focus of the defensive mechanics. Positioning and perfect coordination of offensive maneuvers and parries are more important than a leap at the right moment, due to a marked tracking of the opponent's shots, which does not allow you to avoid everything with continuous lateral shots (obviously this is designed precisely to favor the other defensive maneuvers). Dodges and jumps always remain extremely significant, however, due to specific enemy maneuvers - conveniently indicated by a red symbol at the start - which can often only be avoided, or countered with a learnable maneuver called ~Mikiri~ designed to move an enemy lunge if you dodge on him at the time of his attack. As defensive mechanics, therefore, complexity is certainly not lacking in From Software's new baby ... when it comes to offense, however, one certainly does not find oneself without interesting ideas, despite the developers' choice to offer the Wolf a katana base that remains the primary weapon throughout the game. In Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, the variety of transformable weapons or simple moveset of the past this time you will have to look for it in your mechanical arm, an instrument of incredible flexibility, where the From have poured much of the offensive variety of the combat system. In practice, the Shinobi Prosthetic (as it is called), allows you to mount particularly unique gadgets, which require the consumption of readily available (but limited) symbols and offer all kinds of amenities in combat, from flames to shurikens, up to other surprises that we don't want to reveal. The beauty is that all these tools can later be enhanced and modified by the sculptor who donated the arm to you, become choices that can be equipped separately, and offer variable effects against which certain enemies are particularly vulnerable. An almost Zeldian concept, which however we have interpreted as the only distant link to the Tenchu (the series of which in theory Sekiro was initially to be a part of) remained in this product: as in that historic stealth game series, preparation and careful use of tools led to enormous facilitations of otherwise extremely difficult levels, here using the right gadgets at the right time can make the difference, and guarantee the overcoming of opponents who initially seem insurmountable. Given the monstrous difficulty of the game, it really is worth keeping highly in consideration these factors. Ultra hard difficulty: Git gud We are not exaggerating in calling the difficulty of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice ~monstrous~. With this title From Software seem to have shown their true face, and it is an austere and immovable face, which stares defiantly at the player. Even the Souls, who were already more than well done in malice, pale in front of this video game, since the adventures of the Wolf do not offer simplifications, and the possibilities of circumventing the difficulty depend only on your ingenuity, never really canceling it. There is no cooperative here, no one can accompany you against a boss, and it is not even possible to bet everything on the experience and the enhancement of the protagonist, since the game is an action game with much less marked RPG elements, and the growth of statistics only depends from two types of objects obtainable by defeating the bosses (and sometimes, rarely, in rather hidden maps). The skill points and the money that are obtained by eliminating enemies in bursts obviously help, yet they allow first of all to obtain improvements to the prostheses (which require rather rare materials for the most devastating modifications) or techniques that still need to be mastered to be truly effective ( there are some passives, but mostly it concerns the validity of the cures and the power of the techniques just mentioned). You will die, and even the best Souls veterans won't be excused from constant visits to the creator. To further underline the demonic soul of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, From then saw fit to make all the bosses damage monsters, in most cases able to eliminate the player with two, maximum three hits. This creature by Miyazaki and his cohorts is therefore a brutal test by fire, and it is incredible to see to what extent, once replayed from scratch, it manages to change the entire mentality of those who face it, transforming opponents who previously seemed invincible into challenges almost negligible once their initial impact has been disposed of and your reflexes trained properly. In some ways Sekiro operates in those who play it a transformation similar to the one Demon's Souls was able to apply in the launch period: it completely changes the user's approach to video games, forcing him to patiently adapt to a new and punishing system, for an extremely more hardcore level than one can normally conceive in similar products. The entire game campaign has a gradual nature linked to forced progression blocks - it can be partially eliminated by obtaining a specific object, but we are talking about an incredibly convoluted alternative that can only be obtained once the story has progressed - and does not make discounts of any kind . There is, down to earth, no other way to advance than to observe the behavior of the bosses, formulate a valid tactic and apply it to perfection. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is, ultimately, a title already set to ultra hard, a completely crazy product for the modern video game market, and designed to be appreciated almost exclusively by that niche of users who can tolerate dozens of failures to enjoy that single moment of exaltation brought about by overcoming a terrible foe. Many will abandon him almost immediately for his cruelty, but it is precisely this madness that makes him great for anyone else. Gameplay and stealth in particular If the combat system is in our opinion promoted with flying colors, the same cannot however be said of every single element of the gameplay of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and in particular of the stealth we discussed at the beginning of the review. As already mentioned, it is certainly not the soul of the experience but it is still an important element, and although it works great as a mechanic to quickly eliminate certain difficult enemies or facilitate exploration, it seemed to us in general rather crude, too dedicated to quick kills, and exploited to the bare minimum. We're not joking, there is only one specific phase of the game where stealth is pushed to the limit, during which it is demonstrated without the possibility of appealing how From has programmed the enemies' artificial intelligence to react separately to the sight of the Wolf or to the noise it causes when moving on the map. Yet, while roaming the world and eliminating enemies from behind, this system breaks down several times for obscure reasons, and it can happen that an entire group of guards does not react to the elimination of their comrades via shurikens from a few meters away. or conversely ignore your passing in the immediate vicinity, and then magically wake up when there is a racket on the other side of the map.
