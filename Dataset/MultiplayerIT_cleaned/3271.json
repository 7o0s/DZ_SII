Let's relegate nostalgia to a separate box and focus instead on an unprecedented reinterpretation of Ian Livingstone's classic. For the uninitiated, in fact, Deathtrap Dungeon is first and foremost a game book, written by the co-founder of Games Workshop and former honorary president of Square Enix Europe. The multifaceted British businessman published the sixth volume of the Fighting Fantasy series (known by us as Adventure Size), back in 1984, enjoying considerable success. Now it's Branching Narrative's turn to take us back to the terrible labyrinths scattered in the subsoil of Fang, the town in which the adventure is set. Exceptional Dungeon Master Playing the role of landlord is Eddie Marsan, a Hollywood star (albeit of British origin) who we recently saw in Deadpool 2 and Hobbs & Shaw, but the list of films in which he took part is truly incredible (we only mention Gangs Of New York, V for Vendetta, Sherlock Holmes, Atomic Blonde). Seated on a worn red armchair, in a perfect location for a role-playing evening (a stove from which comes the crackling of burning wood, old suitcases arranged on a table), the actor shows off his mastery by following the camera with a penetrating gaze and interpreting the pages with theatrical tones; all this helps to capture the attention of the player who is enraptured as if he were sitting in the stalls during a pice. Deathtrap Dungeon therefore looks like a real Full Motion Videogame, like the ones that were fashionable about thirty years ago, even if in many respects it is similar to Hand Of Fate, with the difference that the cards are replaced by dice. At certain points in the narrative we are called to make decisions (participate in a battle, open a door, choose which path to take). The crossroads are numerous and each of them corresponds to a save point from which to start again without forcibly repeating the whole plot from the beginning. A map that is constantly updated allows you to visually focus the path, helping the player in his choices. The many situations of ~uncertainty~ (battles, jumps, dangerous passages) are resolved by rolling two six-sided dice, according to a very quick and intuitive scheme. Then there are potions and rations that allow you to restore the hero's initial values (which can be reduced as a result of falls, wounds, poisoning), just as there is a backpack in which to store objects collected during the adventure that in a second might be useful at the moment. Deathtrap Dungeons (1998) Published in 1998 for PC and PlayStation by Eidos, the first Deathtrap Dungeon was an adventure created by Asylum, a software created specifically for this title which will later turn out to be the only one in its short history. The style of play was reminiscent of another hit by the English publisher, namely Tomb Raider, however the graphics engine was different. At the time, the judgments were penalized by the bizarre control system and by a rather coarse realization of the characters. However, the scenarios (about ten in total), although conditioned by the limited processing power, were very well done. We took it back in hand, after having recovered it for just over a euro from the Humble Bundle store, on the occasion of this test and it helped us to identify ourselves with the Branching Narrative title. The Steam version is exactly the one contained on the CD, therefore it is limited to the archaic 800x600 resolution and has some problems in playing the soundtrack (in the 90s the audio tracks were often played directly from the CD player). Color note: the limited edition released for the Anglo-Saxon market contained the original book, a card game with the characters from the video game and an entrance for two people to the London Dungeon which at the time was still located near London Bridge. Matter of choices Before starting, you can choose one of the three pre-packaged characters (Alric, Loretta or Rasmsus) or create an ad hoc one by deciding, again based on the roll of the dice, the values of Strength, Stamina and Luck. The first item is naturally used during battles: that number is in fact added to the sum of the dice rolled to determine the winner of a battle; the second is the health reserve which allows you to repeat the attacks if the latter should not be successful; luck instead allows csave it in certain complicated situations, but each use of the ~b side~ decreases its value by one unit. As if to say: by dint of playing with fire you get burned. The situations that present themselves to the player are all very engaging: for example, you can choose whether to open a door behind which desperate cries are heard, or whether to approach a mirror that reflects your own deformed image. Certain choices are paid dearly: fortunately, as mentioned, you can quickly resume from the previous checkpoint avoiding the wrong answer. Golden Globes The technical implementation is really accurate: one might think that in a Full Motion Video game there is very little to program (and basically it is), but the Branching Narrative title is embellished with various touches of class. In one of the initial stages we pulled a bell rope: at which point a thunderous boom began to fill the headphones and Eddie himself had to raise his voice to be heard in the midst of that din. There are even some tables that depict a particular situation (the clash between two goblins, smiling faces at the end of a corridor): everything helps to involve the player. Naturally Marsan takes most of the work on his shoulders and, as we anticipated above, he really does it with great style, but more generally, the whole package is packaged with class and elegance. A small oversight is the impossibility of skipping cutscenes during fights: always reviewing the same two or three comments from Marsan with each attack, in the long run, can be a bit repetitive. Deathtrap Dungeon does not include subtitles, not even in English; the only moments in which written text appears occur in correspondence with the choices. Despite the perfect diction, this absence could prove to be a stumbling block for the Italian players. A couple of hours are enough to complete the deadly labyrinth under Fang, but the title deserves to be replayed at least a second time, to be able to appreciate most of the five hours of footage that were shot for the realization of the work.", "date": "2020-02-02", "grade": "7.0"}
