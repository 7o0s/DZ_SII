The problem is attributable to the extreme brevity with which you will complete it (for the more skilled players I recommend starting the game directly from the difficult level since the normal level is decidedly easy) and to the fact that, unlike the recurring trend (started with Warcraft 3), will put us in charge of only one of the warring factions. This aspect definitely leaves a bad taste in the mouth since, in addition to affecting longevity, it takes away the possibility of practicing with each faction and then using it in multiplayer. There is always the possibility of doing the same thing in skirmish mode but undoubtedly a campaign with a story is quite another thing. The single-player campaign, despite the excellent narrative thread that unites the various missions, is definitely the only flaw of the THQ production But, as I have already written, this is the only real flaw of Dawn of War since otherwise it is a title that borders on perfection. The most exciting aspect is undoubtedly the actual gameplay. The essence of Warhammer 40,000 is based on the frenzy of action and a fundamental tactical component to bring home the three points Leaving aside what are the elements in common with the vast majority of RTSs, the innovations brought about by Relic primarily concern how we can acquire resources. Very simple to explain: in each map we will find places called ~strategic points~ that we will have to conquer and maintain (also through the construction of fortifications) to have more credits to use in new troops and vehicles. If at first glance, this may seem trivial and elementary, in reality the strategy with which we will decide our plan will be fundamental. One of the most recurrent situations in which I found myself was to decide whether to send a large group of space marines together but with a slower conquest speed or to opt to divide the troops but risk being overwhelmed by the enemy if the number was decidedly greater. This is just a very simple example of how strategy turns out to be fundamental in Warhammer: the novelty of strategic points makes the gaming experience absolutely adrenaline. Another relevant element is that each team (just like in the recent Kohan 2 and Axis & Allies, here too the units are never generated individually) can be strengthened with new elements but also with more powerful firearms. The updating of the troops, even if quantitatively limited, therefore makes the action much more continuous and rapid since only if we do not withdraw in time will we have to send brand new units from our headquarters to the crucial points instead of replenishing the troops already established . The differentiation of the races present in the game also deserves heartfelt applause (read the appropriate box to get to know them better): it is not just a question of a graphic diversification, but the peculiarities of fight and logistics are really very different and therefore lead to example the orcs instead of the Space Marines will also mean resetting tactics and strategies with respect to the specific characteristics of our cannon fodder. Although it can go on for another 10,000 characters in an attempt to convey the wonderful sensations transmitted by the alchemy created by Relic, the advice is to try Warhammer firsthand also because in our files area, you can find the downloadable demo... as long as you don't the word of myself is enough when I tell you that the very high quality of the central core of Dawn of War is difficult to find in other RTS. The quality of Dawn of War is hardly found in other RTS And what species are you with? Although in the main single campaign you can only take the side of the Space Marines, in the skirmish mode and above all in the multiplayer game (from two to eight players, in teams or in all against all without mercy for anyone) we will be able to take command of all the various races (and their sub-factions) that populate the Warhammer 40,000 universe. So let's get to know them in detail Space Marines The most powerful defenders of mankind, the most feared enemies of all, the space marines are superhuman beings genetically modified to be simply perfect war machines. It takes a lot of credits to spawn new units, but every soldier is capable of holding their own and defeating entire squads of opponents. and they started a war between humans which led to theto near extinction of our species. The ~Heretics~ are still part of the Universe and are as skilled warriors as the Space Marines. More capable in infiltration and ambushes, they instead lack discipline and order (being the Space Marines of Chaos it could not be otherwise) but they also have sorcery and demonic reenactment skills. Orcs The most numerous inhabitants of the Universe, extremely strong physically and endowed with a primordial instinct for combat, blood and war. Their weakness lies in their lack of tactical intelligence and inaccuracy in targeting enemies over large distances, causing them to always seek hand-to-hand combat. Eldar The Eldar are an incredibly ancient race endowed with unparalleled psychic powers that once ruled a vast empire. Though the era of their unchallenged supremacy has passed, they remain a powerful force to be reckoned with for their psychic and summoning abilities. How beautiful are these toy soldiers Before leaving you with the final comment and related vote (but I'm sure you've already peeked at it), I can't help but fill the audiovisual component of the THQ title with praise. Equipped with a completely three-dimensional graphics engine capable of managing many units on the screen without excessive frame rate problems even on computers of not the latest generation, Warhammer hands down the competition (except Ground Controls 2 as regards the environments) thanks to a almost maniacal with which all the game units were made: no RTS can boast such a high detail for each individual soldier and above all such an accurate and ~massive~ set of animations (especially in hand-to-hand combat) between the various units. If that weren't enough, some choices such as the pods of new units and structures that arrive at an impressive speed on the ground (or crash in an uncoordinated way if you take the orcs) or the possibility to customize all the colors of your units, are those little touches of class that only the great titles can boast. The ~military-war-fantasy~ aesthetic is further elevated thanks to a sound compartment which, in addition to a work of interpretation of the dialogues (in English but with Italian subtitles) carried out with professionalism and conviction, can boast the compositions of that Jeremy Soule that we have already come to appreciate in titles such as Kohan 2, Morrowind, Unreal 2 and Neverwinter Nights to name the most striking names of his recent productions. My completely peaceful-pacifist soul will regret it but making war in Warhammer 40,000 with these so immersive sensory suggestions turns out to be really exciting and frees the most primordial instincts that we all carry inside us like it or not better to vent them here than in real life , don't you think? Comment Recipe to finally be able to challenge Blizzard's supremacy in the field of strategic games on equal terms: a programming team with important experiences behind them (the Relics, authors of the two Homeworlds and Impossible Creatures), a very important brand and an imaginative universe of incredible impact such as that of Warhammer 40,000 and a great musician (Jeremy Soule, the same of Kohan 2, Morrowind, Unreal 2 and Neverwinter Nights to name the most striking names of his recent productions). The result? Dawn of War, undoubtedly the best real-time strategy of recent years, capable of seriously questioning the scepter of Star-War-Craft in its own genre. A perfect alchemy of action and tactics, of ~military-fantasy~ aesthetics with a devastating impact characterized by attention to every detail as well as an absolutely exciting differentiation of the various breeds. The production of THQ undoubtedly deserves the definition of a masterpiece, although it still has a big (the only) flaw: a single-player campaign mode that is decidedly too short and which, unlike the recurring trend, will put us in charge of a only of the warring factions. But, despite the disappointment I felt, Dawn of War thrilled me so much both when confronted with artificial intelligence and with other human opponents, that it deserves a decidedly high-sounding vote but undoubtedly also corroborated by some touches of class such as the possibility of customizing like the colors of your armies. Undoubtedly not to be missed by strategists of the art of digital video warfare and fans of Games Workshop's ~toy soldiers~. Pros: Fast-paced action and top-notch tactics Sublime graphics and gorgeous sound Infinite multiplayer Cons: Single-player campaign too short and only one faction to control in this mode Glreal-time strategists are enjoying a wonderful second youth. After a few years in which few quality productions were white flies in the midst of an avalanche of clones of clones of clones, 2004 is giving the PCists video strategists a good number of important releases which have also brought a nice breath of novelty that many ( including myself) they deemed absolutely necessary. And the peak of this positive trend, in my very personal opinion, was reached by Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, a title capable of seriously questioning the Blizzard leadership which with the Star-War-Craft combination seemed unattainable and instead For those who have never come across Games Workshop's toy soldiers, I can tell you that Warhammer is an incredibly vast phenomenon followed all over the world where collecting is mixed with artistic skills (if you want to paint your troops) and the strategy to put in place in the board game where you can show your knaves. The ~40,000~ universe was born after the first Warhammer of clear fantasy inspiration and recreates its alchemy in a very distant future where magic and sacred cults (of various orders and degrees) mix with an incredible war technology. In this context, the human race, led by an Emperor who has assumed an exclusively spiritual existence (but with immense power like a God) must confront other species with anything but peaceful intentions, intent on transforming us into ~animals on the way of extinction~. Fortunately, the incredible Space Marines are on our side: genetically perfect, ready to carry out the wishes of the emperor without a doubt, they will be the protagonists of the main campaign of the single game (in particular the squadron of the Bloody Crows). In 11 chapters, we will be involved in an intricate plot full of twists, intrigues and deceptions where it will be increasingly difficult to understand who the allies and the traitors are.", "date": "2004-10-21", "grade": null}
