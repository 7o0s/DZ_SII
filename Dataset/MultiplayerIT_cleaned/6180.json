Evidently born under the influence of illicit substances, the title of Riverman Media rests in fact on the basis of an at least bizarre premise: on a quiet day in the offices of any company, the employees suddenly and for no reason turn into monstrous creatures such as werewolves, warthogs in riot gear, small flying demons, ghosts in the shape of a wolf's head, boxing boars, bulls dressed as firefighters and so on. The protagonist is a manager of the company in question, who without any hesitation decides to solve the problem by beating up anyone who gets in front of him through buildings, trains and subway stations, port areas, Egyptian museums, Gothic cathedrals and ruins full of skeletons . This is the plot of The Executive, and you can reread it as many times as you like, it will never make sense. A condensation of pure madness that fortunately accompanies a decidedly more sensible and lucid play structure, which mixes elements of different genres with a particularly convincing result. The Executive explains what to do if your office colleagues turn into werewolves Staff cuts In fact, The Executive is basically divided into two types of gameplay that are amalgamated and alternated within the levels: a first in runner-style, within which one's alter ego finds himself having to overcome obstacles during a race managed in automatic. The user is only asked to swipe at some graphic signals, trying to do it as quickly as possible to improve his final score. During these phases, which are somewhat reminiscent of Elite Beat Agents, the manager will be able to show all his hidden athletic abilities through somersaults, passages through walls and floors and sliding on walls. However, where the most substantial part of The Executive is found is in the combat phases, which in fact alternate with the racing phases just described without interruption. Simply, when you are faced with an enemy, the game transforms into an initially very basic fighting game, which however gains depth and substance as new skills are unlocked. In practice there are four areas on which we can act, respectively torso and legs of the enemy and the equivalent of your character. Tapping on the latter will allow the manager to parry the opponent's attacks, while acting on those of the monster will carry out the basic blows. By performing swipe combinations from these four areas, special shots can then be created, obviously capable of inflicting greater damage but executable only after loading a special bar. The end result is a game mechanic that intelligently manages the limits imposed by touch screen control, offering an experience capable of guaranteeing a good depth even within an absolutely arcade context. Inaccuracies in the response to commands are indeed present, but with a fully acceptable frequency, as is the general repetitiveness of the action. This is basically thanks to the incredible variety of situations in which you come across, which stimulates you to face the levels one after the other, but also to the well-studied character growth and development system which is also accompanied by a sketchy but still intriguing management component . In practice, by completing the missions you get an evaluation for a series of factors (shots taken and variety of the same, those suffered, speed, etc.) which allows you to earn a cash prize. Each evaluation item can then be increased by bonuses linked to the hiring of certain categories of employees in the company; and the more employees there are, the more money will be accumulated every second passively, without doing anything, even when you are not using the app. In other words, thanks to the personnel hired, it will be possible to find oneself, at each access to the game, with a nice nest egg that can be used to improve the attack, defense and speed of the protagonist, or to buy new skills. The latter are not simply linked to physical attacks, but also to spells of various types that provide support in the most complicated situations. Worth mentioning is the remarkable longevity of the game, which goes through 120 levels that mark the career progress of the protagonist, and the quality of the graphics, entirely in 2D drawn by hand with a very spot on style.
