For every fire he tamed, another was lit, and the oxygen was less than 40%. Colombo was desperately trying to repair the weapons console, while the enemy probe targeted the hull with robotic precision, opening dangerous holes inside. The last of the expedition to die was Captain De Gama. With dignity he rose from the pilot's chair and walked across the flare-shaking hull to the hold, where the pirates had beamed down. He collapsed to the ground before killing even one. That was the New World's last mission, its remains lost adrift in the fifth sector. But soon after a new spaceship left the hangar, and who knows which adventure among the thousands possible in Faster Than Light. In this strategy and simulation game with a rogue soul, what matters most is the journey, since the destination is uncertain. Anything can happen, hundreds of random events await the intrepid crews, but death, at least, is sure and final. Besides, what does it matter if in the end we enjoyed every second? In fact, this is the secret of the two developers behind FTL: to offer the player a deep and complex but very simple to manage experience, from which to draw a new story every time, sometimes dramatic, sometimes hilarious. Matthew Davis and Justin Ma of Subset Games advertised their project on Kickstarter seeking ten thousand dollars and raised over two hundred thousand. The result shows that they have not lost sight of the goal and have given the fans a clean, perfectly polished and almost infinite game. Just like space. Just choose a new crew and the adventure begins again. However, there is one main mission in FTL: to escape the Rebel horde and reach the 8th sector to warn the Federation of the impending attack. Maybe after destroying the final boss. The sense of urgency provided by the presence of rebels advancing across the map of each of the eight sectors is a crucial element of the gameplay. The maps are divided into randomly generated nodes and each of them hides an event or a fight. Our aim is to reach the exit and move towards the next sector, but with the enemies on our heels we have to make crucial decisions. Is it worth the risk of helping the local population to get a few units of fuel? Or is it better to run away with the risk of finding ourselves unprepared against the next enemy? Decisions like this are a constant in FTL and one of the reasons why one game alone is never enough. Usually not even two. Yo no soy marinero The difficult art of commanding requires the ability to make many critical decisions quickly. Luckily in FTL we can pause the game and calmly give orders even during fights. To defend ourselves we have nine spaceships available, each with its crew and its configuration of attack and defense systems. Nine different approaches to the game that are unlocked by completing special missions in certain sectors of the galaxy. For each ship there are also objectives to be achieved to unlock an alternative version. What never changes is the real-time micro management of the various systems and subsystems. Fights are the supreme strategic moment. Indeed, our spaceships have different compartments that can increase if we install new technologies, but the same goes for the enemies. Therefore we have to choose whether to target their shields and then hit them with a drone or rather deactivate the powerful missiles with which they are piercing our shield. Or focus on the pilot if we see that he's about to activate the time jump. And meanwhile we have a crew to manage. In fact, many systems offer a strategic advantage if they are controlled by a person - or by an alien, since there are many races in the game, each with different abilities - so it is important to choose well who we want to send to tame that fire that is developing in the medical room. Or if we really want to rally everyone to fight an invasion aboard ship. Not to mention that in the nebulae the onboard cameras don't work and half the ship is in the dark. While among asteroids we always risk being hit by a stray rock. We have already talked about the fearsome flare instead. Are you stunned by the amount of information? Yet these are barely half the details to consider. It's even possible to open or close the watertight doors between sections of the ship to let some oxygen in, in case a crew member is repairing an area where a fire had started. It seemsall complicated but Subset Games has devised a very simple procedure to manage the levels of the spaceship. Every on-board system needs energy to operate. Imagine receiving the fearsome laser cannon as a reward that allows us to choose the devastating trajectory of its beam. Gorgeous. Meanwhile, we have to spend money - which in the game is scrap - to upgrade the defense system, so that it can feed a new weapon. However, spaceships have a limited power reservoir, consequently we either give up on activating some system, or we increase the ship's capacity. All of these choices in an unpredictable game like FTL require planning and the ability to improvise. It can very well happen that a nebula takes away half of the available power, and then goodbye to our cannon. On the other hand, it is unthinkable to enhance everything and many choices also depend on what is found in the shops scattered in the various sectors. This is basically the charm of FTL: a strategic space ship simulator that contains as many stories as there are stars in the sky. There is life in space Every journey begins with people. In fact, before take-off we find ourselves in the hangar, and there we have to choose our ship. It is the most important moment of the game, because it gives us the possibility to decide a name for each member of the crew and for our ship. Thanks to us, those frenetic little pixels gain their digital dignity. Reckless or cowardly captains, heroic women who sacrifice themselves for the good of the ship, silent but faithful alien species; anyone can be hidden behind the names that we assign to the members of the expedition from time to time. And their ephemeral virtual existence thus deserves to be remembered. We've seen so many crews go adrift in space. Scientists, writers, even the crew of Multiplayer.it attempted a desperate escape towards the ships of the Federation. Sometimes FTL with its supreme randomness can feel unfair. It happens that the best equipped ship gets screwed over by a sudden invasion of robots just when everything seemed to be going well. In these moments the personality of the ship and its crew makes all the difference. It makes us understand that that story had to end like this, and that another one can immediately begin again. That's not the limit of FTL. Its only flaw is that despite the thousands of lines of dialogue written, the randomness with which events occur leads us to repeat the same several times. After a while we learn that it is better not to intervene to put out the fire aboard an orbiting station and the curiosity diminishes. Nothing serious, however. And if the developers add new spaceships and extra content, even better if with the help of the players, FTL will continue to shine for a long time to come.", "date": "2012-10-03", "grade": "8.0"}
