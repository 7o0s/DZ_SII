{"name": "Super Breakout", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-breakout.html", "text": "It was back in 1976 when Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow created Breakout, an arcade game that took up the basic concepts of Pong to give them a particular thickness: driving the usual ~stick~, you had to bounce the ~ball~ every time that ended up at the bottom of the screen, but there wasn't a human opponent to beat. In its place a brick wall that was different every time, which disassembled piece by piece every time the ball ended up against it. The purpose of each stage was to destroy all the bricks, of course, and to succeed in the enterprise you could move the wand in order to give the rebound a certain trajectory. The success of the game prompted Atari to create an enhanced version just two years later, and to port both products for their home consoles. Over the years, Breakout has appeared on various platforms, in all guises, also lending itself perfectly to various reductions for mobile phones. Super Breakout offers us two game modes: the new one and the classic one. The first sees us face a large number of stages in which the goal is always the same, that is to destroy all the bricks, but to achieve it we will have to take into account a series of different factors. First of all, as in the original Breakout, the layout of the bricks is not always the same and often the position of some walls is ~strategic~, designed to put us in trouble with rebounds. Second, not all bricks have the same impact resistance: some will disintegrate with a single hit, others will require several. Finally, we will have to expect the appearance of numerous power-ups, which in this revision by Glu really have a leading role: they will allow us to shoot, to increase or decrease the width of the wand, to duplicate its shape, to increase the balls in play, to control the trajectory of each bounce, etc. One of the most important innovations is represented by the presence of bosses, or enemies with their own intelligence and also made up of bricks, which we will have to face every few levels and which add further depth to the experience. Next to the new game mode is the classic one, in which we can choose an initial ~configuration~ and then get lost in the original Breakout gameplay, reproduced in a very faithful way: a truly valuable addition, especially for nostalgics. On an artistic level, revisiting a video game classic is never a simple undertaking, even when you are faced with a title like Breakout, which even belongs to the era of two-tone arcades. In any case, it is difficult to criticize the work done by Glu in this case: the stages are all colorful and gaudy, without particular pretensions, while the wand has been transformed from the simple line it was into a technological device, equipped with its own animations, which it transforms according to the enhancement and whose control is always ready and precise. The sound commentary is entrusted to a series of MIDI music that doesn't work miracles but performs its task with dignity, accompanying the action without disturbing. PRO Two game modes The upgrade system is great Classic and innovative at the same time AGAINST A bit slow action If you hate the original, it's not for you Some small uncertainty in the controls", "date": "2008-07-24", "grade": "S.V."}
