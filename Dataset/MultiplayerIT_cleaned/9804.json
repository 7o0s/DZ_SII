Given that few of those who were disappointed by this sequel owe their disappointment to the lack of freedom - at least those who expected a worthy sequel to the first chapter - 2K Cech immediately patched up the first paid downloadable content (7.99 euro) released one week after the release of the title. Passing over the necessary protests that having to pay to download content that should already be present in the basic box could arouse - indeed, pay to unlock content that is already installed, to be honest - Jimmy's Vendetta radically changes the game sensation offered by Mafia II, starting with the protagonist. Back in old Naples THAT'S AMORE Whoever writes this article did not like Vito: little more than a puppet, apparently a tough guy, but in reality a weak boy unable to manage his life, so much so that he always needs someone to obey like a dog as he is incapable to set any goal. In the DLC however, as the name suggests, we will play a completely new character, namely Jimmy, the opposite of Vito starting from his appearance: we leave the role of the young clone of Marlon Brando to enter those of a middle-aged man, bald, with eyes marked by life perpetually covered by a pair of dark glasses and wrapped in a black suit, almost as if he were a 50s version of the famous Agent 47 from the Hitman series. Jailed for the betrayal of his former accomplices, Jimmy escapes during a revolt and once again free he has only one thought: to take revenge on those who ruined him by dismantling their organizations from the ground up to reach the top and eliminate the traitors. And this is where the free roaming component comes into play: unlike Vito, Jimmy can not only wander around Empire Bay, but also choose which missions to undertake from time to time, whether they are commissioned thefts to scrape together some cash or sabotage and murders against the hated enemies (among other things it is possible to repeat the missions once done in an attempt to improve the previous performances and conquer other trophies). Boom boom boom boom Although in Mafia II: Jimmy's Vendetta the plot is not exactly the strong point - it is also narrated only through written screens that serve as mission briefings, rather than films - the charisma of the protagonist and the theme of revenge manage by themselves to give a good feeling of identification to the player, also thanks to the always impeccable reconstruction of the city. By the way, although the apartments are present (mainly to cram cars and save the game after a change of clothes to escape the cops), it will never happen that you have to go to sleep, let alone wake up laden with dollars, which finally makes the interaction with the shopkeepers is quite important and above all the possibility of paying and making withdrawals using a 9-gauge credit card. Jimmy, in fact, is not part of a criminal association, let alone has someone always ready to provide him with the tools of the trade, he has to think of himself alone and, especially at the beginning, this translates into obtaining cash and weapons by robbing the shops, going to bars for healing and spending hundreds of dollars quite often to stock up on ammunition (among other things, there are few in circulation, especially for heavy weapons) or to make up/change license plate or color on the car used during the mission. On the other hand, however, the shops and apartments remain the only places that Jimmy can visit: in fact, all his businesses take place on the street or on the sidewalk, and there is no possibility of returning to visit the places explored during the missions in the role of Vito ladder. Hey mambo no more mozzarella However, the free roaming transposition does not fail to show defects that could appear secondary when the narration took place in very different planes: we are referring first of all to the artificial intelligence of the non-player characters and in particular to that of the policemen, who if already showed some weaknesses once, now leaves no room for doubt. It's true: if a shooting breaks out the police arrive (even too quickly) but then what? Most of the time you just need to holster your gun and the cops will pass in front of Jimmy, perhaps unaware that the alley he just came out of is full of corpses, other times they'll start shooting at him for no reason (it happens that during firefights with mobsters you pass a steering wheel that will start shooting at all conditionshonestly, not caring if the player will help them to bring down the criminals or was simply defending himself), they will tend to ignore any infringement of the road code excluding excessive speed (however, it happens to go against traffic or even run over passers-by without there being any reaction) and in pursuits they will not use any other tactic other than trying to stay in line with the fugitive, for whom it will often be enough to press the accelerator and turn the corner to leave the pursuers behind - as a last resort, it is enough to slip into an apartment and save to forget to the policemen all the crimes committed and to go out peacefully on the street. Even in shootings the AI reveals some weaknesses: perhaps designed for the clashes in the narrow corridors that are seen in the previous adventure, in the street it shows several flaws such as enemies who remain in the open or travel absurd distances under fire to hide behind cars rather than behind much closer pylons or walls. All flaws and bugs also present in the main release, but which, either for the intriguing story, for the structure of the missions or for the intense and continuous action, also tended to go unnoticed in the frenzy of the action, and which now show themselves instead in all their annoying arrogance, significantly undermining the final judgment.", "date": "2010-09-16", "grade": "7.5"}
