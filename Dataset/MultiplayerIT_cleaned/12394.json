{"name": "Real Football 2007", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/real-football-2007.html", "text": "Gameloft's Real Football series has quickly become the benchmark for mobile football titles, to the detriment of EA's direct rival Fifa Soccer; all this thanks to an excellent graphic component supported however fortunately also by a robust and convincing playability. Obviously, as per tradition for sports titles, even Real Football could not escape the ~rule~ of the annual update; so here we are facing the 2007 edition, ready to take the field on the vast majority of mobile phones on the market thanks to the wide compatibility guaranteed by the manufacturer. The game structure compared to last year's edition has not been changed, fortunately; the good complexity of the gameplay studied by Gameloft has therefore remained intact, providing the product in question with a depth capable of taking it far beyond the classic couple of games necessary to be able to master all aspects. To confirm this, suffice it to say that Real Football 2007 practically makes full use of the numeric keys available on the mobile phone keyboard, most of which are delegated to running in 8 directions; the latter is a key aspect to guarantee sufficient control of one's players to create a great variety of actions. The 5 key is instead assigned to passes and pressing on opposing players, with 0 for shots and tackles, and finally the asterisk to perform the classic ~games~ and special moves especially with the most talented players. The picture that emerges is therefore that of a product with good depth, and in fact in practice after the kick-off, playing the Gameloft production is actually a pleasure; after a little practice with the control system, it is possible to create spectacular and engaging games, where the greatest limitation is basically only the lack of comfort of the keyboard for this kind of game. In fact, the only defects really attributable to the programmers are to be found in the poor artificial intelligence of opponents and above all goalkeepers, who even at the highest difficulty levels fall victim to gross errors; also sorry for the lack of a multiplayer mode via bluetooth. The aesthetic component is very good, which once again confirms Gameloft's ability; in addition to the valid animations of the players, all the surrounding elements that frame the matches are appreciable, from the flags of the fans to the people on the sidelines. And in the same way, the completeness of available game options should also be underlined, ranging from friendly matches to tournaments through challenges to penalties; the teams, a hundred divided between national teams and clubs, have licenses for all the names of the players. On the other hand, the sound is barely acceptable, crackling and unconvincing both in the music and in the effects, and with the strange lack of volume selection which therefore allows you to only be able to choose between silence or deafening racket. PRO The best football on mobile Great graphics Prompt playability AGAINST Very similar to the 2006 edition Reviewable sound Multiplayer via BT is missing", "date": "2007-04-01", "grade": "S.V."}
