{"name": "Shadow the Hedgehog", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shadow-the-hedgehog.html", "text": "The forgetful hedgehog The game begins with a finely crafted FMV that illustrates the precarious situation of the earth, threatened by planetary wars between humans and aliens, the Black Arms, led by a certain Black Doom. Clashes rage everywhere, and also involve Sonic's historic gang: Tails, Knuckles, Amy and the others. Shadow is extraneous to the conflict, because he is tortured by another more important problem for him, his identity: the Rossoneri hedgehog remembers nothing of his past, he only knows his name. During one of the many clashes he is contacted by Black Doom, who asks him to recover the seven Chaos Emeralds for him. Shadow throws himself into the adventure without thinking twice, convinced by the fact that, having called him by name, that being may have some information about his past. The story is therefore more than valid, especially when compared to the standards of the series, and the best thing is that it also heavily influences the play structure of Shadow the Hedgehog. In each stage our hedgehog will have multiple objectives, that is, he will be able to choose whether to complete the level by helping the good guys (Sonic and companions), the bad guys (Black Arms), or simply minding his own business, limiting himself to collecting the Chaos Emeralds. If you choose to side with someone generally Shadow's task is reduced to killing all the soldiers of the opposing army present in the stage. However, your decision will not be incontrovertible, as you will be able to change your side several times during your adventure. There are twenty-two levels in all, but it is impossible to visit them all by finishing the game only once: in fact, when you have completed a specific objective, you will be automatically transported to the next stage, and this will change according to the goal (good, neutral or evil) that you will have achieved. It's like moving around a chessboard without being able to go back, so much so that there are eleven different endings, which vary not only according to how you complete the last stage, but also taking into account the choices you made during the game. your path. Finishing the game takes a few hours, but surely the incentives to replay it more than once are many. Once upon a time Sonic the Hedgehog... These good ideas have unfortunately been ruined by the partial success of the game, which lacks in several fundamental aspects. The movement of Shadow, first of all, is somewhat approximate: with a simple touch of the analog stick you go from stasis to the wildest race, without graduations. While the hedgehog goes at maximum speed then, given that his shoes are a kind of skates, the changes in direction are not as immediate as they should be in a game of this type. It wouldn't be a serious flaw if the title didn't require sudden changes of direction or jumps calibrated to the millimeter, but unfortunately these things exist and inaccuracies of this type weigh heavily on the overall quality of the product. Furthermore, the extreme speed at which the character goes is inexplicable, given that the Sonic sections, or those very fun parts composed of a mix between a racing game and a platform, are very few compared to the combat ones. This continuous rush only damages the use of the title, given that it has not been exploited properly and becomes a great obstacle both in the parts where you have to face enemies and in the typically platform ones. Almost every object reacts to Shadow's moves, but it always reacts the same way, no matter how you hit it Once upon a time Sonic the Hedgehog... Shadow will be able to use all the weapons that he will find on the ground or that he will steal from the various soldiers, both alien and human, who will come across his path. Most of his arsenal consists of pistols and rifles, but there are also swords or iron rods. Unfortunately it is not easy to use these weapons, since the porcupine will always hit what it will have in front of it, as it is not possible to move the crosshairs without also moving the body. The shootings are therefore not very technical and somewhat confusing, even frustrating if you try to help one of the two factions: since there is an auto-aim system, in battles with many soldiers it is practically impossible to aim at one in particular and you will inevitably end up with hit even those who, hypothetically, will be your allies. The interaction with the surrounding world is very high, although it is not supported by a physics engine up to par. Almost every object reacts to Shadow's moves, but it always does so the same way, no matter how you hit it. The porcupine is also able to drive, but even when he gets into the car he has problems with comasndi and with the view that prevent you from enjoying the journey to the fullest. Although the shot can be changed using the C-stick, it is difficult to control, it does not respond to commands as it should and above all, if left to work automatically, it freezes every minute in the presence of some obstacle. In battles it is incredibly annoying, since it does not allow you to enjoy an adequate overview and often you find yourself in front of enemies whose existence you did not even suspect. Dreamcasts? The graphics are average, practically on the same level as those appreciated in Sonic Adventure 2. Nothing particularly complex, good but not excellent textures and polygonal models, quite poor light effects. The FMVs, on the other hand, are always very nice. The biggest difference compared to the past consists in a greater presence of pop-ups, which is especially noticeable during battles, when enemies of nothing will appear. Furthermore, the horizon is so limited that SEGA has tried to stem the problem by flattening the shot to the ground, however causing further complications of a playful nature without solving the defect. The worst part of the graphics, however, is the style used, extremely banal and anonymous. The world of Sonic has been adapted to the new protagonist, the atmospheres have become darker, the colors duller, but all this has been done without a minimum of personality, to try to impress the crowd. Watching Shadow aboard a spider as he darts between destroyed houses is the most bleak thing you can see, especially for a Sonic fan. The sound sector fortunately makes a better impression, thanks to the compositions that emphasize the events of the porcupine and the discreet dubbing in English. Shadow cross-platform The game was released for Gamecube, Play Station 2 and Xbox. The nearly identical Gamecube and Xbox versions are the best. Shadow the Hedgehog for PS2 suffers from further graphic problems, as in the moments in which there are numerous characters on the screen, that is very frequently, some showy and annoying slowdowns arrive on time. If you have a choice, then, get the game on Gamecube or Xbox. Comment Despite so many good ideas Shadow the Hedgehog fails to rise from the crowd, getting trapped in the multitude of games that are filling the store shelves this Christmas season. All the prerequisites for creating a great game were there, unfortunately some wrong choices were made both in the design phase, entrusting the development of the title to an inexperienced team, and during the actual manufacturing, during which some fundamental aspects in favor of some of secondary importance. Only recommended for hardcore SEGA fans. Pro Good narrative plot Eleven different endings! Lots of good ideas... Cons... mostly badly done Pop-ups Annoying camera Poor and unsuitable controls Anonymous style Shadow first appeared in Sonic Adventure 2, where he led the trio 'Dark', opposite that of his good alter-ego, Sonic. Thanks to his background, his charisma and his ambiguity, he was immediately well received by the public, so much so that SEGA decided to create a personalized game around him, trying to make the most of the features that made him famous among fans of video games. Shadow the Hedgehog, released these days in the European version, was developed by a US subdivision of the Japanese giant SEGA, under the supervision of Naka's famous Sonic Team. Unfortunately, something went wrong.", "date": "2005-12-16", "grade": null}
