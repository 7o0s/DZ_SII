{"name": "Mario Kart Wii - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-kart-wii-recensione.html", "text": "Keep your eyes on the road, your hands on the wheel Mario Kart Wii was born sixteen years after the first episode, but in intent it is the first direct heir: the general vision is aimed at achieving a total balance of the mechanics, exactly like in Super Mario Kart, although the project was hampered by the cumbersome legacy of the last two chapters of the series. Despite this difficulty, thanks to the experience gained from recent errors, Nintendo has managed to border on perfection with the guide system, keeping all the positive characteristics intact and eliminating the negative ones. The curves are smooth and modulable as usual, but this time the power slide is no longer loaded with furious steering and counter-steering strokes, but by drifting for a long time, tightening it as much as possible: in addition to being more realistic, this formulation has also been able to eradicate the snapping phenomenon (the execution in rapid succession of power slides in a straight line) which had so much undermined the usability of Mario Kart DS. The harmony of the trajectory has again a predominant role, and exploiting the wake of the other competitors has become a fundamental part of the game mechanics; this last technique has been skilfully integrated, given the new possibility of looking behind, a function which gives the opportunity to those in front to defend themselves from the advance of the pursuers. in addition to being more realistic, this formulation was also able to eradicate the snapping phenomenon that had so greatly undermined the usability of Mario Kart DS Keep your eyes on the road, your hands on the wheel The aerobatics have also been successfully included, and to win you need to know how to use them: the difficulty does not lie in the jumping phase, just shake the Wiimote to perform them, but in choosing the most suitable points to take advantage of the acceleration that follows. However, the most positive aspect is the total enslavement of the steering wheel to the playful architecture, because it has proved capable of attracting new players and simultaneously deepening the driving system. In this context, the only criticism attributable to the development team is that they did not have the courage to eliminate the classic control, which makes car management more artificial and easier; however, given that the advantages are still minimal, this choice does not affect the excellent quality of this aspect of the game. In addition to being well calibrated, driving is also heterogeneous, and requires a radically different approach depending on the single-seater used: karts and motorcycles are predictably differentiated, but so are the various vehicles that belong to the same type. If the cars have two drift graduations, so as to obtain a stronger boost at the end of the curve, the motorbikes are faster in producing the single charge and capable, by wheeling, of accelerating in a straight line: probably the latter will be more used in the future, above all in time trials, but it is essential to point out that, with rare exceptions, Nintendo has found an excellent balance, because with almost every car it is possible to fight for first place. This result is even more relevant bearing in mind that in the last two episodes many single-seaters were useless, without the bikes complicating the equation. An airbag (could have) saved my life To be to all intents and purposes the Super Mario Kart of the new millennium, however, the game should have also offered a perfect weave in the complicated fabric made up of bonuses. In this case, unfortunately, the result is not optimal: to the usual weapons, many of which are to be used sparingly and liable to counterattack, some have been added that leave no way out for the competitors, thus resulting in situations dominated by chaos. The pilots from eight have risen to twelve, and the destructive potential of those in the last positions has become exaggerated: the blue shell, the thunderbolt, the star, the missile, the pow and the giant mushroom, except for very rare contingencies, incontrovertibly punish the unfortunate person destined to suffer the effects. Not that these exceptional weapons shouldn't be there, because they've always been included in Mario Kart - often with success - but their number should be limited. In this field the episode for Wii also fails because it is unable to synthesize: giant mushroom and lightning, for example, could have been grouped into a single object, which would have been more technical to use and would have had more thickness than the sum of the two taken individually. the destructive potential of competitors in late positions has become exaggerated An airbag (could have) saved my life Fortunately, this defect appears in its entirety only when there are more than eight players, and above all onlywhen racing on short tracks or with too many bonus boxes: unsurprisingly, the tracks inherited from the old chapters turn out to be excessively chaotic, especially those transferred from Mario Kart Double Dash and Mario Kart DS, not designed for twelve drivers and culpably not adapted to the new ones needs. On the other hand, many of the new circuits, innovative beyond all expectations, guarantee excellent races: they can no longer be labeled as classic, ~dirty~ or technical tracks, because almost all of them tend to merge these characteristics to originate new identities, and they often succeed. Among the many tracks (sixteen new and sixteen old) the Toad Factory stands out, a real gem, a synthesis of what Mario Kart has been up to now, a summary executed with such mastery and lightness as to hide the intricate underlying structure: it is the Paranoid Android from the series, a tripartite composition with a crazy closing coda. Pacciokkitsch The modes available in single do not differ particularly from the usual ones: you can compete in grand prix with various engine capacities, there is the time trial, there is the battle, this time necessarily in teams, there is the single race to practice. What really makes the game long-lived is multiplayer as always, which this time extends to online with enormous success: the service made available by Mario Kart Wii would be scarce on Xbox Live, which makes it better than all those offered so far on Nintendo console, although friends still have to be added through gargantuan codes and voice chat has remained a utopia. You can create rooms, you can have online battles, games at a global or continental level, but in any case the game is fluid and flowing like few others, with a minimum lag and a highly additive cyclical structuring: no trophies are played four races, the online game is an infinite wheel that spins as long as you want, racing every time against your opponents and against yourself, trying to improve your own constantly updated personal score. The Mario Kart Channel, included in the game, also allows you to compare your records to those of the best drivers in the world, with the possibility of downloading their ghosts (aka time trial recordings). On a technical level, the title is discreet, in single it is always fluid, but suffers drops in multiplayer offline (four) and online (two from the same console): they are not occasional shots, but a deliberately lower frame rate which however does not allows you to fully enjoy the races. Stylistically, this Mario Kart adds nothing to the old games in the series, and as usual, we simply cannot speak of a racing game sweetened by Nintendo characters, because everything is made up of sugar and caramel, everything is taken to excess, with mountains smiling, rounded cows and ghosts who mock the runners: a real stylistic connotation which, although in the name of opulence, is able to clearly explain the compactness of the playful mechanics on a visual level. Comment Mario Kart Wii is the natural heir to Super Mario Kart, it brings its spirit and intentions back to life: the result isn't perfect, there are some inaccuracies, especially in the balance of bonuses, but it's still excellent. Most importantly, however, Mario Kart is once again playing the field for everyone, casual players, new and old, online and off - there's no greater success than this. last 12 years Truly suitable for everyone... ... as well as the steering wheel Virtually lag-free online game Cons Not fully balanced bonuses Sometimes chaotic from nine drivers on Slow in four offline and in two online", "date": "2008-04-17", "grade": null}
