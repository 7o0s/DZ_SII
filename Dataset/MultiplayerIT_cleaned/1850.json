{"name": "Kakuto Chojin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kakuto-chojin_a.html", "text": "Kakuto Chjin UAAAATAAAAA' !!!!!!In Kakuto Chojin there are 11 selectable characters. The additional modes, in addition to the Story Mode are the Multiplayer which is divided into Battle Royale and Versus Mode. You will think that the ways to enrich the game implemented by the developers are few, and in fact you are right. The constant that exclusively afflicts this genre of games is longevity, almost always nothing. It goes without saying that the synonym longevity doesn't go very well with the fighting game one; it increases only with the increase of friends who come to your house to play a game together. However Kakuto Chojin is also very enjoyable in single player. Practically wrapped in a non-existent plot, we only know that there is this tournament called Fist of Fire or, fist of fire, and that all the best fighters of the globe are gathered in it. Each character practices different fighting styles. Some of them are part of the dark, others are mere humans. The tournament will decide the supremacy of one of the two factions, the Kakuto and the Chojin. Each fighter will have a fighting style which is also determined by the faction to which he/she belongs (for example the character who practices karate, depending on the faction he/she belongs to, will have slightly different moves). Here comes the sore point to press against a product that had the potential to outperform the competition: there are few moves and few tricks for each of the characters. Were it not for the small difficulty encountered in implementing them, the game could be particularly easy and boring. However, I assure you that from Normal mode onwards, it is not really easy to take down your opponents. Yes, because the fight is quite simulative despite the few moves available. An opponent will only be hit properly after having launched a series of combos against him, which will result in a series of dodges and parries worthy of the best martial arts fights seen in the movies. The motion capture created gives a naturalness to the movements of the characters so as to make you forget that they are made of polygons, and all this is accompanied by a Heavy Metal soundtrack of sure impact and great audio quality. Kakuto Chjin Oh my God!!! Really. You will be delighted by the technical realization of this title. The characters are the best polygonal models ever seen in a fighting game. Effects of light and refraction on their body, transparencies, even the glossy effect of the bare parts of the character, which perhaps in some cases is so exaggerated that it gives the sensation of ~grease~. Movements so natural that they seem alive, animations treated to the limit of possible. Collisions not flawless, but convincing. A note of demerit goes to the realization of the scenarios. They are bare and mostly dark, apart from some that reproduce interiors, such as the Chinese temple. One thing that many would have liked is also the possibility of having the scenario interactive (as seen in DOA3) and exploiting it to one's favour, but this is not the case. So much care, at times maniacal, for the characters and for their characterization (when you use Shadow, you too will want to have his cyberskin suit like him!) and so little attention to the rest, relegate this fighting game to the nomination of discreet product and not of masterpiece. Kakuto Chjin But not a sequel to Tobal? I'll be honest: I was really impressed by this Dream Publishing product (for the record, the creators of Tobal, Ergheiz and The Bouncer) but almost only for the graphics. More could have been done, even if I don't deny that it's a fighting game that I really enjoy. The graphic design is a good 80% of the quality of the product, the atmosphere is no less, but right now, more is needed. I would have liked a return of Tobal, who at his release was considered the best in terms of graphics and spectacular moves to perform, and set new standards for fighting games; on the other hand, there are many sequels! Although it cannot compete, except for its cosmetics, with the sacred monsters Dead or Alive, Tekken and Soul Calibur, Kakuto Chojin has something that will be able to capture those who are looking for little frenzy in a fighting game and targeted moves without ~tweaking~ on the pad . A must try, but lovers of the genre can't miss it! Kakuto Chjin Kakuto Chojin, that is, the graphic demo that everyone hoped would come true! In fact, they were right, the movies weren't in full motion, but, as usual, there is a however ...... Indeed, the thing that most intrigued and made the videogame community discuss the most was the reserve with which gamers have welcomed Kakuto Chojin : movies on movies, simpre unclear, and which did not make it clear the actual quality (at least from a visual point of view) of the Dream Publishing title. One thing is certain: from a graphic point of view, we are dealing with a product that reaches a quality never seen before on any gaming platform!", "date": "2002-12-28", "grade": null}
