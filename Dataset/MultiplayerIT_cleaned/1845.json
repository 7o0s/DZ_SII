{"name": "Summoner 2: the Prophecy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/summoner-2-the-prophecy.html", "text": "A figurative universe of high value... Summoner 2 is an action RPG with real-time combat that puts us in the shoes of Maia, a valiant warrior believed by her people to be the reincarnation of a legendary goddess promised by their mythology. Maia, with the support of trusted allies and reluctant to assume decision-making control of the kingdom, thus fights on the front lines in command of a mighty decaying empire, corroded by a series of wars and exhausted by years of waiting for the ninth year of the ninth era , date on which the divine would be resurrected. Attempting to summarize the complex plot that unravels from the skein of events narrated in Summoner 2 would be completely superfluous: what the introductory titles by THQ and the Volition team introduce us to is in fact a packaged product with great attention to everything a video game can do to constitute itself as an alternative visual world, endowed with literary and figurative dignity. Summoner 2 is, basically, a fairly classic RPG as regards the conception of the characters and the management of skills, equipment, experience levels, weapons and objects of various kinds available and organized within special menus: and this according to a canon that crosses the entire genre, well known to enthusiasts and which is even linked to many non-video games related to video games such as role-playing games, board and card games. It is therefore natural that the game system, even if characterized by real-time fights, foresees that most of the time is spent between the fights themselves and the management of the menus relating to the missions, weapons and characters that we will be able to play during the adventure. Just as it is natural that this type of game conception can only rely heavily on the artistic work carried out to guide the player - even before a series of tests of skill with the controller - towards a parallel world and an exciting plot. Summoner 2, in this order of ideas, stands out, even before the way in which it is played, precisely for its aesthetic characterization, carried forward with a high-level artistic work and with a marked taste for fantasy and Gothic. The visionary visual style, the horrific bestiary, the fantasy characterization of the playable and non-playable characters, the taste for the mythological pastiche, the atmospheric music and the literary dialogues are in all respects the cornerstones of Summoner 2. Regardless of how you lets play. ... with too repetitive gameplay! However, it is precisely the gameplay that partially undermines the experience of Summoner 2. The way it is presented, with a tendency to alternate between sections of research and combat and others of contemplation and dialogue with non-playable characters, creates a strange mix between moments of absolute contemplative relaxation and moments of belligerent confusion. Nothing wrong with it  indeed, far from it! - that a game is able to provide the player with opposing feelings. The problem occurs when, as in the case of Summoner 2, the fights are too confusing and repetitive to qualify the game as a great action and the sections of dialogue and the unfolding of the plot are far too linear to be considered a successful adventure or RPG. As for the fights, which take place in full 3D and real time through the physical attack buttons and the spell menus, it cannot be said that the game adopts an ideal system: the way in which it is possible to hit enemies or, rather, pausing the game to access the objects is ultimately very confusing, and is very little relieved by the possibility of assigning behaviors to the characters on our team controlled by artificial intelligence. The anchoring system of the enemies you intend to attack is not at all precise, and often leaves the player at the mercy of the numerous, vain attempts to lay down the enemies rationally: the unrefined result is that of producing bursts of blows delivered more or less blindly on small groups of enemies, hoping to hit as many as possible. In the game it is possible to control a party with several fighters at the same time, but the characters of our team obey the behaviors we attribute to them in a too stereotyped way when they are controlled by the CPU, failing to assume convincing combat patterns; the possibility instead of changing in real time the controlled character among those of the team is a good starting point that unfortunately partially gets stuck on sets of shots that are too similar between the various characters: characters that, however, on paper they would have very different capacities. Even the beautiful transformations of the protagonist, who through the power of the Runes takes on the appearance of ferocious creatures, are very similar to each other, and during the adventure there will be no missions developed ad hoc for particular abilities of a beast rather than a other. In short, the combat component of the game struggles badly between real-time and the menus: and it does so without reaching the precision and frenzy of titles such as Ocarina of Time, nor the complexity and intelligence of the best turn-based RPGs like most Square or Enix titles. This said without exaggerating in the criticisms, given that the fights of the game will still be very enjoyable for all fans of the action component, while the plethora of options and characteristics of the characters will satisfy the most shift-workers among RPG fans. The problems, as mentioned, however, are not limited to the aspect of the fights, but also affect what is best the game has to offer, namely the plot and the development of the story. Speaking of the more contemplative sections, in fact, one cannot help but notice the way in which the beautiful plot, full of mythological digressions and embellished with very well-made cinematic interludes, is presented in a somewhat too linear way: the mass of narrative data and the valuable rendered interludes do not in fact make the game a motivating experience if presented in a too little interactive way. The risk in this case is that, unless you are very attracted and passionate about the plot, the experience can inevitably be repetitive after a few hours of play. Even if you are immersed in a suggestive parallel world, Summoner 2 carries on - unfortunately - as a sequence of inevitably linear chapters, interspersed with long sections of combat and research. Even if the story is integrated skillfully with the gaming experience, the latter is not enriched by it. We are light years away from the open conception of masterpieces such as Chrono Trigger, of course, but we would have liked to avoid finding, in the menus, all the ~main~ and ~optional~ missions explicitly listed, with the result of ruining the free unfolding of the plot and enclose it in a mechanical and all too explicit continuum. The programmers could and should have managed the fabric of situations within locations within the environments, or disseminated narrative cues that are difficult to keep in mind within objects or diaries owned by the protagonists or accessible through specific locations, avoiding entering everything in improbable and anti-atmospheric sheets of notes of the protagonist. Similar metatextual functions, that is, which carry out the components and purposes internal to the coherence of the game, must be treated in a more subtle way and disguised in the fiction of the game if we do not want to compromise its power of suggestion. And the power of suggestion that the figurative universe of Summoner 2 can evoke is decidedly high. As already mentioned, in fact, the audiovisual realization of Summoner 2 is overall excellent: it is, however, more for the work of the artists involved than for that of the systems engineers and programmers. The decidedly average technical performance of the polygonal engine (doors that pass through the protagonist to open without any hand to open them, firm lips of speaking characters, oscillating frame rate, ultra-serrated lines and so on) in fact brakes, in a decisive way, the artistic potential of the aesthetic characterization of the game. As far as the sound is concerned, however, there is almost nothing to complain about: the few and obvious sound effects do not undermine the overall judgment. The very appropriate and theatrical recitations of the characters' voices (even if many dialogues are left written, without voice acting) and the decidedly atmospheric music, capable of growing with the situations proposed by the levels and accompanying them appropriately, perfectly frame the settings of Summoner 2. Comment The only reason we were hard enough with Summoner 2 is its potential, the fact that it's a game that managed to improve on its predecessor's shortcomings only in a superficial, and not a substantive, way. The uploads that occasionally interrupt the flow of the game must disappear, and not be minor; the technical realization must overcome certain technical impasses in order to be able to provide artists with the ideal platform on which to spread their beautiful efforts; the fights must be able to avoid cumbersomeness and repetitiveness; the plot must be made non-linear, and more embedded in thegame situations. If all this is accomplished in a sequel, then the Summoner saga will be able to aspire to a very high status for all fans of the genre. But, even so, Summoner is a great game for anyone who considers themselves a true fan. A game suitable for those who, in addition to being an RPG user, will be able to appreciate the plot and the settings full of quotes with a fantasy, gothic and neo-messianic taste, the excellent characterization of the playable and non-playable characters, the settings with a strong artistic. Thumbs up for the artists, then. But thumbs down for the game designers: its constitution as an RPG in a certain sense a hybrid between two schools of thought is certainly a double-edged sword, which can make the experience original but risks, for those who are not sensitive to genre and its figures, to translate it into an advancement that is a bit unappealing and too linear. Comment Pros: Splendid Fantasy-Gothic characterization Well-crafted narration, with some sidequests Extras and digressions with a mythological flavor Cons: Choked fights between real-time and paused menus Repetitive action, without characters or actions sensitive to the specific context Extremely linear progression Missions and sidequests too much explicit in the menus Desert, a blinding sun. A figure wrapped in a long black cloak wanders around an expanse of sand. A female face can be seen from the hood. The woman's hands pick up a sphere with engraved lines, similar to those of a brain, and turn it upwards towards the sun, where it is charged with a very strong multicolored energy. The unknown female figure places the sphere again, now transparent and teeming with shapes inside, in the burning sand, and sprinkles it until it sprouts with dozens of wooden tentacles, which in a few seconds create a large tree with twisted and sinuous branches full of blue spheres. He picks one up, squeezes it in his palm and an enormous wave of life shakes and invests the desert landscape up to the horizon, restoring vegetation and life while a large dried up bed fills up with water in a few seconds. The dunes become green hills. There is life. Quiet. A silence broken by a hint of catastrophe. The woman turns at the first stroke of thunder, the storm suddenly breaks out and shakes her, the whole hill. Lightning strikes mercilessly on the tree of life.
