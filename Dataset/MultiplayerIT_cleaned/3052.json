Oh yes, because WayForward this time has treated the distribution of the fifth chapter of the franchise in a very particular way: the precedence was given last autumn 2019 to iOS-based systems, above all to Apple Arcade, among other things with the first half of the game; the second arrived in March 2020. Only in recent days, however, Shantae and the Seven Sirens has finally landed everywhere: PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. We played it well on the latter platform, and between a ballet and the other (less than usual, actually) we are also ready for the review. New: transformations and trading cards It's likely you read our review of Shantae: Half-Genie Hero Ultimate Edition almost exactly two years ago, to which we gave it a resounding full 8. The fourth installment of the franchise brought the half-genius heroine into the world of high definition and current-gen; the fifth, i.e. Shantae and the Seven Sirens, evidently set itself the simple objective of increasing the dose, limiting the novelties of the gameplay to minimal innovations, and focusing on the recovery of everything that already worked in the past. So let's take the pebble off our shoe, as they usually say, and try to face reality: Shantae and the Seven Sirens is the so-called ~more of the same~. Anyone who enjoyed the previous chapter will also love the new one; those unfamiliar with the franchise will have a perfect chapter in their hands to start with, since no previous knowledge is required from a narrative point of view. The sore point of this operation is that WayForward celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of its presence on the market in 2020, and perhaps never as in this moment there would have been a need for an innovative chapter for the franchise: a production much more similar to Half-Genie Hero than at The Seven Sirens. So let's see what those minimal innovations we have mentioned consist of. To begin with, Shantae and the Seven Sirens introduces the Fusion ballets: in practice now the protagonist is able to manage the transformations in the creatures without necessarily going through the ballet phase, and without selecting the respective power, as happened instead Half-Genie Hero . If you find yourself in front of a wall to climb, simply execute the R1 command (from PlayStation 4) and the Triton Tritone takes the place of Shantae, ready to climb it. Once the command is released, Shantae returns to normal state. In fact, however, one of the salient ~moments~ of the franchise is also missing in this way, the one in which the protagonist began to sway and then transform into a myriad of different creatures. The ballets are still available, but are relegated to other powers: those of healing and revealing hidden objects, for example. Another novelty of the title consists in the introduction of collectible cards linked to monsters: now each eliminated enemy can release a playing card (or sticker), which is added to a nice collection, which can be consulted in the pause menu. It's not just an increase in collectibles for its own sake: by collecting a certain number of cards per monster, it's possible to activate a passive bonus (for example the one to increase the effectiveness of consumables). Shantae can keep up to three bonuses active at the same time. Playstation 4 trophies Of course, Shantae and the Seven Sirens brings many glittering Trophies to PlayStation 4, including the coveted Platinum Trophy. However, you will need to get your hands on every single collectible, secret and hidden detail of the production: it will take some time, and even a pinch of skill. In less than fifteen hours, however, you should do it extensively. Gameplay We have already underlined the conservative soul of Shantae and the Seven Sirens, which of course is also reflected in the gameplay, which has remained fundamentally unchanged from the previous chapter. The player will therefore buy again an excellent 2D platform, with both horizontal and vertical progression: the game philosophy represents a good compromise between modernity and the old school. For example: it is true that in many situations it will take millimeter calculations to jump from one platform to another, and good precision also to hit enemies with Shantae's magical hair; and yet checkpoints abound in every area of the game, and allow you to quickly return to the point where you were eliminated. In addition to the platform, the metroidvania is remarkable, and usually forces the player to a solid backtrackin: having learned a specific power, or a particular object, you therefore go back to a point where it was previously impossible to continue. From time to time you get lost and don't understand what to do: at this point it is advisable to check the game map and talk to all the available NPCs. Beyond ballets and jumps, Shantae can also fight using magic: in the game shop you will find upgrades for each individual skill, but you will have to bring a lot of sounding gems with you, and possibly other material too. Like squid ready to cook: expansions for the health bar don't create themselves. Plot and technical sector The plot of Shantae and the Seven Sirens restarts exactly where that of Half-Genie Hero ended: the protagonist, together with her uncle and friends Sky and Bolo, decides to leave for a vacation on a lush tropical island. But here the tranquility lasts only a few seconds: Shantae first discovers the existence of other half-geniuses like her (she is therefore not the only one of her kind), then she is invited to dance on the occasion of a festival. Over the course of the very first show, however, a mysterious event rocks the island and something - or someone - kidnaps the other five half-geniuses. Given that for some reason only Shantae is left around, the latter decides to help the Mayor of the place in finding all the other half-geniuses: but something very strange is happening on the island, and probably some characters presented as positive are not he tells it right... Between welcome and predictable returns and completely new heroes and antagonists, the plot of Shantae and the Seven Sirens continues in a pleasant (and a little predictable) way for about 6-7 hours of play. It is not particularly long-lived, therefore, but the many secrets hidden in the levels will do the rest. The technical sector of Shantae and the Seven Sirens is appreciable but not commendable: given the return of backdrops and levels completely in 2D, the title needs even less than Half-Genie Hero to exploit the potential of the reference console. On PlayStation 4 Pro we have never noticed slowdowns or fluctuating frame-rates, and in general level cleaning and graphics are excellent. However, the loads between one play area and another are inexplicably long and annoying, a sign that a little more optimization certainly wouldn't have hurt. Excellent, as always, the soundtrack, as well as the melodies that accompany the various game areas. It should be emphasized that the entire game is dubbed in English, and that the texts on the screen and in the menus are instead in Italian: an understandable language, yet full of errors and inaccuracies, also from the point of view of translation.", "date": "2020-06-06", "grade": "7.8"}
