We are in fact talking about a fighting game that for the first time (if we don't count the Pit Fighter experiment, of course) used graphics digitized by real-life actors, with extraordinarily fluid animations and a violence never seen before, introduced in particular by the Fatalities, or by the ~coup de grace~ that each wrestler could give the opponent after defeating him, killing him in a gruesome way. Of course, the differences with the other symbolic fighting game of those years, Street Fighter II, were clear: the characters of Mortal Kombat moved quickly, placing the emphasis on timing and reflexes rather than on combat strategy, and in many points by sight the Midway title appeared coarser than the Capcom masterpiece. The fact is that its strengths were so evident as to decree its success and transform that game into the first chapter of a long series, certainly with ups and downs but also capable of characterizing the life of home consoles (someone, for example , will remember the miraculous conversion of Mortal Kombat II for the Mega Drive...). After several average episodes, the franchise urgently needed a reboot and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, the new owner of the brand, could only entrust its implementation to NetherRealm Studios, a team made up of various former Midway and therefore with all the cards in order to bring Mortal Kombat up to today's standards. Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition arrives on PC late but at half the price and with the solidity of the original From console to PC The product released in April 2011 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 pleasantly impressed us, skilfully mixing the gameplay of the origins with an incredibly full-bodied structure for the average fighting game, full of interesting modes and an adequate online sector . The wait for Mortal Kombat enthusiast PC users has been long, in fact, but in the end here is a Komplete Edition which not only natively includes a total of DLC (mainly extra characters) worth around 20 euros, but is also offered to us on Steam at a very attractive price. The characteristics of the game are the same that we have been able to appreciate on consoles, in this case a full-bodied story mode in which we take on the role of different characters who interact within the same story from time to time, in a collage of old and new that makes lots of fan service; an ~arcade~ mode in which it is possible to freely select one's warrior from a list of over thirty elements which includes, as mentioned above, extra characters such as Freddy Krueger, the well-known nightmare of Elm Street, Skarlet, the ninja Rain and blind swordsman Kenshi; the Skalata, or a path characterized by an increasing degree of difficulty and by missions that must be completed in view of the encounters; and finally the online multiplayer, which allows us to challenge other players in ranked or customized matches, access a room and challenge its occupants, as well as try our hand at the fun and original King of the Hill. Unfortunately, during our tests, the online sector did not give a brilliant performance, given the large amount of connections lost even before starting a match and the presence of a lag that completely undermines the experience, which as mentioned it is based on timing and speed of execution. A patch is needed to fix these problems. Smooth strokes Beyond the extra content, it is clear that the most interesting aspect of Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition concerns the technical sector. Is this the best version of the game currently available? From this point of view yes, certainly: on the test configuration the game runs at 1080p and 60 frames per second without problems, with all the effects at maximum, despite suffering from quite evident tearing which, however, can only be solved by adjusting the video card settings, as the game itself does not include an option for v-sync. The items on which it is possible to act to visually scale the experience are the aforementioned resolution, the quality of the textures, the quality of the shadows, the antialiasing, the transparency of the antialiasing and the anisotropic filtering. The differences compared to the console version of two years ago are all visible, but it must also be said that the minimum requirements refer to a DirectX 10/11 video card whereas no use is made of the effects linked to the latest Microsoft graphics libraries. This can only make you turn up your nose, beyond the beauty of some stages and the spectacular nature of certain sequelscombat ence, primarily the X-Ray moves. It is also absurd that the cutscenes have been ripped from the console version, resulting in a huge difference in quality between the cutscenes and the in-game graphics, which is very bad to see. Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition natively supports the Xbox 360 controller, highly recommended for playing, although some moves are still linked to the use of the d-pad, in this case mediocre. Finally, as regards the audio sector, there is a lot of ~body~ in the sound effects, really powerful, and an essential musical accompaniment. However, the Italian dubbing is among the worst ever heard, it is no coincidence that there are those who embroidered on it.", "date": "2013-07-09", "grade": "8.0"}
