{"name": "Grey's Anatomy: The Mobile Game", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/greys-anatomy-the-mobile-game.html", "text": "There are now several TV series with a ~medical~ background, thanks to the success of ~E.R.~, but the genre is certainly not born now, on the contrary. In any case, the strength of ~Grey's Anatomy~ probably lies in the peculiarity of its protagonists: the episodes are not focused on purely work issues, but range on the fears, paranoia and foibles of the characters, which sometimes take on connotations really bizarre, typical of sitcoms. This spirit is captured quite faithfully by Gameloft, just think that the early stages of the game see Meredith recovering her clothes after a night of passion with a handsome stranger (who later turns out to be her boss at work... ). Let's also say that to go ahead in Grey's Anatomy: The Mobile Game you need to know the TV series at least a little, since we will often find ourselves facing simple quizzes that refer to some episodes or in any case to the distinctive features of the characters. The game has a very particular structure, especially as regards energy management: the bar fills up when we talk to people, when we answer questions correctly and when we complete small missions, as well as when we take advantage of the vending machines to fill up on coffee and snacks. For the rest, we will have to move around the various areas of the hospital (sometimes in a hurry...) following the orders of our ruthless foreman, and demonstrate the utmost attention during the intervention of the surgeons, to act on the patients as we are taught. We will be able to check the current mission or the position of the characters by looking at the pager (right soft key), which will start to vibrate in case of emergency. The most challenging phases of the game are represented by the actual interventions: the view of our character disappears, giving way to an overview of the patient's body, corresponding to the area to be treated. Here the developers have drawn a very clear inspiration from Trauma Center: in the lower part of the screen we have the different tools (needle, tweezers, scalpel, laser, drainage, etc.) and we must use them appropriately to carry out the operation. In the case of lacerations, we must eventually drain the blood that comes out, then apply sutures. When faced with aneurysms, on the other hand, we will first have to incise the part, then drain and then extract with tweezers. It is clear that the control system of Grey's Anatomy: The Mobile Game cannot compete with that of Trauma Center (both DS and Wii versions), so the use of the instruments has been greatly simplified and is more based on the right timing : the scalpel moves automatically, but we have to ~press~ it at the right moment; the suture needle finds the points of application by itself, but we must insert it promptly; tweezers must pull in a certain direction, etc. The end result is really excellent, if you think that you use a single button to do everything, but things could have been improved a lot by assigning tool selection to the function keys: moving the extremely slow cursor to the bottom of the screen is not the maximum comfort. The game boasts a truly excellent technical realization, especially in terms of quantity: there are numerous characters that move on the screen and with whom we can interact, the protagonists of the series are well characterized and are recognizable despite the comic style, the areas of the hospital boast a convincing design and a good level of detail. The sound sector does what it can, with a series of well-made music that has the task of underlining the different phases of the action. Finally, the controls are simple and immediate: the joystick moves our character, the FIRE key (or 5) is used to interact with characters and tools, or (by keeping it pressed) it allows us to run in the direction we are facing. The right function key is used to call up the pager, from which we can also consult a map of the various areas as well as check the mission in progress.
