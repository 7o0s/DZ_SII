Wonderful to slowly discover a game, to feel it gradually entering your veins until you are completely enveloped in it, immersed in the narrative, fascinated by the charisma of the characters and the story. No longer spectators, but protagonists in a world created by someone else, able from the very first moments to make it exist even in our heads, somehow giving it life. It rarely happens, it happens with a few works and it happens often and willingly with games the expectations weren't exactly very high. Arkane has gotten us used to this over the years and with Deathloop the magic has been incredibly recreated. Just a moment listening to the first lines of dialogue between Colt and Julianna and we were already in the part, with the world, the real one, dull and silent, we were so tangled up in the repeated days of Blackreef. Playing for Deathloop review was a rare and magnificent experience, which we want to try to tell you below. How to play Deathloop In Deathloop we don't know who we are, but we do damn good killing You wake up numb on a beach, your mind clouded, your ideas confused. We sincerely don't know what to expect, but as we look at the setting the atmosphere already proves to be incredible. Different from the usual shooters, Deathloop takes us by the hand, over and over and over again, until we begin to become familiar with all the mechanics that the developers have made available to us. We start by discovering that we know how to tinker with guns, that we can take a life without asking why or without feeling remorse, immediately realizing that this seems to be what we do every day. Colt is a charismatic character and Arkane did not want to reveal too many details in the game, leaving it to the one who holds virtual control to interpret his actions, to define his story and his personality. We would call it freedom of reading, just as freedom is the word that best marries with the entire production, for all the meanings we know. Deathloop is therefore a story, a vision with multiple meanings with a tough protagonist, capable of joking about what happens to him but also able to reflect and reason. In short, we do not have in our hands the usual mercenary all muscles and zero brains, but rather a fighter with acumen and determined to solve the mysteries that surround him. As the fog of logic unravels, we thus discover that we are trapped on a cursed island, caged in a remote place surrounded by ice, where our freedom, precisely, is questioned. Not even death is able to give us the longed-for relief, given that the only consequence of an untimely death will be to wake up again on the same cursed beach. A loop, as the title suggests, infinite and deadly, which must be ended to find the longed-for serenity. To do this we will have to devise a perfect plan, find a way to eliminate the Visionaries and their minions trying to change the inevitable. Colt thus begins to become aware of his mission and we will have to guide him in search of continuous clues that can alter the order of events, change the course of the day and successfully conclude the enterprise: only twenty-four hours to do it. The game map is thus divided into four districts, each characterized by a unique setting and with a discrete extension, which can be visited at four different times of the day which not only change the aesthetic aspect but also, and above all, the activities that there are carried out. Taking advantage of this basic knowledge, Colt will thus have to change the pre-established order and generate a day that gives him what he is looking for. Obviously on the island the inhabitants, called Eternalists, see it differently since this sort of immortality without consequences does not seem to be a problem. For this they placed a nice virtual Most Wanted sign on Colt's back, since he represents the only real threat to their eternity. The structure of Blackreef Enter guns blazing or play silently, the choice is yours Deathloop wants to make the player think step by step, giving him a few crumbs of knowledge at a time, making him think constantly during the game. While you take aim, while you stab yet another Eternalist, the brain continues to process information, continues to be active so much that you often feel overwhelmed by things to do, filling you with ideas to complete them. It's actually a great Arkane magic, since the game is structured in an excellent way, built as it is to always let you know with precision where to go, never frustrating you with not being able to remember or figure out what to do but also leaving you feeling like you have everything under control. There are hundreds of clues scattered about Blackreef: numbers to open armored doors, traps, passwords, puzzles of different kinds but everything, once discovered, is archived in a series of menus created with great care, clear and always exhaustive. However, there are more complex secondary missions and bizarre objectives that always remain within the reach of any type of player. How to get to the solution of the problems, however, is left in your hands thanks to the help of a varied paraphernalia and special powers designed to make the gameplay more dynamic and fun. You can choose to use sniper rifles or heavy machine guns, silenced pistols or nail guns or still wander through the streets of the neighborhoods becoming invisible and brandishing the ordinance machete by the hand. An interesting subsystem will provide you with the element of character growth, with weapons of different rarities and a system of perks and passive skills to help you perfect your play style. The dog tags do this job, dozens of stats that you can equip in the weapon slots or graft them on to guarantee you particular resistances or improve the effectiveness of the guns, for example by increasing their magazines or speeding up the rate of fire. The variety is excellent and the player can enjoy combining the special effects of weapons with these power-ups in a creative and fun way resulting in specific builds. The multiplayer We can become invisible, hurl enemies away, or contrive to make eternalists suffer in many ways To add the right dose of pepper, Arkane then thought well of complicating the method of obtaining powers and platelets, obviously equipping the Visionaries with the strongest ones, but also forcing the player to seal them in their inventory through special residues. The loop erases everything upon your death, or at the end of the day, including all unsafe equipment. Thus you will initially have to make choices on which weapons to keep and which to sacrifice so as to save your favorites for the following loops, with a functional system during the first few hours but which becomes superfluous as you accumulate passive properties, almost being able to ignore it on the end of the adventure. Your first perfect loop won't close for twenty, twenty-five hours of play, with the option, once completed, to replay the last daily loop to complete all the secondary or start the adventure from scratch, a necessity that frankly we haven't seen how satisfied we were with our first run. There's also multiplayer, in a light but ingenious version, ready to mess up your plans and keep you tense at every single step. Our main antagonist, determined to keep the constant flow of the loop is called Julianna and, as a hobby, has the determined will to repeatedly end Colt's life. During the missions we will thus be able to see her suddenly appear ready to hunt us down, perhaps while we are already engaged in a firefight against the artificial intelligence or while we are wandering around Blackreef in stealth, throwing our plans into jeopardy. Upon her arrival, the exit routes are closed and the only way to be able to leave will be either to deactivate the antennas through our trusty hacking tool, with which we usually modify the behavior of sensors and turrets in the game, or to eliminate her before she does with us. Colt usually has an advantage since every quarter of the day a special tablet allows him to come back to life up to three times, while Julianna will have a single vital supply and will not even be able to interact with the objects scattered around the map. It happened that our plans went awry especially when there were flesh-and-blood players to control Julianna, but even artificial intelligence can be annoying. It's a feature that can be extended to all online players, allowing them to join our game, or limit entry to friends only or artificial intelligence only, leaving them as inevitable events in Deathloop's economy. Obviously we will be able to have fun impersonating her and go annoy other players or, perhaps, help some of our friends in difficulty. This possibility is not very in the strings and philosophy of the game, but it is still feasible given the complete freedom of our majestic antagonist. Julianna will then be able to level up and automatically earn new weapons, ability and aesthetic elements of personalization while remaining confined to this universe. The attention to detail Julianna will really give you a hard time, especially if it will be controlled by humans All mechanics convince even if not all are calibrated to perfection. Many of the powers are derived from other Arkane titles, such as translation or invisibility, and the artificial intelligence may seem undemanding at first, although things improve as you eliminate the Visionaries during the same loop. But they are flaws that quickly fade into the background when you feel part of the setting. The visual glimpses are beautiful and the feeling of freedom is total, being able to take advantage of the tunnels in the bunkers to move with a low profile up to playing with the most complete verticality by running on the roofs of Blackreef. To surround all this there is an incredible style capable of drawing from the colors and imagery of the 70s and an enormous care placed in the design of the levels, as well as a truly creepy soundtrack, which will be able to accompany you very well in every moment of the game by raising the adrenaline during the most excited moments and cradling you in the rare moments of stillness. We also take our hats off to the technological gimmick of making the numerical puzzles for opening doors unique to each player, a choice that will allow you to enjoy the game to the fullest and force you to use your head to advance in the game. Our mind, on the other hand, is still a prisoner of the new Arkane universe, in the end it's wonderful to be surprised.", "date": "2021-09-13", "grade": "9.0"}
