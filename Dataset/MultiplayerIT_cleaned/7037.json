Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. We could debate for a long time whether or not it is correct to literally clone a successful title to try to obtain the same results in terms of diffusion and monetization, especially since in the case of Gameloft we are faced with a company that has often and willingly done of this practice a distinctive mark. The point is that several years have now passed since the French house threw itself headlong into the development of mobile games, and it is clear that it has been able to attract highly talented professionals into its ranks, capable of transforming an operation of dubious taste into something different, into a great opportunity. Beyond the obvious similarities with Puzzle & Dragons, in fact, Dungeon Gems can boast its own dignity; indeed, to be honest, the game manages to introduce into the starting mix, the one borrowed from the GungHo blockbuster, a series of factors capable of making the gameplay even more complex and engaging. This so solid and multifaceted system was therefore placed within a freemium model which at first appears restrictive, with the traditional ~action points~ conditioning the amount of missions that can be performed consecutively, but which over time proves fundamentally balanced, given that as our degree of experience increases, the already mentioned action points also increase hand in hand and this equalizes the ever-increasing demand. The technical sector is also of higher quality than that of Puzzle & Dragons, characterized by an excellent design for the characters, free of any smudges, with various and discreetly animated enemies, as well as some interesting touches of class that contribute to enhancing certain phases of the 'action. The sound accompaniment is also beautiful, with ~epic~ music at the right point and capable of involving. Dungeon Gems takes the mechanics of Puzzle & Dragons, refining and packaging them in a better way Infinity Gems The Dungeon Gems campaign puts us in front of a large number of missions that we must face by preparing a team composed of five elemental warriors, whose attacks are based on fire, water, earth, light and darkness. Each of these elements proves to be particularly effective against its antithesis, and this translates into the adoption of a precise strategy during each level, aimed precisely at making the best use of our equipment. There is a large management phase, with a traditional hero summoning system that involves the use of virtual currency (gold coins) or valuable currency (gems), and which allows you to merge the various cards to obtain a more powerful warrior, or exploit certain materials to evolve into a new form. It goes without saying that with the acquisition of new and better units we will spend part of the game time in setting up the team, possibly evaluating the presence of more exponents of the same ~order~ to double the effectiveness of the relative maneuvers, or by composing the team in the most balanced way possible. Once the setup is done, we move on to the real action, which as mentioned clearly takes up the gameplay of Puzzle & Dragons: after selecting another user's avatar as a support unit, using a dungeon crawler-style view, we will find ourselves facing various enemies in the perspective of a turn-based system mixed with a match-3 style puzzle game. In fact, in the lower part of the screen there is a classic scoreboard with the various elements, which we must pair to score shots that are all the more powerful the more articulated the combo is. One of the novelties of the Gameloft title is represented by a quantity of points which allow not only to exploit the special abilities of each character on the team (for example healing spells, poisons or momentary power-ups), but also and above all to combine elements of different colors, so as to create combinations that also include all the runes together, and which can translate into devastating attacks. This possibility, together with the fact of being able to use the boxes even individually, in the absence of better combinations, increases the strategic weight of the experience and makes it more varied and multifaceted.", "date": "2014-06-28", "grade": "8.0"}
