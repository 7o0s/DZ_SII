{"name": "Prey - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prey-recensione.html", "text": "Since the plot the first missed opportunity The protagonist of the story is Tommy, a native American, who is captured by an alien spaceship while he is in a bar with his grandfather and his girlfriend Jen. The premises for the creation of an original plot would be excellent but the player will soon realize that he is dealing with the usual a-la-Quake plot: to free himself and other living beings from the captivity of the evil Queen Mother, he will have to deal with hordes of enemies and square kilometers of hi-tech rooms before the classic final showdown. Fortunately for him, Tommy will have the powers conferred on him by the noble Cherokee origin (which, in essence, translate into the elimination of the game over writing). [C] Here is one of the luminous walkways that allow you to evade the force of gravity; At the beginning of the adventure Tommy will discover the the powers of the tribe; Cherokee [/C] What amazes about Prey, beyond the good technical realization that will be analyzed later in the review, is the mix of influences of old glories which inspired the programmers and which generated a series of certainly interesting and original levels. Although conceptually the structure of the gameplay is always the same (you continue in the only available direction, activating a few buttons from time to time and eliminating anything that moves), the revival of some techniques already used in the past, but much better presented, allow to Prey to have a note of inventiveness more than the other FPS. PC vs 360 Speaking of comparisons between the two versions, the first thing that should be emphasized undoubtedly concerns the technical aspect: and if a comparison between a high-end PC and Xbox 360 leads to the victory of the former (especially for higher resolution and texture quality and effects), at the same time the console incarnation of Prey seems decidedly more suitable for anyone who doesn't have a very powerful computer, given the good visual rendering of the product accompanied by a very stable frame rate. To this must be added the good work done on the control system, precise and reactive to the point of not regretting the mouse + keyboard combo. No big difference, however, in terms of multiplayer: modes and maps therefore remain the same, with only the Xbox Live services as a side dish. The first thing that catches the eye is the level design: the creative use of physics has allowed the developers to get around what has always been seen as a limit for first-person shooters, namely the linearity of the levels. On average, there is a tendency to continue without problems towards the imaginary line that leads to the end of the map: in Prey, on the other hand, some ideas, taken from games such as American McGee's Alice, lead the player to study the areas of the level more carefully in order to move forward: who prevents you from thinking that behind a box there is a portal that leads to a parallel plane? There are three innovations (although it is a bit of an exaggeration to define them as such) that deserve to be mentioned: the door-walk, i.e. the possibility of climbing walls using special walkways; the panels that allow you to change the gravitational force (literally overturning the level) and the spirit-mode, a metaphysical state that is very reminiscent of Soul Reaver and which allows you to evade insurmountable obstacles in reality. In several cases it must be admitted that these characteristics have allowed programmers to create interesting and certainly less sterile adventure moments than the classic find-the-key-and-open-the-door, even if - in all honesty - it could have been do something more. There are also several sections aboard spaceships, which are driven just like those of Descent  nice and always scenographic alternatives that interrupt the tran-tran of the action on foot and make the pace of the game more sparkling. In multiplayer mode these ships assume a particularly important role, because they can become very useful especially in team deathmatch. Even the arsenal at Tommy's disposal is original in its own way and, although it is not varied at all (just six weapons), it is well balanced and is especially suitable in the single player, where you have to choose carefully what to use because some aliens are immune to certain types of damage and especially ammunition are in short supply. The plasma rifle is undoubtedly the most successful, while the pincers, a basic weapon that barely serves to kill the first two unfortunates, seems to have been placed there only to mimic Half-Life's crowbar. Goals 360 The Xbox 360 version of Prey also differs from the PC version in the presence of d objectivesto unlock, peculiarities of each title available for the Microsoft console. In the case of the product in question, the list counts as many as 44 units per 1000 points, half of which are attributed to the user for simply completing a level. Most of the rest instead concern multiplayer, and can be obtained by winning a certain number of games and accumulating kills in general or by using a single weapon. In this rather conventional framework, a handful of achievements stand out that can be unlocked by winning certain sums of money at the electronic gambling games in Jen's bar, scattered around the Sphere. parallel platforms The game uses a modified version of the DooM 3 engine, and is not particularly demanding in terms of hardware resources. While it falls short of its id counterpart in terms of polygons and animations, it still manages to have its say with explosions and other lighting effects. Just take a look at the accompanying screenshots to realize the skill of the Human Head programmers, who managed to reproduce truly splendid glimpses. Negative note instead for the character-design: the protagonist is certainly not the most charismatic and the enemies he meets are few and too similar to those of Quake and DooM. The sound sector also contributes to exacerbate this feeling: it is certainly not that bad, especially if you have a surround system, but other titles have shown that it is possible to reach much higher levels than those reached by Prey. There are also two songs, respectively at the beginning and in the final bars: these are the songs of Heart (Barracuda) and Judas Priest's (You've Got Another Thing Comin'), decidedly energetic and suitable for the rhythm of the action. It is a pity that it was not decided to opt for a richer and more present soundtrack during the game. parallel platforms The limited longevity of the single player (about ten hours) is due to the low difficulty and the poor artificial intelligence of the enemies, few and not very smart. Only in the final do things improve a bit, with aliens popping out from everywhere and particularly agile; we actually would have preferred to have more tactical and less frenetic firefights. Things don't get much better going into online arenas: by the programmers' own admission this aspect has been a bit neglected in the hope that the community of enthusiasts will give life to a few more modes than the canonical deathmatches and team deathmatches initially present. In any case, the official servers are very fast (also because the number of users is currently limited) and stable. Final comment Prey is a game that started - on paper - with excellent conditions that were only partially expected, both in terms of technical implementation and gameplay. Of the first aspect we particularly appreciated some spectacular levels embellished with fantastic plays of light, while the realization of the enemies left us perplexed, not very inspired both conceptually and graphically. Of the second, interesting ideas have allowed us to glimpse some brilliant intuitions of the programmers, who however have preferred not to tread their hand, limiting them to a now dated style of play. The low longevity of the single campaign and an unconvinced multiplayer are two other aspects that cannot be forgiven for such a long-awaited game. A title suitable for the majority of players, but which lacks some fundamental aspects that would have elevated it to a must have. Pros Several extremely scenic moments Immediate and light-hearted action Several interesting ideas Cons Repetitive firefights Animations not up to par Low longevity The history of Prey is undoubtedly known to most: presented at E3 in 1997 as the second project of 3D Realms (Duke Nukem Forever should have been the first release shortly thereafter) and plunged into oblivion on the threshold of 2000, it finally found new vitality thanks to the joint action of the original software house (which supervised the project) and Human Head which stood out for Rune (an inevitable quote in an initial easter egg). After the beauty of ten years, it reaches the shelves of shops in two PC formats: the standard edition, which includes 3 CD-ROMs and the Limited edition which  unlike recent fashion  does not contain graphic additions but only the always welcome gadgets and is offered on a single DVD. There is also the Xbox 360 version.", "date": "2006-07-17", "grade": null}
