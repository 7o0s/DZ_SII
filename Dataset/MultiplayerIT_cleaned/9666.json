A clarification is urgent: Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG and as such it is a product potentially subject to changes and reversals of direction that can improve (or worsen!) its quality. However, whoever buys the game box (literally, as digital download is not possible in this case) still pays at the time of purchase so optimism and indulgence are luxuries that cannot be afforded. Having said that, the assumptions of Final Fantasy XIV were anything but negative: the MMORPG niche market has recently opened up to all types of users, a path that Square Enix had also announced its intention to follow, in contrast to the interlude other than ~casual player~ of Final Fantasy XI. The reality of the facts, game in hand, is very different from how it was painted... Stories of Eorzea? In our previous preview we discussed starting the game, creating your avatar and choosing the starting capital which determines the main storyline. Even with the limitations imposed by age, what distinguished Final Fantasy XI from the rest of the market was certainly the emphasis placed by Square Enix on the story that involves the players, an element rarely so cared for in the MMORPG market. We also expected something similar with Final Fantasy XIV, instead the initial cutscenes that introduce us to the main-quest are a real red herring: the quality of the script is undeniable but the subsequent missions, assigned only from time to time during character growth, prove to be much more disappointing. Not only is the dubbing shown off in the prologue completely missing, but they are essentially reduced to wandering from one point of the map to another to view the umpteenth, albeit excellent, cutscenes all too rarely interspersed with action or fights. The main-quest is moreover the only narrative element within the package: adapting to the now consolidated format of reward quests, Square Enix has proposed a version of its own which, in other words, leaks from all sides. Levequests are nothing more than grinding disguised as quests, in fact they require you to always and only kill a certain number of enemies to be resolved and the fact that you can choose the difficulty does not hide their basic repetitiveness and the absurd limit of eight Levequests playable every thirty-six hours, not to mention the totally random rewards in terms of money and items or the fluctuating difficulty of the enemies proposed by Levequest itself. The system designed by Square Enix, moreover, does not forgive: a crash or a disconnection will determine the failure of the Levequest in progress, which can only be attempted at the next reset. All this would be even vaguely interesting if the quests developed following a sort of plot, but in reality the themes are terribly trivial and disconnected from the surrounding universe: a Levequest may perhaps require you to chase away the monsters that are attacking a farm but soon he realizes that there are no farms anywhere, just enemies appearing in the middle of nowhere, helping to fuel the growing feeling of emptiness and incompleteness. Interface problems The most important element in any MMORPG is the interface that will be our inseparable companion for every minute, paid or not, that we spend in the virtual world. Through it the player explores, fights and interacts with other players and the surrounding environment. And that of Final Fantasy XIV is one of the worst ever made in a commercial product: the result obtained is even worse than the already questionable interface with 8 years on the shoulders of the eleventh chapter. It just doesn't work. The interface is slow, unnecessarily cluttered, and requires multiple swipes, clicks, and confirmations to perform the most superficial of actions. The drag&drop system is currently pure utopia and to interact with an element of the environment it is necessary to open the main menu and select the appropriate option, if any. Furthermore, the interface lacks the most basic functions, such as access to the various submenus by pressing special keybinds. To view an object, it is necessary to open the main menu, access the inventory (and not the separate equipment screen) and scroll through the list of objects in the bags, which cannot be organised, to find the item in question. Unnecessarily long-winded and complicated. This lack of smoothness extends mercilessly to the svamany features of the game, starting with the miserable friend-list, not to mention the Linkshell system, the equivalent of the ~guilds~ typical of MMORPGs. Square Enix has re-adopted the solution already proposed in Final Fantasy XI, the Linkshells are in fact a bit like a ~chat room~ but unlike the prequel it is possible to equip more than one at the same time. Bizarre, however, that the list of players in Linkshell only shows if they are playing or not, without providing further details. Worse still, the system seems to have been set up in a hurry: to invite or even kick out a player you have to be physically close to him (therefore it is not possible to remove someone who no longer plays) and the Leader cannot transfer his role to someone else. But on the other hand, even to invite someone to a group to play together you need to be close to them and any group is not even displayed via icons on the map. This last oddity summarizes the whole bad habit of the game: beautifully designed and detailed, but really not very functional and clear. Thankfully, the combat interface abandons Final Fantasy XI's drop-down system for a more modern shortcut bar. In reality, there are some non-negligible shortcomings here too, such as the inability to visualize a target's target or select group players on the fly, rather than scrolling through all possible targets in the surrounding area, hostile or not , by repeatedly pressing the Tab key. This structure involves many problems especially for healers and demonstrates, once again, the approximate work done by the developers. Better alone than... The basic idea is undoubtedly original and captivating. In fact, players can grow multiple professions in parallel, then mixing the various skills obtained to create a personalized set: the physical level of the character is universal and increases with the canonical experience points, while each profession has a series of Ranks linked to the relative Skill Points. Just switch weapons to change your profession, at any time. The various professions are divided into four categories, among which the most unfortunate is certainly that of the Disciples of Magic, which includes only two professions, Conjurer and Thaumaturge. On the other hand, there are many more commercial professions, but we'll get to that shortly. Despite Square Enix's statements, playing Final Fantasy XIV alone is possible, but certainly not recommended. The limit of playable Levequests imposed by the system basically forces an exasperated grinding on the enemies that hang out in the lands of Eorzea and once the twentieth Rank is exceeded the points required to grow increase exponentially, requiring several hours of grinding which are at a certain point blocked by the system Fatigue which, in a nutshell, blocks the affected profession, forcing the player to change it until the Fatigue is discharged within a few hours. The freedom of growth and progression is only apparent, in short. The alternative to monotonous solitary grinding is naturally represented by group play in which, if possible, Final Fantasy XIV manages to do its worst. Assembling a party is a real odyssey: the game offers a sort of incredibly cumbersome and obscure integrated research system that hardly anyone uses, relying instead on chat. In case you find a potential group mate, best wishes: to invite him you have to be physically in front of him. The poor balance between the professions makes it almost superfluous to build the party based on the usual archetypes and the groups are assembled almost in bulk: the important thing is to kill the enemy as quickly as possible, before someone gets killed, especially the healers who succeed to attract attention with the most insignificant magic. At this point the complete nonsense of teamwork comes to light which, incredible to say, is practically competitive: the aim should be to earn Skill Points, randomly assigned based on the damage inflicted or the life points restored, in the sense that the end of a fight it is possible to receive a certain amount of Skill Points or less or even zero split. A few practical examples are needed to understand the senselessness of the system: a good tank will receive less damage or will prevent the rest of the group from suffering it, nullifying the progress of a healer; good damage-dealers will frustrate each other's progress as the faster a target dies, the less Skill Point chance they have. From this point of view, the game system almost seems to want to reward those who play worse. One could say that it is not how the progression was thought of, but how the gShould players grow and acquire Skill Points if their only alternative is Levequests? Sent back to Economics In addition to the combat professions, Square Enix has well thought of underlining the importance of trade in Final Fantasy XIV by proposing eleven specific professions. The idea is only a partial success, needless to say: crafting is actually one of its best features due to the complexity and interactivity that distinguish it, but it is deeply undermined by various problems. In the first place, the usual interface, which makes even selecting the materials necessary for a synthesis a cumbersome and slow operation: there is no recipe book that can be consulted in the game and it is necessary to rely on the large network to know what to produce and how, despite recipes by completing the related Levequests, which however cannot be consulted later. Furthermore, already in the first Ranks one realizes that the professions are destined to intertwine with each other and the absence of a postal system or a real auction lead to fend for themselves, in a certain sense undoing the basis all the good intentions of the concept. If you decide to embark on the trade, you find that it does not exist or that it is completely in the fray. Instead of integrating an auction into the game like virtually every other MMORPG on the market, Square Enix decided to go off on a tangent with its Market Ward, pretty much the worst idea in the history of worst ideas. The Market Ward is basically an instanced area where players can place their Retainer, an NPC that plays the role of the bazaar (and can only be enabled or disabled locally). In practice, a player interested in buying something from other users must go to this large gallery and consult the bazaars or Retainers one by one. Without any search or identification function, apart from an almost superfluous division into subject areas, it goes without saying that it is the proverbial needle in a haystack. Multiply this ~ingenious~ mechanic by the three Market Wards relating to the same number of capitals, and you will easily understand how Square Enix's idea alone substantially led to the death of the economy of Eorzea. Selling or buying isn't easy, as is establishing standard prices for any type of object or ~making a name~ within an economic structure that doesn't exist. Quite simply, Final Fantasy XIV kills one of the best features of its prequel. It's incredible to think that players have to rely on browsers and information gathering websites created by the most willing and interested users. Look & company Finally we come to what should basically be the lifeline of Final Fantasy XIV, the new generation technical realization, never dared before in the MMORPG field. In fact, it has never been dared until now because a product of this type should generally be kept light and fluid in performance, which certainly cannot be said of the brick that Square Enix has codified. Final Fantasy XIV is technically heavy, there is little to say, and optimized in an almost tragicomic way. To process the graphics in maximum detail you need a very powerful machine. However, this does not mean that those who do not have a good computer will not be able to enjoy the game, which at medium details still offers excellent performance and postcard scenarios, to the detriment of obvious drops in frame-rate. The problem is actually more far-reaching. On the positive side, Final Fantasy XIV offers truly over the top character and creature modeling, supported by excellent art direction, remarkable textures and simply amazing animations. The glance of the immense panoramas is initially breathtaking, thanks also to a good game of shaders, bump mapping and glow effects, but just start exploring the surrounding environment to quickly realize a small catch: the areas are incredibly monotonous . The vastness of each area does not hide the repetitiveness of the theme in it: the almost total absence of real landmarks, excluding rare closed and deserted fortresses, makes long explorations decidedly boring, especially due to the rarefied presence of potentially hostile creatures. The obvious copy-pasting of entire geographical sections, repeated many times within the same area, does not help: basically, a panorama near Limsa Lominsa is practically identical to what you would find on the other side of the region. From time to time we stumble upon underground locations, in short, the canonical dungeons, which, unlike what was initially promised, are not instantiated at all, if anything they follow the philosophy of Final F", "date": "2010-11-10", "grade": "4.0"}
