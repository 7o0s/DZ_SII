{"name": "Endless Ocean - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/endless-ocean-recensione.html", "text": "The Wii user does not live on Mario alone, or at least this is what Nintendo believed by publishing this Endless Ocean for its very successful flagship, right in the Galaxy launch period. In reality, these are products that have nothing in common; the first, a blockbuster that has been awaited for years and which has confirmed itself as the killer app of a console already capable of achieving incredible success in some respects. The second, on the other hand, is part of the circle of niche games, which arrived on the market practically completely on the sly and destined to collect modest sales, arousing the interest of a few enthusiasts and onlookers. One thing is certain: from planets and galaxies to the depths of the abyss, there really is something for everyone on Wii... Pet therapy Created by the Arika team, already authors of that Everblue for Ps2 of which Endless Ocean is practically a sequel, the title produced by Nintendo is markedly detached from the themes and structure that unite a large part of the current videogame market. In fact, in the specific case, the intent of the programmers was basically to try to reproduce the atmosphere of scuba diving in the most faithful and realistic way possible. A game, or rather an experience therefore, which is based on themes such as exploration, contact with nature and relaxation, all united by bland rhythms and the absence of a real goal to pursue. In reality, Endless Ocean offers something similar to missions, obtainable in the form of e-mail messages, which basically require you to accompany some customers on guided tours in order to observe certain forms of marine life, or even to take photographs on commission or discover hidden treasures. But the substance does not change since the fulcrum remains immersion in the ocean, the discovery of its colors, its inhabitants, the ecosystem in which to enter as a guest by observing and admiring the wonders of nature. More contemplation than action, to summarize. But that doesn't mean that Endless Ocean isn't an inspiring product, in its own way; first of all, the cataloging component proves to be engaging, which allows you to fill a sort of marine encyclopaedia by adding the different species following direct interaction during the dives. Pointing the wiimote at a sea creature and pressing the A key switches to a first-person view that focuses on it, allowing you to interact with caresses or offering food. This allows you to obtain information on dozens and dozens of fish and mammals, definitely interesting for anyone with the slightest inclination towards this type of topic. We were talking about emails; these can be read on the deck of your sailboat, which practically acts as an interactive menu in which you can interact with the bizarre marine biologist friend of the protagonist, accept the missions, make time pass quickly, develop the photographs, move inside of the explorable area, listen to the songs from the soundtrack or examine your progress and change your appearance thanks to a whole series of gadgets and elements (wetsuits, gloves, fins, etc.) to be obtained in parallel with the progress of the adventure. It must be said that on this occasion, i.e. on the boat, Endless Ocean certainly does not show its best from a graphic point of view; on the contrary it is a rather embarrassing section, especially for the poorly detailed human polygonal models and moved by bad animations. Fortunately, however, it is only a limited section, and in other game situations the graphics engine is capable of much more... Marine control In fact, underwater, Arika's fatigue really becomes a pleasure for the eyes, with few weak points; the variety of marine fauna is excellent, with creatures ranging from plankton to whales, behaving in a believable way, joining in schools and swimming freely. In this sense, the only note goes to the animations, which could have enjoyed greater variety to reproduce the different movements of the animals more accurately. But in principle there is little to complain about, and the discreet diversification of the seabed settings helps to give a sense of real identification, of authentic participation in that unique and wonderful world that is the underwater world. And the passion of the programmers is also evident in the attention to detail, such as to guarantee the possibility of discovering something really new on every dive. As far as the control system is concerned, the decision to simply rely on the wiimote alone proved to be really spot on; to swim simply point the controller in the direction and hold down a key, and likewise the wholeinteraction with the environment and the use of objects appears immediate and appreciable. There is also a multiplayer component, with which it is possible to tackle dives in the company of a friend connected via Wi-Fi; nothing striking given the nature of the game, but a further confirmation of the care taken in the creation of this atypical product. A good quality soundtrack (replaceable, among other things, with your own selection in Mp3 on SD cart) and a sale price of 29 euros conclude the picture of an extremely sectoral ~game~, certainly not for everyone, but which the public of those who want something different and outside the box will not struggle to appreciate. Comment Endless Ocean costs 29 euros and is a decidedly atypical and original product. These two characteristics would be enough to earn Nintendo production a more than sufficient evaluation, but in general it is evident that the game in question was created with care and passion by a team with good experience in the field. Certainly there are less convincing aspects, but all in all Endless Ocean deserves to be recommended to all curious people looking for an experience very different from the typical ones that the world of video games is capable of offering. Pros Original and relaxing Good underwater graphics Apt control system Cons Section on board the boat almost unwatchable Pacing of the game for many soporific Little variety in animations", "date": "2007-11-30", "grade": null}
