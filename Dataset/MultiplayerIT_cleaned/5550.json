Inspired once again by Mexican legends and folklore, the game uses a first-person view and a structure that closely resembles dungeon crawlers, but adopting a real-time combat system completely based on the touch screen; so much so that it would not be surprising, in the near future, to see the landing of this exclusive (storm?) for PlayStation Vita on iOS and Android devices. The story is told in fragments and intuitions: Sasha, the protagonist of the adventure, is a strong and determined girl who doesn't give up even when she finds herself with a severed arm. Grasping a mysterious sword, she decides to find out what happened to her father, mother and brother; and if possible to save them, breaking the spell that has trapped them in a dream dimension. Severed is an original and fascinating title, undoubtedly one of the most interesting for PlayStation Vita Nightmare journey Severed is in many ways a style exercise for the guys at DrinkBox Studios, who felt the need to try a different experience before working on a very discounted Guacamelee! 2. The atmosphere of the game is great and is built through very well studied sequences, dialogues with disturbing creatures that we don't know whether to fear or to trust, from the monstrous ~old woman~ to the eyeless bird with two heads, both talking, that at some point he will offer us his help. The battle seems desperate, yet the protagonist of the game has no intention of giving up and will learn, throughout the story, to face any danger by brandishing his sword and using some magical objects that he will come into possession of. As mentioned at the beginning, the structure of Severed is very reminiscent of dungeon crawlers with a first person view, also because the maps are made up of ~blocks~ to be accessed with a single step, but which must be observed closely to grasp the presence of vases and fruits: the former can hide objects useful for crafting related to upgrades, the latter instead restore part of our vital energy. In the upper part of the screen it is possible to call up the map at any time, so as to orient oneself in case one does not know where to go. Only in the advanced stages, however, does locating the destination become a problem to be solved through environmental puzzles, finding keys, activating switches and so on. Cutting The combat system plays a major role in Severed. At first it seems almost trivial, after all we are simply asked to ~draw~ the trajectory of our blows on the touch screen, exactly as happened in the blockbuster Fruit Ninja. The difference, not insignificant, is that each enemy has a particular attack pattern and weak points that must necessarily be memorized, so as to repel their blows in order not to suffer huge damage and sink the sword into the most appropriate moment their meats. At the end of the duel we will also be able to finish off the enemy by cutting off specific parts of the body, during a bullet time from which to obtain some objects to collect. As the story progresses, new and more powerful opponents will be introduced, some of which have ~rocky~ parts that must be broken through a charged slash, and at certain times we will also have to deal with dangerous bosses. Later things will get complicated, because the enemies will begin to attack us in groups and we will therefore have to try to do what has been said so far by dividing ourselves among several targets, switching from one monster to another using the PlayStation Vita analog stick or once again the touch screen ; until you get to the frankly impossible situations in the final part, in which you not only have to duel with very strong monsters, but also eliminate them quickly to avoid certain death. To face such a onerous challenge, the character's enhancement can be taken care of using the objects collected around, real alchemical ingredients to improve power, resistance and other characteristics, but the doubt that the developers have pressed their hand a bit the final phase actually comes, between one curse and another. Luckily the game over is not punitive and you immediately return to the previous point of the map: thank goodness! PSVita trophies Severed includes twenty-five Trophies that are obtained by completing the various stages of the game, but also more complex achievements, linked to the elimination of a certain number of enemies or to the discovery of all the secrets hidden in the settings. Art in motion It is no coincidence that we were talking about an exercise in style, given that Severed does not make particular use of the hardware on which it runs, but manages to communicate a lot thanks to what is now the consolidated style of DrinkBox Studios, the same seen in Guacamelee! , tending towards cartoon atmospheres which however, never as in this case, clash profoundly with the story being told. Sasha and the members of her family are characterized by angular features, the scenarios boast an essential design and the monsters refer to a disturbing imaginary between mushrooms-cyclops, birds capable of dividing into many smaller versions, squat creatures equipped with a single, enormous arm , flying eyes protected by a mobile barrier and so on. To effectively accompany the action we find an essential sound but with a great atmosphere, perfectly functional to what is happening on the screen. A side note relating to the controls: using the PlayStation Vita analog stick even during the fights it is necessarily necessary to place the console somewhere, and from an ergonomic point of view this solution is not exactly very comfortable. Falling back on the touch screen alone, things work better, provided you change your grip at each new duel: perhaps even allowing movement via touch would have made everything simpler and more coherent.", "date": "2016-04-26", "grade": "8.5"}
