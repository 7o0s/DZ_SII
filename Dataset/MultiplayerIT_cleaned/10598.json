{"name": "Il grande ritorno delle avventure grafiche", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/a-vampyre-story-recensione.html", "text": "Let's face it: despite the good adventure games released in recent years, we miss the LucasArts titles a lot. It's not for nothing that we continually refer to the ~Lucas style~ when trying to define a certain way of conceiving the genre. Furthermore, it must be said that the adventures have not taken big steps forward since then, especially as regards the game interfaces, and therefore they still appear very tied to that primitive vision, from which they cannot detach themselves .. and who knows if they will ever succeed to do it completely and, above all, if they really want to do it. A Vampyre Story was announced in 2004 by an ex-Lucas, Bill Tiller, that to continue making point and click titles he founded his own production company (Autumn Moon Entertainment), after he was forced to abandon a project aborted by Lucas . We owe him above all The Curse of Monkey Island, the third chapter of the saga starring the naive Guybrush Threepwood, of which he took care of all the graphics (probably the most successful aspect of the game). His visual style, a cross between pictorial and cartoon, is also clearly recognizable in his latest effort, which fans from all over the world have been waiting for like a godsend, hoping for a grand revival of the genre but, above all, in a new masterpiece to play. In A Vampyre Story you take on the role of Mona De La Fitte, an aspiring opera singer vampirized and locked up in a castle in Draxsylvania by an evil dwarf and megalomaniac baron: Shrowdy Von Kiefer. The vampire woman dreams of being able to escape to return to the Parisian stage. To make it, he can only count on the help of the talking bat Froderick, his inseparable traveling companion, and on the Baron's unexpected death. Radical vision The game view is in the third person, therefore in Lucas's classic style, and the interface is also very classic, with the left mouse button used to interact with objects and with the elements of the scenario; interactions that, as genre commands, vary according to the context. The right mouse button, on the other hand, is used to access the inventory and to quickly move from one location to another, without waiting every time for Mona to go all the way. The player is obviously called to collect and use objects, perhaps after combining them in the inventory, and to talk to the characters, all to solve the many puzzles that divide him from the final. Despite the deliberately radical style, which concedes nothing to some of the gimmicks so disliked by the most poisoned adventurers (the arcade sub-games... brrrrr, a shiver runs down our spine just to mention them), often strung by force just to try to make an adventure more attractive to the masses (with dubious results), some novelties are present. In reality, more than news, we can talk about ~loans~. Consider, for example, the role of Froderick, who must be used as if it were an object for solving some puzzles; older gamers will immediately think of Sam & Max: Hit the Road (Lucas' original, not the more recent series). Another gimmick, also already tested in one of Lucas' adventures, consists in not having Mona collect the bulkiest objects, which are entered in the inventory in the form of memories, however accessible as normal objects in times of need. Being a vampire, Mona has some powers that will help her escape, namely she can transform into a bat and, later in the game, she can bite humans. However, its nocturnal nature is the cause of some problems, such as a certain allergy to garlic and crosses, which are exploited in some situations. Curiosity Yes we know, the game was already reviewed some time ago. The novelty is that Multiplayer.it Edizioni has now taken over the distribution, in a new package including subtitles in Italian, so as to allow anyone to play this excellent graphic adventure. Enjoy... ehm, enjoy it! Style and bugs Visually speaking, A Vampyre Story does not disappoint expectations, making Tiller's style immediately recognizable and preponderant. Scenarios designed in splendid 2D are associated with 3D characters who, despite the most pessimistic forecasts, do not stand out too much and are well blended. The many years of development have made it possible to create a title with a remarkable stylistic compactness, without sudden drops in quality or less well-finished scenarios than others. Someone may find the protagonist unpleasant, but it must be considered that some of her attitudes are wanted, in honor of her origins and her ambition: after all, she is a very bored aspiring Parisian opera singerto who is trying to escape from a castle, where he has only a bat as a friend. To balance the situation is Froderick himself, with whom Mona creates a perfect comic couple capable of withering entr'actes. The humor that runs through the game is overflowing with quotes (the title itself is). There are so many that discovering them is a game within a game. Of course, if you are unable to grasp them, the overall picture loses some of its charm, but it is a calculated risk. To be less calculated are some bugs that infest the product. Despite the release of a patch, some problems have not been solved. For example, we were unable to see the ending with antialiasing set to maximum (just turn it off before the final sequence and everything goes smooth as oil), or sometimes the three-dimensional models appeared corrupted for brief moments. Nothing insurmountable actually, but given the years of development certain inaccuracies could have been avoided. However, an excellent graphic adventure that deserves to be played and that will make fans of the genre happy.", "date": "2009-07-30", "grade": "8.6"}
