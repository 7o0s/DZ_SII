Dozens of covers left to the short and chubby one, with the whole world making the words ~video games~ to ~Mario~ almost two synonyms; but you know, money, fame and overexposure make people a little unsympathetic in the eyes of the people, while on the contrary, losers seem more human, real and believable. And then who knows, maybe fate can present the bill and reverse the roles from one day to the next. We can't say if Luigi's future will be studded with gratifications and joys, but we can undoubtedly say that the present represents a moment that the mustachioed and somewhat dumb Italian plumber in the T-shirt and green hat will want to fully enjoy. Because this, as President Iwata announced, will be ~the Year of Luigi~. Welcome! A long rest Overturning the rules of ~dulcis in fundo~, the celebrations of this event seem to offer the best from the very beginning; March 2013 is in fact the moment in which Luigi can go back to enjoying a game of his own, the sequel to the beautiful (and underrated) Luigi's Mansion for Gamecube which debuted in Japan in September 2001 together with the boxy console. Over 11 years of waiting for a sequel are very many, yet evidently the priorities in Kyoto were different; and although the use of the Wiimote could well be combined with that of the vacuum cleaner, Luigi's Mansion 2 has not found its way to either the Wii or even the Wii U. On the contrary, it took the 3DS, and several months of waiting from the reveal of the E3 2011 conference, to finally see that good man Luigi dealing with ghosts and assorted sprites. Luckily, the wait paid off in full. The plot of Luigi's Mansion 2 is obviously full of references that players of the first chapter will be able to appreciate; in summary, everything runs smoothly in Cupavalle where Professor Strambic and the ghosts live in love and harmony thanks to the positive influences of the Dark Moon, capable of keeping the ectoplasms calm and peaceful. But when the moon mysteriously shatters, things change: the whole valley is covered by a thick fog, the ghosts become hostile and the professor is forced to take refuge in a bunker. And who to call to fix things, if not good friend Luigi who had already solved similar problems in the past? Not that the improvised hero had all this desire to get off the couch to tell the truth, but when duty calls... Based on this narrative canvas, and on the need to recover the pieces of the Dark Moon, the whole adventure comes to life which basically takes place inside five different and huge houses, obviously completely different from each other in terms of architecture and aesthetic style , towards which the professor teleports poor Luigi continuously and without too many compliments. A vacuum cleaner will save us Those who have enough spring on their shoulders to have played the progenitor on Gamecube will not really struggle to find themselves at ease in the action-adventure play structure developed by the Canadians of Next Level Games; in fact, exactly as at the time, Luigi found himself carrying out his ghost-bustering activity relying only on a sort of vacuum cleaner designed by Strambic himself, the Poltergust 5000 evolution of the Poltergust 3000 of 11 years ago. The capabilities of the instrument in question are basically resolved in the ability to suck in and blow air and, thanks to special accessories, to illuminate portions of the scenery with a normal torch or a colorful Arcobaluce. With the latter you can basically reveal objects and portions of the scenario made invisible, with a whole series of practical implications that this entails in puzzles and in the simple collection of objects. The greatest value of Luigi's Mansion 2 is therefore precisely that of having managed to offer a product that is so respectful and faithful to the original in the concept, but at the same time capable of expanding and expanding it without distorting it in the most absolute way. The game designers have in fact found an almost perfect balance between the element of ~combat~, or the capture of ghosts, and that of exploration and the solution of environmental puzzles characterized by an extraordinary variety. The first aspect is essentially expressed just like on the Gamecube: the ghosts are almost always first stunned with the torch, and then sucked in with the Poltergust by applying a force contrary to the escape direction of the unfortunate ectoplasm with the analog stick, a bit as in a fishing game to be clear. If ghostssmaller and more common ones can only be a problem when they appear in groups, with the bigger ones the fight becomes interesting, either for the greater energy that requires a longer period of struggle, or for offensive skills of various types. However, where there is a need to commit a little is in the boss fights, which in each of the five villas bring decidedly more complex and elaborate situations to the table, perhaps not always equally brilliant but with a variety that proves to be fundamental in the overall economy. However, it is in the second element, that is the exploratory one, that the programmers have best expressed their creativity, giving Luigi's Mansion 2 that depth which determines and outlines its success. Most of the elements that make up the scenarios can in fact be explored by simply pressing the X key: drawers, vases, wardrobes and so on, perhaps to collect coins and gold with which to enhance your equipment, or even to discover the less pleasant hiding place of some spider, mouse or even ghost. But obviously this is only the most superficial and simple solution of interaction with the settings, which instead finds maximum expression when it comes to solving the puzzles that literally fill every villa, whether these are fundamental for progression or rather useful only for increasing the collection of extras and the like. Let me be clear, it is very difficult to get stuck because these are almost never particularly complex puzzles, yet the variety of situations devised by the team responsible for the game is truly commendable. The decision then to fragment the progression into missions (6 + one extra in almost all the villas) with precise objectives to be achieved is successful, because it thickens the progression without lending itself to dead ends and overshadows the inevitable backtracking relating to need to visit the same rooms several times; each mission can be completed in approximately 20 to 40 minutes, an ideal time in our opinion. The 3D effect Undoubtedly one of the most convincing uses of the peculiarity of the 3DS, Luigi's Mansion 2 guarantees an element of depth that never appears, not even for a second, as an end in itself but on the contrary with extraordinary naturalness increases the spectacularity of the sumptuous graphic component of the production Nintendo. A painting for Mario Analyzing only the game structure of Luigi's Mansion 2, the result is a very good game, well balanced in terms of pace and progression, fun, rather simple but equally rewarding. But the aspect that in fact allows Nintendo production to take flight is undoubtedly the graphic component, or more properly artistic, and the characterization of even the smallest element, with such care and quality as to determine and significantly affect on the pleasure and the stimulus to continue the adventure. First of all him, Luigi: irresistible, extraordinary, trembling in the face of danger and hesitant before opening any door, terrified of any ghost but still unable to refuse the missions that the professor gives him. He is an improbable but incredibly communicative hero even if he only squashes a few words every now and then, maybe a ~hello~ or an ~oh yeah~: let's not exaggerate by saying that, even with the right proportions, Luigi's Mansion 2 recalls the Pixar films in this respect. Looks, expressions and attitudes help to determine a sense of affection with the protagonist that only a few other video games are able to achieve. Obviously such attention could not fail to be realized also in the animations, and we bet that many will lose the first few hours with a smile on their face simply admiring the work done by the Canadian team. More generally, it is the whole world of Luigi's Mansion 2 that recalls a cartoon, and it is every character and ghost that you meet that appears alive, vibrant, present, concrete, overflowing with personality and charisma. We don't want to exaggerate in hyperbole and superlatives, but when you move the curtain of a shower to discover a ghost busy washing himself, or when in a bathroom you discover another one sitting on the toilet while reading the newspaper, or even when you cross a couple who are playing morra it is quite clear that we are dealing with a product that is at least special. But not perfect for this, mind you; beyond a subtle repetitiveness that emerges on the final bars (with the last mission before the final boss unnecessarily frustrating and uninspired), Luigi's Mansion 2 does everything to try to make people forget about the absence of a second analog stick, yet more than a few moments you may find yourself a bit annoyed dto a control system that would have greatly benefited from the additional stick. The choice then to impose the complete repetition of the mission in the event of death seemed out of place for a certainly non-punitive title like this; undoubtedly given the not particularly demanding level of difficulty it will not be a situation destined to arise often, yet we found it an inappropriate choice. The frame rate is also inconstant, destined to suffer on occasion in the more complex scenes. Having said that, it is in any case a matter of slight smudges in the face of a product of very, very rare quality especially on laptops; even the multiplayer component for up to 4 people with 3 modes that are sufficiently different from each other, is far from a forced side element but on the contrary a very worthy and convincing way to extend the longevity of the game well beyond the approximately 12-15 hours necessary for conclude the main adventure (it took us just under 14 to get to the end), excluding the extra missions and the collection of all the gems. Finally, the sound component is also first class, both for the wonderful background tracks that are always perfectly spot on and for the effects.", "date": "2013-03-21", "grade": "9.2"}
