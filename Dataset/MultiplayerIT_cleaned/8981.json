It is clear that achieving those levels of realism and visual detail is a challenge often beyond the reach of smaller projects, but smaller teams use UDK to have tools that allow them to enhance particular, engaging and stylish atmospheres, regardless of the actual game quality. Just think of dream:scape or the fascinating Dark Meadow, for example. Then, unfortunately, there are games that claim to be made with Unreal Engine and then propose a flat, monotonous and personalityless aesthetic, which perhaps ends up weighing down a game mechanic that all in all starts from good premises and, moreover, demonstrates itself graphically mediocre when compared to more ambitious projects. This, without going too far, is exactly the case of Gyro13. A helicopter to be scrapped With Gyro13: Steam Copter Arcade HD, the developers of the Cinemax team have brought an arcade game to mobile devices whose mechanics are partly reminiscent of those of the excellent PixelJunk Shooter for PlayStation Network. In fact, while lacking the particular interaction with fluids that characterized the Q-Games game, even here the aim is to pilot a rescue ship inside a cave full of dangers in an attempt to find and save a series of missing miners . Learning to move forward or backward, losing or gaining altitude, requires some practice on the part of the player, so much so that it is really unlikely to baptize the very first attempt without a disastrous crash on the rock face. Some basic ideas work quite well, with the ship regaining energy at each checkpoint and having to bring as many survivors to the base before the cavern fills with toxic gas; moreover, already after a few levels you have to deal with floating mines, air currents, automatic platforms and a whole series of obstacles aimed at complicating the player's life. Yet despite the developers' efforts to add some variety to the gameplay, overall Gyro13 fails due to huge interface or design issues: hurling a shockwave to detonate bombs forces you to leave either levers for a certain period of time, risking losing control of the ship in too delicate points of the level. Being able to use a sort of tractor beam to ~suck~ the missing away from the landing points is a difficult and frustrating undertaking, while even more annoying is seeing some miners approach the ship at a very slow pace and burn up all the precious seconds gained from the start of the level. As if that weren't enough, some technical ugliness gets in the way so, inexplicably, often crashing straight into a wall causes much less damage than touching it. Of course, in the event that the ship should destroy itself, it is always possible to start over from the last checkpoint, but a handful of seconds of penalty is given to each new attempt, which, considering how little time is available to the player, inevitably leads to restart a level after just a couple of crashes. Finally, at the beginning of the article we mentioned the problematic graphic component, which despite being technically of a good level is ruined both by a monotonous and not at all charismatic style, and by some quite questionable combinations: the same backdrops often end up misleading the player, and it is not always possible to easily understand if a certain obstacle is in the background or if your ship risks hitting it and being damaged. Even if the signs along the way suggest the direction to take, neither does the total lack of an on-screen indicator, a map or the impossibility of moving the camera away, with the result that, not knowing what awaits him, the player all too frequently ends up hitting unexpected obstacles.
