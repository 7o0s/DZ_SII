The German company has evidently thought well, as many have been doing in recent times, of developing their most famous brand also on the Nintendo DS, an incredibly successful portable with features that are well suited to this kind of game. The main purpose is to conquer, colonize and defend a territory, then trying to fulfill all the needs of our people by allowing them to advance to the next levels of civilization. The main purpose is to conquer, colonize and populate a territory The adventure begins The latter are five, and start from ~pioneer~, continuing with ~Settlers~, ~Citizens~, ~Merchants~ up to the last one, ~Aristocrats~. Anno 1701 begins with a series of comic strips that work as an intro for the game and in which the story is briefly shown to us: an elderly King dreamed of discovering a new world and sent a fleet to discover what was other part of the known lands. Only part of the fleet turned back, confirming that one of the two captains had betrayed the crown. The King grew old and his daughter continued to explore, but meanwhile the irascible Queen Eliza plotted her own plans to colonize the New World. story, continuous play and multiplayer With the story mode, which includes an excellent and exhaustive tutorial to learn all the main commands, you set off to conquer the New World through five chapters, which are in turn divided into different missions. By selecting ~continuous game~ instead, it is possible to set the level of difficulty of the opponent, its speed of construction, its commercial and military potential, as well as any type of settings regarding the game map, the number of islands , size, distance and their fertility. It is essentially about creating our ~ideal game~ and starting the game without a precise story to follow but only with the aim of conquering and managing the territory. In the last option, you can decide to play up to 4 friends a network game over Wi-Fi in a local LAN. In this mode, players start the game in the center of the map with a ship loaded with gold and building materials. Depending on the victory conditions chosen, the mission can range from building a large city to having to defeat other players in combat. It is also possible to exchange ~tributes~ between players, sending goods and money to eventual winners. Unfortunately, an option to play online via Nintendo Wi-Fi was not included, an option that would have greatly increased the longevity (already excellent) of this title. The fun game of the little colonizer In the story mode you start the game arriving with your ship on a still virgin and unexplored territory. Our task will be to colonize it, build houses, factories and warehouses in order to advance our civilization. Anno, as previously happened in Age of Empires, takes full advantage of the touch screen as an interface, thus bringing all the functionality of the mouse back to the stylus. The lower screen is therefore the main one, which displays the map and the interactive elements, while the upper one is used to convey information and display data and statistics. Everything is therefore designed to be done using the stylus and the touch screen, from moving around the map to selecting the available actions. Through the options menu, however, it is possible to set quick commands to be assigned to all the available keys of our Nintendo DS, a bit like on PC with the ~macros~. It is immediately noticeable that although the game is deep and complex, with its innumerable options and executable actions, all the control is extremely simple and intuitive, working by dragging when there is a need to move the map, and by pointing when there is it is to select objects and things. In the upper screen are all the statistics in real time, information on what we select, and help from our trusty ~adviser~ who always tells us what to do in the most difficult moments. There is also a zoom function that allows us to go and see what is happening on the map up close. The game phases are mainly divided into three parts: exploration, construction and combat. In the first we have to look for new territories to colonize, in the next to build and evolve our ppopulation, and in the third to engage in battles and duels with other populations. It is possible to send ships to look for other islands to conquer, and if we manage to find a new territory, the vessel will be dismembered to build a new warehouse which will serve as a starting point for the new colonization. The Battles of the New World Anno 1701 boasts a myriad of objects, houses, items and things to craft. We need to produce wood for building, food to feed the people, warehouses to concentrate goods, construct public buildings such as schools and churches, defensive structures to protect against war and disease, armies to fight and lavish buildings to meet the standard of living of our population. After exploring and laying the foundations for our own little civilization, we can also fight and conquer new territories. Before doing this you need to build barracks, troops and warships for the occasion. The army serves both to attack but also to defend itself: it is a top priority to erect defense barriers and train troops. To attack enemy islands we have to move our combat ships, choose a landing point and direct our soldiers towards the crucial points to be conquered: every enemy building that comes under our control will work for us. In combat, the game is very similar to a ~Command and Conquer~, there is strategy, there is action and above all there is a lot to think before acting on the field. Another very important element, in addition to those of ~construction~ and combat, is trade, through which it is possible to increase our earnings. The prices of the goods are not fixed but vary according to the current market conditions, thus showing a very good AI by the CPU. the game is very similar to a ~Command and Conquer~, there is strategy, there is action and above all there is a lot to think before acting on the field Trade works the same in all three game modes: our goods are stored in the global market, and opening its menu gives access to all the goods that we can sell, buy and available stocks. The parameters and options to keep an eye on are definitely many, and fortunately the design of the game allows you to follow everything in a decidedly comfortable and intuitive way. By touching the screen with the stylus you ~grab~ the map and you can move it in any direction, the only limitation is that you cannot change the viewing angle as the graphics are still in 2D and the sprites cannot rotate . In the 3D version on PC it is instead possible to watch the action from every view so that it is easier to understand what is happening even behind large buildings or constructions. The graphics sector is still excellent, full of bitmaps and animations on the screen. Each element is well defined and excellently made, and even with the lower screen full of objects it is possible to distinguish everything very well, even in spite of the size of the playing field. The music is very relaxing loops with the flavor of good video games from the 80s, sweet and reassuring melodies that cradle us during hours and hours of uninterrupted play without becoming tedious or repetitive. Year 1701: At the Dawn of the Discoveries - Review Anno 1701: The Dawning of Discovery is a great Nintendo DS title, a very good surprise and an addictive RTS. The game is a good cross between a management game, a Command and Conquer style war RTS and an exotic adventure. The design is studied down to the smallest detail and is extremely effective in making the two screens of our Nintendo DS contain the flood of information we need and the play area excellently created with isometric 2D graphics. Anno 1701 is deep, tactical, complete and fun: you have to manage, build, expand and fight, all in a very intuitive and simple way with the exclusive use of the stylus and the touch screen. A Wi-Fi mode on the internet could perhaps have been included which would have made this title practically eternal. Not recommended for anyone who doesn't like this particular genre There is a genre of video games which by its very nature is difficult to make on consoles, and even in the rare times it has appeared on the screens of our TVs it has never had the success it perhaps deserved. Surely the fault lies entirely with the controls that are too complex to perform with a joypad: we are obviously talking about the genre of management and strategy. The analog sticks of traditional consoles were certainly no match for the immediacy and funity of the Nintendo DS touch screen, similar in many ways to the touch of a PC mouse, the platform on which these games have made history and fortune. In recent times we have been witnessing a real invasion of RTS on the Nintendo laptop, not only thanks to the perfect controls but also because they are titles that are very suitable to be enjoyed anywhere. DS evidently continues to confirm itself as the ideal machine for portable transpositions of the most famous RTS for PC, as Keen Games demonstrates by announcing one of its most successful titles: Anno, which has been reworked for the occasion in order to make the most of the double screen and stylus, just like the conversion of the famous Age of Empires.", "date": "2007-06-20", "grade": null}
