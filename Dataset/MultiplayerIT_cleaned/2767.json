{"name": "Frostborn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/frostborn-recensione.html", "text": "The Frostborn review catapults us back into the magical and glacial atmospheres that characterize the Viking epic, all the rage in this period also thanks to the success of Assassin's Creed Valhalla. The title of Kefir Games, available in the traditional freemium format on iOS and Android, however, offers a very different experience compared to Ubisoft's action RPG. We are speaking of an extremely classic survival in its mechanics and even in the way of representing them visually, through the tried and true isometric three-quarter view that we've seen used in several classics of the genre over the past few decades. In the role of an immortal warrior, of which we will be able to choose gender and class of belonging, our goal will be to grow and build an ever richer and more important outpost. Gameplay As mentioned at the beginning, Frostborn's gameplay is based on traditional survival mechanics. Once our character has been created, we will literally find ourselves in our underwear, about to leave to create a new settlement, and there we will be able to begin to familiarize ourselves with the game's crafting system and the inevitable collection of resources (wood, stone, leaves, skins , etc.) to be able to create various objects. There are no specific tutorials, therefore you will happen to proceed a little by groping and only realize after a while that you have perhaps wasted many opportunities to be able to give your character a dignified outfit ( hat, dressing gown, trousers and boots), as well as more effective weapons than the basic spear in order to be able to defeat the enemies who often and willingly infest the surrounding forests. A rich list of achievements always provides the objective of the turn, starting from basic tasks to get to slightly more multifaceted missions but only after several hours. As mentioned, we will have to try not only to grow our warrior (possibly unlocking new classes), but also his settlement, which could be attacked at a certain point. Given the not exactly friendly degree of difficulty, especially in the early stages, we will be able to take advantage of a very interesting feature, the cooperative mode, and therefore find other users to collaborate with to organize expeditions in the most dangerous areas of the map. In terms of resources of course it will be worth it. We talked about the enemies that we will find to guard some places, and that they will be stronger and more resistant depending on the degree of difficulty indicated before accessing these scenarios. Well, beyond the lack of novelty with respect to the genre to which it belongs, Frostborn's major flaw is undoubtedly its combat system, which does not value the impacts in the slightest and ends up trivializing the clashes with its inconsistency and slipperiness. pity, because in terms of touch controls and interface management, the developers have done a great job, giving us a simple and functional system, to support a structure that however exploits the consumable nature of all objects, sometimes a little excessive , to try to push us towards microtransactions. Technical realization If in terms of sound, the Frostborn experience immediately reveals itself to be relatively poor and not very incisive, there is no doubt that from the point of view of graphics, the guys from Kefir Games have done a good job. Here too nothing revolutionary or particularly detailed, indeed the references to a dated approach are clear and are expressed with the inevitable recycling of assets within the scenarios. However, the sheer quantity of different objects and characters available, as well as the fluidity of frame rate and general responsiveness of the game on iPad Pro make the title a pleasure to watch and play. Perhaps with future updates the authors will also be able to give greater depth to the fights, as mentioned the weakest aspect of an otherwise very valid presentation and in any case always functional to the action.", "date": "2020-11-26", "grade": "7.6"}
