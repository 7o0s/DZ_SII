However, the esoteric world does not only live in Harry Potter and friends: even a small provincial town, like Dead Hawg, can very well have its own school, attended (like all schools) by more or less able students. However, one of the less smart ones, more out of desperation of the teachers lacking alternatives than for real merits, will finally have the opportunity to win the esteem of the teaching staff in Solomon's Keep: it's just a pity that the exam he is about to undergo does not properly among those of the normal didactic... Harry Potter in Diablo sauce On the summit of Mount Awful, a stone's throw from the city of Dead Hawg, stands a hideous and crumbling tower, residence of the terrible dark lord Solomon, whose malefic curriculum boasts experiences in necromancy, assassins and evil spells of various kinds. The young protagonist of Solomon's Keep is therefore entrusted by the now hopeless teaching staff with one last task, valid as the final exam for the qualification of magician: to defeat the nefarious Solomon. Beyond the apparent disproportion of this latest test, the plot of the title in question is only a foothold on which to base the exploration and battles of this classic Action-RPG with a top view. In complete darkness, weakly illuminated only by the light of the magic staff (which also represents the main weapon supplied), the wizard bravely (and a pinch of recklessness) faces each floor of the tower, made up of random dungeons full of enemies of all types. The random generation of labyrinths and monsters is essentially the only element that gives the title a good variety, allowing you to be able to replay it every time aware of always facing different situations. The enemies that can be faced vary by nature and type of attack: in the close-ups, in fact, only skeletons, zombies and goblins without weapons or powers are faced, easily eliminated thanks to the fireballs thrown from the stick; continuing in the adventure, however, the simple melee attacks will be joined by long-distance ones, using arrows or spells, as well as with the sneaky poison. There are also boss battles, which must be tackled differently from time to time, analyzing the monster's behavior and thus exploiting its weaknesses. Simultaneously with the enemies, obviously, the skills of the little protagonist will also increase in level upon reaching a certain number of kills: in this way it will be possible to enhance both the range and fire intensity of the stick, and the effectiveness of the extra spells, based on from tradition on rings of fire, protective circles, lightning and on a comfortable super speed, ideal for dodging projectiles hurled from afar. The magician then has two bars at his disposal, positioned in the upper part of the game hud: the red one indicates the health level, the blue one that of Mana, very important ~fuel~ for the fireballs launched; while to recover the life it will be necessary to collect the red orbs left by the enemy corpses, the Mana will regenerate automatically, even if it is possible to find blue ~orbs~ to speed up the loading. In the levels there are also chests full of gold, which once accumulated will allow you to sell or buy objects and talismans in the village shop: to reach the merchant, the young wizard can use a magic key, capable of opening a direct portal between the dungeon in which it is located and the shop, to then return once the purchases are finished. In addition to regenerating potions for life and Mana, it is possible to buy magic sticks and rings with particular properties (defense from poison, greater increase in Mana, increase in attack strength, etc.); you can equip up to two rings in addition to your favorite staff. With each increase in the experience level (up to 21), it is possible to improve one characteristic among three random choices: depending on what will appear, you can increase the firepower, enlarge the health or Mana bar or increase the level of the spells extra, thus trying to make the best tactical choice. Graphically speaking, Solomon's Keep literally offers light and shadow: in fact, darkness reigns supreme throughout all phases of the game and there is very little to say about the small portion of the visible environment. Even if the general technical quality is good and the light effects are well done, the problem of the monotonous level design definitely stands out which, despite the aforementioned random dungeons, risks making the player bored; some quick eexcursion on small external terraces certainly cannot solve this aspect of the game. Then the animations of movement are absent, covered by the wide brims of the hat: however, the appearance of the magician appears sketchy probably due to an artistic choice. However, a small applause goes to the simple and effective control system: without virtual analog sticks, the movement of the protagonist is entrusted to a wheel placed on the left, whose movement will indicate the direction of movement of the magician as long as it is pressed; another wheel on the right will take care of the attacks instead. Finally, music and sound effects are standard, certainly less cared for than the rest of the production. Price: 0.79 The tested version is 2.21 App Store links", "date": "2010-10-25", "grade": "7.0"}
