{"name": "Urban Attack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/urban-attack.html", "text": "The fundamental resources available to programmers have always been creativity and ingenuity: the first allows you to create something valid, the second to do it even in difficult conditions. At the time of the Commodore 64, shrewd characters like Jeff Minter even exploited the bugs of the machine to obtain particular effects in their games. In the current video game market, situations of this type are now more unique than rare: the connotation of a product is based on consumer tastes and only on them, with the result that we are full of sequels but running out of ideas. And if experimentation has become almost impossible in contexts where the development of a game costs millions of dollars, the aforementioned creativity and ingenuity have had to find alternative outlets, which are manifested in a thriving branch such as wireless gaming. Urban Attack is not an original product in terms of mechanics, but it is for the way it was conceived and developed. It is to all intents and purposes a shooter (one might say ~with a gun~...) in which you have to eliminate the enemies that appear on the screen from time to time, before they have time to attack us. Our Yuri moves to the various locations following the orders of his commander, unable to do otherwise due to his nature as a cyborg. The game makes clear references to the film ~Robocop~, moreover producing real homages to the ~mecha design~ seen in the film directed by Paul Verhoeven. The action takes place in a linear way: Yuri moves from one place to another and stops to start a combat session, during which we will have to use the 1 to 9 keys on the numeric pad of the mobile phone to hit the enemies in the nine different areas of the screen, thus moving the crosshair on a predefined grid. The command becomes manual only when using the sniper rifle, which involves zooming in on the target and moving the cursor to hit it from a great distance. But the starting pistol and the sniper rifle aren't the only weapons that we can use in Urban Attack, which also has the presence of the machine gun and the rifle, with different results on the screen and a different area of impact. Between one burst and another we mustn't forget to reload the weapon, of course: being without bullets in critical moments means allowing enemies to hit us, and taking too much damage translates into a ~stasis~ from which we can recover through a simple minigame (which is added to those present to open locks and so on). On some occasions it will happen to abandon the shooter phases and face skill tests, such as when we have to drive a runaway train to avoid a disaster. As mentioned above, Urban Attack boasts a very particular realization, which uses even simple black and white vector graphics to represent the locations and enemies, to which some spot colors are added. Our character only moves between one game session and another, so it must be clarified that we are not dealing with a first person shooter at all, but a simple shooter with a viewfinder. If the starting idea for the graphics is undoubtedly original, unfortunately it cannot be said that it is also effective: the Vivendi title has obvious limitations in terms of design, in some scenarios we will see enemies walking ~in the air~ without respecting the lines of the setting and, in general, the choice of monochrome graphics clashes with the good things we have seen in the mobile sector in recent times. It is clear that the movements that Yuri performs in moving between one stage and another could not be obtained using color polygonal graphics and perhaps with textures, but it is also clear that in the absence of this type of possibility alternative paths could have been chosen , which would have made Urban Attack certainly more spectacular. Little to add as regards the sound sector (consisting of some well-made music) and the control system, which responds promptly to inputs and is particularly immediate.
