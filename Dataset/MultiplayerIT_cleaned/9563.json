Unlike the average iPhone user, those who have long been linked to the big brands and the most famous IP console releases seem to have a far from positive opinion. The reason, it is useless to hide it, concerns the particular policy of the French giant, aimed not so much at creating innovative and original games, as at exploiting the initial disinterest of the big publishers towards the App Store to grind real clones of the titles that have been more successful in recent years. And so here Hero of Sparta looks outrageously similar to a God of War, N.O.V.A. presents itself as the half-brother found in a random chapter of Halo, while the name is not the only thing in common between Modern Combat and Modern Warfare. Eternal Legacy, one of the games in Gameloft's massive Christmas lineup, fits exactly at the tail end of this trend, offering iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad owners a JRPG that draws in all respects from the most famous Final Fantasy, starting from the choices stylistic and arriving at the game mechanics. Where have I seen this before? Going around it is of little use: the similarities between the Square-Enix series and the new Gameloft title are impressive. Starting with the plot which, just like in some of the most important chapters of the Japanese franchise, sees a group of young rebels oppose an evil empire which, in a not too veiled way, seeks to expand its dominion to the detriment of nature and the unfortunate inhabitants. There is no shortage of the usual clichs, as if to demonstrate that the developers have made both the best and the worst of the genre. And do we want to talk about the design of the characters? From bizarre hairstyles to flamboyant clothes, passing through the type of weapons and the characterization of the protagonists: Astrian, the player's alter-ego, carries a huge sword on his shoulders very similar to that of Cloud Strife, while the young daughter of the king looks a lot like the beautiful Rinoa seen in Final Fantasy VIII. The kingdom of Algoad is dotted with fascinating settings that mix fantasy and science fiction elements, which can be crossed more quickly on the back of a clumsy Piyagi; this species of gigantic iguana can be obtained from the first minutes of the game and can be summoned at any time, effectively replacing the Square-Enix Chocobos. In short, Eternal Legacy does everything to replicate the entire iconography of a Final Fantasy, leading the player in search of some magical crystals in which the power of nature and the elements is locked up. Does it remind you of anything? JRPG fans will probably find themselves in an awkward situation, where every single character, every environment and every creature ends up in an unfortunate comparison with everything that has populated the adventures of the various Final Fantasy. A comparison from which he emerges clearly defeated, above all due to a poorly characterized bestiary and characters with little depth. Yet, on an aesthetic level, Gameloft's game is truly remarkable, especially when considering the platform on which it runs: the settings are vast and varied, despite the presence of an arrow on the screen discouraging exploration; the effects in combat are also excellent, while the support for Retina Display further enhances an already impressive graphic realization. The presence of lip-sync is nothing to get excited about, but seeing the characters move their mouths helps keep them from sounding like immobile puppets, where every dialogue has been dubbed entirely into English. As already mentioned, it is not only the shape that inspired Eternal Legacy, but also and above all the solid and tested gameplay that characterizes the traditional JRPGs. The player can enter combat with a party of three characters, each with its own abilities and attacks: the turn-based combat system is quite classic, even if the player can decide whether to issue orders directly to his companions or let them be managed by AI; in this case it is however possible to impose a particular strategy on each of them, so as to ensure, for example, that there is always someone to heal the party or cast spells. At this point, faced with so little originality, one would expect a total rejection of the game, topped off with a skimpy vote and many greetings. But no. Because, regardless of the similarities with the Square-Enix saga, what the player is left with is a solid and extremely satisfying experience. Eternal Legacy is a truly unique product, one step ahead of almost all other JRPGs on the App StoreAnd. And, most important of all, manages to entertain throughout the duration of the adventure.
