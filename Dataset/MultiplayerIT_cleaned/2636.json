The second official chapter of the for now small series by Tarsier Studios, also expanded thanks to the spin-off Very Little Nightmares and some comics, passes from the claustrophobic atmospheres of the Fauci to the subjugating dispersion of a more open world made up of wild nature and a city abandoned to itself, where the horrors are stronger than ever and amplified by the mysterious Repeater who subjugates the inhabitants. The protagonist of the game is Mono, a boy who hides his face behind a paper mask to defend himself from the world and from anyone who wants to see him fail; to accompany him the well-known Six, on a journey poised between prequel and sequel which only at the end, if you have learned to grasp the details, will reveal more of itself. For this Little Nightmares 2 review, we've been playing the PS4 version in backwards compatibility, with the next-gen version due later. Telling through images Little Nightmares, we have highlighted it more than once and you will have understood it too if you have played the original chapter, it speaks without the use of words: it takes the so-called ~show don't tell~ and makes it its best tool to tell and tell. It plays on the images, on the suggestions it generates, it also enjoys making us believe something that in reality is anything but, it shapes our perceptions aware of always being in control; it presents itself consciously cryptic because it forces us to go beyond simple seeing, it pushes us to look, to grasp details that have been before our eyes from the beginning but, in fact, we have only seen, never really looked. It invites players to take their time, take their time and browse the different subtexts that make up its distorted, yet incredibly communicative, world. Little Nightmares II does exactly that, with an even more incisive force thanks to a more varied and broader setting, providing us with just the basis of a narrative that must be extrapolated piece by piece, level after level, even game after game: we have had confirmation of this when, taking a look at the counter, we realized that we had accumulated a total of twenty-two hours of play on an experience which, although longer than the first, is around six and a half. The first time we were amazed by the conclusion, with a sense of incompleteness and even disappointment in the face of a hermeticism that could have been fine as long as Little Nightmares was a game in its own right, but instead did not combine well with the concept of seriality that it embraced . Too many obscure points, the impossibility of placing it in the timeline of the narrative universe and the belief that Tarsier Studios had made the unsaid a tool to make up for the lack of plot, using the mystery as a shield for a lack of ideas; then we played it a second time more calmly, a third and even a fourth, slowly discovering something more until we grasped it in its entirety - which in any case does not give up that enigmatic quality typical of the series. We understood the theme of evasion, also and above all understood as an escape from reality, as the central point of his narrative and we succeeded by accepting that it was the game that dictated our rhythms, without imposing our own. The journey of Mono and Six is a constant allegory, which began as the nightmare of two children fighting against a cruel and prevaricating world to turn into a much more multifaceted story: a cryptic tale, which may not find everyone's favor, but faithful to the foundations laid previously and facilitated by a greater variety in the settings. The first game in Little Nightmares 2 is, in essence, the cover - the one for which any book should not in fact be judged; the following ones represent the actual story. A more refined gameplay Cryptic narrative or not, we are still talking about a video game: how does the story of Little Nightmares 2 relate to the gameplay itself? What, if any, has Tarsier Studios done to improve on the previous chapter? First of all, the cooperative mechanic is introduced. Different levels, more varied and more spacious, require collaboration to emerge unscathed and this is where the character of Six intervenes once again, as a trusted companion guided by artificial intelligence who will be Mono's shoulder during the adventure. As we have already noted during the demos, the girl in the yellow raincoat is limited and scripted in her actions but in any case these are targeted interventions, which prevent situations like The Last of Us, for example, in which Ellie is not identified by enemies even if she starts dancing in front of them. Restrained interactivity, therefore, yet essential in not highlighting any discrepancies and thus breaking the suspension of disbelief; the limited presence of hostile entities, which are reduced to a few minor enemies and bosses, helps to avoid running into similar situations, however we did not perceive it as an obstacle but rather a possible basis for developing a co- concrete op along the lines of Trine. At the moment therefore Little Nightmares 2 remains a single player experience with support from artificial intelligence but it cannot be excluded that, given the premises, if the developers want to continue the series they will be able to think of a chapter in multiplayer. Perhaps it would dampen the idea that one should always feel defenseless and alone, but time and any direction that will be taken will tell us this. To move things around, and also to increase Mono's sense of impotence, the possibility of defending oneself in some cases is offered by exploiting objects contextual to the environment: a hammer or a metal pipe, but even a ladle, are the weapons with which our young protagonist will be able to protect himself from the assaults of the most disparate creatures, if they are within his reach. Since these are objects intended for people of a very different size from Mono's, their use is slow and tiring, requiring at the same time quick reflexes and decision-making ability because the fact remains that a single blow is enough to kill us. Although it may be alienating at first, it fits perfectly into the developers' intention to make us feel defenseless even when we are armed, emphasizing how nothing is safe in a world where everything is hostile to us. Despite having a slight trial and error component, the fights also have a minimal margin in some cases to recover our mistakes and reposition ourselves; it doesn't apply to all enemies but, again, we return to the concept of eternal inferiority with respect to the game world and the need to anticipate it, if we want to at least survive. What acts as an obstacle, in the clashes and in some more agitated sections, is above all the perception of depth: sometimes it is difficult to determine Mono's position with respect to the weapon he must hold, or the hole in which he must slip to escape the creature unbeatable on duty, and it is in these cases that failure becomes more constant, perceptible and punitive. Especially with regard to pursuits, a minimal hesitation is enough, perhaps also due to not knowing what awaits us, to be irretrievably captured or killed. The checkpoint is fortunately always around the corner but Tarsier Studios has yet to completely polish the concept of trial and error, although in our opinion it is less felt than in the original chapter: the forced escape situations are less, the stealth phases are more manageable in terms of space and timing, and many of these are intuitive at a glance. The cases in which you are caught off guard are quite rare, so overall we can confirm that the developers have made progress compared to the previous game while still allowing themselves to be tempted in part by the trial and error issue. In terms of puzzles, a greater breadth and diversity of settings allows an equally varied approach in testing our intuition: they are more savvy than the original chapter, in some cases they include an annexed danger situation, while in others they are small puzzles that they exploit the surrounding elements to build themselves, thus making good use of the environment to express themselves at their best. However, being Little Nightmares 2 a game with a story to tell, they never put a real block on the continuation of the adventure; sometimes it will even be Six herself, with a glance, who will prompt us on what to do, thus reinforcing the sense of complicity between the two protagonists. The level design also allows the adventure to shine, distributing itself between a refined verticality and situations with ~down to earth~ able to alternate in a pleasantly fluid way: in short, it is difficult to perceive a forcing in the path undertaken by Mono and Six, since they exploit every what the environment has to offer. Artistic and technical sector On a technical and artistic level, the final result is excellent: inspired from the beginning, with Little Nightmares 2 the series is enriched with literally nightmarish glimpses, enhanced by an always high-level sound sector and perfect in generating voltage peaks, down to the smallest detail and once again able to give us back the feeling of helplessness in being a childlost in a world too big and too voracious. The very design of the monsters adapts to the individual levels, fitting perfectly, presenting different bosses capable of disturbing each in their own way. Precisely by virtue of the aforementioned show don't tell, each setting has a story to tell which then enriches the general picture, and we also found the fact that the digital comic (to be read via a special app) connected both in terms of scenarios both of lore to adventure, even suggesting some secret rooms - but in the full style of the series without ever being too explicit. The next gen version will arrive in the future, however there is very little to complain about the PS4 backwards compatibility: the only real criticism is a slight delay at times in the execution of commands, which ends up turning against us in the most delicate situations. These are smudges that do not ruin the game overall, leaving the experience very enjoyable.", "date": "2021-02-09", "grade": "8.5"}
