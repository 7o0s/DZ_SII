Not really, although it is undeniable that they were heavily inspired by the very powerful brand set up by Nintendo and Game Freak in the mid-nineties. However, they have managed to differentiate themselves worthily, focusing on the fascinating digital world from which the little monsters created by Akiyoshi Hongo originate, and to carve out a good slice of the faithful public that has followed them in these fifteen years of career always with dedication and enthusiasm, both on the television and video game front. Like any self-respecting Japanese media/franchise, that of Digimon has in fact quickly become very varied and multifaceted, ranging from anime and manga to feature films, toys and trading cards, but until now the titles have been confined only to portable consoles with rather disappointing results. Arrived in the West a year after its release in the land of the rising sun, Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth marks the debut of digital monsters on home consoles. The choice fell exclusively on PlayStation 4 with a version that accompanies the one for PlayStation Vita sharing its saves. The result was encouraging in its own way, but there are several aspects to work on in view of the next chapters. Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth brings Digimon to PlayStation 4! Torn between two worlds The title developed by Media Vision and published by Bandai Namco is set in a futuristic Tokyo, where social networks have evolved to the point of becoming three-dimensional digital spaces in which users immerse themselves completely through projections of themselves made of data and polygons. The platform is called EDEN and brings together virtually everyone with internet access, from depressed bank clerks to young high school students, without depriving themselves of hackers and criminals of all kinds. You can have conversations, make purchases or simply escape from everyday life with good entertainment, but the safety of users is threatened by a virus that increasingly causes the population of EDEN to fall into a coma, including our protagonist. As in any good self-respecting role-playing game, he will have a different sort from that of the other infected: despite being infected by the virus and his real body is hospitalized, our protagonist inexplicably develops a sort of replica that allows you to easily switch from the real world to the digital one through any device connected to EDEN. Thanks to the help of a young private detective, we will then be called to investigate the traces of the hacker who created the virus, looking for a solution that allows us to get our body back and save all those who are in the same situation . The duality between the two worlds and the possibility of being able to easily access both will be the basis of the Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth campaign, made up of cases to be solved and missions to be completed by jumping from one side of the portal to the other, all obviously helped by our trusty Digimon. EDEN is divided between safe areas with public access and those dominated by hackers and populated by Digimon, which act as dungeons to be explored to complete the missions, while the city of Tokyo is reproduced only in some small locations such as Shinjuku and Roppongi, to be reached by fast travel. While on the one hand the length of the story allows you to constantly grow the creatures and gain new ones, on the other hand the excessive prolixity of some dialogues and a certain basic repetitiveness will partially undermine the enjoyment of the plot. In short, despite the original themes, everything ends up again as a sterile glue for the acquisition and growth of new Digimon. During our stay in EDEN we can of course use the digital monsters that differ from the competition precisely because they live in a reality parallel to that of the protagonist. Here, courtesy of a mysterious entity, we are entrusted with a Digivice, which allows us to interact with creatures and manage various aspects related to the game structure of Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth, from saves to inventory organization. Initially we are offered to choose one of three available Digimon (Terriermon, Palmon, Hagurumon) but subsequently it will be the device that allows us to add new creatures to our ranks. Playstation 4 trophies Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth offers 56 trophies, most of which are initially hidden and linked to the completion of the main campaign. Collect all 48 bronze, 6 silver and the only trophiesgold to get Platinum will require dozens and dozens of hours of play since you have to face a thousand battles, make thirty Digimon mega-digivolve, collect all the medals scattered around the game world and much more. Little originality There is no real capture mechanic, but the acquisition is linked to the analysis of each one which occurs automatically as soon as the encounter begins, focusing the progression of the collection on the frequency with which we have faced a specific Digimon. The growth rate of the scan varies from creature to creature, but once we reach 100% we can go to the laboratory and materialize it directly in the Digibank. However, the percentage can go up to 200% and in that case our creations will have better abilities. Considering that there are 250 Digimon to obtain through fusions and digivolutions, always having low-level creatures available to improve in less demanding dungeons is a good solution. The clashes take place according to the scheme of turn-based combat, with a strip on the right side of the screen that highlights the order of attack to allow us to better organize the strategy of our party made up of three Digimon, but we can have others in reserve in case things got bad. The combat system is also very classic, structured on direct attacks or skills that depend on the type and characteristics of the individual creatures, remaining enjoyable but without offering something original or that hasn't already been seen in titles with a similar structure. After each encounter, you earn yen and experience points to level up both the Digimon who fought and the reserve ones until you reach the threshold necessary for digivolution to be performed at the Digilab, from which you can also access online battles and all 'island in which to leave our creatures free to roam to earn experience points independently. Although Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth is an honest game both in structure and in gameplay, the technical sector row in a completely opposite direction, highlighting a qualitatively lacking work that does nothing but partially compromise the franchise's debut on the Sony home console. Without mincing words, the feeling is that Media Vision has taken the title from PlayStation Vita by weight and, adding a handful of post-production effects to improve its overall performance on the big screen, has brought it to PlayStation 4 with a decidedly disappointing. Poorly detailed polygonal models, low-resolution textures, incredibly bare environments and woody animations are evidence of a botched conversion, to which is added the inconvenience of the decidedly inconvenient fixed camera during dungeon exploration. Therefore, given the lower introductory price and the much better performance on a small screen, it is natural for us to recommend the portable version of Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth over the home version, but if you are such a fan of digital monsters that you get them both, know that it is present the cross save and you can continue the game on both consoles. However, a big obstacle could be represented by the dubbing in Japanese and above all by the presence of subtitles only in English, often a real deterrent to the purchase more than the actual quality of the title.", "date": "2016-02-13", "grade": "7.3"}
