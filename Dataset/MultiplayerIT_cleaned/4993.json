In a post-apocalyptic world, there's a huge blob of glow-in-the-dark green fluid that must reach the conclusion of various levels, facing numerous obstacles along the way. Why all this? How was this sort of creature formed, what drives it to change, reconstitute itself and seek a salvation that seems impossible in the midst of so much destruction? Faced with all these questions, the fundamental question, quoting the great essays Statler & Waldorf is: ~who cares?~ And so the developers must have thought too, who without getting lost in chatter immediately offer us something to do, because to manage the blob there's no time to waste and you need to start touching the screen right away. The idea has been around for some time but this particular application is in any case original, also due to a particular behavior of the fluid which presents itself as a sort of static being which always needs pushes and adjustments to be able to advance between the levels. In short, it's not really Putty, but a real dynamic puzzle that has to do with the platform, especially for its scrolling structure and the need to go through different obstacles and situations, but basically it's about a puzzle game full of puzzles, some of which are actually quite challenging and perhaps a little unbalanced compared to the otherwise fluid flow of the action. This is the story of a shapeless blob at the end of the world and his path full of obstacles The hard life of green jelly The ~protagonist~ of Mushroom 11 has a particular physical behavior but which responds to very specific laws, largely taken from those of real fluids even if it is not exactly a simulation. Basically, to move the creature, if it can be defined as such, it is necessary to model it, deleting pieces to make them appear on the opposite side, or pushing it in order to create a motion, given the imbalance of the weight. It is the classic mechanics that are more difficult to describe than to implement, because once on the screen, moreover with a touch screen, the behavior is extremely intuitive, like a sort of plasticine that is a little more reactive and iridescent but responds to certain predictable laws . We must think of this ~mushroom~ as a being made up of cells, rather than a simple fluid: by destroying some cells it will recompose the same number, or by pushing the set of cells in one direction they arrange themselves so as to occupy the space in the more logical way, if possible remaining equidistant from the center but also adapting to the conformation of the scenario. The various levels confront us with puzzles that require changing the shape in order to let the substance enter tunnels, openings and various passages, often with the need to divide it into several parts to activate switches and mechanisms necessary to open alternative roads and routes. The settings do not spare various obstacles and dangers, as well as possible enemies and even boss fights, sometimes putting us in front of frankly rather demanding situations and keeping the average challenge level high along the 7 large worlds that compose it. What emerges in Mushroom 11, in fact, beyond the good idea about the behavior of the protagonist and the control system, is precisely the level design, which always manages to offer interesting ideas and cues on a basis that might initially seem limited and very little supported by a graphic sector which, although well-made and undoubtedly atmospheric, tends to flatten the experience a bit with a certain repetition of elements. The puzzles and challenges follow one another constantly, maintaining an excellent pace and with truly stimulating game solutions, even if sometimes a little unbalanced in terms of difficulty.", "date": "2017-03-16", "grade": "8.0"}
