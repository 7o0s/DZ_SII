{"name": "Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-luigi-partners-in-time.html", "text": "Let the children play The strengths of the GameBoy Advance game were its particular graphic aspect, the humorous narration and the possibility of controlling the two plumbers in parallel, with new interactive situations in which Mario and Luigi collaborate better. Now, Partners in Time carries on the spirit of its prequel with absolute fidelity. However, it doubles in turn: screens and characters. There are now four characters to control at the same time. However, this does not happen as in most traditional JRPGs, often perched on the serial and now obsolete idea of a team in which the peculiarity of the individual characters only acts in the clashes. Partners in Time presents an original vision of both the adventure sections, rich in platform elements, and the fights, which are among the most frenetic and ~fluid~ in the genre offer, slightly blurring the line between turn-based and real-time combat . The narrative premise sees Mario and Luigi grappling with the junior versions of themselves, in a past in which mysterious UFO-piloting mushrooms, aesthetically indebted to the poisonous mushroom of the first Super Mario Bros, attack and destroy Princess Peach's palace, also 'she is still a baby - and they kidnap the adult one, at the hands of her monstrous alter ego. The plot primarily serves to provide tasty slapstick comedy situations. Master Toad, ~doubled~, ridiculously fights himself to protect the little princess. Or the hand is pressed on narrative situations with a pleasantly naive and at times self-deprecating humor, with Bowser Jr. ready to play the role of the individualistic but not evil opponent and the brothers Mario and Luigi connoted respectively as the simple and courageous hero and the brother fearful but loyal. But this doubling serves above all to double the interactive dynamics. The game builds on a traditional turn-based RPG setup, with experience levels accruing for characters and combat sections distinct from environment discovery, but goes a little further. In Mario & Luigi the player can constantly switch between the two teams - the adult and the children - to act in the game environment with extreme freedom, solving simple puzzles or platform missions that require the use of the two groups at the same time. For example, it will be necessary to advance the two groups in two distinct directions in the rooms, activating switches to which only children can have access and thus allowing the adults to advance in turn, solving interactive missions that children could not carry on. However, the two teams can proceed together, with the children in the arms of the adults. In this case, the player will have access to a double jump or will be able to launch the children in distant places to reach, from where they will be able to operate what is needed to continue. All these game dynamics, simple to undertake but which prove to be progressively more interesting and sometimes quite challenging, are masterfully distributed between the two screens of the DS, which effectively double the size of the playing area and displace the action by alternating between maps and game screens so that the player can act on different points of the environments, finally making the two teams collaborate in real time. The encore of the characters is also interesting with regard to the fights. In fact, adults and children can face enemies alone and, indeed, will often be forced to do so. However, the player will always want to bring the two teams together before the fights, because in this way he will have access to a series of very interesting, fun and effective combo shots. Hits performed in pairs will require the player to use both characters: adult and child in arms. It will thus be possible to double a hammer blow, giving the input first to the adult and then to the child, and so on, or to hit with two timed jumps instead of just one. But the shots can also be tripled or more: for example, in the attack with the shells, in which the player has to kick and bounce the same shell against the enemies with as many carambolas as possible, pressing the key from time to time. character who will have to kick it again and also that of the child who rides it to make him worse the dose against the enemy. Simple but spectacular Particularly commendable is the control, both in combat and in environments. The four main keys of the controller are each assigned to a character, with an extremely functional control economy which makes it possible to play complex games that are often difficult to bring to success, but ifalways clear in the interface. In the case of the environments, there will be various types of control games with blocks that require you to position yourself correctly in order to hit each time with the character and then with the required key. In the case of fights, complex hits will require the player to make the right character act at the right time with the right key. Initially, this can be a little confusing. However, this is entirely within the spirit of the game, which attempts to deliver the most active and interactive combat possible while respecting the turn-based system. The dodges of enemy blows are an integral and inescapable part of the game, without which the player would be forced to succumb in a short time; while attacks often require a high degree of interactivity that, in the spirit of the series, goes far beyond choosing a hit from the menu. Simple but spectacular The series of dodges, reasoned attacks and multiple hits, combined with the strategic and joint use of special objects and badges, make the fights often exciting and never boring or repetitive. Furthermore, the fights have a very fun logic to discover so that the enemies are killed in the best possible way, and they often appear (especially those of the bosses) with pseudo-narrative scenes that take advantage of the double screen to make the attacks and the development interesting of the action. Eat those damn mushrooms! In short, Mario & Luigi II can be played just as well as its prequel, and manages to double the complexity of the control and fights in an original way and without making the control excessively heavy. Of course, at the beginning it suffers a lot from a certain forced tutorial syndrome that accompanies the player right into the most basic action: but this is an introductory trait due to a part of the target to which it is addressed. This does not mean that the game is long enough and that it often reserves challenging moments, resulting in anything but a long-distance guided tour. Furthermore, Mario & Luigi, although quite linear despite the double map and the secrets of the castle, is also very aesthetically pleasing. From the first Super Mario RPG to today, the type of narration of the Nintendo RPG has gone beyond the fairy-tale modules and has settled on a type of cartoonish comedy that is very often self-deprecating and never heavily Manichean and serial like many Japanese or artfully psychological proposals. Even the aesthetic trait is clean, well made and animated, but above all it is safe from the Hawaiian drift of Nintendo from the first GameCube era. The characters are simple and stylized, with eyes more Felix or Super Mario Bros III style than ever, while the double screen, although there is practically no touch system, is often used to explain the shots or deepen the narration with screenshots and animations. Particularly interesting and very funny are the jokes of Mario and Luigi, spoken in a false Italian idiolect, or the interactions between adults and children with hugs, laughter, crying, consolations, little gags. Finally, also, for the first time in history, the characters actually EAT, chew, swallow those damned energy mushrooms. Mario & Luigi II is one of the best action RPGs out there. The reason is soon to be said. The Alphadream team has developed a type of interaction which, while making it possible to control four characters, is economical, fun and above all very original. The action sections are interesting and entertaining due to the peculiar approach offered by the use of the four characters, while the fights reach a considerable level of frenzy and depth, with interactive gimmicks that make them spectacular and exciting. Of course, in the economy of the series, the game is slightly easier and more linear than usual, and sometimes gives the impression of being a bit too ~driven~. But basically Mario & Luigi II wants to amuse and relax in terms of aesthetics and challenge and amuse the player with an original interaction, things that it manages to do very well with a certain self-irony and originality. In this sense, while not always reaching the glories of a Paper Mario 2, it avoids offering itself as a simple ~more of the same~ and establishes itself as one of the best purchases for lovers of the genre and for anyone who wants an original and very entertaining title . Pros An original action RPG, with new ideas Has an excellent control system Great aesthetic, cartoonish and colorful Cons It will seem a bit too ~driven~ to many The challenge starts on a very low difficulty Mario &amp; Louis II It's now been a decade since the first turn-based RPG was released withMario as the protagonist, developed by Nintendo in collaboration with Squaresoft. Today, RPGs with Mario have become a small series, which has developed on its main tracks. On the one hand, Paper Mario, on home consoles. On the other hand, Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga for Gameboy Advance, which is now being followed up. Mario & Luigi II: Partners in Time is the latest incarnation of the famous brothers, this time grappling with a space-dimensional doubling. In this role-playing game the player is in control not only of the two mustachioed Italian plumbers, but also of their childhood versions. The meeting of the two characters with their childhood alter egos, made possible by a leap back in time, is nothing more than a useful excuse for Nintendo to resume Mario & Luigi for GameBoy Advance, continuing with the game design work in that groove. The new episode takes advantage of the DS double screen to spread out the action, doubling the characters and using the screens and the four brothers for a variety of interesting gameplay. The gamble paid off and, although it doesn't take advantage of the touch screen, it delivers one of the best DS games available so far.", "date": "2006-02-08", "grade": null}
