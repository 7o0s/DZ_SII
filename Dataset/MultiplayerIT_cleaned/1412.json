{"name": "Fallout : Brotherhood of Steel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fallout-brotherhood-of-steel.html", "text": "The setting of this new chapter has remained the proven one typical of the prequels, in Brotherhood of Steel we will therefore find ourselves in a post-atomic scenario, a world devastated by nuclear holocausts, in which the human race has survived only in small part. In practice, the setting is very reminiscent of that of the famous Ken the warrior, men have returned to a pre-civilization stage and, while maintaining a part of their technological development, are forced to start all over from scratch, to coexist/fight against mutant creatures and come to terms with the law of the strongest. Before starting our adventure we will be able to choose one or two, if we play in cooperative, characters among the three available: the two humans Nadia and Cyrus, or the mutant Cain, each obviously with its own characteristics and respective strengths or weaknesses. The impact with the game is not the clearest, given that you find yourself a bit lost in the middle of the starting city, but thanks to the clues, after a few minutes of exploration and a little perseverance, you manage to find the first quest to complete. From now on we will proceed in a rather guided way, without too much freedom of decision, through the different paths to be taken to bring the missions to a conclusion. The view used is in the third person, with a shot from above, practically fixed, a little less inclined than the one present in Dark Alliance. Unfortunately, however, it is possible to move the point of view only to the right or left, while there is no way to bring the camera closer or further away, a possibility that in certain situations would certainly have been of help to better evaluate one's position on the screen. One of the downsides of the game is the lack of depth that is felt by progressing between missions, given that the Rpg component becomes less and less and that the action is reduced to a continuous pressure of the attack button to kill enemies faster. This problem is linked to a bad balance of the supplied arsenal, firearms are not so useful (except in cooperative mode with good coordination between the two characters) and practical, as healthy melee combat, with blunt objects or white weapons. In Fallout there are over 30 different types of weapons, ranging from the handcrafted pistol to the rocket launcher, passing through various types of grenades, as well as obviously all defensive objects. A point in favor of the control method lies in the possibility of grappling with a particular enemy and concentrating attacks on that target, partly making the action less chaotic. One of the most appreciable parts in Fallout is undoubtedly the development of the characteristics of the character, a well-structured feature in the individual aspects and which leads to significant differences during the alteration of the various skills, some of them deriving from the old chapters of Fallout. Brotherhood of Steel, however linear it may be in its development, is certainly not short to complete and it will take about twenty hours, excluding the more advanced level of difficulty, to reach the end. As for the game modes, unfortunately, Xbox Live support has not been implemented, which together with the cooperative mode, would have added a lot of depth to the Interplay title. The Italian version of Fallout is fully localized, both in text and speech, the result is undoubtedly appreciated for its usefulness in the game. However, there are some texts or questions that seem out of place, compared to others, but, probably, it is a factor due to the use of particular puns or a typically American slang in the original version of the title. The game interface is summarized in two main components, a map that shows our position on the screen and highlights the save points or, in any case, all those useful to the player, and another part which consists of a double health/ experience that gives us the essential indications during the clashes. Technically Speaking The graphics engine, as already mentioned above, is the same used in Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, but, unfortunately, no significant improvements have been made, with the aggravating circumstance given by a design that is certainly not up to the standard famous Interplay title, which significantly penalizes the technical sector. This is certainly not the best in the genre, resulting, at times, even disappointing. In some situations there may be some drops in the frame rate, although the polygonal detail or the quality of the textures are certainly not to be remembered, but it must be noted that the image cleaning is always excellent, avoiding aliasing or flickering problems. The part deductedicata all'audio remains without infamy and without praise. The various voices used for the Italian localization are good and diversified, the sound effects are discreet. The chosen soundtrack is very inspired, with tracks suitable for the Fallout setting. Comment This Fallout is recommended for lovers of Diablo-like titles or precisely for those who particularly appreciated Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. The typology of these heirs of Gauntlet is well defined, it is summarized in a game that has little freedom of action and a significant dose of repetitive fights, but which, if played in multiplayer, acquire a certain appeal. Unfortunately, the atmosphere and design in Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel do not live up to the previously mentioned titles, and the game does not become engaging as it develops. The technical part is certainly not up to an Xbox title of this generation and the general design could be decidedly more refined. Ultimately a title without great pretensions that acquires greater value if played in a cooperative. Pros: Skill Management Action galore in multiplayer Cons: Repetitive Technically poor The time has come, and Interplay is also bringing the Fallout saga to the console world, one of the best-known series in the world of PC role-playing games. The transition between platforms was certainly not painless, the developers have decided to make some changes to the game to make it closer to the tastes of ~new users~. Interplay has, in fact, chosen to reuse the concept, as well as the same graphics engine, seen in Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel has become an action RPG in all respects, gaining in immediacy, but losing something in the depth of the game.", "date": "2004-01-15", "grade": null}
