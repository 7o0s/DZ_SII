{"name": "Ratchet & Clank 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ratchet-clank-3.html", "text": "A platformer, some puzzles and rpg stats Ratchet & Clank 2, just like its predecessor, combines the classic gameplay of a platformer with a series of more or less conventional gadgets and weapons that shift the gamer's attention to the action and make life difficult for insiders, often not able to categorize the game into a specific genre. In practice, the title we are going to analyze is nothing more than a 3D action-platform with rpg elements, shooters and a sprinkling of puzzles and puzzles that never hurts. At certain times Ratchet, a humanized dog-fox (we haven't yet managed to figure out what it is, help us!) and Clank, a faithful little robot with greater versatility than that of a multifunctional Swiss Army knife, are in fact called upon to do their utmost in millimeter leaps of derivation mariesca, improbable races on science fiction vehicles and more or less inspired mini ~Maxigames~, for the most part, however, they will shoot left and right with the sole purpose of eliminating the enemies on the screen. To do this, they will have at their disposal weapons that can be purchased using Bolts, the current currency in the Ratchet and Clank universe and can be acquired by defeating opponents and destroying everything that comes within range. Obviously the ultimate goal of our protagonists will be to save the universe from the bad guy on duty: long live originality. Shoot what happens to you Let's start right from the arsenal available to Ratchet: having established that it is not our intention to reveal the new entries to you nor to resume the discussion starting from last year's gadgets, since we would ruin all the amazement and laughter deriving from the continuous discoveries of the same, know that the weapons are able to grow and develop. Thanks to a simple ~rpgistic~ system, depending on the number of enemies killed, the weapon will evolve thus increasing its offensive power. As your capacity for devastation increases, an artificial upward adjustment of the enemies' potential follows: fortunately, the level of challenge, already low in itself, thanks to this expedient is not affected in any way. Your opponents enjoy, among other things, different characteristics that will force you to face them differently from each other. This peculiarity will put you in a position to make choices and therefore to use the right gadget or weapon at the right time. Ratchet & Clank 2 presents the classic mission structure of increasing difficulty already tested and therefore difficult to criticize except from the point of view of originality which is unfortunately alien to this production. To break up the frenetic game action, as mentioned before, Insomniac have devised some simple puzzle game puzzles as well as sections aboard strange vehicles and Maxigames (actually conventionally they would be called mini-games, in this case the developers have them defined maxi to celebrate their complexity and goodness, undoubtedly superior to that of the more or less trivial mini-games we are used to) quite inspired but repetitive in the long run. The icing on the cake are the animated interludes in which Ratchet, Clank and the various supporting actors will entertain you with their irony snatching more than a smile and a laugh. A subtle but at times absolutely crazy humor and therefore consistent with some of the craziest gadgets in the game. The controls are excellent and the title is fun from the first to the last moment in which you hold the Dual Shock. The camera is not perfect, it responds late to the movements of the protagonists but fortunately it is possible to adjust it manually thanks to the right stick of the joypad: no Ratchet or Clank will be killed or mistreated due to outlawed shots. Technically speaking Let's now analyze the technical department of the game and start for once from the sound: if the music is simply out of place, trivial and at times even irritating, the Italian dubbing of Ratchet & Clank 2 is perfect. There's no smudging while the quality of the acting is really top notch. Graphically speaking, it seems to be faced with the first episode that a year ago stood up to most of the Playstation 2 productions and those of the Gamecube and Xbox rivals. Since then, water has passed under the bridge (especially from the parts of the competition) but the Ratchet & Clank engine, for the record it is the revised and corrected engine of Jak and Daxter, has not evolved much to the point that the easily detectable differences are few and marginal: the enormousamount of polygons on the screen as well as the excellent fluidity are exactly at the levels of the prequel, despite some hesitation during the explosions. Even the textures do not escape the rule: as in the previous episode, they are more than fair for a Playstation 2 and characterized by some good color choices. Too bad for the absence of the selector for 60Hz, a strange detail since the first chapter had it. In any case, the 50hz game is perfect and has really narrow black bars and for this reason anything but annoying, luckily nothing compromised. Comment As before but no more than before. The summary judgment can only be the same expressed in respect of the first chapter. The main features of Ratchet & Clank 2? It is an excellent game that winks at several genres and for this reason is not easily labeled, with a sound and solid gameplay, a graphic design of the protagonists that is more than unsatisfactory but counterbalanced, fortunately, by an excellent characterization and a story told in a nice and never intrusive way. Insomniac's latest effort is fun, playable, technically sound and long-lived, everything that is required of a video game with a capital ~V~. Too bad for the feeling of already seen that will make players who are not fanatics of the previous episode turn up their noses: it is practically the same game system with different levels and some other small negligible differences. Nothing serious, as long as the Insomniac bosses don't decide to make a new Ratchet & Clank every year until 2020. Pros: Extremely playable Varied and long-lived Excellent dubbing Cons: Aesthetics of the characters It is the prequel with the levels changed The accompanying music is not the best Ratchet and Clank are back! Well, to tell the truth, it would be appropriate to wonder if in reality they have not always been here: the first chapter of the series was released just over a year ago and the new episode was announced in the spring. Furthermore, commercially speaking, the original was included at the beginning of the year in a special bundle with the console and subsequently, during the very hot summer of 2003, it was released in a platinum version. In short, between a promotion and a bundle, Ratchet and Clank have become so famous that over two million players have enjoyed the fun offered by the game featuring this strange couple.", "date": "2003-12-05", "grade": null}
