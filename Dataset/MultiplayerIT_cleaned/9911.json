{"name": "Far Cry 6 - Vaas: Insanity", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/far-cry-6-vaas-insanity-recensione.html", "text": "~Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?~ Vaas Montenegro's monologue still resonates in the ears of Far Cry fans today, masterfully interpreted by Michael Mando and dubbed into Italian, equally masterfully, by Francesco Mei. Those words marked the birth of the most iconic villain in the Ubisoft series, but also of an approach that the French firm would adopt from that moment on in a stable manner. Exactly nine years later, we are still here talking about it and we do it for a reason specific: as you know, the Far Cry 6 Season Pass will put us in the shoes of three of the most famous ~villains~ of the series, in as many adventures set within their minds. A journey through disturbing shadows, memories never revealed and impossible landscapes, which we begin to tell precisely with the review of Far Cry 6 - Vaas: Insanity. History Vaas: Insanity, one of the memories that we will be able to discover within the DLC Far Cry has accustomed us over the years to decidedly bizarre paid content and Vaas: Insanity is no exception, indeed it confirms right from the start that it corresponds precisely to the definition of madness that the famous antagonist taught us: ~doing the same thing over and over fucking thing, over and over, hoping something changes.~ This first downloadable content is a repeating cycle, each time raising the bar of the challenge and revealing new secrets, up to the biggest one. Amazon offer Far Cry 6 Limited Edition Ps4 - Amazon Exclusive - Playstation 4 71.16 64.98 See Offer There is no actual narration: we wake up as Vaas, catapulted into a vivid dream resulting from his sick mind, and around us stands a distorted version of the Rook Islands, with three main points of interest that hide as many boss fight, but also and above all different places where you can unlock unpublished backstory memories, which will help us find out more about this character. Vaas: Insanity, a memory related to Citra We will witness sequences that illustrate the sick relationship with Citra (whose voice will guide us through the entire adventure), but also the rivalry with Jason Brody, the protagonist of Far Cry 3, and some events related to the setting that explore the past of protagonist and what happened after he betrayed his own people to join the group of mercenaries in the pay of Hoyt Volker. Unfortunately, the interpretation of the aforementioned Francesco Mei is a distant memory: exactly like the base game, Far Cry 6, Vaas : Insanity has no dubbing in Italian and therefore boasts dialogues only in English, with the possibility of activating subtitles in our language. Gameplay Vaas: Insanity, the Mirror that allows you to unlock permanent upgrades We said that Vaas: Insanity presents itself as a cycle, in this case a roguelite-type experience made up of a total of five increasingly difficult levels. The things to do and see within the map are the same, but the possibility of unlocking new permanent upgrades (the so-called ~traits~, obtainable by looking in the mirror of the initial outpost) and new weapons (by winning the related challenges buying them) makes it possible to approach the mini-campaign in a different way. Unfortunately the gunplay hasn't changed compared to Far Cry 6 and the presence of a reduced arsenal only highlights its limitations. As it is possible to read in the Far Cry 6 review, the combat system of the last episode of the Ubisoft series did not excite us and in Vaas: Insanity it is re-proposed with some extra complications, which often makes the experience even less enjoyable. Improving the weapons solves the situation a bit, but we are far from what we have seen in the most famous shooters. There is also a problem of balancing the difficulty, in the sense that the roguelite approach should create a certain tension related to the possibility of losing (almost) everything we have gained at each game over and then starting over, but during the first level we have never died and indeed we have managed to unlock those traits that allow you to keep money or to enjoy a second chance in case you are killed. Added to these perplexities is the systematic repetitiveness of the DLC, which precisely proposes to time after time the same battles and the same situations, only going to tweak the challenge upwards. A structure that would reveal more content with each new attempt would have been decidedly more interesting, but as the gameplay of Vaas is set up: Insanity is an end in itself and has reason to exist solely in the fanservice that it makes available to users. Graphics and sound Vaas: Insanity, one of the DLC boss fights The alternate interpretation of the Rook Islands is a bit reminiscent of the alien landscapes of the Far Cry 5 DLCs, but this is not a positive comparison. The map has only a discrete extension and the assets tend to repeat themselves in a somewhat anonymous way, with only the volcanic area proposing some significant differences but again without acute details. There is no trace of the advanced effects of Far Cry 6 , or in any case it is difficult to see it in scenarios that express more than anything else an artistic direction, trying to give shape and color to the visions of a crazy mind. Unfortunately there are no moments of particular interest, except for the sequences in which Vaas recalls some events from the past and which can count on Mando's talent to gain intensity and depth. In conclusion The charismatic Vaas Vaas: Insanity is a concentrate of fanservice: it will certainly be able to give emotions to those nostalgic for Far Cyr 3 and in particular for the character played by Michael Mando, who is also able to offer a masterful performance here. These are the aspects that represent the fulcrum of the first Far Cry 6 DLC, which opts for a somewhat banal and perhaps not well organized roguelite structure to push us to repeat the sequence again and again. Those who succeed are adequately rewarded but the journey, thanks to an improvable gunplay, immediately turns out to be tortuous.", "date": "2021-11-15", "grade": null}
