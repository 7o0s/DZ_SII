{"name": "The Italian Job", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-italian-job.html", "text": "From England to the Alps The Italian Job, in addition to the well-known film, is quite markedly inspired by the Driver series from which it draws numerous elements. The story mode consists of a series of missions set in sequence in London, Turin and the Alps. The game structure is rather simple and straightforward. The objective of the missions is to prepare ourselves for the ~coup~ and at least initially our efforts will be concentrated in recruiting the men and means necessary to implement the plan. In practice, what we will have to do will be to walk around the city streets, and not, a series of cars and try to reach certain locations in the city avoiding being captured by the police. Everything would seem easy but things are complicated by the limited time we will have available to complete the missions. Added to this is the fact that the roads we travel on will be full of obstacles consisting of not only decorative elements such as lampposts, telephone booths and traffic worthy of rush hour in Milan. Escape from the ~flyers~ Such a simple game scheme is counterbalanced by a vehicle control system that is often not very precise and sometimes difficult to master, especially during the phases of frantic escape from the police ~cars~. Not infrequently you will hit objects or, something very unwelcome, cause accidents with other cars in transit which will not only cause damage to your vehicle but will make you lose precious time. Overall, the main mode proves to be fun while failing to offer the depth of other titles of the same genre. In addition to the story mode, The Italian Job offers a fair number of multiplayer modes that will allow you to challenge up to 7 of your friends (in turns) in a series of skill competitions behind the wheel. Defects of old age... From a graphic point of view, The Italian Job is well done although not free from defects. The vastness of the city settings and the care in the reconstruction of buildings and characteristic elements of London and Turin are truly remarkable. However, much attention to detail is paid in terms of performance of the game's graphics engine which occasionally presents problems with the appearance and disappearance of polygons on the horizon and occasional slowdowns. However, nothing particularly serious. The game has been completely localized in Italian and for this reason you will also be able to enjoy the dubbing of the voices, however of questionable quality. On the other hand, the tune at the base of each mission is very nice but, since there are no variations on the theme, it ends up boring. God save the Queen! The Italian Job, despite the name suggesting our beautiful country, is a game with a typically Anglo-Saxon taste, which is certainly not despicable given the results. Fun and varied, it will satisfy all fans of this ~outlaw~ genre even if it will hardly keep you glued to the joypad for a long time. The more experienced players may turn up their noses at an antiquated game concept or in any case borrowed from other productions but this does not mean that it is one of the most interesting games of recent weeks. Pros: Funny Cities are very large Good quality graphics Cons: Sometimes difficult to control Some graphical glitches Voice acting not particularly appreciable An Italian hit! In 1969 an English film achieved such a resounding success that it is considered one of the best in the history of British cinema. It was ~The Italian Job~ whose main interpreter was Michael Caine who I believe many of you have had the opportunity to admire in numerous other films. In the film Charlie Crocker (Caine), just released from prison, organizes a plan to steal 4 million dollars in gold in Italy by deceiving the Turin mafia and the police. This is the idea behind the plot not only of the film but also of the homonymous game created by SCI Games for PlayStation. We are therefore faced with yet another videogame conversion of a film, a widespread practice but which has often led to rather disappointing results. Will it be the same for The Italian Job?", "date": "2001-11-08", "grade": null}
