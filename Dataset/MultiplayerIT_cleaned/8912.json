{"name": "Ben 10: Galactic Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/96007-ben-10-galactic-racing-corse-dellaltro-mondo.html", "text": "Ben 10 is a cartoon produced by Cartoon Network Studios, also broadcast by us, which narrates the deeds of a boy capable of transforming into various alien creatures, thanks to a special device called Omnitrix. Why are we telling you all this? Because our super teenager shows up on our screens with another Tie-in, this time inspired by the famous Mario Kart. Ben 10: Galactic Racing is nothing more than a clone of the Nintendo saga, but with the protagonists of the cartoon facing each other in a gas-free tournament! The crackling alien Distributed by Namco Bandai, the product has been entrusted to the hands of Monkey Bar Games, a studio specializing in casual productions, an excellent choice as we will see. The aim, unsurprisingly, is to cross the finish line first with our favorite vehicle, choosing between two categories, the first which favors speed at the expense of resistance, and vice versa. This is because in the full tradition of the genre the typical power ups are proposed to be collected, capable of hindering enemies, while a more singular side is represented by the specific defenses of each character, very useful for avoiding attacks. For the rest we are completely in line with the tested standards, including a series of references, not only to Mario Kart, which will be quite welcome. The title offers different modalities along about twenty paths, a frankly surprising number for a budget title, also considering the great variety that distinguishes them. Under the pretext of the interplanetary tournament, very different scenarios are presented, based on the planet chosen for the competition. Not only that, the circuits always have a noteworthy design, with a large number of shortcuts capable of saving precious seconds. Again, nothing really new compared to what has already been seen and played, but Ben 10: Galactic Racing proves to be a product curated by programmers who know their craft. Xbox 360 goals The title offers 1000 player points distributed through the canonical 50 objectives. Most of these are achieved in the single player mode, which requires at least third place in each race, and first place in the final to access the next tournament. The most coveted is undoubtedly the one with 100 player points, which requires the achievement of the first position in all races. Task, we anticipate it, not to be taken lightly... Good luck! A breeze Technically we are faced with a work that is certainly not transcendental, but absolutely acceptable, with a framerate anchored to 30 fps, a graphics engine that all in all goes well with the style of the cartoon, lots of colors and good fluidity. Certainly we don't cry out to be a miracle, but here too it is a pleasure to ascertain a more than decent production level. The playability is less convincing, actually very simple, the title is light years away from the inspiring masters, but the maneuverability of the vehicles is not exactly the best, including the never too exciting speed. This leads to rather demanding races, a feature that fuels our greatest perplexity. The very setting of the tournaments, which requires the conquest of at least the third position, and the podium to move on to the next one, is frankly severe for the user to whom the product is aimed, namely that of the television series. The lack of online mode is not particularly beneficial either, although understandable in some ways, but it considerably limits the longevity of the product. On the other hand, the local multiplayer is good, with races for up to four players, and special modes, such as the one set in an arena, certainly among the best proposals. The audio is characterized by a very nice two-voice commentary, unfortunately only in English, like the rest of the game which only uses Italian subtitles. Who Framed Peter Pan Ben 10: Galactic Racing is a rather singular product, if on the one hand it is presented as an entertainment conceived for young cartoon lovers, its derivative nature and the not exactly low difficulty curve are elements that seem to wink at the older children, even better players who know which are the masterpieces that the effort Monkey Bar Games goes to disturb. What leaves you pleasantly surprised is the quality of the production, always discreet, if we exclude a slightly difficult driving system. However, the numerous routes available, the pleasant graphic design and the many single and multiplayer modes make it a good pastime that is not without fun, to be shared in the company of the whole family... At a budget price!
