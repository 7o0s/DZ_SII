The protagonist of this new game is a young novice ~Overlord~, a worshiper of evil who is already able to use the power and flexibility of the Minion creatures. The basic gameplay of the game is the same: it is an action with RPG elements, with many influences from that little Nintendo jewel called Pikmin. For those unfamiliar with it, in that case we were able to command many small creatures that had to fight, carry objects, evolve: and this is precisely the common thread that binds Pikmin to Overlord. Gromgard (this is the name of the lord of evil that we impersonate) surrounds himself with many small creatures called ~Servants~ who respond to our wishes, help us, overcome obstacles and destroy everything we want. Nintendo Wii, in the eyes of the developers Climax Studios of Codemasters, therefore seemed the ideal platform on which to play a title with these requirements. Overlord Dark Legend is in fact an action-RPG with RTS elements, as you point directly at the TV indicating the direction and movement of our minions, just as it would happen on PC using a mouse. On the side of evil Given its point-and-click nature, the control system designed for the Nintendo Wii necessarily had to be flawless in order not to compromise precision and comfort. Fortunately, the developers have managed to create a perfect mix between the nunchuk analog and the pointing of the remote control on the game screen: the latter is always precise and punctual, perfect for such a game genre. The very nature of the remote form, however, made other actions cumbersome. We are talking, for example, of the need to often reach for the secondary keys such as the game map (~2~ key), or the spell selector (~+~ key next to home): it is not very practical to have to change your grip to be able to reach the thumb down there, and considering that those functions are used very often, the inconvenience is evident. The Overlord is controlled with the nunchuk analog, with a third-person view conveyed by a fixed shot from behind the shoulders. This means that often the view cannot be changed, finding ourselves in some blind corners during the fights, and with a certain slowness during the changes of direction. A system to make the camera rotatable at will would certainly have helped, but the only option we are granted is to bring the view forward. In spite of these problems, however, the innovations made by the remote control are evident and actually comfortable: now you can also ~grab~ a Minion from the pile and drag it wherever we want, or order attacks on multiple targets instantly. The powers of the Minions They have various characteristics and behave differently depending on their color and nature. The brown ones are the fighters: they are more common than the others, sturdier and great fighters. They resist very well in close combat but elemental substances destroy them. Red Minions are specialists in fire (they can put out flames), and are also able to attack from a distance. Greens are not as tough as browns but are much more powerful and agile: they are also called assassins for their stealthy way of attacking from behind. Finally, Blue Minions are healers and can survive water. Sub Creatures to me! The peculiarity and beauty of Overlord revolves around the minions, their powers and their use on the battlefield. The Overlord is obviously capable of fighting and casting spells, but the job would be awfully tougher without the help of his little creatures. The latter, in addition to having totally different characteristics depending on their color, can have many other functions. Minions are spawned through Portals, activated by using ~Life Force~ accumulated by killing creatures and enemies. There is a maximum horde size available to us, indicated by a small number on the game HUD. Due to the hardware inferiority of the Wii compared to other consoles, the number of Minions available on screen has more than halved. This factor makes Dark Legend even more strategic, giving maximum importance to the color and quantity of Minions used in battle. Our little slaves can move obstacles, reach difficult points, put out flames, swim, but also sacrifice themselves for our good. And it is even possible to immolate them for (our) just cause to obtain mana or health points. TheThe execution is hilarious: just grab one of the little creatures by pressing A and B together and shake the nunchuck. The Overlord grabs the first Minion that comes into his hands, lifts him off the ground and mercilessly strangles him. We can also ~charge them~: instead of sacrifice, just quickly shake the remote control and various effects will be produced on our subordinates: the Browns create a powerful explosion, the Reds set fire, the Greens poison with a cloud of gas and the Blues resurrect the comrades fallen. Finally, our little friends are reinforced through armor and weapons that we find on the street, and they can be used to guard some strategic points simply by activating a ~banner~ to place where we prefer. Pros and cons of being a Wii game One of the differences compared to the first Overlord is that the accumulated experience points are not added to the specific Minions categories to be summoned, but to a generic accumulator which makes the game much simpler and more intuitive. We will no longer find ourselves having to look for a specific color because we are missing a particular Minion, therefore. The goal of lowering the difficulty of the game to meet a more varied and younger target is also evident from the light-heartedness with which the various quests and end-of-level bosses are tackled, all quite simple and quick to defeat. Furthermore, the map is very useful for not getting lost and going straight towards the required objective. Similarly, accumulating gold, equipment and weapons has become very simple and fast, being found in almost all objects to be destroyed. Obviously, the technical sector of the game has also been adapted to the Nintendo hardware. Environments and characters are designed in an excellent way, with an important amount of polygons and effects (the particle ones and the sunlight are very nice), an unusual and surprising factor for a Wii game. The scenarios are full of details, monsters, vegetation, buildings, destructible objects (practically all), but the other side of the coin is a dancer frame rate that varies from the granite 60fps of some interiors to a handful of fps in chaotic situations, battles and when the horizon is particularly far away. We certainly would never have expected 60fps on all occasions, but perhaps it would have been better to optimize the engine, cut some boundary elements and let the game travel at a lower but stable frame rate. The background music and effects are instead perfect, inspired, well orchestrated and very pleasant to hear. The legacy from the first chapter is evident, and it is a good thing to take up the good things the series has produced in the past. Regardless of the various problems of Overlord Dark Legend, the conditions for having a better game are all there: let Codemasters work with confidence and enjoy this chapter, even with its limitations.", "date": "2009-07-14", "grade": "7.2"}
