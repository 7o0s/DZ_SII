At the beginning you will not be elegant, then maybe you will buy a Limousine... Better not make Tony Montana mad... The world is Yours You arrived in Florida directly from Cuba. There you weren't a shin of a saint and here you have no intention of going straight, with the difference that America offers great, great possibilities to people like you. If you have some brains and a lot of attributes, you can do some work for a mob boss and join his team. And then, slowly, take his place: control the city through commercial activities and drug trafficking. Only there are other people who want what you want, and so you have to watch your back. Letting go, dulling your senses is equivalent to showing your side, and so you find the villa full of hit men who want you dead. But Tony Montana isn't the type to die so easily... Scarface: The World is Yours begins exactly where the film with Al Pacino ends, but with one difference: the protagonist manages to survive the terrifying shooting, he makes his way and manages to escape in a car. Some time later he returns to Miami, without possessing anything but with the intention of rebuilding his empire and taking revenge on those who wanted him dead. You put yourself in command of Tony during the assault on the villa, so you need to quickly learn how the combat system works: the left analog stick moves the character, the right one moves the viewfinder of the equipped weapon. By pressing one of the back buttons you can automatically ~lock~ on the closest target, possibly adjusting the aim always with the right stick. Another back button and the trigger is pulled. And Radical Games' intentions are already clear: hit an enemy on the head and you'll see it literally explode; wound its leg and it will fall to the ground screaming. The effectiveness of each weapon is transposed in a realistic way: the ~regular~ pistol, except for targeted shots, must literally be unloaded on the opponent to work. The shotgun, on the other hand, is deadly from close range and hits nearby enemies. Not to mention the AK47, which also works well from a distance and proves to be quite versatile. Weapons are fundamental in Scarface, as it should be: underlining the goodness of the combat system was the most logical choice to give a game that on paper (and not) appeared like a sort of GTA clone with its own personality. Yes, even in Scarface the character runs faster by pressing a button on the pad... Here is one of the most popular places; expensive you will have to buy... Don't be surprised by the harbors and bays - the action on the water is endless. consistent. Even in the game the sun sets... Game mechanics The objectives of the game are multiple: Tony must become richer but also increase his reputation proportionally, buying an infinite series of objects, making investments, bringing new girls to his house and eliminating all the gangs who fight to divide what was before was his property: the entire city of Miami. Even the question of the territory in Scarface occupies a leading role: by accessing the map of the city, we will have a detailed picture of the commercial activities we own and those for which we are in negotiation, of the gangs of traffickers, of the areas still outside our control as well as the range of action of the police. There is really a lot of irons on the fire and you become aware of the various possibilities only after several hours of play, so it is appropriate to describe everything with an example: you have just restored Tony's house and got back in touch with the banker who takes care of to launder your dirty money. Well, after having bought a car from those in the ~catalogue~ and hired a driver (in name but not in fact: you will drive), you can go to the city and contact good old Felix to get you some work to do. Once the mission is completed, with a lot of money in your pocket and a good amount of drugs, you can buy one of the many businesses in the area and stop to sell the stuff to local drug dealers, trying to get the best price. If during one of your tours you should come across a gang, you will have to fight them and wipe them out to clean up the neighborhood, but be very careful of the police: being on the street with a weapon in hand increases exponentially the chances of alarming passers-by, who they will call the police. If you don't want to finish the job ~in installments~, you will have to risk arrest and flee once the last enemy has been killed. This is not a simple practice, however, as the policemen are anything but stupid, and will succeedor to follow you even if you own a fast car. With a little head start and a few well done turns, you'll be able to outrun them. If, on the other hand, the situation is critical, perhaps because you had to eliminate an agent too close, the game will warn you that you are literally f... well, you get the idea. In that case, there will be nothing to do: you will have to start over from the last checkpoint, losing the money and drugs collected but not deposited. You can buy many vehicles and steal as many. Watch out for the police, though. In the game there is no shortage of cutscenes, indeed they are extremely numerous. Ferrari (which here is called Fellini for a matter of rights) snaps that it is; a pleasure. How big is the city Miami is divided into zones, which must be conquered one by one. That means raising the money to buy a business and preparing to defend it against the onslaught of Sosa's men, the trafficker who wants you dead. This phase of the game is a bit like facing an end-of-level boss, and allows you to really take a step forward in terms of reputation. The last commercial activity of each area is generally a large warehouse, which must be emptied of all its guardians (many) and used to create cheerful delivery sessions. As mentioned above, you can pause the game at any time and take a look at the city map. From there you can place a ~cross~ on the place where you want to go, a cross which will then be shown on the radar screen to orient you towards your destination. Getting around the streets is a little complicated at first, then as you learn the intersections and even traveling many kilometers it becomes pleasant: the driving model is valid, the vehicles are profoundly different from each other and only in some cases you can complain of excessive severity, for example when you throw traffic lights in the air as if nothing had happened but nailed against a tree. While driving, it is possible to use the handbrake to drift around corners (paying attention to the inevitable traffic) but also to use weapons, in a rather nonchalant way. And so you can decide to attack a gang arriving with a fast car, decide to run over a couple of enemies and kill two others from the window, then decide to get out and complete the work. Here, decide: the fundamental element of Scarface. The game does not put you in front of a pre-established track, or at least it does so only in broad terms: you can implement any strategy you deem best to pursue your objectives, and conquering the neighborhoods one after the other will only be a natural aspect of your conduct. Shooting at cops is fun. really inadvisable... More go ahead and more; weapons you can buy. Grenade launchers too... The graphics of the game on PS2 are very good. in low resolution, but it doesn't fail to amaze with its numbers. The technical question Quantity or quality? Scarface: The World is Yours definitely leans towards the first, but without neglecting the second. In the game we will have the possibility to go around all of Miami, as well as the ~island~ locations, without any loading, which is really an exceptional result. The price to pay is a not very high level of detail, but still more than functional to the game action. Tony Montana / Al Pacino is perfectly portrayed, the general quality of the characters is quite good and the vehicles are also nice to look at. The sound sector is also of great substance, with a soundtrack signed and made up of dozens and dozens of songs taken not only from the original film, but also from the years in which the film is set. All this is seasoned with convincing effects and high quality speech, with Pacino's voice imitated effectively (we don't know if the Italian version will also have dubbing in our language or only subtitles). The dozens of missions that you can take on! participating can also hide traps... Each vehicle has its own energy bar. If you run out of it, it's time to go. the case to get out of the cockpit quickly! You will come across often to engage in more casual conversations. or less pleasant. Comment It's not often you come across products as compelling as Scarface: The World is Yours. The game is really huge for the extension of the area, for the high number of things that can be bought (cars, boats, furniture, objects, weapons, fixers, etc. etc.) and for the numerous missions present. The good technical realization, which gives its best on PC due to the high resolution and very defined textures, but which also gets along well on Xbox and PS2, is only functional to the action. The system ofcombat is excellent, vehicle handling convincing. Ironically, one of Scarface's few limitations can only be his greatness: finding yourself managing such a vast territory becomes difficult due to the ~dead spots~ represented by the necessary journeys from one part of the map to another. For the rest, if you want a game to be passionate about, a product of depth and with strong contents, the new Radical Entertainment title must be your first choice. Without a doubt. Pros: Immense Technically up to the task Excellent combat system Cons: Some dead spots in the advanced stages Occasional bugs in rendering polygons I got the yeyo In Scarface a particular system is used to carry out transactions, of any kind (the sale of drugs, the deposit of money at a subsidized rate, the search for information): one of the pad buttons is pressed to start a slash, and you must release it before the ~terminus~. The closer you get to the limit, the better the result will be. If things go badly, though, get ready to bring out your guns A pound and a half of the good one, thank you. Do you have balls? In addition to the energy bar, our dear Tony has a very particular bar: that of er, attributes. By killing enemies with edged weapons, or verbally threatening them while they shoot at us, this bar will rise and once filled it will allow us to enter ~blind rage~ mode: for a limited period of time the view will switch to first person, we will be invulnerable to attacks and our blows will become deadly. Making a video game from a film is now part of the merchandising plans of any large production, on a par with T-shirts, cereals, trading cards, CDs with soundtracks and action figures. There are times, however, when you don't try to ride the hype of the moment, taking advantage of the popularity of a film to sell too often mediocre games. Times in which one decides to confront a cult, to pay homage to it, to communicate to the players the passion for that film... It happened with ~The Warriors~ and it happens now with ~Scarface~, a film directed by Brian De Palma and starring by the great Al Pacino. If in the case of ~The Warriors~ the developers of the Rockstar team have decided to tell the same story as the film, adding details and flashbacks, the case of ~Scarface~ is emblematic, as it poses the question ~what would have happened if Tony Montana had he survived?~", "date": "2006-10-13", "grade": null}
