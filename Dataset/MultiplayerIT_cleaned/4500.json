{"name": "Dwarf Fortress", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dwarf-fortress-recensione.html", "text": "There's a reason Dwarf Fortress by brothers Tarn and Zach Adams (Bay 12 Games) is exhibiting at MoMA, despite its text-based graphics and steepest learning curve in video game history, and that's because it's able to do something that no other video game is able or has ever tried to do: convincingly simulate a world, right from the start of generating the game world. The objective given to the player is actually very simple: manage a group of dwarves and have them build a fortress to defend themselves from dangers. Between saying and doing, however, there is an astonishing amount of game systems, some manifest, others hidden, which create a unique and essential experience, as we will see in the review of Dwarf Fortress, actually Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress, just arrived on Steam and itch.io in a graphically renewed version and even with an attempt at a tutorial. Losing is fun Dwarf Fortress will not take you by the hand Who looking at the images comes to mind Rimworld do not be deceived, it is Rimworld who tried to copy Dwarf Fortress, succeeding moreover only in part. Honestly, we don't even try to describe everything the Adamses' game, in development since 2002 and made available to the public for the first time in alpha version since 2006, can do, the prospect of even trying is so distressing. To make you understand what we are talking about we will use a meme. In 2012 the book was published: ~Getting Started with Dwarf Fortress: Learn to play the most complex video game ever made~ by Peter Tyson, 248 pages long. The players, amused by the claim to explain the basics of the game in such a ~little~ space, immediately made a meme of it, lengthening the size of the volume a little. The manual with the basics of Dwarf Fortress as imagined by users Surely this is an exaggeration, but it makes it really good how you have to approach the game: with a lot of humility and desire to learn. Here one of the novelties of the Steam / itch.io version of the game comes in handy, namely the presence of a tutorial. Now, making a tutorial for Dwarf Fortress that is capable of introducing its gameplay is already a worthy undertaking in itself, as crazy. On the other hand it is impossible to launch such a title among the masses without at least trying to explain it. Bay 12 Games has chosen a rationally impeccable approach: that of providing the information necessary to survive the first five minutes, which is not as obvious as it seems (hence the game's motto ~Losing is fun~). Let's say that from this point of view the project was successful, but don't expect screen writing to explain everything to you. You will need them, but then you will have to do it yourself, using your brain. More than a game, a philosophy When at full capacity, fortresses look spectacular Dwarf Fortress is the closest thing to life in gaming. The very angular approach of the Adamses, who have chosen to focus on the development of the game systems, leaving out everything else, really pays off only after having overcome the terrifying initial impact, the one for which you look at the screen and think: ~and now what I have to do?~. This is actually the point: experiment freely, always keeping in mind that surprises are behind every click. Do you think that only the generation of the world deserves a separate tutorial. Consider that the two madmen, said in a good way, have opted for the creation of such a complex and multifaceted system, that before each game the game elaborates a complete geological history of the map, complete with emergence and drift of the continents. Each box is steeped in this story, which takes on its own function, even anthropic, during the game, influencing an enormous series of factors. Then consider that the game world is only apparently 2D, since each box has dozens of layers, all with their own functions. Thus, for example, an area is more or less windy depending on the surrounding geographical conformation, while the presence of some materials is linked to the age of the soil and so on. [embed yt= p_dNTrOG0Kg] The only ways to really learn how to play Dwarf Fortress are either to turn to the very kind community, where you can find valuable help, or by making attempts to see what can work and what doesn't and, in case of defeat, use the knowledge acquired in the next game. Only by doing so is it possible to slowly enter what is really a small videogame miracle, in which every action is in fact a choice that affects the whole context. At that point, when the functions of the interface start to become clear, when the boxes no longer appear as unknown territoryor full of dangers, but like a prairie full of possibilities, and when you start to really get into the spirit of the game, then Dwarf Fortress blossoms and you start thinking about how to enlarge the hole initially dug to defend our people, turning it into a organic and functional construction. You also begin to appreciate everything that the game world has to offer, being amazed at how it manages to propose ever new situations and how it is so full of emerging narrative that it is easy to understand why the tales from Darwf Fortress have become a real gender among the community. Anything can really happen, including assaults, love stories, famines, escapes... In Dwarf Fortress the player has complete freedom of action The narrative component is so strong and loved by the players, that at a certain point the Adamses also created an Adventurers mode, essentially a roguelike role-playing game inside the immense management. But still, because when players realized that every world they generated was full of details, they began to ask to know more and to record their deeds. They were satisfied with the Legends mode, which basically allows you to explore the history of the created maps and relive the highlights of the games. There is the graphics On Steam there is also graphics One of the most important novelties of the Steam / itch.io version is certainly the introduction of graphics. Please note that the free version, which will always be available and will be updated with new content, has textual graphics based on the CP437 character set. The reason for this radical choice (it was also in 2002) was explained by the developers themselves: the graphics were an obstacle they didn't want to have. Most of all they were interested in perfecting the game systems as much as possible, which they did constantly, releasing hundreds of updates. However, arriving on Steam has required taking some dust out of the packaging, so to speak, and accepting that you need to add some glitter. Nothing shocking, given that we are talking about very small boxes with limited animations, but at least now the sense of repulsion caused in many players by the textual world should have disappeared, moreover not very easy to decode without specific help. Don't expect who knows what, but compared to textual graphics, the step forward has been decided and frankly welcome, especially since those who love the old version will be able to continue playing it without problems.", "date": "2022-12-05", "grade": "9.5"}
