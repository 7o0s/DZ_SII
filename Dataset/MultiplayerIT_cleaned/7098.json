{"name": "Distopia canaglia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/132282-wolfenstein-the-new-order-distopia-canaglia.html", "text": "The storytelling is the best thing about Wolfenstein: The New Order, and the beauty of it is that it seems absurd to think about. A first-person shooter that tells its plot well (very well), thanks above all to excellently directed cutscenes (they even allowed themselves the expedient of the ~fragmented~ shot, which elegantly recomposes itself in the protagonist's close-up) is not for everyone the days, even more so if you compare it with titles that should be a step above just in terms of narration and direction (who said Assassin's Creed?), and which instead get lost in a whirlwind of wrong timing, hasty solutions and holes logical. In short, the work done by MachineGames from this point of view is impeccable and the fact that the first levels act as an introduction to what comes next, complete with titles that scroll while the soldier William ~B.J.~ Blazkowicz falls into the void at the end of a particularly hard and engaging sequence, it is just a further touch of class. As you already know, if you have read our detailed review, the events of the game take place during two different historical periods: the final stages of the Second World War and a dystopian and alternative 1960, the result of the victory of the Nazis. Remained in a catatonic state for fourteen years due to a metal splinter that ended up in his skull, Blazkowicz awakens in his moment of greatest need, again at the end of a sequence in which the cruelties of the Third Reich are very well represented, and recovers to do what he does best: kill the bad guys. His mission will lead him to the heart of Berlin, on the trail of what remains of the resistance, and at the same time dealing with the human/robotic monstrosities built by German scientists, one in particular. And then you shoot The enjoyment of the plot of Wolfenstein: The New Order, told without sparing ~mature~ interludes (at least more than usual for PEGI 18 productions) perfectly contextualized, bathed in bloody violence for which more than one work on the Nazis had already prepared us and assisted by a well-made Italian dubbing (with the only - serious! - flaw of too low levels for the voices compared to the rest of the audio, also made up of solid effects and decidedly spot-on music), it clearly does not represent the only advantage of a production that is appreciated from the first minutes and for the entire duration of a rather full-bodied campaign, without particular declines, which we are allowed to face in two different variants depending on a choice made during the early stages, which then goes to influence the unfolding of the story. There is in fact the gunplay, and this too we found excellent, distinctly ~old school~ but equipped with very solid foundations, excellent feedback for weapons and impacts, as well as solutions that add value to firefights (see the armor of some enemies, which jumps as we land hits, revealing their weaknesses). MachineGames' shooter is not one of those ~with the nanny~, like Battlefield or Call of Duty, and therefore the gameplay does not arise as an alternation of scripted situations in which we simply have to follow our companions without being able to decide what to do and where to go. It only happens at a certain moment that you have to run after an ally, but even in that case the thing is perfectly contextualized (it is a flight and only he knows which way to take). In general, therefore, there is a welcome exaltation of the level design and alternative approaches to the head-on collision are valued, such as silent eliminations with the knife. To reward these choices, the developers have seen fit to include ~specializations~ that are obtained once certain achievements have been unlocked, and which enhance our character in different ways. A beautiful and elegant idea, however implemented without too much fanfare, which fits in with a whole series of effective and evidently well-calibrated solutions, such as the sliding and ambush system, both very ~natural~, and the frequent use of barricades which, however, can often and willingly be torn to pieces by the gusts of our enemies, drawing the picture of a very dynamic scenario, in which it is not possible to fossilize but which rather enhances the movement and decisions made quickly. To further enjoy all of this, we suggest you select a higher difficulty level than the ~normal~ one, which we found in some ways easy and a little too forgiving. Artificial deficiency? A few days before the release of Wolfenstein: The New Order, gameplay videos had popped up showing nparticularly inept and passive enemies, so as to raise concerns about the quality of the game's artificial intelligence. Well, in the field test we can say that the promptness, reactivity and behavioral routines of the opponents are average for shooters (indeed, probably above if we look at titles such as Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty: Ghosts). In fact, the Nazi soldiers don't just shoot at us, but they move from their shelters, try to go around and take us from behind, in short, they are quite dynamic in their attitude and this invariably pays off in terms of challenge and involvement. Mechanical opponents, like robots, tend instead to ~stop~ when we disappear from their radar, however this is a completely understandable and contextualized behavior in view of an advanced robotic technology but still belonging to an alternative 1960 . Wolfenstein: The New Order is a great buy if you're looking for an excellently crafted ~old school~ FPS The PC version Thanks to the versatility of the id Tech 5 engine, Wolfenstein: The New Order looks very, very similar on PC and consoles. The engine used, the same as RAGE, is based on OpenGL and therefore does not include some of the latest technologies, focusing above all on the fluidity of the action with the cap at 60 frames per second. This does not mean that the graphics of the MachineGames title are excellent, and in fact we appreciated almost all of what alternates on the screen, also in this case thanks to a direction that absolutely does not skimp on spectacularity (see the plane of the first levels , but also many subsequent situations). The polygonal models are well made and betray only a few ~edgy~ details, while the texture system seems to have solved the pop-up problems that we had seen in the aforementioned RAGE, while showing the side to textures that do not give a close-up view the best of himself. It is the flip side of the virtual texturing system that characterizes the id Tech 5, which uses huge textures rather than putting together a certain number, often equal to each other, avoiding the risk of repetition. Another downside is the more than 40 GB required for installation, but at least the amount of data is not made up of uncompressed audio files that are completely useless for the quality of the experience, as happened for Titanfall. There are many options available on PC to scale on less performing configurations: it is possible to change the resolution, activate or deactivate the vertical sync (without however experiencing drops in the frame rate, at least in our case), increase or decrease the field of view and then adjust again the size of the cache for the textures, compress them or not (it is recommended to do it if you have less than 2 GB of video memory), work on the depth of field, reflections and light effects. By setting all the values to the maximum, at 1080p and with v-sync activated, we obtained a constant 60 frames per second, with rare cases of falling towards 50. In short, the difference between PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is visually minimal, as the various video comparisons testify, therefore you can proceed with the purchase of the game on the system that best suits you, without particular fears.", "date": "2014-05-26", "grade": "8.3"}
