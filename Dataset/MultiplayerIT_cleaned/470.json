Also perplexed are those who, in the trailers published so far, have recognized the legacy of the mediocre Dirge of Cerberus, one of the worst titles in the so-called Compilation of Final Fantasy VII much desired by Tetsuya Nomura. In short, we approached this DLC with a mixture of anxiety and concern, sure that we would have fun thanks to the usual combat system, but fearful that the story could disappoint us. We tell you how it went in the review of Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Episode INTERmission. History Final Fantasy VII Episode INTERmission: Bloodbath is Yuffie's Limit Skill. It turns out that history has indeed let us down, but for entirely different reasons than you're thinking. Let's get right to the burning issue: Deepground's subplot was the least of our problems. Indeed, to be honest, the presence of Weiss and Nero didn't even weigh us down. The two villains have a very tight screentime in the DLC economy. The first only serves to justify its presence as an optional boss in the VR Missions of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, while the second is faced in combat in the DLC as anticipated by the trailers. The way they are introduced, however, is very subtle and, indeed, serves to cast a further shadow of uneasiness and mystery on the affairs of Shinra. On balance, new players of Final Fantasy 7 now know that Shinra has a special team of completely unpredictable superhumans that it can deploy as needed, but the DLC does not linger too much on them nor on Deepground. They exist, they are disturbing, and that's it. Considering how bad these characters were in Dirge of Cerberus, that's okay too. Final Fantasy VII Episode INTERmission: One of the first fights. The problem of the narrative lies elsewhere, namely in the storyline of the DLC and in the characterization of the protagonists. Episode INTERmission is what can be defined as a ~filler~ in television terms, practically a story that acts as a filler and which adds very little to the overall outline. There's very little really relevant information we learn in the five hours or so it takes to complete the new content, and it doesn't do much to revisit some iconic moments from a different perspective. Yuffie arrives in Midgar to steal the mysterious Ultramateria that Shinra would keep in its laboratories: the plan would serve to consolidate Wutai's warlike intentions with the help of the original Avalanche, a much more scrupulous team than Barret's terrorist cell. The young ninja can count on the help of Sonon Kusakabe, a former student of her father Godot with an outstanding account with Shinra: it would have been an invention of the evil Scarlet, in fact, to kill her sister Melphie. Final Fantasy VII Episode INTERmission: Yuffie can throw her shuriken like a boomerang. Unfortunately, however, the limited duration of the DLC does not guarantee Sonon the space he deserved: the result is a barely sketched and quite generic character, with unexpressed potential. More astute, however, the characterization of Yuffie, a character who in the original of 1997 was completely optional and who was then better defined in the subsequent multimedia productions inspired by Final Fantasy VII, but always in the background. Kazushige Nojima in this case made the wisest choice: instead of deepening it with flashbacks or complicated storylines, he exacerbated its idiosyncrasies, making it an even more exhilarating character who nevertheless shows a serious and determined side when necessary. The writing is balanced and finally does justice to the young ninja, anticipating the reasons that will lead her to join the Cloud Strife team. Final Fantasy VII Episode INTERmission: Yuffie can explore the world in a very acrobatic way. The rest works in fits and starts. The stage presence of the odious Scarlet in the final bars is good; much less interesting are the members of the Avalanche, who have a very limited presence in the history of the DLC. Our impression is that Square Enix has attempted the same approach seen in the Xenoblade Chronicles 2 expansion Back ~ The Golden Country: getting us familiar with the microcosm of Sector 7 for the ultimatebut time, triggering a strong emotional reaction in the players. Unfortunately, the experiment didn't go as planned, because in Episode INTERmission you spend too little time in these slums, and the bond that is established with the characters and the scenario is much less tight than in the original game. The two chapters of the DLC Final Fantasy VII Episode INTERmission: Fort Condor is a strategic minigame. The DLC is in fact divided into two chapters. The first takes place almost entirely in Sector 7, so much so that it recycles most of its assets. The introduction is a kind of tutorial lasting a few minutes that teaches us the peculiar combat mechanics: in Episode INTERmission you control only Yuffie, who can fight in two ways. The ninja attacks normally with her shuriken, stringing together combos that inflict physical damage at close range; by pressing the triangle button, however, Yuffie can throw the shuriken, which deals damage over time and changes her normal attacks, which become ranged shots. Employing the Elemental Ninjutsu technique, Yuffie can change the properties of her ranged attacks to exploit the enemy's vulnerabilities and induce the Stagger condition faster. Alternating the two attack methods is therefore essential to keep distance from enemies and hit them at the same time. Final Fantasy VII Episode INTERmission: Polk will teach us how to play Fort Condor. Sonon, on the other hand, cannot be controlled directly. The player can still give him orders which the character will instantly execute, but otherwise he will act of his own free will and usually play the role of ~tank~. By pressing L2, however, the player can activate the Synergy state, which allows you to power up some of Yuffie's special attacks that the ninja will perform together with Sonon, provided both have enough ATB. Often you have to decide, on the spot, whether to consume all the ATB in a synergistic attack or perform two actions separately: the difficulty level of the DLC is not particularly high, but some bosses can become quite challenging if the possibilities of the new system are not exploited correctly of fighting. The idea is not bad and we must admit that we would not have minded if Square Enix had implemented it to marginally control Red XIII in the final stages of Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Otherwise, players of the original can expect the same features: weapons earn Skill Points to spend on bonuses that guarantee a decent level of customization, and there are plenty of Materials to equip and upgrade, including the spectacular Ramuh invocation. Final Fantasy VII Episode INTERmission: Sonon Kusakabe is a new character. Chapter 1, in the face of the recycling of scenarios and situations, is the most varied and fun of the DLC. After the introduction, you immediately find yourself free to wander around Sector 7 and carry out some secondary activities, among which the search for the Happy Turtle flyers, a fun quote from the original dated 1997, and the mini-game Forte Condor stand out. The latter surprised us positively; Square Enix has redesigned one of the most criticized segments of Final Fantasy 7 and turned it into a colorful and intuitive tower defense mini-game. Sector 7 is full of NPCs to challenge, some of them quite famous like Wedge, Jessie or the wacky Rosche. In essence, a type of configuration is chosen, on which many factors depend, such as the reload speed of the ATB, the number of units to be deployed, the materials that can be used and so on; after which the ~deck~ is prepared with the units in our possession, perhaps evaluating each choice based on the opponent's configuration: each unit, in fact, reacts differently to the opposing ones, and the three different types are linked by a scissor relationship -rock-paper. Final Fantasy VII Episode INTERmission: The Windstorm ability used in synergy with Sonon. Once the game has started, you deploy units as they become available, but always using your head: you have to attack your opponent, but also protect your own half of the battlefield. Each game lasts three minutes, and whoever destroys the opponent's stronghold or damages it the most when time runs out wins. By defeating the various level 1 opponents, we move on to level 2 opponents and so on, until we reach the clash with the best player in Sector 7 who will obviously reward us for our victory with a rare material. Forte Condor, however, is a content that carves out a few minutes in the total played of the DLC, which obviously gives more space for action and fighting, as it should be. Chapter 1 is however more balanced in terms ofside activities, exploration and combat. The story takes us to a factory full of simple environmental puzzles which, thanks also to the vastness of the scenario, stimulates the player to explore and demonstrates good quality level design. Chapter 2, on the other hand, confines us to the final corridor of the DLC. After starting it, it will be impossible to resume pending activities in Sector 7, and we will spend the rest of the time in the Shinra laboratories. It's certainly the weaker half of the DLC, especially when it comes to location variety, but Square Enix has managed to balance the narrative and action without one dominating the other. Once this Chapter is completed, after a decidedly demanding boss fight, the DLC ends with a cinematic that represents a real bridge to Final Fantasy 7 Remake 2 and which will raise endless controversies and discussions. Guaranteed. In conclusion... Final Fantasy VII Episode INTERmission: Zhije is a member of the Avalanche. Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Episode INTERmission is a more than decent DLC, fun to play but not particularly brilliant in terms of narrative. Yuffie's characterization and the Fort Condor minigame are undoubtedly the best part of the DLC, together with the proven combat system of the Remake and the enhanced technical sector of the Intergrade version for PlayStation 5 which allowed us to play it in Performance mode with granite fluidity even in the most elaborate and chaotic visual sequences. Given these considerations, we recommend this DLC to those who have already enjoyed Final Fantasy VII Remake, but considering the price, the short duration and the marginal contributions to the new storyline, perhaps it is better to wait for an important discount.", "date": "2021-06-11", "grade": null}
