{"name": "Jet Set Radio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108802-jet-set-radio-pattinare-a-tokyo.html", "text": "Released in the now distant 2000 for Dreamcast, Jet Set Radio is the testament not only of a Sega that perhaps no longer exists, but also of a certain way of conceiving typically Japanese video games. Shaped by the skilled hands of Smilebit, the title was revolutionary above all for the use of the cel-shading technique, avant-garde at the time, which gave it a cartoonish look despite a laughable number of polygons today. But not only. Jet Set Radio is a true monument of style that combines slapstick comedy, choreography worthy of a musical and an absolutely irresistible soundtrack. It is no coincidence that the equivalent of such an explosive style is that of the master Tetsuya Mizuguchi and his delirious Space Channel 5, also from Sega. But is it possible for all this talent to be invested in a simple Rollerblade title? To find out, if you haven't done it at the time, this faithful high resolution porting will take care of it at the cost of only ten Euros. Rock it on Set in a very colorful Tokyo, Jet Set Radio narrates the adventures of a group of wild teenagers, the GG, competing with other eccentric gangs for control of the streets, obviously using roller skates, spray cans and graffiti. In fact, the aim of the game is precisely to smear the objective points indicated in the various maps proposed, trying to escape the police forces who will rush in as a group in an attempt to stop us. Proceeding in the work we find ourselves facing increasingly dangerous opponents, such as the SWAT teams and Captain Onishima, not coincidentally a parody of the legendary commissioner Lupin's Koichi Zenigata, not to be underestimated though, as he is armed with a devastating pistol capable of terrorizing even Inspector Callaghan! The adventures are commented by Professor K, the resident DJ of the city and leader of the title's Jet Set Radio. Before experiencing all this, however, we must first pass a long tutorial in the role of Beat, the main protagonist, who must persuade those who will become his future teammates, imitating their tricks to convince them to join the GG. And we assure you that this is not child's play, those who have experienced this title at the time know very well what we are talking about, all the others must prepare themselves for a series of tests of the past, with instructions on what to do reduced to a minimum (when provided), with the risk of repeating the same challenges countless times. A nice cold shower for those used to the didactic and permissive approaches of modern video games. Xbox 360 goals Jet Set Radio presents, like all new Arcade releases, the usual 400 player points, divided over 30 objectives. The tutorial rightly has one of its own, on the other hand once you get it you will feel that you have earned it. For the rest, a long series of operations must be carried out, from the recovery of all the members of your gang to the most delusional actions, such as repeatedly painting Onishima's back. Good luck! Everybody jump around Once the unusual initiation has passed, things improve and the game opens exponentially, offering the possibility of choosing which element of the team to play (new ones can be recruited throughout the game) and the neighborhood to dominate, even if essentially we find ourselves in a structure with limited areas very far from the free roaming standards established by more recent titles. In the same way, the small number of commands available leaves us dumbfounded, even if we can say that the control system has managed to pass the severe test of time. Of course, the camera does not always facilitate a full view, but Jet Set Radio has other aces still valid up its sleeve. Let's talk about the combinations to make to create the graffiti, represented by a series of movements to be replicated with the analog stick. Often the time available to carry them out is very limited due to the inexorable pressure of the enemies, a feature that always keeps the adrenaline rate high and the fun. Technically Jet Set Radio is always a marvel to see thanks to its truly unique style, as already mentioned the polygonal limitation is compensated by the cel-shading and the charisma of the whole design, which oscillates between futuristic minimalism, street culture and craziness, but above all by the commendable harmony between images and sound accompaniment. Any character (including the protagonists) moves and makes sounds in time with the music, to mention the irresistible entrance of the police, hilarious even for those who know the title inside out. The apotheosis is represented precisely by the galvanizing soundtrack which, we will never get tired of saying it, is still a true masterpiece today. Mixing percussion and samplingn funk and hip-hop with the sparkling sounds of electronics, Sega almost writes a testament to the sounds of the nineties. The high resolution porting is excellent, even if some textures suffer in quality, but the general impact is all in all positive. The online options are limited to scores, as Jet Set Radio is a title designed exclusively for single players.", "date": "2012-09-25", "grade": "8.0"}
