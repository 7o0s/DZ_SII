{"name": "Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/samurai-jack-battle-through-time-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time represents one of those occasions in which a new title arrives on iOS devices, in this case via Apple Arcade, but also on PC and console at the same time (at a price, however, of 39.99 euros! ). This is not a technical miracle, given that the tie-in developed by Soleil comes with very simple graphics, rather dated to be honest, but which faithfully renders the aesthetics of the animated series created by Genndy Tartakovsky. Protagonist of the story is a skilled samurai nicknamed ~Jack~, determined to defeat the demon Aku to rid the world of its nefarious influence. However, the infernal villain possesses great powers, and thus sends Jack into the future or, as in the case of this tie-in, into a dimension that overlooks various possible time planes. This is not a novel narrative gimmick, given that it refers to the events of the last season of Samurai Jack, but it works great to be able to re-propose the best-known characters of the cartoon, voiced for the occasion by the original actors. Gameplay Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time is an action game with essential gameplay, bordering on the banal, which actually recalls the first videogame productions with three-dimensional graphics. Under Jack's command, our task in the campaign will be to overcome various levels and defeat the enemies within them using the magic katana supplied to the character but also numerous other weapons, of the melee or ranged type, with RPG elements that determine their resistance: after a while they break, when they are not repaired. The developers must be acknowledged for having tried to introduce several facets in this sense: by collecting objects from killed opponents or around the scenarios we will be able to unlock new skills and combos, improve our mastery of the various tools and, in general, enriching the combat system with many nuances. The problem is that these precautions do not materialize in a solid system, on the contrary we find ourselves dealing with very approximate collisions and a slippery and inconsistent yield of impacts, as well as with major balancing and difficulty problems: ranged weapons are overly effective, and at the normal challenge level it's all way too easy. Structure As mentioned above, the approach chosen for Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time is limited to the representation of situations already widely seen in the past, with an essential level design whose only peculiarity consists in sometimes passing from a three-dimensional setting, with an adjustable camera , to a two-dimensional one as you venture through certain passages. The feeling is actually that of being faced with a very old title, characterized in this way perhaps to allow even the youngest users to face it without major problems. That said, an excellent job has been done in terms of fidelity to the animated series: all the most important characters of Samurai Jack and the most characteristic settings are present, together with some touches of class. In fact, when the character takes damage and his vital energy bar drops, we will observe him ~barbarize~, let his hair down and eventually become the wild version present in some episodes of the cartoon. It is a pity that on the normal difficulty level, and with the many refills available within the levels, this practically never occurs. The controls Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time supports Bluetooth controllers, like any title in the Apple Arcade catalog, and it's actually a great luck: using a pad it is possible to play with the same layout seen on PC and console, while falling back on touch controls the situation becomes quite complicated due to the many buttons on the screen and an accuracy that in many cases leaves something to be desired. Technical realization Let's go back to the technical realization, which as mentioned appears very dated, as if it belonged to a couple of generations ago. However, the reason behind this choice could be the intention to remain as close as possible to the aesthetics of Samurai Jack, who actually adopts a minimal style for the characters and scenarios, and from this point of view it cannot be denied that the tie-in does justice to the atmosphere of the cartoon. The problem is that on a second generation iPad Pro the game struggles a lot, and with this graphics it doesn't seem normal to us: slowdowns are quite frequent in the most agitated situations, when there are many enemies on the screen, and there are even some annoying glitches on the cutscenes, for example the introductory ones appeared completelymind black. In short, the Apple Arcade version of the game certainly needs some updates, while there have been no rumors of particular problems on the other platforms.", "date": "2020-08-26", "grade": "6.5"}
