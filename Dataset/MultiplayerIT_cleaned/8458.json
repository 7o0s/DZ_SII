The first is that of Merida, the Scottish princess protagonist of ~Rebel - The Brave~, the new animated feature film by Disney Pixar. Daughter of King Ferguson and Queen Elinor, Merida refuses to follow the traditions imposed by her family and repudiates court life, taking refuge in the woods to cultivate her lifelong passion: archery. Her desire for freedom will unfortunately lead her to trust the wrong people and unleash a curse that could destroy the entire kingdom... will she be able to stop it? The second story is that of Temple Run, a running game with something like eighty million downloads, available for free on the App Store and Google Play, in which our goal is to escape from a herd of dangerous wild monkeys while we were within the walls of an ancient Mayan temple. The game uses gesture controls on the touch screen for the character to jump, slide and suddenly change direction, and as we cover greater distances, achievements, power-ups and extras of various kinds are unlocked. He runs, jumps, flies, what a horse he has... As written in the introduction, Disney did not want to produce a tie-in from scratch to promote the theatrical release of ~Ribelle - The Brave~, which in Italy will only take place in September due to the traditional abandonment of cinemas during the summer period , and therefore entrusted Imangi Studios with the task of creating a sort of spin-off of their Temple Run, redesigning the graphics and putting the red Merida at the center of the action. The incipit of Temple Run: Rebel is the same as the original Temple Run, or rather we have to escape from a terrible threat, in this specific case a huge wounded bear. Thus begins an endless race, the pace of which is accelerated every few seconds, going to amplify the degree of challenge and placing us in front of ever more numerous and sudden obstacles: roots that sprout from the ground, tree trunks that block the way, passages to be overcome in slip, collapsed portions of the road and so on. And then the inevitable changes of direction, a test in the test put there by the developers to prevent us from understanding what will be the gesture to make immediately after: a jump, a slide or a lateral move? In terms of gameplay, the differences compared to the popular running game by Imangi Studios are minimal and are identified with some sections in which Merida has to pull out her bow and hit the targets placed on the sides of the screen on the fly, in this case using our timely tap to hit the target and get a score multiplier. The rest hasn't changed, except technically: the new graphics appear more accurate, defined, full of details and accompanied by a more ~dense~ background of elements. Finally, the presence of a large number of achievements to unlock, as well as some upgrades for the objects present along the way, succeeds in reviving interest in the product and pushing us to run again and again.", "date": "2012-07-04", "grade": "7.0"}
