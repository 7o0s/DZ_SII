It is from the glories of Dungeons & Dragons, in fact, that the board game not only allows a handful of adventurers to take part in fantastic adventures of all kinds but at the same time allows them to shape their own ideas and give life to the imagination, perhaps building a completely original campaign. This last step is perhaps the element that has always been missing in the most successful video games and only in recent years have things started to turn around in a different way, thanks to the many sandboxes on the market and the arrival of real systems for video game creation. RPG Maker is probably the most effective and powerful tool born with this purpose in mind and the iterations that have appeared on the PC of the series are truly excellent. Here then is that creating something from nothing following your own idea also becomes reality for video games, with the further possibility of distributing it to the whole world in a few simple steps, perhaps even managing to give birth to something memorable as it was for To The Moon and The Witch's house. This year RPG Maker FES finally arrives on Nintendo 3DS and to be honest we expected many things from this version, either because using the stylus was perhaps the most comfortable and natural alternative to the keyboard, or because the Nintendo community always asserted in these cases, see the success achieved by Mario Maker. Unfortunately after a few minutes you realize immediately that something did not go according to plan... When the heart fails The strength of RPG Maker is that it allows anyone to create a video game essentially from scratch, without any programming background and with few basic ideas. So we're not talking about a real video game but rather a useful and fun tool to develop your imagination and that's why the incredible lack of any tutorial is one of the worst things that could happen to production. If you have already tried some other chapter in the series you may still be able to figure it out but if this is your first experience, the initial step could really be too high, making you lose all the initial enthusiasm. Why hand such a powerful tool to players and then leave them to their own devices? It's a question we asked ourselves over and over during our test, without ever being able to give ourselves a sensible explanation. Fiddling with the various options hardly leads to tangible results and we can assure you that creating something that is even trivial is not easy at all. You can take a basic map, adapt it by inserting rivers and adding woods or hills but even starting from this point, to get to a complete and playable product there will be too many intermediate steps to do. The only possible solution, for those approaching the series for the first time, is therefore to try, fail and try again until all the pieces are in the right place and the development of your idea does not start to take shape. ' more concrete. If you manage to achieve this goal on your own, and only from that moment on, you can start working on your party members, choose the classes they will play, add non-player characters and create the first lines of dialogue. A task that is certainly more tedious than seen on the PC thanks to the comfortable use of the keyboard but the stylus, as expected, still behaved very well and the text shortcuts work quite well. However, you get to a point where having created something, anything, is no longer enough and then you move on to the finishing touches. You move on to balance the statistics of your characters, to those of the monsters that you will have placed on your path and maybe even to change some area of the map that seems redundant or excessively complex to you. In short, after having wasted about ten hours figuring out how everything works, you will need several hundred to have a complete package that comes close, at least a little, to your starting idea. A rock that is difficult to overcome for casual players. I had big dreams for us However, RPG Maker FES has major limitations compared to the PC counterpart and not only related to the controls. The first is the extremely limited number of assets at your disposal in this basic version (only four of each type between monsters and heroes), not to mention the impossibility of modifying the different sprites in any way. Thus you will find yourself dealing with a standardization that undermines freedom of expressionand which basically makes all the productions available online very similar to each other. In fact, it is possible to download any type of game created by other users from an open library, this time however without any quality control during loading. Thus, it may happen that you find incomplete content in your hands, only sketched or unbalanced productions, somewhat ruining what is the true strength of RPG Maker. To expand your inventory of customizations, also ranging towards futuristic settings since only fantasy is included in the basic package, you will have to put your wallet again, with a considerable expense of almost twenty euros: a bit too much in our view given the already not exactly competitive price of the base title. The only truly appreciable idea combined with the production was therefore that of introducing a parallel application that will allow you to download all the titles created and uploaded by other users completely free of charge even if you don't own the complete game, obviously taking away the beauty of the creation but sharing the ideas of other players. We would therefore have preferred a more sophisticated feedback and evaluation system in this case as well, fundamental tools for the correct growth of the community, all tools that today seem not to want to be part of this universe and which represent the biggest failure of this operation.", "date": "2017-07-16", "grade": "5.5"}
