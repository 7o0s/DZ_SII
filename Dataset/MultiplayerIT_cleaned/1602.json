{"name": "PRIDE Fighting Championship", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pride-fighting-championship.html", "text": "~Who's The next??~ Pride FC is not one of a kind, before it there was UFC (and the disappointing sequel UFC THROWDOWN for PlayStation 2) for the never quite regretted Dreamcast. This title, with good reason, was elected as the best simulation fighting game ever made. Perfect from practically every point of view, the only flaw (if we really want to be picky) lay in the gameplay that was not immediate, which could discourage the casual player, but in fact, as already mentioned, it was a simulation. Will Anchor Inc. be able to surpass the work done by Crave? It's time to find out. What immediately catches the eye after a short loading of the DVD is the great care that the developers have placed in the presentation of the product. Great introductory movie, pounding music, really well done menu layouts, fabulous pre-match presentation with dedicated movie for each wrestler. The outline graphics are truly remarkable, that of the actual game a little less. The graphics engine used appears a little dated as regards textures and models: the latter, however rounded and well defined in details such as faces and proportions, lack the usual jagged defects and sometimes an annoying flickering in collisions. The animations are well done and numerous, the motion capture has been used rigorously; each wrestler has his own stance that characterizes him, his own moves and entrance and victory animations, as in any self-respecting sports fighting game. The styles featured such as Kick Boxing, Muai Thai, Wrestling, Shoot Fightin', Free Fighting, Jujitsu and so on are faithfully crafted, respecting the champions featured in the game. The Edit mode shines only under the point of view of the selection of the moves, really numerous and in the total freedom of choice of the combos. It is possible to chain up to 5 hits in succession, both for kicks and punches, for both the right and left side, creating truly interesting Custom-Combos for the professional player. Serious flaw, however, is the substantial lack of a large number of objects to customize your fighter. From this point of view the editor of Shut Your Mouth! still remains undefeated, and who knows for how long. The controls resume the glories of UFC on Dreamcast, triangle and square correspond to punches, while X and circle to kicks; by pressing them together horizontally we will carry out the counter moves, while vertically we will try to make a submission on the opponent. Perfectly functional for the purpose, they denote a certain response delay which causes a serious slowness to the action despite the nailed frame rate, without ever slowing down. The gameplay is very realistic in the end, obviously rearranged for videogame use, as those who follow this sport will know that matches often end even on the first try, if well settled. Here all this is absent, as is the possibility of immediately submitting the opponent due to the double bar (stamina and energy) which increases the resistance of one's alter-ego on the screen. Whether this is an advantage or a defect, it is up to the player to evaluate it: the fact remains that the game is mainly aimed at enthusiasts due to its simulative attitude, also accentuated by a pinch of strategy. ~I'm Da Man! I'm Daaaa Maaaan!!~ The biggest disappointment comes as soon as you notice how poor the game modes are: Tournament, Survival, Vs Mode and Training. The classic strength of Career Mode which would have increased single player longevity dramatically is missing. If we add to this the scandalous absence of unlockable extras, the interest curve inexorably drops to very low levels in single, to rise again worthily only in multiplayer. The sound sector is very well done, both from the point of view of the soundtrack and that of the effects. The presence of a single arena, or rather ring, in which it is possible to fight negates any variety of game, influenced only by the setting of the (few) rules. So are champions like Wanderlei Silva, Royce and Renzo Gracie, Marco Ruas, Otsuka, Inoue, Maurice Smith, Gary Goodridge and others enough to make this game great and attractive? Find out just below... Comment Pride Fc resumes the glories of a masterpiece like UFC, but it doesn't improve any aspect, indeed in some it gets drastically worse. The DVD seems filled more with movies than with the game itself, leaving a bad taste in the mouth when you realize how short the interest curve is in single player mode. Graphicallyand does its duty even if more attention could be paid to the variety and details. The controls are fine but the action feels quite slow and mechanical. Nothing to complain about sound and presentation, truly flawless. Longevity is ensured only in multiplayer, as in all fighting games for that matter. Ultimately, the purchase is recommended only for true fans of the genre, equipped with a couple of friends to play with, and, above all, for any non-owner of a Dreamcast and UFC. Pros: Great presentation Good controls and simulation aspect Wanderlei is there Cons: No innovations Total absence of unlockable extras and single player replay value Unacceptable absence of Chuck ~The Iceman~ Liddel ~You know what awaits you.. now only you count~ Vale Tudo, everything is worth it. Fighting style born in the clandestine fights of Rio De Janeiro, where it was allowed, as the name suggests, to hit the opponent in any possible way and with any part of one's body. You know Fig Club? That's right, here we are. But even more brutal and violent and, unfortunately, Real. These clandestine fights, so dangerous but fascinating at the same time, became more and more famous so as to attract athletes from all over the world who certainly didn't fight for glory or fame, but rather to prove that they were the strongest of all. Due to this interest, it was soon decided to legalize this sport; equip it with professional infrastructure and organization and, why not, make it a show to be fed to spectators hungry for violence and blood, without detracting from its ~roots~, that is: no rules. Thus the UFC was born in America and Pride is its Japanese counterpart. On paper, a great championship where the best fighters of each discipline can participate and challenge each other up to the coveted title; in fact, a great way to vent your frustration and get drunk on the sense of omnipotence in front of the defeated opponent. It must be said that this is a professional sport, the absence of rules concerns the parts of the body with which it is possible to hit the opponent, i.e. all with the exception of the teeth and intended blows to the genitals. Knees, elbows, heels, shins, shoulders, headbutts as well as classic punches and kicks, as well as locks and submissions are all accepted; you win by KO or Submission. The only differences between the Pride circuit and the UFC are the arenas in which you fight, in the former the classic quadrangular boxing ring, in the latter the mythical octagonal arenas closed by wire mesh from which, once you enter, you cannot get out. After this brief interlude, it's time to talk about the game.", "date": "2003-07-01", "grade": null}
