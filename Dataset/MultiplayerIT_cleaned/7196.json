While objectively recalling the Rovio product in some ways, Loco Motors has a personality of its own and above all a playful structure capable of highlighting the distinctive features of the game: the result is a puzzle game almost entirely based on field testing of one's own creations, in which repeating the same stage over and over again in search of the perfect combination is more the norm than the exception... It takes patience to appreciate it, but Loco Motors is a puzzle with a very special style Mother of God, the motor loco! Adapting perfectly to the dogmas of immediacy that have always governed the mobile market, the developers of Minority Media have set up a title that needs very few tutorial screens to be understood. As we mentioned at the beginning, the primary objective is to bring your car to the finish line of each of the 50 levels, represented by two-dimensional paths bristling with different pitfalls and obstacles. Reaching the end is a necessary but not sufficient condition, given that you also have to worry about collecting the bronze gear on the way that allows you to unlock access to the next stage. This object is almost always positioned in such a way as to make it easily obtainable, while the same cannot be said of the silver and gold equivalents: having collected the bronze specimen and crossed the finish line, one can in fact decide whether to continue or repeat the same scheme to aim first for one prize and then for the other. Here things get decidedly more complicated, and you need to arm yourself with ingenuity, patience and availability for pure ~trial and error~ dynamics: a dedication that is rewarded with a total of gold coins (which can be spent to buy aesthetic variants of the pieces that make up your car) and with access to three challenges for each level. In short, Minority Media evidently strongly believes in the concept of ~repetita iuvant~, a belief undoubtedly destined to split Loco Motors' audience in two: for every player who will appreciate the depth hidden in every single scheme, there will be another who will find basically boring having to repeat each stage up to six times to get all the rewards. The gameplay of Loco Motors takes place for the most part in the section dedicated to building your own contraption, the authentic beating heart of the playful experience. Taking advantage of a very simple interface, the user has the only constraint of having to equip his own creation with the fundamental components for it to function, i.e. engine, tank, driver's seat and wheels: the arrangement, type and quantity of the same are, however, absolutely free, even if every decision has effective consequences on the behavior of the car on the track. For example, a very powerful engine consumes much more petrol, while the number and size of the tires are the discriminating factor for the stability of the vehicle and so on. Once the creation phase has been completed and the vehicle has been positioned at the starting line, the player's task is largely complete: the acceleration dosage can only be established by pulling a cord placed in the lower part of the screen, after which he is only allowed to observe the progress of the toy car without being able to actively participate, as happened instead in Bad Piggies. If things don't work or when the next objective comes around, you can decide to try again by giving the car less power or go back to the drawing board and reconfigure the vehicle. There is no single solution to win in Loco Motors, all to the advantage of a puzzle game that pushes creativity and ingenuity like few others. However, there are some aspects that cast some shadows on the work of Minority Media, beyond the monotony of the basic scenario. Everything stems from the constant basic feeling that most of the victories are the result of luck rather than the user's skill, even considering the non-optimal precision of the vehicle editor, which does not allow you to better manage the millimetric changes they can make the difference between success and failure. Whether or not to overlook these nuances realistically determines how much Loco Motors can be involved in the medium/long term.", "date": "2014-04-11", "grade": "7.8"}
