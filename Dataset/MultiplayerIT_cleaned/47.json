{"name": "Terminator's Revenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/terminators-revenge.html", "text": "It starts from the year in which the world is already in the hands of machines to infiltrate the secret bunkers of the rebels and obtain information and microchips until you have enough material to be able to travel back in time to our present and nip the human alliance in the bud starting with those researchers who were the first to understand the dangers of the project. The beast of flesh and steel moves in a platform arcade-adventure, in the maze of underground fortresses he faces soldiers and some robots but the road is not always paved, in some cases he must have the intuition to break through the wall (you approach and the wall is marked as demolishable) or the floor (jump and press down) to access secret passages full of bonuses and pitfalls or simply to continue. However, brute force is not enough to make his way through, more often than not his path is interrupted by titanium sliding doors too hard even for him, not far away you will find terminals to activate, how to activate them depends on the situation, sometimes you have to recover an ~interface -hacking~, others activate other chain terminals, still others decipher a code that will be provided to you on the screen only for brief moments or kill the right scientist. As for the bonuses, it is possible to recover armour, energy, ammunition, hand grenades and extra weapons, anyone who has ever seen an episode of the Terminator trilogy has an idea of what role weapons play despite the power of the cyborg being already devastating by itself, the warmongers they'll salivate at the idea of handling assault rifles, lasers, grenade launchers, machine guns and the rest of the holy barbara (you can pull up to two at a time), and even if all this weren't enough to save your skin there is always one last hope , when you are killed you can attempt an emergency recovery, promptly type the numbers that appear on the screen and if you manage to repair his body in time you can start again from the same point where you died although with a minimum union of energy.
