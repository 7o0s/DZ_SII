Who better than the ~cousins~ of the north could create the perfect ice hockey simulator? Now reached the 2010 edition, just like the other serial videogames of the EA Sports label (FIFA, NBA, NFL), NHL 10 has also reached a point of no return, when the technical and gameplay sectors are now so refined, polished and tested as to no longer require revolutions or major changes. Just like what happened with FIFA, the turning point for the NHL was 2009, with graphics that finally detached the previous versions and an almost perfectly balanced playability. This year, with the 2010 edition, the philosophy of the team responsible for NHL 10 is to add options, modalities, opportunities, moves. In short, to create that ~surrounding~ even more lively, varied and complete which finally makes their creature beautiful, perfect and flawless. The innovations introduced Reviews of sports titles, especially serial ones, are never simple because they must always take two aspects into account: to speak to newcomers to the series, introducing the game in its entirety, and to satisfy the desire for novelty, delving into the details introduced with the last chapter. Ice hockey is certainly not a very popular sport in Italy, but for the very few who do not yet know what we are talking about, it is enough to know that it is a swarm of beefy men equipped with ice skates, helmets and armor who have to try to throw the puck, the black disk, inside the small opposing goal. Physical contact is not only allowed, but it is a part of the gameplay of this sport. Among the major innovations of the 2010 NHL we find a new approach to physics and physics, factors that determine the very nature of the game. First of all, the possibility of fighting on the field has been re-inserted (certainly not very educational element, but in fact present also in reality) with an unprecedented subjective view and the possibility of throwing blows at the opponent, holding him by the shirt and throw it on the ground. Obviously at our peril, because this kind of action always involves a temporary expulsion from the playing field. Honestly, this is one more option, but for the purposes of the game it brings practically nothing, on the contrary after doing it a couple of times to try the instinct is to never start a fight again, so as not to waste useless time and not be disqualified. The subjective view is a good variant compared to the horizontal 2D view of the old NHL Midway, in any case the visual experience is satisfying and engaging. The other aspect on which the developers have pressed the accelerator is certainly the game physics: it is now possible to play rough on the sidelines, crushing the opponent against the outside lanes and making our player's body feel on the one in contrast . The outcome of the clashes depends a lot on the physical structure, heaviness, speed of movement, giving an even more realistic feeling to the game action. The physicality of the players is also felt more in the middle of the field, when we manage to move or land the opponents with shoulder strikes and speed tackles. Unlike the previous chapters, this time the player's body, and his skates, can influence the trajectory of the puck, changing its direction and intensity if intercepted. The shooting system has been perfected: the puck is launched first by loading the shot with the right analogue, then directing the shot into three-dimensional space thanks to the left one, thus managing to create infinite trajectory possibilities: a decisive factor for a sport with of such a small net (moreover defended by armored giants on the score line). Curiosity The Hip Hop of the NBA and NFL leave ample room for the punk rock of some of the best bands in the stars and stripes. EA Trax, the ~soundtrack~ of every Electronic Arts sports game, is now synonymous with quality and quantity. Among the ranks of the NHL 10 OST are Rancid with ~The Bravest Kids~, Papa Roach with ~Into the Light~, Nickelback and ~Burn It to the Ground~, Scorpions with ~Rock You Like a Hurricane~, Green Day in ~Know Your Enemy~ and Megadeth and their ~Peace Sells~. A very high quality soundtrack, even if something more could have been done in terms of the number of songs, just 18. Matter of feeling The feeling on the playing field, while giving more physicality to the clashes, is the same as alwayse: the soul of NHL 10 is once again the same as last year. Having reached the famous point of no return, the developers can no longer drastically modify (nor improve) such balanced gameplay. What can be done, then, to give a pinch of vivacity to the 2010 chapter? The idea was to be able to choose one's own very personal style of gameplay, obviously not a brilliant or innovative idea, but one that is welcome in a sports title that has now reached its maximum potential. Thus, a menu appears from which to select (all strictly in English, no Italian): casual, default, normal and hardcore. In the first case, all aids for aiming, passing and blocking are deactivated. Normal is the standard gameplay pre-set by the programmers, while hardcore leaves the player with the burden of carrying out all the actions manually. With default we can indulge ourselves, creating our own personalized ~style~ of gameplay, modifying rules, physics, possible actions, fouls and so on. A matter of bat ~Road to the Cup~ has also been added to the classic season and the possibility of going directly to the play-offs, which catapults us into a final of the legendary Stanley Cup, battling with one of the official teams of the league directly in game 7, the one valid for be able to lift the prestigious trophy. In addition to the classic ~Be a Pro~, in which we play the role of a league player and face the championship only in our shoes, EA Canada has created a new mode called ~Be a GM~ (General Manager, Ed). In this case you don't play but you manage the fanchigia by buying, selling, discovering new talents and hiring qualified personnel to follow the team. It is also possible to unlock and earn new items and clothing to enhance our players: clubs, helmets, shirts and so on. All ~played~ modes are available in both local multiplayer and online via PSN (or Xbox Live on 360) where the game flows smoothly and without delay. One of the flaws of the 2009 edition, that of having some bugs on launches and online goals, has been eliminated. The goalkeepers' artificial intelligence has improved, perhaps even too much since they are now able to parry even deadly shots from a few meters away. At a normal level, however, the opposing AI shows too much freedom especially in the defensive phase, where the players appear too permissive and passive. In the offensive phase they prove to be decidedly more shameless and aggressive, while unrealistically wrong (occasionally) some blatantly easy passage. The goalkeeper, who is far too good at saving, suffers from some fairly important flaws in defense: he always tends to throw himself on the ground when passing perpendicular to the pitch, as if he wants to save at all costs, and leaves the attackers too much time to steal the puck due to an animation that is too slow to retrieve the game puck by hand. The online game, enhanced with a tasty entirely human 5 vs 5, is enhanced by the usual constant updates from EA Sports regarding news, drafts and rankings: the game dashboard is practically always connected to the internet. Playstation 3 trophies Just like its cousin FIFA10, NHL 10 also offers 42 trophies up for grabs for the player, of which 1 platinum, 3 gold, 10 silver and the rest divided between the bronze ones and some secrets. A large number of them are unlocked by playing online, or by obtaining particular positive performances. The rest is achieved with specific actions: a certain number of goals, using the NHL94 key configuration, scoring with an injured player, and so on. The accuracy of the models The visual component of NHL 10 is one of the most satisfying ever seen in a sports game. It is no coincidence that in the United States this game has won the prize for best sports title several times: the top-level graphics sector is an essential component of the visual simulation. The polygonal models are almost perfect, both in proportions and in precision and likeness with the real counterparts. Palazzetti and public are equally well made, embellished with animations, light effects and presentations that serve as the ideal setting for every meeting. The in-game animations are smooth, well captured and above all very varied. During the cut scenes and sporadically in the most excited game actions, slowdowns are noticed, now typical of any Electronic Arts sports production. NHL 10, before the next generations of consoles, represents the non-plus-ultra of console hockey simulations.", "date": "2009-09-30", "grade": "9.0"}
