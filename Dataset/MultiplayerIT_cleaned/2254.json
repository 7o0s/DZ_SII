{"name": "Driven", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/driven.html", "text": "Game mode After the (painful) presentation, the home screen appears, reduced to the essentials with very few game modes. An ~arcade~ (game room) and the other ~story~ that attempts to reproduce the film with 14 missions on the track different from the usual races. The main mode is precisely the story. Between one mission and another there will be videos, all in all well made that will better clarify the events. In the videos the characters are made with a style like Fear Effect or with faces glued onto the bodies in a cartoonish style, without contours. The menus, like the videos, are well translated; in particular the latter are completely dubbed in Italian with the voice of real Italian dubbers (such as that of Sylvester Stallone). Simulation? The game immediately from the first game shows a very particular style that is neither simulation nor too much fun. Precisely for this reason it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. The aspect is decidedly ~Arcade~ and given the scarcity of long-lived modes, having it played in the room would perhaps have been more appropriate than bringing it to the console. After a while you will realize that the control system is really awful! Too exaggerated on-screen reactions, lack of precision in the buttons all this will lead you to witness absurd spins against every law of physics! During a race it will happen to hear the volume of the music go down to a minimum and hear only the sound of the wind. What's strange? That this ~wind~ makes the control of the car (already horrible) disastrous by no longer allowing you to turn well, so you will find yourself against the guardrail due to a simple breeze that exceeds the strength of a hurricane. It's not just the looks... Graphically Driver proves to be a decent title! Well-crafted tracks, have great lighting effects, aliasing is non-existent and the cars are made with sufficient care. Of course, after being spoiled by other titles, this beautiful graphics does not satisfy us and leads us to look for something else that unfortunately is radically missing. The sound is another aspect achieved discreetly. During the race you will hear some quite catchy tunes as well as the roars of the engines and various effects such as crashes or skids. Checkered flag Summing up, the game proves to be a bad title that is definitely not worth buying. Driven might even deserve more but with GT3 and the other good titles that are already available it's really unlikely that anyone will buy it even if they liked the (equally mediocre) movie. Pros: There is S. Stallone!!! Discreet graphics Nice sound Cons: Terrible control system! There is S.Stallone Not long-lived It won't amuse you much Start!!! Another game based on a movie? Well I'm sorry but that's right! I say ~sorry~ because most of the movie-inspired titles have proven to lack depth and enjoyment. Driven may be the exception that proves the rule, but sadly it's always the same awful story. More glorious is the opposite phenomenon; movies based on video games are often bad unlike video games. Closed this small parenthesis let's analyze the characteristics of this title!", "date": "2002-02-02", "grade": null}
