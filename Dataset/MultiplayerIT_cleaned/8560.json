{"name": "Sniper Elite V2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/102592-sniper-elite-v2-giu-la-testa.html", "text": "Rest for Rebellion Developments never seems to exist, in addition to the recent NeverDead for Konami, the British company has dealt with the remake/reboot of its Sniper Elite for 505 Games, a game dating back to 2007. The choice does not seem so illogical, if from one on the one hand it is stimulating to reinterpret the mechanics of a title using more advanced technologies, on the other it reduces production times. However, this new version does not share much more than the characters and the scenario: a Berlin devastated by the Second World War and become a spectral battlefield between the Germans and the Russians. The protagonist Karl Fairburne is an American agent charged with obtaining valuable documents concerning the technology of the Nazi V2 missiles, but not before having overcome eleven dangerous missions. The aim is to make your way trying to avoid close combat, but striking using the trusty sniper rifle. In fact, Karl possesses prodigious sniper skills, a starting point on which a large part of this production is based, setting up a sumptuous show of death. When I grow up I want to be a sniper Sniper Elite V2 is therefore a title that distances itself from today's third-person shooters, which tend to prefer action to the detriment of realism, making it particularly suitable for those looking for more reflective products. Karl is not a hero, let alone a protagonist of some epic war novel, but a real shadow that moves through the cracks of a world devastated by war, a feature that brings the product closer to particularly in-depth stealth dynamics in certain chapters of the game. To obtain these assumptions, the programmers worked hard on the ballistics of the bullets, faithfully simulating the effects of wind and gravity, which require precise calculations to be made before pulling the trigger. At the same time, however, we have tried to maintain a democratic line by inserting a wide possibility of customization, it is therefore possible to completely circumvent the ballistics (in this case the bullets will proceed in a straight line) or adjust the artificial intelligence of the enemies. Whatever our choice, the sniper rifle and the spectacular killings caused by its barrel remain the unchanging protagonist. During its use, the game switches to a first-person view and uses a special shot to celebrate the best shots, called the killcam, which follows the path of the bullet up to the devastating impact with the target. On this occasion we witness breathtaking scenes set up with the X-ray technique, very similar to what we saw in Mortal Kombat, which shows us the damage done to the skeleton and organs. The visual rendering is very faithful to the targeted parts, these include the head, temples, cheeks, genitals, belly and so on and so forth; a veritable bombardment of digital violence. It is even possible to hit two soldiers at the same time, if placed in a straight line, or detonate grenades on their belts. Similarly it is necessary to shoot the petrol cans of the crawlers or armored cars to make them explode. The effect is absolutely exhilarating, it's hard to tire of these spectacular sequences thanks to their variety and splendid execution. The art of sniping is essentially a real pleasure, resulting in the most successful element of Sniper Elite V2. Lost roads Rebellion has set up a series of maps for the occasion using the proprietary Asura graphics engine, capable of impressive visual depth and excellent light effects, but less valid in terms of animations, interaction and textures. The settings are mainly urban, if we exclude some exceptions (such as a mountain missile base) we move in the rubble of a Berlin disfigured by bombing, where we must learn to exploit the vertical development of the levels to look for advantageous positions. Unfortunately we are not alone, the roofs are the territory of lethal Russian snipers, a real scourge in difficulty levels from Sniper Elite onwards. As we had already noticed in the previous test, the artificial intelligence problems of the enemies remain, decidedly inconstant. Just referring to the snipers, their surreal precision in hitting us and the absence of repercussions on the surrounding patrols leave us stunned. In a system in which the sound of a bell is relied upon to confuse it with our shot, it is not a detail that is conducive to realism. And unfortunately there are many similar cases. We noticed several shortcomings, such as enemies who didn't feel our presence or just wandered around absurdly waiting to be executed. Another problem is close combat exteminently deficient, the machine gun is practically unusable and there is no frontal bare-handed shot, ironically it is better to use the sniper rifle at point-blank range. The hit box outside the killcam is very confusing: it can happen to hit an enemy mortally and see him walking like nothing happened, or to be hit ourselves from impossible positions. This is not a determining factor in open maps, where the player is naturally incentivized towards a distance-based offensive, but tends to worsen in closed ones. The schematic and backtracking level design does not help, a fact which, combined with the deficits of artificial intelligence, makes the use of traps or elusive expedients (as well as hiding the bodies) useless, thus reduced to a subjective habit. The decision to leave full freedom in the regulation of each parameter is a double-edged sword, which demonstrates behind an apparent benevolence the difficulty of the development team in giving a decisive timbre. At the basic difficulty level everything is really too accessible and the strategic premise is slightly lost, while at the maximum level the management of the rifle becomes demanding and the soldiers acquire inhuman resistance, without however resolving the behavioral defects. Xbox 360 goals Sniper Elite V2 features the classic 1000 player points of retail titles, divided across 41 objectives. Our game allowed us to take home half of the points, while for the rest you have to face the online co-op mode or complete the campaign on the maximum difficulty level. This is my rifle Yet Sniper Elite V2 is not without its exhilarating moments. Starting from the aforementioned killcam, there are details of a certain class, such as the fight against a sniper who uses dolls to confuse our aim, the main theme played by vintage radios and a tangible atmosphere that manages to convey all the cruelty and devastation of the conflict, including the protagonist's sense of isolation. Exploiting the agony of one wounded soldier to lure another into a trap brings to mind historical scenes such as those from Full Metal Jacket. As icing on the cake, the Italian edition offers the voice of the excellent Roberto Draghetti, a significant added value. The graphic aspect is functional to the action and as we have said offers little interaction with the scenario, but it can give memorable glimpses and a warm color palette almost in contrast with the crudeness represented. Hidden in the various settings we can find gold bars and bottles of wine that we have to shoot at, elements that add a welcome element of exploration to a substantially linear structure. The game has a length that varies from seven to ten hours, depending on the skill of the player and the chosen level, while there are several online cooperative modes, including the entire campaign. Unfortunately, the competitive multiplayer mode is absent on the console, added only in the PC version, a big lack that significantly limits the longevity of the product.", "date": "2012-05-02", "grade": "7.5"}
