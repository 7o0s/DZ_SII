Blizzard's work has conquered the market in such a sudden and irrepressible way as to cut off the legs of all the competition, and even the most deserving titles have had to give way to its accessibility and continuous updates. Not that between the balance and the exponentially growing number of expansions there are no problems for newcomers to the card game made in Irvine, yet there hasn't yet been any video game with enough innovative drive to be able to get down with a knife between your teeth. Therefore, if there is no way to face such a giant in the open field, it is better to move with caution, prepare your strategy secretly, and conquer a loyal army of fans by turning them as far away as possible; and who knows, with the passing of time, at least a way to cripple him will be found. The plan of the Duelyst developers, veterans who have worked on titles such as Rogue Legacy and Diablo III, seems to be just this: to create a game capable of challenging the Blizzard colossus on the same level, but unique to the point of being able to conquer a user of all different, not necessarily so attached to virtual cards. And their contender for the throne they trained just fine. A free to play card game capable of insinuating Hearthstone? Maybe not, but Duelyst remains remarkable A collection of warriors Duelyst, at its core, is without a doubt a card game. The player builds a nice deck of 40 cards, chooses a general from the various races available, and prepares for battle. However, the chosen leader this time will not be a simple portrait at the bottom of the screen, but a mobile character on a playing field divided into squares, as in the most classic of tactical role-playing games. Duelyst is after all a title that has chosen to stand out by hybridizing cards with turn-based strategy, and the creatures, spells or artifacts played (these are the three types of cards available) will populate or directly influence the game map. Clearly these characteristics give the video game a completely different tactical depth from that of the main opponents: the ultimate goal is, as always, to eliminate the general opponent, but here, in addition to the fearsome combinations of creatures, powerful elemental magic and other surprises, it has enormous importance even the simple positioning of your alter ego, who can escape enemy attacks with a few steps in the right direction or create traps by carefully positioning his troops. For the rest, however, the title has similarities with Hearthstone, and uses a system of constant growth of mana to play the various cards practically identical to that of the Blizzard game, combined with skills that closely resemble the classic ones seen in each ancestor of this genre, from the historic Magic to the most recent emulators. You will therefore have at your disposal ravenous beasts that can attack in the turn they are put on the field, armored monsters with taunt that must be attacked by adjacent enemies, support troops that ensure you draw more cards or offer passive bonuses of some kind, and so on thus for a genuinely remarkable variety of options in such a young game. The order of battle The fact that there are even six races available and that each is equipped with two different generals is even more surprising, especially when one considers that the aforementioned generals are equipped with dedicated passive skills that can heavily influence a user's style of play . The same races then have variable specialties, which lead, for example, the Songhai to be very aggressive and focused on creature combos, or the Vanar to control spaces with a mixture of powerful spells, glacial walls and monsters with fairly effective defensive skills. There are also neutral cards, which can be inserted in any deck and are always very useful for completing particularly devastating combinations (also because the number of exclusive cards per race is high but not impressive, since it is the beginning of the game's life cycle). Another curious mechanic is that of substitution, which allows you to exchange a card from your hand with a random one from the deck during the turn, and gives greater stability to a player's battle plans. Finally, the developers have seen fit to insert mana globes in the maps which, if conquered with one's general or creatures, offer extra magical energy for summoning cards, and made sure that in a direct confrontation every surviving creature could counterattack. therefore it is really the case to calculate every move painstakingly hereHere you dive into the world of Duelyst. Each of these inventions is a boon for those who hate random cards or the percentage effects of certain card games and, while depriving the title of a bit of panache, move the balance more on the players' ability in calculating movements and in the use of the right card at the right time, than on simple strokes of luck. Pixels on paper Even technically and in terms of content Duelyst does not disappoint. The Counterplay Games game is free to play, but it's not one of those titles that require hours of desperate farming or a large expenditure of real money to get a decent deck. When buying Orbs (the equivalent of boosters in this game) there is no shortage of rare cards, and the necessary gold is earned with a certain speed between challenges and classic games. Speaking of challenges, Duelyst also does an excellent job at the tutorial level, offering players puzzle missions that teach practically all the strategic foundations necessary to not succumb online. Duplicates of already owned cards can among other things be created with a crafting system, provided that they are not basic cards that can be obtained simply by leveling up. It takes a while to unlock all the available factions and generals, but that's a small sacrifice when you consider the presence of a well-functioning ranked match system divided into leagues at launch, a replay menu that allows you to see the matches of players of each group, and a ~draft mode~ with random cards for those who don't want to get lost in building decks but don't disdain the rewards for victories. They are basically all the basics needed to keep an enthusiast hooked on the screen. The graphics are the final aspect to evaluate in this curious free to play. It is pixel art, and we hardly believe that anyone will drop their jaw looking at the sprites of creatures and generals in motion, but it is difficult not to applaud the work done by the artists of the team, who have been able to instill a strong personality in almost every monster and object on screen. The art direction of the backgrounds or the quality of the music is no less remarkable both in battle and in the menus. We have noticed some loading too long or tiny bugs, but they are mostly trifles.", "date": "2016-05-11", "grade": "8.2"}
