In a completely identical way to what has already been seen in Half-Life it will now be possible to choose whether to play the original Vietcong or to load a new expansion. In the current state of things it will only be possible to select Fist Alpha, but it is not difficult to imagine that, thanks to the release of the powerful Game Editor, within a few months we will also be able to play new unofficial expansions developed and released for free via the Internet by the most willing and capable. Technically, the update of the game to version 1.51 does not bring major technical upheavals, however few but significant aesthetic implementations will be noticed right away. As already seen, for example, since the time of Unreal Tournament 2003 or the more recent ~Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic~ particular graphic routines have been implemented for the representation of grass and bushes in general, all without weighing more than too much on the absorbed computing power. The three-dimensional models of the characters have instead remained unchanged, as well as the entire stylistic setting of the levels: in fact, if the number of polygons used is far from being high, great care can be seen in the use of textures and all those effects graphics that cannot fail to reproduce, never like in any other game, a real claustrophobic effect. The usual - and known - underlying engine problems are all still there, including the unpleasant effects of polygon interpenetration. In the less claustrophobic levels, without bushes or long tunnels to go through, it is easy to notice rather annoying slowdowns that highlight the limits of the Pterodon graphics engine, despite the wise use of mists and a reduced visual horizon. The hardware requirements are still the usual, with 1 Ghz and at least one third generation graphics card (Radeon 8500 or GeForce 3) the game runs without too many worries. One aspect of the game on which the developers' work seems to have particularly focused is that of the atmosphere. If already in the Vietcong the sensation of being in a humid and insidious jungle was more than acceptable, now, thanks to a series of new small devices, the impression of walking in a ~living~ world becomes even stronger. We are referring to the even richer and more animated representation of the fauna, complete with colorful insects and birds that take off frightened by our movements, or the placid grazing animals or, again, the simple scripted sequences that make us believe, similarly as seen for example in the two Gothic, or the independence of the various NPCs (Non-Playing Characters) of the game. Unfortunately, above all due to the relative short duration of the expansion, these aspects are most often only hinted at but still give us hope for a possible real sequel. The audio side, on the other hand, does not present any relevant innovations, if not for a bad use of the environmental audio effects of the third level of the game (that of the village in the mountains) and for a series of new arrangements along the lines of the already excellent soundtrack of the original title, which help to keep the quality level of this aspect of the game high. Worth mentioning is the excellent localization, Take 2 also this time does not disappoint and presents us with a translation of the highest level. Noions vulevon savuar ATTENTION, due to a production defect, some copies of Vietcong: Fist Alpha and Vietcong: Purple Haze distributed to date on the national territory do not include the audio dubbing in Italian relating to the content of the expansion. Anyone who has purchased a copy of one of the two products in question, bearing the barcodes 5026555037204 and 5026555037525 respectively, can contact the Take Two Interactive Italia Technical Assistance Service either by e-mail at assistenza@take2.it, or by telephoneon 199150020 (service active from 15.00 to 18.00, from Monday to Friday). Take 2 will replace the product free of charge as soon as it becomes available. The mechanics of war From the point of view of the narrower gameplay Fist Alpha turns out to be rather stingy with novelties both in multiplayer and in single. The new game mode, called Turn Table, consists of a kind of check point CTF where, in turn, one team attacks and one defends: the team that recovers all the flags in the shortest time in its turn to attack wins. Nothing revolutionary, but still a great diversion. Beyond the introduction of new means for air support, a series of new weapons and the possibility of using the bayonet (actually rather useless, at least in single player) the game mechanics appear practically unchanged, including defects. The artificial intelligence of our squadron mates is still rather sketchy, that in the enemies, while settling on more than acceptable levels, sometimes amazes us with flashes of inexplicable stupidity. However, all of this still fails to affect the overall quality of what many - myself included - define as one of the best, if not the absolute best, FPS in recent years. The alternation of different types of mission (from the ~Search & Rescue~, passing to the defense of certain strategic positions, arriving up to the attacks from above with the use of the helicopter) and the extreme realism of the game actions still guarantee moments of extreme tension and great satisfaction. If we add to all this the fact that, in full Illusion Softworks style, all the various missions are held together by an excellent and never banal plot, the caliber of this Data Disk still remains undoubted. We add that, fortunately, the designers no longer provided for those boring infiltration missions in very complicated cubicle systems that instead infested some game sessions of the basic title. Worth noting is the difficulty of the game which once again settles on rather high levels, at least compared to the average of contemporary shooters, and the fact, quite boring, that every now and then you have to load the last save, not through our direct fault but through cause of the premature death of a fellow soldier controlled by the computer. As Billy Wilder said: nobody is perfect. Final comment If you loved Vietcong, Fist Alpha is a must buy. It is true, there are not many new features and 7 new missions may seem few. However, we must not forget the reduced price of the expansion and the new possibility, thanks to the introduction of the AddOn management, to be able to play any new unofficial AddOns developed by the people of the Internet. If, on the other hand, you have never even tried the basic title, I cannot fail to mention the excellent ~Vietcong: Purple Haze~ which, at a very competitive price, includes both Vietcong and its expansion in the same package. Waiting for the imminent graphic wonders of the next generation FPS, playing some new mission for the Vietcong represents, on balance, much more than a mere consolation Pros: Excellent game editor, finally included in the game Atmosphere and adrenaline always unmatched, or almost Competitive price Cons: 7 missions are likely to finish quickly The graphics engine is starting to show its limits Vietnam, 1963 Not even a year after the release of Vietcong, one of the few great revelations of 2003, Illusion Softworks in cooperation with Pterodon Team publish this awaited expansion called, without too much imagination, Vietcong: Fist Alpha. Fist Alpha presents itself to our eyes as the most classic of the prequels, abandoning the role of the man who must never ask, Steve Hawkins, in this datadisk we will get to know the special Alpha team and sergeant Warren Douglas, to enter into war a few months before the events recounted in the first Vietcong, when the Nui Pek base camp did not yet exist. For the price of this expansion we will bring home an unprecedented and versatile game editor, 7 new missions to be tackled in single player mode, 8 unpublished maps designed specifically for multiplayer (plus a new type of game) and a series of new usable weapons to face the new digital guerrillas, powered by a further refined version of the graphics engine developed by this promising team of Czechs (let's avoid banal jokes please).", "date": "2004-02-16", "grade": null}
