{"name": "Constatazioni poco amichevoli", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/101992-burnout-crash-constatazioni-poco-amichevoli.html", "text": "The famous Burnout series of driving games has attracted a large number of fans over time, thanks to the fun and immediate arcade approach but in general also to the spectacular cinematic cut that the races manage to convey, especially on the occasion of the numerous accidents. Then with the last episode, the excellent Paradise, we have reached really high peaks, both in terms of crash physics (clearly remaining in an extremely arcade context) and for the visual rendering of the various crumpling of the plates. Until now, however, collisions had always been considered as obstacles to winning a race; hence Burnout CRASH! tries to overturn the point of view of a normal driver, even rewarding the most damaging and choreographic accidents caused by reckless or, in some situations, even criminal driving. Question of precedence In Burnout CRASH! therefore the one who arrives first no longer wins but on the contrary the one who, following risky manoeuvres, manages to create the biggest possible traffic jam with accidents. Physical damage to the vehicles, contact of any kind (even minimal) is a necessary condition for the vehicle involved to declare itself damaged; the various vehicles approaching at the crossroads, announced by some arrows, always tend to continue in their direction, very rarely avoiding the obstacles present and in any case only in the presence of a large space on the sides. In this way rear-end collisions are much more frequent, because it is enough to place one's own vehicle (or another previously hit) along a pre-set trajectory and the accident thus becomes almost guaranteed. Unlike the home versions, the control system here is entrusted to the ever-reliable touchscreen: in the initial phase, ~run-up~ so to speak, the car supplied follows the finger on the screen, accelerating up to the inevitable collision. Once the chain of disasters has started, it is possible to blow yourself up in the area and then fall back by guiding the trajectory via rapid slides in the desired direction, without however being able to accurately predict the landing point; randomness and chaos are in fact two characteristics of the title, closely connected to the final purpose. The explosion of one's own vehicle also causes a sort of small shock wave, indispensable for triggering and continuing the bursts of accidents; in fact, chaining bumps increases a special multiplier which can each time give extra points but also cataclysms of increasing magnitude. Storms, cyclones, aliens or meteorites thus contribute to increasing the total destructive score which is increased by destroying urban furniture or buildings. Although in principle the actions to be performed are always the same, attributable to a furious tapping of the finger, there are three modes available: Road Block, in which to create traffic jams from which cars cannot escape, Rush Hour, where in 90 seconds you have to cause as much damage as possible and finally Pile-Up, dedicated to fire lovers in which the score multiplier depends on the number of vehicles or buildings set on fire. During each event there are bonus vehicles to destroy, such as very expensive sports cars or even all gold, but also ambulances to save, fuel trucks to use as amplifiers for explosions and the very useful pizza van which, once once down, activate a ~wheel of fortune~-style mini-game to unlock one of several power-ups. Each test is evaluated in stars, up to 6, to be accumulated to unlock both other vehicles and subsequent tests. With 54 events distributed in 6 areas and a total of 18 different intersections, there will certainly be opportunities to create as much chaos as possible; the problem is, if anything, as already mentioned, the way of interacting with Burnout CRASH!. We must acknowledge the developers for having imagined very different intersections, even with multi-carriageway roads, but in essence the player always finds himself furiously hitting the screen, both to blow himself up and launch shock waves and to move the 'car left and right once falling; certain that if the goal was to recreate total chaos, then it can be safely said to have been achieved. The work done in the conversion phase was good: the ~bird's eye~ view remained and the game runs smoothly on all occasions, even during the most spectacular explosions. Unfortunately it was not possible to test the interesting multiplayer mode via Autolog, potentially very fun, due to the lack of available opponents.", "date": "2012-04-19", "grade": "6.5"}
