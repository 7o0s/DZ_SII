The title of Guerrilla Games has in fact established itself among open world adventure games with RPG elements thanks to a well-defined structure within these two genres, a beautiful playability and a truly fascinating post-apocalyptic setting. A planet where nature has taken over cities, as told in The World Without Us, the book that inspired other works such as The Last of Us. But, as we have written in the past, if the future of Naughty Dog foresees a pandemic of harmful mushrooms and mutants driven by an unstoppable homicidal rampage, the one imagined for Horizon by its developers takes on a decidedly different turn. In fact, a thousand years after the development of the civilization of the game world, the machines have evolved taking on the features of the animals that once populated it, forcing men to move away from the cities, retreat into tribes and fight using the technologies at their disposal. One tip before you start... To play Horizon: Zero Dawn The Frozen Wilds it is necessary to have the original game and it is recommended to play it at a character level equal to or higher than 30, although it can be accessed after completing the mission ~A Seeker at the Gates~ or from a later pre-existing save. Hunting on the Squarcio mountains Precisely in this same context, the story of Aloy starts again, who finds herself exploring a portion of the map that was not available in the original title, and which now unfolds instead before the eyes of gamers to lead them into the wild and frozen lands of the North. Dangerous places located between a freezing tundra and snow-covered mountains, dominated by a volcano where a terrible threat to man and machine is hidden. A ~Being~ that the Banuk, a nomadic population who live in that area with great difficulty, calls ~The Demon~. From this incipit then starts a story that intersects with the main plot and which, albeit without too many twists and turns, manages to entertain for ten to twelve hours (depending on the player's skill and whether all the missions are completed secondary, the search for collectibles and so on) revealing more details on the facts regarding the universe created by Guerrilla Games. As far as playability is concerned, the product is obviously similar to the main adventure, with the part dedicated to the fights which leverages heavily on outflanking enemies, on some stealth mechanics and in general on the use of all the arsenal available to Aloy. In this sense, players are given the opportunity to try new approaches to the clashes, often complex due to the aggressiveness and the ability to vary their moves of the new creatures (just a pity that their artificial intelligence is not always equally valid), thanks to a set of unpublished weapons and upgrades related to the Banuk people, and to the possibility of being able to use two extra short- and medium-range weapons. Important elements to get to the bottom of the fights with the new demonic machines that infest the area, such as the terrible Control Towers or the ~fiery~ Mastiff: many of these ~love~, among other things, to come out when one least wants to waits, taking advantage of even the most difficult weather conditions, such as blizzards, to hide from view and then attack Aloy by surprise. Perennial frost In the same way, the role-playing structure remains important, which, although not as deep and ~dense~ as that offered by the sacred monsters of Western RPGs, remains well-finished as well as important in the game economy, and is not lacking in quantitative terms either in this DLCs. As promised by the developers, there are more possibilities for interaction with the non-player characters, with a whole cast of rather interesting new characters, and a series of side missions that are beautiful in terms of variety, difficulty and above all that allow you to better understand the plot or the links with the new community, the aforementioned Banuk, that Aloy is dealing with. The settlements are the forerunner to the RPG structure of the title, because the protagonist can talk to the inhabitants and ask questions, buy weapons, objects and clothes capable of giving him particular bonuses, start primary and secondary missions and so on. Where this DLC changes some game dynamics is in the exploratory phases, more focused on platform elements such as jumps or rapid climbing in movement. These moments are well implemented in the context of the adventure, but in our opinion not fully refined in terms of response to commands by the character, who is not always able to perform certain combinations very wellni of jumps and hooks. Then there is the introduction of a new set of skills called ~Traveller~, which adds some new functions useful for making better use of the enemies that Aloy takes control of, or for increasing certain parameters such as the space available in the inventory. For the rest obviously the control system of Horizon: Zero Dawn The Frozen Wilds is that of the original title, very articulated but at the same time easy to assimilate after a few game sessions. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, The Frozen Wilds does not differ much from Horizon: Zero Dawn, apart from some new features related to the Photo Mode system and certain particle effects inherent in the frozen setting and therefore the snow. In general, the product supports a solid artistic system with an excellent graphic sector, above all the lighting system and the complexity of the scene, for a visual impact that places this expansion, as did the original game, on the upper floors of the productions for PlayStation 4. Guerrilla Games' DLC is truly a feast for the eyes, thanks to an important depth of field rich in detail, a clean image, vivid colors and great contrast, which know how to best enhance the frozen scenario in which the adventure unfolds. And then there are those improvements made to the entire game world, from the most beautiful facial animations during dialogues, among other things less static than usual, to particle effects or effects linked to weather conditions, so as to give more vitality to the environment in which Aloy moves. Finally, the sound sector is beautiful, which proves to live up to expectations and in line with the rest of the production.", "date": "2017-11-07", "grade": "8.2"}
