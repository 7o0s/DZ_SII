In our homes the situation has been a little calmer, with several multiplatform or ~low~ budget titles that ideally serve as a link between those great productions that, like it or not, are expected by most players, beyond the their actual qualities. PlayStation 4 will take care of opening the dances of the important exclusives, which in the first part of the year seems more ready from this point of view and which sees The Order: 1886 in the pipeline on February 20, subject to day one breaks sadly more frequent. Just peek into the main page of Multiplayer.it these days, but also on many other sites, to see a real media massacre, made up of dozens of more or less interesting, more or less truthful news, which if you look in a The positive point of view denotes a rather high attention around the Ready at Dawn title. On the other hand we are talking about the first new intellectual property of this developer, who after gaining experience on PSP immediately attracted attention for a technical sector that seemed out of this world, as well as for the fascinating setting, to say the least. The analysis that needs to be done around The Order: 1886 is decidedly more complex than its linear structure and duration suggest, because in addition to the specific judgment it is clear that this production is part of a larger project, destined to materialize in subsequent chapters and to treasure, especially from a gameplay point of view, the feedback that players will publish in the coming weeks. Shoot or not shoot? As soon as we popped the Blu-Ray and installed the game, we downloaded a small 66MB patch which should be the only update available at launch - good news given the dangerous trends of recent months. The minimalist menu offers a handful of options related to audio and video; the difficulty is instead calibrated on three levels interchangeable at any time, which do not affect the conditions for obtaining the trophies. London at the end of the 1800s is the backdrop to the events of the game; a little Victorian, a little steampunk, a little disastrous, reinvented from a technological point of view thanks to the presence of double-chamber airships and advanced weapons, which may have never seen the light of day but which are always based on really existing projects . This is because the world created by Andrea Pessino and Ready at Dawn is the result of a great work of historical and photographic research, which has made it possible to create a credible and fascinating setting, certainly one of the most inspired that we have seen in recent times . In this context we have a series of factions that play a leading role in the economy of the game: first of all the Knights of the Order of the Queen, an Order created to maintain order (the pun is too greedy, we apologize) over time blinds, inside which there is Sir Galahad, the protagonist who controls himself throughout the adventure of the game and around whom most of the narrative attention is focused. In the background, but not so much, the canonical police, the rebels, the half-blood Lycans, each of whom will cross the path of Galahad and his companions at least once. The narrative is divided into chapters, including a prologue kept well hidden by the developers: despite all the news leaked on the net they have been quite good at hiding most of the aspects of the story, and this translates into a constant learning of new information, which little by little they piece together the puzzles of a larger picture and demonstrate the talent they have had in creating a ~full-bodied~ and fascinating historical backdrop. We stop here to avoid spoilers and catapult us towards the first chapter of The Order: 1886, which at first glance is a third-person shooter but in reality it recalls the great classics of the ~solo~ genre in the pure combat phase, since it leaves ample space for narration, dialogues and moments of progress without shouldering the artillery. There is the Council Chamber in which many discussions take place, there are twists and turns that introduce new characters; there is, as mentioned, the construction of a much larger story than the events narrated up to this point: we take up arms when the word fails to hurt more than the sword and we need to resolve the situation with lead. Some chapters are therefore dedicated solely to the advancement of the story and to exploration, for a guided structure that in practice does not provide for backtracking or the possibility of going back if you have lost anyauk collectible on the street, represented by audio cylinders, documents, photos to inspect. In this sense, the settings are all rather linear, but there are small detours to reach the extras, and some larger-scale battles or stealth phases, despite continuing constantly between one fight and another. The Order: 1886 comes forcefully to PlayStation 4, with a new universe to discover Downgrade my balls The rhythm is not lacking, therefore, and the technological side is a small masterpiece that manages to completely involve the player on a visual level, for a result that probably, to date, represents the peak of videogame productions in the mix of all the factors that compose it. The transitions from the non-interactive and quick time sequences to those where Sir Galahad is fully controlled are practically imperceptible - net of an even more sensational realization of the faces, in the first case - and sometimes it is really hard to understand if you are playing all or not. The proprietary graphics engine of Ready at Dawn is simply incredible, and the well-chosen artistic side has allowed for an exceptional stylistic realization of the environments, always beautiful to look at and seasoned with phenomenal attention to detail. Just look at the faces of the characters, the meticulous details and the aesthetic quality of their armor, the continuous night and day views of London, with an infinite visual distance, structures of all kinds and textures always of excellent workmanship, which stand out when the perspective and the lighting system manage to perfectly render the differences between bricks, ceramics or fabrics. But also details such as the hair that moves in the wind, the reflections on the windows, which show their contents and what is on the opposite side of a street; always and only dynamic lights, which ~affect~ any object on the screen and even in the distance, the deformation of metals, fabrics and objects that react to bullets, up to the ultra-detailed creation of gadgets and weapons, including the their functioning. It would therefore be a crime to rush through the various connecting settings between the fights without dwelling on everything else, as the narrative and technological aspects are the cornerstones of the Ready at Dawn production, and are already excellent in this first chapter . Everything is sealed by an artistic sector that offers a soft, ~adult~ and pleasant trait, certainly full of charisma. About the black bars and the visual filter used: we can't speak for everyone but we completely forgot about it after a few minutes and the filter is perfect; surely this is more noticeable on small monitors and no one would object, indeed, if they played in full screen. There is one aspect that remains out of this technological riot: interaction and physics with the environment, beautiful with props but quite standard in everything else. The musical sector enjoys the same excellent care as the graphic one; the sound of the shots of each weapon is extremely accurate and peculiar, the effects in general follow the same lines and the soundtrack manages to underline the most important moments well, proposing some very inspired songs. , The game is completely dubbed in Italian, with Sir Galahad entrusted to Silvio Pandolfi, an eclectic artist of films, TV series and animated series that we heard for example in Borderlands, where he dubbed Marcus. His timbre of voice is excellent but he didn't always seem appropriate to the situation. On the other hand, we found an excellent Claudio Moneta in the interpretation of Alastair, a knight of the Order who is often encountered during the game. To select the English dub, perhaps of higher medium quality, you have to change the console language. Playstation 4 trophies The Order: 1886 can be counted among the ~easy~ titles to platinum. We finished the game by getting 68% of the trophies, and in general it is enough to make a certain number of kills, perhaps in a specific way, or collect all the collectibles present. Nothing difficult, on the contrary, only that as regards the latter it is not written in which chapters the ones not yet inspected/collected are found, and therefore one is forced to replay the title at least one more time moving in a meticulous way between the small deviations available. Ghempley We have arrived at the examination of the gameplay and the shootings, which are present in good numbers but at the service of everything else rather than the other way around: when the story requires it, you explore or perform in short platform phases together with the different characters with which Sir Galahad interacts - especially the Marquis de La Fayette, SirPercival and Isabeau D'Argyll - or there are phases in which you have to eliminate opponents silently, pressing the triangle button at the right moment to give the sense of perfect synchronization between Sir Galahad's movement and the actual action to slaughter the enemy . In other situations a crossbow is used from a distance, and in general the game is always quite raw, not skimping on blood or heinous killings. The firefights have a typical third-person shooter setting: there are covers, which are hooked with the circle button and from which you can exit with the same pressure or simply by moving away; the classic combination of the triggers for aiming and shooting, melee always with the triangle and so on. The variety of weapons is excellent as is the pleasure of using them thanks to the different types of ammunition and recoils. There are single and multi-shot pistols, automatic rifles - including one with the secondary power (by pressing R1) of generating a shockwave - but also sniper rifles, carbines and various exotic weapons such as thermite shooter and then a rocket to set it on fire, or the pulse rifle capable of emitting an incinerator beam. All thanks to Nikola Tesla, who needs no introduction (... right?) And who plays an important role in the story, making his laboratory available also for some gadgets that are used through short but elaborate mini-games. This great work on weapons and physicality unfortunately collides, it must be said, with fights that lack dynamism because they are rather flat and ~dry~, funny enough but never able to involve for their grandeur and above all for the opponents somewhat anonymous. The degree of challenge is above all at the highest difficulty level, but the artificial intelligence is, shall we say, old school, with enemy types that move, take cover, throw grenades, as well as so-called riflemen who they verbally announce their arrival and present themselves with the sawed-off shotgun. This scholastic subdivision slows down the dynamism, therefore, and unfortunately the clashes with the key characters follow the same trend, alternating quick time sequences (certainly spectacular) with recycled mechanics between them in the case of werewolves. The weapons themselves often don't have equal time and dignity of use, and it's a shame because they are very fun to use. All these ~clues~ made us suspect that maybe the developers didn't have the time to implement all the ideas they had in mind - even in the light of a satisfying, but clearly open ending, and the lack of some connecting sequences - postponing speech to future chapters. We completed The Order: 1886 in 7 hours and 50 minutes timed by hand, at a normal level and with 68% of the trophies obtained, collecting a good part of the extras and occasionally pausing on the setting. In our view it is the best way to enjoy the game; certainly playing faster the counter decreases quietly, but it doesn't even make much sense to do so. At the higher difficulty level, the enemies become more difficult and the energy, which recharges without being hit for a certain amount of time, is less: in this way you can ~earn~ a couple of hours on the total longevity.", "date": "2015-02-19", "grade": "7.8"}
