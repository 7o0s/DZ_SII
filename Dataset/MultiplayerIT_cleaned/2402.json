{"name": "Red Faction", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-faction-azione-in-miniera.html", "text": "~The Miners Revolt~ The story is that of a man (Parker) who works in a mine under the surface of Mars. More than miners, these workers are slaves, oppressed even by ~easy gun~ guards. In addition to all this, a kind of plague is added which is decimating them (only later will it be discovered that it is not a plague, but ...). These conditions push the miners to form a rebel group called the Red Faction. The enemy is Ultor Corporation. Naturally, as in any well-constructed screenplay, this plot will also develop and present us with twists and turns that will lead us to the discovery of... oops, I'll stop in time. Someone says that the plot is very similar to that of Total Recall with Schwarzenegger (but since I've never seen that film, I can't have my say, sorry!) Directly on your monitor: 3D graphics! You certainly can not speak ill of the graphics engine. The textures are well made and never too repetitive, the 3d models are often good (apart from some pitiful cases, see an example screenshot), the maps are very varied (we go from very narrow tunnels) to very vast open spaces, from interiors of high-tech buildings to very varied military constructions. The resolutions I tried are the usual ones (640, 800, 1024 and 1280) and even at the maximum resolution the frame rate doesn't drop too much (tested with celeron2 900 + gforce2). If you like to play with a high framerate or your computer is not of the latest generation, I would recommend the 800*600 resolution, which shows an excellent compromise between graphic quality and rendering speed. A small flaw is the lighting system: almost all the lamps and lights can be destroyed and with them the luminous halo will disappear, but the flaw is that the ambient light will always remain the same (which makes us turn up our noses when we are in a cave hundreds of meters underground). The missiles will bring their beautiful halo of light with them and in general the weapons will illuminate the walls with their own light. Worth noting are two really successful special effects: the breaking of the glass is made in a decidedly convincing way (there should be some screenshots to prove it) and the fire from the flamethrower (screenshot rulez). GeoMod The most exciting and innovative aspect of the game is undoubtedly the GeoMod. For those who don't know what it is I will simply say that some weapons (missiles, rockets and bombs) can modify the geometry of the map. Not all surfaces are ~punchable~, but only some previously defined by the mapper. In some cases, with a nice missile that opens a wall in two, you can discover secret rooms, in other cases in front of a door for which you do not have the key, the best solution will be to make your way by destroying the wall around the door as you prefer. Other times to kill the boss of the moment or war machines, the solution could be to make them lose the ground under their feet (wonderful when an armored vehicle is sucked into a chasm created by one of my randomly fired missiles). Geomod is such a smart, fun to use, and realistic technology that I wonder why no one has ever thought of it before (and I hope that future actions will make extensive use of it). If in singleplayer the GeoMod shows its limits (basically whoever built the map must have decided on the destructible surfaces and planned the player's moves), in multiplayer this feature enhances and makes the unfolding of the game completely unpredictable (the map is beautiful two-story deathmatch where ALL walls are destructible). Turn on the speakers: this game has sounds too (and a nice soundtrack) Absolutely worth mentioning is the soundtrack created for the game, which will accompany you from level to level, changing settings according to the scene. Attention to detail is a winning aspect in Red Faction. For example, after breaking glass with a shotgun or pistol, the fragments will obviously fall to the ground (gravity's fault, even on Mars). When you walk over the fragments, you will hear them creak. Even this in its small way, reinforces my positive judgment on the game. The same caution was used when using the flamethrower on someone (brrr) or while climbing the creaky metal ladders. Learning curve and playability The game from the very first moments is very simple and very enjoyable. You will encounter the weapons one by one and this will allow you to learn their uses (almost all weapons have a dual mode of fire). From the first ~cave~ you will not be faced with long corridors without freedom of choice: the maps are built in such a way as to almost always offer you more ways toto achieve the goal. It should be noted that the complexity of the locations has been well calibrated and you will rarely find yourself without knowing where to go or lost without finding your way out. If something is difficult to define (above all because it remains a personal and objective consideration) that is the ~playability~. How fun, exciting, never repetitive and frustrating a game is, I think this can be defined as ~playability~. From this point of view, Red Faction is a product that knows how to offer all of this. The only advice I can give is to download the various demos released and experience the feeling of the game (both singleplayer and multiplayer) firsthand. The multiplayer Regarding the multiplayer, I can only refer you to a preview I made a short time ago (here), making small notes: the maps that were embryonic before have now been completed and reach a good graphic level. Deathmatch gameplay is decidedly frantic and fast paced, while CTF requires more team play and more thinking. ~How many hours will Red Faction last me?~ Many: together with the multiplayer mode, the game presents us with a good dose of singleplayer levels, which will make you spend a large number of hours of play (I can't estimate the number of hours because it will depend very directly on the chosen difficulty). The replayability is quite good, precisely due to the fact that the maps are not linear, but you can almost always decide which path to take or how to deal with the unexpected (also thanks to the GEO MOD). An editor toolkit for the game has just been released (and if all goes as planned, we might have some MODs and new levels as well). Closing speech Ok, I was didactic, but you may be wondering, ~Is this game worth my money?~. Easy easy question, but always difficult answer to give. I don't feel like giving a definite yes or a no. The game is fun, always very smooth and with good cards on its side (first of all the innovative GeoMod). The multiplayer game is certainly fun even if less than sacred games such as CounterStrike, Quake3 and Unreal Tournament (just to mention the most played action on the net). If we then consider that Max Payne has just been released and that the most attentive gamers are already anxiously awaiting ~Return to Castle Wolfenstein~ (at Christmas) and ~Medal of Honor~ (within a few months), life gets difficult for Red faction. A Few Stories (optional reading) The Internet is a really strange resource: faced with the amount of information we are often displaced and appalled. Not least the gentle surf without haste is increasingly distant from the habits of the Internet user. How many times have you found yourself with dozens of explorer pages open, without even remembering the reason for all those open pages? Or how many times have you searched in vain for the information you were looking for and you gave up in front of pages of BLA BLA BLA? Not infrequently I close a window because the information I'm looking for is too hidden, or I limit myself to leafing through the page visually without wasting time on the details. Maybe I'm in too much of a hurry or maybe it's the prerogative of the media used that makes us jump from one page to another at the speed of light without letting us enjoy the details (which instead happens when reading a book or the newspaper). That's it: I take the initiative to break this review into many small pieces, hopefully exhaustive, in which I will analyze the various components of the game without too many frills. I hope to please those who are in a hurry, but also all those who like to have information at their fingertips. Let's start..", "date": "2001-09-22", "grade": null}
