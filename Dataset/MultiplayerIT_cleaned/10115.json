We could exceptionally forgive you if the mere thought of playing a puzzle game immediately gave you hives and uncontrollable nausea, but in that case you probably made a mistake even clicking on this review. For everyone else, Picross remains an essential step in the journey of discovery of the best titles available on Nintendo's two-screen portable, an engaging and challenging puzzle game like few others. Instead of proposing an obvious sequel with new puzzles and little else, the Kyoto house has rather chosen to take the path of renewal, making its product make the leap from two to three dimensions. After about a year of waiting since its Japanese launch, Picross 3D is now finally available in our area too. The art of the cube Entrusted this time to the expert hands of the historic HAL Labs, Picross 3D takes up exactly the concept of its predecessor, transporting it in 3D but maintaining its main characteristics. Imagine having a more or less generously sized parallelepiped made up of rows of cubes; on some of these cubes, on the various faces of the parallelepiped, numbers are affixed, which represent the fundamental clue on which the gameplay of the game revolves. In fact, the figure establishes how many of the cubes in that row must remain intact, with the others who, on the contrary, will be eliminated with a simple touch of the stylus. And so truly like a new digital sculptor, the player must get rid of the excess parts, the useless matter, until a (stylized) figure with a complete sense is born from a shapeless mass. These are the basis of Picross 3D, but they are not the only elements of the mechanics of the Nintendo title; the very long and perhaps a little too wordy tutorial, however fortunately ~playable~ for the most part, adds the various aspects to be taken into account in a gentle and progressive way. For example, if the figure displayed is a simple number, this indicates precisely that that number of squares must be placed next to each other; on the contrary, if the number is enclosed in a circle, it means that that number of squares will instead be separated from each other by at least one space. Therefore, although Picross 3D remains a simple game to understand - and in this sense for the poor reviewer, much easier to play than to explain - it is undeniable that everything is less immediate and instantly clear than its two-dimensional predecessor. Since the parallelepiped is 3d, it must obviously be rotated with the stylus; but that's not all, since two additional cursors allow you to ~enter~ inside it, varying the level to also interact with non-surface cubes. A greater cumbersomeness which is however counterbalanced by the maximum dimensions of the parallelepipeds, unable to exceed 10 cubes on each side; a big difference compared to the giants of the more advanced 2d levels of Picross DS, which in fact paves the way once you get the ease of movement in the game mechanics. It is therefore rare to find, among the approximately 350 puzzles present, a level truly capable of making the proverbial seven shirts sweat; all this despite the timer that marks the time limit available to obtain the best scores (represented in stars). On the other hand, on the options front, it is pleasing to note the presence of the editor for one's picrosses, perfectly integrated with the wi-fi connection with which to send one's creations or download those of the community and thus further increase overall longevity. On the other hand, little to report on the technical front, obviously an accessory in such a product; in reality, a greater aesthetic personality and a better quality of the audio tracks would have helped, but these are aspects to which one can turn a blind eye without too many problems.", "date": "2010-03-26", "grade": "8.3"}
