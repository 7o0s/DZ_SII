After the first disappointing Dante's Inferno DLC entitled Selva Oscura, whose complete review is available at this address, Visceral Games returns to the public with a second add-on called The Torments of Saint Lucia. This extra content adds an unpublished option directly to the main menu of the base game and also features the patron saint of Syracuse, or rather, her (very) revised, corrected and reinterpreted representation. The DLC features online co-op play for two players and a level editor to create and share your own battles with other gamers and is available for download at the unfriendly price of Euro 9.99 on Playstation Network or 800 MP on Xbox Live, in addition to being contained in a special edition of Dante's Inferno, the so-called Santa Lucia Edition which will be available from May 14th in all stores, including ours, and which will include the base game, a new package complete with exclusive artwork as well to the appropriate codes to download the two expansions mentioned above. The way to sanctification With a practically absent plot and a beat 'em up arcade setting, The Torments of Saint Lucia is on balance a frenetic hack & slash in which battles take place in limited spaces and where the primary objective is to resist and defeat the hordes of enemies who defend themselves with a certain insistence in front of the protagonists. In short, we could almost define it as a collection of small challenges which, from many points of view, offer little to those looking for a stimulating, more articulated and well-structured experience. From a list of quests prepared by Electronic Arts (about forty) or by the players themselves, the user selects which one to play and in a moment finds himself in an arena massacring, horde after horde, dozens of opponents. Each ~trial~ consists of a series of consecutive challenges located in arenas that are structurally quite similar to each other. The rules that determine each series of clashes and therefore the player's actions take care of making the gaming experience a little varied. In the various arenas it is possible to come across timed battles or battles with specific objectives to be hit in order to be completed, such as for example that of killing a Boss or using only particular types of attacks to defeat opponents, free battles in which you just need to hit everything that moves on the screen or others in which the vital energy of the protagonists gradually decreases without the possibility of restoring it so as to force the gamer to speed up the times, etc. However, it must be said that despite this, unfortunately in the long run all the challenges end up looking alike and therefore gradually boring the users. In this sense, the possibility of playing as a couple with a friend by taking control of the sensual winged female co-protagonist, Saint Lucia, to fight on the game servers in one of the many online cooperative challenges, or to share one's creations made via editor with other gamers around the globe they add something more, but not enough. Playstation 3 trophies There are ten trophies available in Dante's Inferno: The Torments of Saint Lucia: three in silver and seven in bronze. As usual, these prizes will be won in various ways such as earning 50 gold medals and 25 platinum medals in online trials or by completing 25 EA challenges in single player and 15 in co-op, just to name a couple of examples. Saint Lucia? The character of Saint Lucia is very similar to an angel and as such can fly, move quickly and be devastating in aerial and ranged attacks. An excellent sidekick for Dante. Too bad, however, that it is not possible to make combos or moves in common, and that even when one of the two characters dies, the level must be started again even if the other member of the team is in perfect health. Which makes two-player mode frustrating at times. The editor, on the other hand, allows the player to make several free choices, in order to be able to better customize the natural ~ring~ where the clashes he wants to create will take place. The latter will therefore be able to establish his own rules applied to the context, such as for example determining the number of stages that will make up his own trial, the level of general difficulty, the number of human players as well as objects present in the area, how many and which traps will be scattered on the terrain, quantity, type and combat capability of the enemies, among which there are some new entries. The whole,as we mentioned in the introduction of the article, it can then be shared online with other gamers around the world. As for the aesthetic aspect of Dante's Inferno: The Torments of Saint Lucia, there is little that is relevant to report compared to what is already known about the original game: the graphic engine of this DLC is clearly the same as Dante's Inferno with all the pros and cons of the case. The frame rate remains at a good level even in the most chaotic situations, the enemies appear effectively detailed and made with excellent characterization. Although the scenarios are not stylistically perfect, they are still fascinating, as mentioned in other articles, not so much for the aesthetics themselves, but rather for the settings and views in general. The character of Lucia is very beautiful, sexy and lethal at the right point. Finally, as regards the aspect relating to the sound, nothing new: the audio does its ~duty~ in full with surrounding noises and music that make up the overall well-made soundtrack.", "date": "2010-05-13", "grade": "7.0"}
