It is one of those video games that it is difficult to find someone who speaks badly about, which seems to be linked only to good memories, but which has been a huge failure in the test of the market, moreover on several occasions: it was at the time of the first edition, to the point that the development team at the time, Appeal, was forced to close its doors; it was when the Kickstarter campaign for the sequel was launched, unfortunately it went very badly, despite the noise and the apparent general interest, and who knows if it will still be, now that version 1.1 has been launched. What is this out-of-date update for? Outcast was first released in 1999 and was the classic outsized experimental title, eager to innovate in every direction, but taking elements from the then most popular competitors with both hands. Today, talking about an open world in which to interact with hundreds of non-player characters doesn't make much impact, given that we are broadly describing the standard genre of the most commercial titles on the market, but in 1999 it was a big novelty, unedited for action games. Yes, because in role-playing games there had already been more or less defined open worlds that guaranteed very relative freedoms, but for action games this approach was very rare and often used in a partial way. Outcast wasn't the first of its kind, but it helped define it and allowed us to see the potential behind giving the player greater freedom in complex open worlds, even without the pressure exerted by statistics. The impact, at least on critics, was considerable and there are many players of the time willing to sing their love for an experience in more than one unforgettable sense. All that remains is to understand whether fifteen years later it is worthwhile or not to return to the role of Ulukai. Times and inspirations In the new version you can raise the resolution Now the Xbox 360 joypad is natively supported Outcast's protagonist, former Navy SEAL Cutter Slade, finds himself reluctantly grappling with a world to save. His main task was to act as an escort for scientists in an alien world, but something went wrong and we find him already at the beginning of the game appealed to by the indigenous population as Ulukai, the chosen one who will save them from the evil that oppresses them. After a short initial phase, which serves more as a tutorial, Slade can start exploring the vast world, divided into six areas with different graphic styles. The player is given the freedom to do somewhat as he pleases, helping the locals or acting like a fetid imperialist. Playing it today after all the years gone by and the videogame worlds visited, Outcast's debts to some of the most talked about titles of the time appear evident, starting with Core Design's Tomb Raider, which dictated the law in terms of exploration, passing through Thief: The Dark Project by Looking Glass, to whose success we probably owe the inclusion of stealth mechanics (poorly done and, in the long run, quite useless), without forgetting first person shooters such as Quake 2, Half-Life and Unreal, which offer model for the artificial intelligence of enemies, much more reactive than those we usually face in modern games. Of his Outcast had the amalgam, that is the way in which he took each element and inserted it into a different framework from that of the sources cited. Above all, the title of Appeal, today Fresh3D, had a much more alive world than those of the competition. Good Slade could chat with practically every inhabitant, obtaining more or less useful information, help and missions depending on his behavior. Pointing a weapon at someone had effects. Shooting them produced durable ones. If desired, there were also some RPG-like mechanics, not related to the character, which remained identical in characteristics from the beginning to the end of the adventure, but related to weapons and gadgets, which could be upgraded and gave Slade new possibilities of exploration or made his life easier. In short, it was a very complex title with many different facets. Let's find out whether or not Outcast version 1.1 is worth playing Version 1.1 The six upgradeable weapons are all here Version 1.1 of Outcast, nothing more than a big update patch, was born from the failure of the aforementioned Kickstarter campaign for the realization of the high definition reboot. Without too many mysteries, the developers consider it an alternative way to try to raise money for that project. The novelties in terms of gameplay are practically zero, if not the addition of supportor native to the Xbox joypad, while various technical aspects have been revised to make the graphics engine more digestible by modern systems. Meanwhile, it is now possible to raise the resolution of the game to higher resolutions. Doing it cold would have run the risk of noticing the defects of some elements, designed for the old resolution. The solution was to redesign the game interface and replace the background images with new versions, also in high definition. For the rest, the game remains identical to the original, with the same graphics engine based on a voxel system, aged poorly in truth, but which still guarantees the title a peculiar visual style, and the same dynamics, with a few less bugs among those historical, but also with some unpublished bugs due to the new features.", "date": "2015-01-16", "grade": "8.5"}
