{"name": "Modellismo da smartphone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/143175-monzo-monzo.html", "text": "Madfinger Games is a software house originally from the Czech Republic which in the past has churned out two titles that have enjoyed great success among gamers from all over the world, namely Dead Trigger and Shadowgun; two examples of excellent products aimed at an audience that loves violent and exaggerated FPS, equipped with first-rate graphics and generally flawless from a purely technical point of view. With a sensational turnaround, the developers have decided to release a new application that has nothing to do with the two aforementioned games, appealing instead to a totally different audience, that of lovers of scale models. In short, a more Zen approach than in the past, which in any case reveals some characteristics in common with the previous works. MONZO is the ideal application for those who never want to be separated from their models It's not a game The title in question is a non-video game that gives the possibility to assemble the model of one's dreams piece by piece, including the final paint job and the placement of the decals. When you first start you are catapulted directly into the tutorial which explains the basic gestures to be able to interact satisfactorily with the first major construction work; everything is preceded by a wonderful animation in which a box opens to reveal the disassembled kit inside. The interface is simple and clean: at the top right there is a sort of assembly instruction manual, on the left a slider with all the fragments available while in the center of the screen the stupendous 3D model dominates plan takes shape thanks to our skilled hand as an expert craftsman. To fit each piece, simply drag it from the box on the left and position it more or less in the indicated point, you don't need patience or precision in the movements, since the computer will take care of indicating which part to use and how to fix it. Once the assembly phase is over, which can usually last up to 15 minutes for the more complex kits, you have the possibility to customize your creation by choosing the color and the decals to apply in every possible and imaginable way; the customization options are truly endless and in this respect Madfinger Games have done a truly excellent job, giving the player the opportunity to express their creativity. Initially the number of shades and stickers is limited, but you can safely buy or download packs containing new elements for free to have fun with. Once the actual construction phase is completed, there is only one thing left to do: take a snapshot of your creation, apply Instagram-like filters - seven in total, from the classic sepia effect to the all too abused retro effect - and show the whole world your skills as a designer. All this is possible thanks to the photo mode, in which you have the option to choose a background - there are several, you can also take an image with the camera and use it as a landscape - on which to place your masterpiece and immortalize it in all its glory, be it a firearm or a street car, with the added bonus of being able to interact with the finished kit, opening doors and bonnet or spinning the tires. Once this has been completed, all that remains is to share our little gem with the people of the internet through the ubiquitous social networks, without even leaving the application. Show me your destroyer Technically the title is truly amazing, with absolutely realistic graphics thanks to the use of effects such as shadows and reflections reproduced in an incredibly realistic way for a mobile game; the 3D models are flawless and have a huge number of details allowing you to distinguish plastic from metal or glass. One is truly surprised by the incredible care placed in the realization of every detail that forms the final specimen and it is a joy for the eyes to be able to admire every groove, every little detail of a masterfully reproduced Colt 1911 or of an ancient machine designed by Leonardo Da Vinci take shape before our eyes; on the other hand the Madfinger Games are known for the spectacular care placed in the graphics department and MONZO, in this sense, is not an exception, rather a further step forward. The real strength of the title is the store, the gateway to a world full of assembly kits ranging from Leonardo's cars, weapons, planes and inventions; At the time of writing this review, 32 other models are available that can be purchased via in-app purchase, all of the highest quality. As evidence of thishe last statement, just think that Revell, a well-known company in the sector, has inserted some of its products in digital format chosen from among those actually in the catalog in specialized shops. Prices vary according to the number of parts that make up the kit and range from a minimum of 85 cents to a maximum of 7.80, all in all a price that does not represent an insurmountable obstacle for a lover of the sector. Unfortunately, such a title can hardly have appeal outside its target audience, which will certainly appreciate every aspect of this particular application, and therefore it is difficult to formulate an evaluation that gives justice to a title that is technically impeccable and well done, but which at the same time risks boring those who are not part of this narrow market niche. Personally we believe it is worth trying at least the kits that the developers offer for free to evaluate subsequent purchases; in any case it must be said that there is an abyss between the creation of a physical scale model of the Spitfire and the digital version, however for the true modeling fanatic the possibility of being able to create something from your smartphone in those 5 minutes of break can be an excellent reason to consider whether or not to invest a few euros in this application.", "date": "2015-01-09", "grade": "7.5"}
