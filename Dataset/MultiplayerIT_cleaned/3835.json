And what could possibly happen once you reach a high altitude amid verdant pines, chair lifts and slopes to be covered at full speed on your trusty skis? In fact, more than one might imagine, especially in the event that the plant designers have completely disregarded the most elementary rules of physics. On the other hand, already from the title of the work it is understood that sooner or later something will inevitably end up going wrong and someone will get hurt, very badly. From these simple premises comes the first title created by the independent team Hugecalf Studios. After three years of work, the project has finally come out of the Early Access phase and has landed in its complete and definitive form both on Nintendo Switch and on PC. Well, after having had the opportunity to try this latest version of the game, we are ready to tell you about it in the review. A bridge builder with a rich campaign When Ski Lifts Go Wrong aims to reinterpret the so-called bridge builder genre, entrusting the player with the construction of structures that are safe and as reliable as possible for skiers, snowboarders and more. Through the more than fifty levels that make up the campaign we are required to successfully lead a series of individuals from an entry point to an exit point, doing our best not to send them to the creator. Before doing so, it is therefore necessary to have the foresight to erect all the indispensable structures to carry out this thankless task in the best possible way. Not only ski lifts, as one would be led to think, but also chair lifts, cable cars, bridges and connecting ramps that fulfill the purpose for which they were built. The first block of levels serves as a tutorial to learn all the main game features and variants, then you start to get serious: the difficulty curve is well balanced and the levels flow pretty well, requiring the player a pinch of inventiveness and ingenuity to be able to correctly exploit the resources made available in each assignment. Developing a project and bringing it to life on screen is the first step, but then inevitably you have to go to the road test to make sure you've done a good job. This is where things get interesting, given that on more than one occasion one realizes that one's creation is not structurally adequate to withstand the road test. It only takes a moment to see them collapse disastrously to the ground, dragging behind them even the unfortunate human guinea pigs who are walking along them unaware of any danger. Each challenge comes with a set of rewards, though not all achievements are required to unlock subsequent stages. In addition to the need to successfully lead the patrons to the exit, it is sometimes required to complete the construction without breaking the budget, or even to collect some medals along the way. If in these cases one can do nothing but be spectators, by tackling the construction of the ramps it is possible to actively take control of the individual characters, naturally only after having appropriately built those structures capable of allowing the crossing without harmful consequences. Moreover, continuing in the game, it also happens to put aside skis, boards and boots for a moment and to get on board snowcats or even mountain bikes inside impervious mountain paths. Overall, the user interface has proved to be quite simple and intuitive: in the lower part of the screen there is a bar that contains all the objects that can be selected for your constructions. It ranges between wooden poles and beams, concrete blocks to position the foundations, tie rods useful for improving lift, gears, but also platforms and launch ramps to be combined to complete every single task with brilliance. Editors and Workshops In addition to the main mode, When Ski Lifts Go Wrong also includes an interesting Editor for creating your own levels. A good way to further vary the offer in the eyes of the player and why not, allow the level of challenge to be further raised compared to the default challenges set by the developers. In this case the only stumbling block is dictated by the absence of indications which somehow direct the player's activity in order to make him understand the rudiments of the instrument in front of him. You therefore need a little initiative to actively engage in the creation of content,but those who love this kind of approach will certainly find bread for their teeth. For all the others, however, it is possible to directly access the Workshop section, where all the levels created by the rest of the community can be downloaded. To take advantage of the new challenges, all you have to do is register for the individual events and download them to your game system. If necessary, there is also a way to share replays of your actions by accessing the appropriate online gallery. The management of physics is not prohibitive but it still remains quite faithful to reality, therefore it is essential to build the structures taking into account the lift and the type of materials that are being used. It is worth noting the absence of localization in Italian, but this is by no means an insurmountable obstacle for the correct use of the title, given that the tutorial instructions are easily understandable even for those in possession of a basic knowledge of English.", "date": "2019-02-05", "grade": "7.5"}
