{"name": "Demeo: la recensione del dungeon crawler da tavolo in realt virtuale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/demeo-recensione.html", "text": "Demeo is above all a successful nostalgia operation. Her recipe is simple: take the Dungeons and Dragons classes, create dungeons with a grid in which to have them fight monsters and set everything in the basement of an American house in the late 80s. This title really hit us with its atmosphere because putting on the headset and taking the miniatures in hand, all the problems of the outside world started to disappear, almost like when you play an RPG. The only problem was that each session didn't last longer than 20 or 30 minutes because after that time the nausea became almost intolerable. This Resolution Games title is a so-called cross-buy therefore, by buying it, you will have access to both the 2D and VR. We have focused our test on the latter because it makes that futuristic and augmented reality version of board games that science fiction has promised us. Using the controllers to move the checkers, take the cards from our hand and enlarge and tighten the map is one of the experiences on the market closest to that virtual reality imagined by Ready Player One. To play, just take a chair and place it in the center of a room, and wearing the viewer you'll find yourself in the same basement where the protagonists of Stranger Things gather to conquer a dungeon in the company of a bard, a murderer and a sorcerer. In this review of Demeo we will tell you how this experience has made very good use of virtual reality to digitally recreate the excitement and fun of meeting friends in the evening to try a board game or to continue the adventure of your party . There is not much original in this experience, the story is trivial and the mechanics are all already seen, but the grounding in virtual reality has made this device take a big step forward which is getting closer and closer to maintaining his promises. Class issue By simply turning your wrist upwards, Demeo's virtual reality will show you the cards in your hand: you can take them and play them by placing them on the target hero or enemy The product that the developers were most inspired by to create Demeo is, without a doubt, Dungeons and Dragons. Not only for the combat system and the grid structure of the dungeons but also for the available classes: hunter, sorcerer, assassin, guardian, bard, wizard and barbarian. Being a tribute to the roots of nerd culture, a pinch of Magic The Gathering could not be missing, so the combat system is a successful mix of these two classics. The entry barrier is non-existent because the system is incredibly intuitive even for those who have never chewed D&D or MTG, but once you pass the first levels it is clear that without coordination and strategy you won't go anywhere. In fact, once you enter a dungeon, your protagonist will have two actions available per turn which can be: move, launch a basic attack (by placing the character on an enemy's square), perform a special attack using a card from the dungeon's hand player, revive a fallen teammate, or open a chest. Each action is repeatable so you can attack twice but you cannot reuse the same card. To get new special attacks, just open a chest and each party member will receive at least one new card. Healing oneself and recovering hit points is an action available only through a special card of which each hero has one copy per dungeon. Magic in Vr Fighting in Demeo you will have to take and roll your die to determine if your action succeeds, fails or deals double damage, just like in Dungeons and Dragons Normally played on a TV, Demeo is a fun experience full of quotations which, however, does not surprise for its originality and variety. Wearing the virtual reality viewer, the same experience is put in a completely different light. Looking around you're in a basement full of 80's nerd culture references like Hero Quest, RPG manuals, a telescope and loads of memorabilia. On a table in front of you the map comes to life, you can grab the miniatures of your heroes and when there is a die to roll to decide if your attack is successful you have to take it with the controller and roll it. Said like this, these functions only look like what the English call a gimmick, a sop or a little thing, but wearing the virtual reality equipment it really feels like you're role-playing with friends. Whether you're looking for a memory or want to live first person a ret fantasyr, Demeo is a great tool to embark on a journey into the past of nerd culture. The biggest problem we encountered, unfortunately, we fear is difficult to solve. Unlike most VR games where you are staring straight ahead, since Demeo simulates a board game, you'll find yourself looking straight down most of the time. This made us quite nauseous after just over 20 minutes in the dungeons and only by taking off the headset and walking around a bit were we able to recover enough to play, again for no more than half an hour at a time. This problem obviously breaks the immersion in an almost perfect fantasy between miniatures, dice rolls and really funny fights.", "date": "2023-03-26", "grade": "7.5"}
