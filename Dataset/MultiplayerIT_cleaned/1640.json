{"name": "Star Wars: La Guerra dei Cloni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-la-guerra-dei-cloni-5.html", "text": "Countryside The single player mode is basically the ~story mode~, a set of levels to be overcome interspersed with film sequences that will explain the outcome of your actions in the game. The background of the game is taken from the final part of the movie Episode Two. The young Anakin Skywalker with the senator and his master Kenobi were recognized by the Separatists as guilty, following a summary trial, and sentenced to death. The Jedi, with the clone army of the Republic, will have to reach them and save them before the death sentence is actually fulfilled. Once rescued, the mission becomes the search for the weapon of mass destruction the Separatists are trying to build. The game intersperses combat situations aboard various vehicles, including the unforgettable walkers that also appeared in the first trilogy, and clashes with the lightsaber. Although all fans will initially like to take up the lightsaber and get out of the vehicle for some Jedi Knight action, unfortunately the disappointment will come almost immediately for them too, since the animations and controls are not at all taken from the beautiful Jedi Outcasts. The result is mediocre and these white weapon sequences almost seem like bonuses, done quickly just to attract a wider audience. The strong point of the game therefore remains the action in the vehicles, and above all the multiplayer action. It goes online! The Clone Wars suddenly changes its tone as soon as you activate the Live mode! It is certainly much more fun and interesting, considering also the scarcity of the artificial intelligence of the enemies in the Campaign mode. Actually the Live! it's just one of three different multiplayer modes. The other two are the classic split screen one, which allows up to four to play with four gamepads on the same Xbox, and the System Link one, which allows up to eight to play with the special connection cable between Xbox consoles. Returning to Live!, the mode that interests us most due to its enormous entertainment possibilities, we must say that it provides for different styles of play: the Duel, essentially a deathmatch, the Control Zone, practically a king of the hill, and Conquest (action team based). It is possible to use the Xbox Communicator during co-op games to agree on a common action, and while there have been noticeable frame-rate slowdowns during online action, these have only been sporadic cases. In short, the game runs very well online, and this is probably the mode for which it is actually worth buying. The graphic aspect The graphics, especially when compared to that of the PS2 and GameCube versions, are one of the positive aspects of this title. The light effects and details that are noticed when, for example, a missile is launched, with a flash just before the launch of the weapon and the trail of smoke that follows, or when you are in the middle of a pitched battle with dozens of lasers whizzing in opposite directions are quite evocative and exactly reminiscent of sequences from the film, which can only be more than welcome to hardcore Star Wars fans. The only sore point concerns the fights with the lightsaber. These levels are clearly seen to have been built quickly and with little attention to detail compared to the other in-vehicle levels. Mace Windu has a good number of polygons and detailed textures (in any case of a level always lower than the models of Jedi Outcast, for example), but the same cannot be said of the enemies or the surrounding environment. Music and sound effects The soundtrack by John Williams beautifully follows the sequences of the game, the sound effects are the traditional ones of Star Wars, the quality is that of the film series and it is especially noticeable with the use of a good surround system. There is nothing more pleasant than the well-known sound effect of lasers or the sword swinging from one side of the screen to the other as the sound completely envelops us with our surround speakers. This is undoubtedly another strong point of the game, especially for those who use the excellent Xbox 5.1 system. Conclusions The Clone Wars has begun and will bring fast-paced action right into your home. Fun is guaranteed, but especially if you have a connection to play in Live mode! Otherwise, the game will only be pleasant to enthusiasts, who will discover many reasons for satisfaction for having purchased it, and perhaps turn a blind eye to some flaws, without which the game could have definitely been better. Instead, it turns out to be a simple good diversion while waiting for the next Lucas titles such as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars: Galaxies. Pros: Great online mode via Live service! by Microsoft Impeccable audio Cons: Artificial intelligence to be reviewed Poor lightsaber sequences In the heart of battle In the Clone Wars, you are thrust into the heart of the fiercest and most spectacular conflict in Star Wars history. Leading the Republican forces, impersonate Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi in order to achieve a single goal: to stop the Separatists who are building a very powerful and ancient Sith weapon of mass destruction. The game features frenetic pitched battles as well as clashes and lightsaber combat, as well as the ability to lead as many as five different Republic units. We anticipate right now that The Clone War is not a masterpiece, and certainly not even remotely close to the famous Rogue Squadron or Jedi Starfighter, but it is a good action that will keep you busy for months thanks to the Live! mode, the multiplayer mode networking by Microsoft which has been well implemented. This adds depth to a game whose single player campaign is boring and lacking in depth in the long run.", "date": "2003-06-03", "grade": null}
