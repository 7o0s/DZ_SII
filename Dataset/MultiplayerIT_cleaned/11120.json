{"name": "Asphalt 4: Elite Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/asphalt-4-elite-racing_a.html", "text": "Surely, the interest of readers will be mainly oriented to the graphics of Asphalt 4 and the differences between a high-end mobile phone and an iPhone. As was to be expected, the version for the Apple device comes out the winner, while leaving the strong feeling that much more could have been done. The frame rate is good, the polygonal models of cars and motorcycles (one of the novelties of this episode) appear sufficiently accurate and the settings denote a certainly commendable variety and structural complexity. However, the product suffers from bad clipping and poorly defined textures that affect its overall visual impact. On mobile, the assessment regarding the average of the platform is certainly more than fair, even if compared to the iPhone there is a significant difference in terms of fluidity and number of polygons. Speaking of sound, the iPhone version proves to be overall better, despite Gameloft's absurd decision to accompany the act of drifting with a very annoying and deafening effect that can lead to turning the volume down to zero on its own. On the other hand, the dividing line that separates the playful experience that can be experienced in the two versions is thinner: despite the Apple terminal boasting the beauty of three control systems linked to the touchscreen and the integrated accelerometer, Asphalt 4 does not prove to be more enjoyable on one or the other platform. In both cases, acceleration is automatic, but while on mobile phones the pad and a couple of keys are used, on the iPhone to steer you can rely on the tilt sensor, or act on the sides of the touchscreen, or still take advantage of an on-screen steering wheel. screen to move with the thumb. Each method offers strengths and weaknesses, without dominating the others: the first allows for greater fluidity of the maneuver at the expense of precision, while the second offers the exact opposite, with the third playing the part of the ~neither fish nor fowl~ solution. However, what is not fully convincing about Asphalt 4 is the driving model, with cars and motorcycles that do not show great performance differences between them and whose behavior on the road does not leave the user great satisfaction: a negativity that must be added to a sensation of really low speed, with racing cars that score 300 km/h but don't make them ~feel~ at all. It is a pity that Gameloft did not take care of certain important aspects, because on a structural level Asphalt 4 is a product that fears very few rivals: in fact, the game boasts a vast series of tracks set in suggestive locations (Los Angeles, Paris and New York, just to mention the most famous), various modes that go beyond simple races, a simplified but still pleasant tuning component, and a wireless multiplayer section that works really great on the iPhone. Of course, even here there are gray areas - the ~stolen~ takedowns from Burnout are objectively ridiculous - but completeness is certainly the greatest value of the French production. For the next chapter, however, it might be a good idea to sacrifice something on the altar of quantity in favor of gameplay that rises to the occasion...
