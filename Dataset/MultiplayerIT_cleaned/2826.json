{"name": "Dirt 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dirt-5-recensione.html", "text": "If you have played Dirt Rally and have not followed this new title in the past months, the expectations towards this latest effort by Codemasters could lead you to think of a realistic video game. Well know that there is nothing further from simulation here and the Dirt 5 review will detail why. A bare and raw arcade, dirty with mud from the head to the muffler, rough, wet, colorful and over the top like few driving games in today's and past market. The light-hearted hours spent driving the most disparate car models can make us safely say that this is the rally title that all or almost all of us have been waiting to play for quite a while. Career Dirt 5's main mode, the career, doesn't have much to tell in terms of story or lore, after all how deep could a narrative that revolves around the repetition of challenges, spins, drifts and rams be? Little trust me, very little. But still know that the developers have found an interesting trick (not that it's the first time in a sports game, anyway) to tell the events behind our climb to success. A sort of podcast-comedy that with its banter between the presenter and the runners will make you smile more than a few times. The races take place in the classic way, going to unlock on a tree of connections as the previous ones are completed up to a kind of final challenge, obtainable only after having achieved certain objectives. The competitions are divided into categories, five to be precise: Stampede, Rally Rush and Ultra cross which are more or less the same type, or rather a 3 or 5 lap race; Ice Breaker is instead a challenge like the ones mentioned but takes place on a totally frozen track; Land Rush is simply a long descent between bends and overtakes, with no laps to repeat; Sprint will make you spin like tops on a ring, in 5-lap races; finally Gymkana will put you inside some arenas with various obstacles and tests, asking you to perform this or that other trick. Before even starting to compete, however, you will have the opportunity to choose a sponsor who, by completing certain objectives, will guarantee you the money and points necessary to unlock liveries and textures for your cars, or some parts to customize your character card. This is a sort of ~business card~ that can be customized with backgrounds, effects, stickers, lanyards and various nicknames. Each sponsor will guarantee you different customizations, so as to make it essential to change it often or in any case when a certain objective is achieved. At the end of each race you will be distributed money, career points, achievement points and collectibles. You will need the money to buy a bit of everything in Dirt 5, from cars to stickers, from cards to liveries. That's right, the game does not skimp on money and you will have no particular difficulty buying your favorite car or style of card that you prefer. Career points are the ones that will raise your overall level, regardless of the sponsor you choose. This rank will also allow you to unlock certain player card customizations. The sponsor level, on the other hand, is linked, as you can imagine, to the selected brand. Each of them has 15 steps, during which it will allow you to unlock customizations for the player card and particular liveries but not only. At the end of each race, if you reach the set goals, you will have a cash bonus given by the sponsor of the case. As we mentioned earlier, to advance in your career you will have to face some kind of end-of-chapter challenges, five to be exact. To gain access, however, you must have achieved specific objectives, accumulating a certain amount of objective medals. These are obtainable by achieving certain actions during the races, such as making a defined number of drifts or rams, or having spent a few seconds in the air or even having crossed the finish line in reverse. Once you reach the necessary medals, you can take on the level challenge and, if you finish at least in the top three, you can move on to the next events. On the side of the main Career then there are 1vs1 challenges that can be unlocked when certain objectives are achieved (which you cannot know, a fact that has given us a lot of annoyance) which will allow you to face the strongest pilots in the game. Lastly, longevity is not exactly a strong point of this mode: it is possible to finish everything in about 5-6 hours, obviously leaving out the completionism, which can double the hours of play. Arcade The arcade mode of Dirt5 is what everyone expects but lately few have been able to offer. It is divided into two categories which on paper are practically identical, were it not for the type of race, i.e. time challenge and single race. In the first you can decide the duration of the competition, while in the second the laps: it's simpler than that. The tracks to choose from are all those of the career mode, being able to also set the time and weather conditions. Playgrounds Here we are at the section which is the real beating heart of the title. As its name suggests, Playgrounds is a sort of fully customizable mode editor. At the beginning the game asks us to choose which type of attraction we intend to create between Gate Crasher, Gymkana and Smash Attack. The first is an event designed to cross the checkpoints we created in the shortest possible time. We have already talked about Gymkana, while in Smash Attack we will have to destroy all the targets to reach the set score in the shortest possible time. Basically however, apart from the different incipit, the editor always remains the same: once inside we will have to decide the size of the arena first, and then find ourselves faced with a very good variety of obstacles, arrows, platforms and objects that can be placed on them. All of this, once you get used to the simple editor, is decidedly exciting and exhilarating, especially in the company of a ~rally architect~ friend with whom you can share ideas to give birth to the definitive track. Speaking of sharing, once you're satisfied with your extraordinary track, you can save it and upload it to the game server so that the rest of the community can try it too. As well as, of course, you can test the tracks created by other users. Technique and gameplay Once you hit the track it's impossible not to fall in love with the feeling returned by the arcade driving model revised and corrected by Codemasters for Dirt 5. Every single curve, every single extra kilo, every horse and every puddle will make the gaming experience so varied , fun and different from wanting to try all the tracks again with each car to have the opportunity to test its characteristics and find the most suitable one. There are a total of 12 car categories to choose from, with cars belonging to the biggest car brands, from Ford, to Aston Martin, via Fiat and Peugeot. You will have the classic rally cars at your disposal, but also the super light ones, trucks, heavy pick ups and so on and so forth. All the extra machines have perfectly visible damage but which, as a good arcade, will not affect the gameplay. The accelerator is positioned on the right dorsal while the brake on the left one, with the left analogue you direct the car and with the right one you can look around. Our test was for the vast majority in automatic mode and we always enjoyed it, on all the tracks, but the manual gearbox is also available for those wishing to experience the thrill. Artificial intelligence does its job, always causing problems and cutting the road, trying in every way not to let us win: among other things, we have noticed that even among them, the cars controlled by the CPU push each other off the road. Technical and artistic side Dirt 5 has pleasantly impressed us. Some tracks and above all certain side effects have left us speechless many times, among other things, occasionally distracting us from the actual race. Codemasters has done a really applause-worthy job, with particles, light reflections on cars, water and ice, sudden snowstorms limiting vision, night fireworks, colored lasers, smoke bombs, variable weather and a myriad of other details. There are tracks that make you shiver from the amount of detail and work behind them, such as the Chinese bamboo forest or the Italian marble quarry. The changing time of day, then, gives that hint of realism that makes everything even more scenic. The sensation of speed is also very well rendered with the usual well-dosed lateral blur effect and used only when the need is really felt. Frame rate anchored without the slightest jump and soundtrack absolutely splendid, with punk rock songs that ~smash~, are the icing on the cake of all this excellent production. The online mode remains out of our test, not available at the time of the test and to which we will return later, with the servers turned on.", "date": "2020-11-02", "grade": "8.8"}
