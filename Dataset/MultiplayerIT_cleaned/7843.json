However, Microsoft's new motocross game has little to do with the PC classic from Rainbow Studios. It is a markedly arcade game centered on the use of avatars, the now famous polygonal alter egos designed by Rare, which have been crowding the friends lists and dashboards of Xbox 360 users for some years. previous and homonymous title, the new cosmetics of the Bongfish game is immediately appreciated for its caricatural and light-hearted form without any pretense of realism that goes well with a product that makes immediacy its strong point. Furthermore, it's certainly not every day that we see a polygonal puppet with our features riding a motocross bike wearing the Master Chief's helmet or a Portal 2 t-shirt. Prepare for landing The new Motocross Madness looks like the classic arcade racing game, characterized by an elementary driving style that is easy to master, thanks also to a rather permissive physics that helps a lot not to lose control of the vehicle even in situations that an experience more simulative would certainly have penalized with a fall. In practice, the only cases in which we will see our avatar thrown from the vehicle will be due to a high-speed frontal or more frequently when we have not been able to finish the animation of a trick during a jump in time to land composed. In fact, the heart of the game is heavily focused on performing spectacular evolutions in the air, essential for being able to load the inevitable turbo bar, a resource without which any hope of arriving first at the finish line will inevitably be precluded. The career game categories are the classic three-lap and eight-bike races on the track, the rivals mode which consists of fast laps where you can beat the developers' times (and subsequently those of other users) and an exploration mode where you can roam freely in large areas to be able to collect the coins and skulls hidden on the map. To these three is added a fourth mode, unlockable once you reach the eighth level of experience, all focused on tricks and evolutions where the challenge is to reach record scores while keeping the multiplier high. The experience level of our avatar rises by obtaining medals and collecting the objects scattered in the areas and in the tracks, this allows us to unlock new motorcycles and related pieces to enhance them and also numerous and curious clothing sets for our centaur. Motocross Madness is also one of the games with Avatar Famestar functionality, so that progress during the events will help raise the general fame of our avatar. Xbox 360 goals Nothing particularly challenging as regards the objectives, mostly related to obtaining gold medals and performing particular numbers of tricks and drifts. Most of the points are obtained simply by unlocking and finishing all career modes without breaking a sweat. There are two secret objectives instead. Up and down the world The tracks (nine in total) are set in Egypt, Australia and Iceland and the track design shines with a pleasant variety of jumps, gradients and above all very useful shortcuts for cutting portions of the track. To increase the longevity of the title, the Bike Club comes in handy with numerous missions to complete (focused on the statistics of the races) and above all the possibility of interacting with our friends list, thus organizing challenges in order to beat their best records and fastest times. Motocross Madness as fun and immediate, thanks to a very gentle difficulty curve, certainly does not shine for originality. While not sinning for serious flaws, the gameplay in the long run can appear flat and poor in bite, thanks to an artificial intelligence that does not appear particularly combative in single-player competitions. In any case, it would be unfair to expect depth and precision in handling the vehicle like that which characterizes the Trials series, however the feeling remains that everything is really too permissive and consequently there are few incentives that encourage clean and precise driving, perhaps better trajectories. Falls and off-piste rarely compromise the race and although it can be a good thing that every competition is never really decided after some mistakes, sometimes we wonder how much the merit of our results lies in our skills orin the stupidity of the opponents. The risk, in the absence of a substantial community of players on Xbox Live, is that the sense of challenge and the motivation to move forward are lost once all the tracks have been unlocked and all six motorcycles have been purchased. Nothing to say about the technical sector, the evocative settings are rendered in an excellent way and the tracks are full of details and choreographic details such as ruins, forests and caves that become part of the path itself and are very well modeled. There is an annoying texture pop-up effect during track presentation overviews, but fortunately this disappears (almost) completely during the course of the race. Without infamy and without praise the music that does nothing to be memorable but at least is neither intrusive nor annoying.", "date": "2013-05-09", "grade": "7.7"}
