Let's start our review of MXGP 2021 with a sentence from multiple champion Antonio Cairoli that embodies the philosophy of the new Milestone game. Also this year we have arrived at that period in which every virtual motocross enthusiast dreams of facing the first MX2 race to discover all the news of the new MXGP edition. MXGP 2021 is, as always, a nice gift for all two-wheel enthusiasts, but after so many years it still can't fully get out of the usual loop of small improvements that distinguishes the productions of the Milanese house. Gameplay and technique MXGP 2021 - Scuffles in the dust are the order of the day Fun. Guys let's not hide behind the usual finger, MXGP 2021 is fun and addictive like few titles. Either for the short duration of the races, at least the basic ones, or because it's fantastic to jump with motocross bikes, or because it's wonderful to create your own route and share it online or roam around a semi-open world map. The new title from Milestone, the Milanese studio that now holds almost the monopoly of any licensed game that deals with motorbikes, really has something for all tastes. However, this year's novelties are not as brilliant as the general result. The beating heart of the production is obviously the classic Career mode in which you can customize your rider's equipment and bike and choose a sponsor to compete in MX2. The ultimate goal is, of course, to win the championship to get to compete in the most famous one, the MXGP. During the Career, as in all other modes, you will receive credits based on your performance, which you can use to buy hundreds of licensed items, including helmets, jerseys, boots and gloves, but also the components for your bike. The customization options are quite deep, perhaps slightly more than last year's title, but just like its predecessor, we won't have the possibility to customize our avatar in this new game either. Returning to the gameplay, the playful and purely ~playful~ part is absolutely commendable. The developers have listened to the criticisms and improved the whole experience in general. The control of the bike, on PlayStation 5 thanks also to the DualSense and the haptic feedback, seems more reactive and precise to us, net of a few too many slips and a physics that makes some bad jokes every now and then, but they are really trifles. The vehicle seemed more stable and ~heavier~ to us, with a more realistic rendering than last year's version. Then, as in real races, the return of the stimulations on the joypad tires the hand and makes everything even more immersive. The race surround has been enhanced with smoke bombs and shouts, even if the crowd continues to be too static. The lack of a soundtrack during the races is felt (excuse the pun) because, in our opinion, it would have helped to raise the adrenaline. Just as the lack of a comment is inexcusable. We tried the entire Career in easy mode without advanced physics and with all the aids activated, something that turned MXGP 2021 into a kind of arcade. The result is really a lot of fun, also because the AI made us understand that it was there anyway, overtaking us and not forgiving a few wide curves. Conversely, with all the aids deactivated, let's say in simulation mode, things change drastically and you will certainly need a few more test rides to get the hang of it. Mode MXGP 2021 - The amazing jumps we all want to do The main menu puts in front of the game modes we are used to: the Career, which we have already analyzed, the Playground mode, the track editor, the quick modes, customization and multiplayer. Playground is a semi-open world map in which to participate in races and events also created by other players and made available. The possibility of creating trial tracks with obstacles scattered around the map is very nice. Scattered around the scenario are points, called waypoints, from which we can face timed challenges with checkpoints to share with the community. Unfortunately even this mode, although it is only an addition to the main game, would need an overhaul. It feels more like a filler of sorts, however appreciated nonetheless. We trust in the Milestone guys and in their expertise to maybe have a beautiful map next year with lots of things to do. The track editor is as we remembered it and deals with 4 main maps on which to build our tracks. We will be able to add straight stretches, curves with and without jumps, bumps, single double and triple jumps and the various finish lines. To help us we will also have the possibility to activate the altimetric display to plan descents or ascents to liven up the races. However, small inexplicable difficulties in closing the route once completed should be noted. When we have finished creating the outline of the track, we will obviously have the opportunity to share it with the community. Here too we are left with a bitter taste in the mouth and with the feeling that something more could have been done, net of a few small additions such as the holeshot. The fast modes are basically the Time Attack, the Championship and the Fast Race in which you can choose your favorite driver and take part in it. We will also have the Legacy maps Ottobiano, Ernee, Leon and Agueda from previous versions of the game available for fans of the franchise. Then there is the customization mode in which we will be able to modify our avatar, even if not physically, with all the parts and accessories that we will unlock thanks to the in-game currency. Graphics MXGP 2021 - The playground mode From a technical point of view, MXGP2021 looks bad. Compared to last year's title we are facing a general improvement in terms of textures, lighting and effects. Racing in the rain gives particular satisfaction and finally, by popular acclaim, the first-person mode is back, very fun, even if we still preferred to enjoy all the contours and models of our bike for the entirety of the test. As already mentioned, however, the Achilles' heel remains the almost totally immobile spectators. The photo mode, then, shows off its muscles and does justice to a title that with all its redundant features still manages to entertain and do justice once again to Tony Cairoli and the whole cross world.", "date": "2021-11-30", "grade": "7.5"}
