{"name": "Narita Boy: la recensione di un massiccio tributo agli anni 80", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/narita-boy-recensione.html", "text": "Narita Boy's review, one day ahead of its official launch, comes four years after the announcement of what immediately turned out to be a clear and passionate tribute to science fiction, video games and the imagery of the 80s. , there is a normal boy who becomes a very powerful digital samurai, there is the cathode ray tube effect, there is a sci-fi virtual world structured like an ancient fantasy kingdom, there is an avalanche of synthwave music, there are abilities that they load from floppy disks and there is even a DeLorean, queen of the thousand references to a game that is bigger than the two-dimensional view would suggest. It is no coincidence that it has attracted the attention of Team 17 and tomorrow it will also arrive on PlayStation, Switch and Xbox with an attractive price of 24.99 euros. But on PC and Xbox it will also be usable with the Game Pass, Microsoft's secret weapon. The 80s, in soul and substance The terrible efficacy of the Trichroma Sword The first and already captivating Narita Boy trailer was worth $160,000 on Kickstarter, out of $120,000 requested, in what hasn't been among the brightest moments for crowdfunding. The rest was done by the evident passion of a team which, despite some economic sacrifices and the pandemic, reached the finish line, also winning the support of the legendary Team 17, with just over a year behind schedule and we can already to say that it is not much given the dimensions of a project which, bound to two dimensions, shows off a spectacular pixel art made up of 300 screenshots and over 20,000 sprites, all made by hand. This can also be seen in the different fluidity of the animations, sometimes undoubtedly linked to issues of time and costs, but often desired to evoke a specific style or imagery. Narita Boy is a tribute to the eighties in substance and aesthetics, a title that evokes the essence of Tron but makes her wear the eclectic and multicolored dress of Ready Player One, also tracing its enormous variety. Not everyone is passionate about pixel art, we know it well, but although it is intrinsically modest, the graphic design of the Studio Koba title is strong in an avalanche of details, animations and suggestions that give depth and variety to a two-dimensional but full Digital World full of details, of different creatures, of little pixels put exactly where they should be. Even the quotes are all seamlessly integrated into a game fabric that includes gameplay variations, Another World-esque tunnels, flashbacks set in Japan, giant robots and even a bit of surfing. A sunset ride about to turn into an obstacle course Someone called Narita Boy a metroidvania, but from the point of view of the structure we are talking about a title divided into levels and combat sequences that mixes adventure, platform and two-dimensional action. Some areas offer a certain amount of exploration, also functional to the adventurous component, but going to the bone it is a linear experience, albeit full of details and even some secrets. However, it takes its cue from the Metroidvania for the evolution of the character which is interrupted only at the end of the game. New moves, including summons and even combat modes, enrich or alter the gameplay for all 12 chapters of Narita Boy, the story of a digital samurai who makes his way thanks to the sword of the Trichroma and thanks to the abilities he unlocks by recovering, of course , floppy disk. Gameplay A gigantic Koi carp, as fascinating as it is dangerous Narita Boy's gameplay starts with a jump and a sequence of basic attacks to which are added, rather early in the game, a ranged hit, albeit short, and a couple of attacks that consume a resource that recharges in time, The first, a sledgehammer blow is not the most comfortable to use, but the second, a huge laser capable of inflicting huge damage, is vital to get away when the number of enemies is overwhelming. And it's just the beginning of a collection of powers largely linked to a reactive, spectacular and increasingly varied combat system. Other skills are instead linked to sessions on horseback with obstacles to jump, clashes between giant robots and maritime acrobatics on the back of floppy disks which, in addition to quoting old games, undoubtedly give variety and perception of breadth to the experience. But the bulk of Narita Boy is experienced by brandishing the Trichroma sword which guarantees us all sorts of powers, including three evocations linked to the three colors that represent the three balanced forces of the Digital World. Furthermore, by acquiring them, our hero gains the ability to boost himself with a yellow, red or blue aura, inflicting more damage on enemies who have the sameempowerment, but suffering even more from them. And it is when this picture is completed that a series of particularly excited fights begins that ask us to use the right aura with the right enemies, before other increasingly dangerous enemies make the screen too crowded to be able to get away with it. One hope, however, always remains lit between dodges, shoulder thrusts, summons and even two jumps, the basic one which is faster and a wider one which also works as an uppercut and is essential for dodging bosses and tackling certain platforming sessions. A Trichroma-style DeLorean The uppercut, it must be said, is an all too effective move and it happens to be abused, but the combat is still fun, intuitive despite the large number of moves and satisfying, thanks to the graphics that have one of the maximum peaks in the often bloody defeat animations , although the virtual nature of the world cushions the perceived violence of enemies. These, by the way, are quite a lot. In fact, with the new moves come new threats that change in movement, attacks and even defenses. There are flying enemies, huge creatures, exploding enemies, impromptu fights with special enemies that appear only once, shooting enemies, charging enemies, shielded medieval skeletons and huge armored knights. Each requires a different approach although it is always possible to use dodging and basic attacks to take out almost anything. But things get easier by taking advantage of acquiring new skills that include shoulder thrust, lunge and attack from above, three moves also necessary to overcome certain barriers that add to the multitude of factors of a decidedly rich title from every point of view, including dialogues not particularly deep, at least within the Digital Word, but which abound with suggestions designed to enhance the parallel between the developer's story and the characters that appear before us. It must be said that once you understand the monster sequences and boss attack screens, things almost always get pretty straightforward, but Narita Boy doesn't want a punishing title. Dying isn't that difficult when you get into a fight with low health, but it regenerates when a save is loaded and there are so many strictly automatic saves. So many that we would have liked a few more challenging sequences, of those that Narita Boy reserves for us only in the last levels, but overall it is enough to make us feel like heroes in combat and it is not an impediment to the story, an important part of the experience. Furthermore, Narita Boy does not need to put a spanner in the works to lengthen the broth. We are talking about over 12 hours of always new screens and fights that are almost always fun and satisfying, thanks to the work on the graphics which, already spectacular, shine with their own light in the animations of the monsters, including those that underline their horrible death under the blows of the Trichroma Sword. A little big colossal Battle of the titans in the streets of the capital of the Digital World Basically, the story is that of the classic hero who enters an enchanted world and must defeat the villain of the moment, but the enchanted world is a simulation created by a legendary programmer whose story is told to us through references, allegories and 12 flashbacks that punctuate the many chapters of Narita Boy, the title of the game but also the title of the virtual simulation and of the hero who must face it to restore balance in the Trichroma. In fact, everything is based on three rays of colored light, three allegories of the forces that act ruthlessly on the lives of human beings who also correspond to three populations to be saved from a terrible corrupting entity called Him and its hordes of Stallion programs. To reach the dark enemy, Narita Boy faces a journey through the memories and impulses of the creator, the programmer whose dramas permeate the Digital World, a creation born from bullying from the desire to escape, from the disappointments and bitternesses of life, fragments of a story that unfolds leading us towards a partly bitter, partly surprising and partly left unfinished ending. In fact, it does not close the games, explicitly opening up to the future, but if nothing else it does not deprive us of the satisfaction of a final boss worthy of respect and of a twist that fits perfectly into an alternation made up of small touching moments and junctures of revenge in the digital world underlined by the sensational main theme of the soundtrack. Another transformation, particularly powerful Everything, as we said, enhanced by delightful animations and an avalanche of details that support the coadventurous component of the title. In fact, this is based exclusively on finding symbols to unlock certain teleporters, but between suggestive glimpses, details and animations of our samurai, it reinforces the mystical / science fiction dimension of a decidedly rich experience. Some tricks are clearly seen and some choices are not fully convincing, as in the case of the planes directly from the very first beat'em ups, but the overall quality of the experience is excellent. And it is a crescendo that culminates with a spectacular final boss characterized by very fluid animations, inspired by a certain Japanese animation both in style and in the distortion of the flesh as an allegory of the torn ego. A visually direct reference to Akira for an evocative and all in all difficult final fight, thanks to a large number of enemy attacks that are difficult to predict and sometimes capable of distracting us thanks to an amazing quality. The difficulty, however, does not exceed the threshold and remains consistent with a title that prefers to convey satisfaction rather than frustration, giving us yet another surprise at the end of a small pixel art colossal which, despite not inventing anything, gives an intense experience. long and full of exciting moments. One of the most spectacular fights, in an absolute sense Finally, let's not forget the amazing soundtrack, accompanied by effects of equal quality, which gives us jazz entr'actes in the bars, a western piece to underline the ride in the desert, epic excerpts to accompany the sequences with the giant robots clashing a la Godzilla between the buildings of the capital of the Digital World and a couple of memorable synthwave pieces, the kind destined to end up directly on the smartphone to be listened to endlessly. And it is precisely the sound that represents another important arrow in the bow of a title that invents nothing, and in style is undoubtedly partly indebted to the excellent Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery, but hits the mark for variety, visual rendering , fun and imaginary, complete with CRT screen distortion which can still be reduced from the menu. However, the Italian language is missing, at least for the moment, and the promised beat'em up sequence inspired by Double Dragon is also missing, although the open ending still anticipates its future arrival.", "date": "2021-03-29", "grade": "8.8"}
