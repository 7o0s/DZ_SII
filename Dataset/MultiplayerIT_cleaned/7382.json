The last episode sold on cartridge was in fact that Picross 3D of 2009 (2010 in Europe) for Nintendo DS, which also represented a risky and not entirely successful attempt to transport the concept into a three-dimensional sphere. Setting aside experimentation and probably also the ambitions to reach the general public, the series has therefore found its own dimension on the Nintendo 3DS eShop under the name of Picross and; in the course of just over a year, the online store of the Nintendo portable therefore welcomed three episodes of the new brand, with a formula based totally on substance rather than on form. Picross e3 continues on the path traced by the previous episodes without major surprises Mega is better Picross e3 stands in a fundamentally unchanged way compared to its predecessors, precisely on the basis of the choice to address itself almost exclusively to that audience of fans who already know and appreciate Nintendo's nonogram-based puzzle well. We had spoken, reviewing the previous chapter, of a solution ~to the Puzzle Week~, with mini-episodes released a short distance from each other united by the same aesthetic aspect. With Picross e3 we can only confirm this indication, because with the exception of the dominant color theme - this time a bright pink - there are practically no substantial graphic differences compared to the other releases: same menu structure, identical organization of contents, same interface and check. And the game obviously doesn't change: in this case too it is a question of being able to identify the figure hidden within a grid, following the indications provided by the numbers placed at the beginning of each row and column. By analyzing the ~joints~ between these numbers, it is necessary to understand which squares to color, so as to give shape to the figure and solve the puzzle. A mechanism as simple to understand as it is intriguing and challenging to deal with, which is why Picross has always maintained its hard core of loyal enthusiasts. As in the first two chapters, also in Picross e3 there are different modes: easy and normal, in which errors are reported and ~cost~ a time penalty, and instead free and extra where, on the contrary, the player has to rely totally on his forces to be able to get the better of the nonogram. The novelties of this episode are therefore to be found exclusively in the Mega Picross, which represent a further increase in difficulty that will please the most experts in the field; in practice the substantial difference lies in the presence of Mega Numbers which indicate the squares to be colored not on a single row or column but on two at the same time. Although it may appear to be a minor change, in reality it is a change that requires a further degree of reflection, making the 30 puzzles contained in this mode decidedly the most interesting of the package. For the rest, the strengths and weaknesses that have distinguished the Picross series remain: 150 nonograms are a good number, but the maximum limit of the 15x15 grids make the experience in general often too simple (with the exception of the Mega Picross) precisely because those experts who should also be the main target of the product. The decidedly affordable price, however, makes the purchase always rather inviting.", "date": "2013-12-27", "grade": "7.3"}
