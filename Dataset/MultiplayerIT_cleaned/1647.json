{"name": "Pac-Man 99", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pac-man-99-recensione.html", "text": "The rise of titles eager to betray their origins and jump into the now overcrowded genre of battle royale continues. The main platform responsible for this revolution is obviously Nintendo Switch which, trying to give value to proprietary online services, continues to offer players combinations of historical titles with a more modern multiplayer setting, for a mix that was simply unthinkable until a few years ago . The strangest thing, however, is that these upheavals are working all right. The Tetris 99 review talks about a title that has demonstrated how a game at the evolutionary basis of gaming can still have a lot to say even in the modern sphere and Pac-Man certainly does not want to be outdone, trying to repeat the event. If with Tetris 99 then, one could feed on healthy skepticism before getting his hands on it, with Namco's iconic title things travel in the opposite way, knowing how much the mechanics of one against all marries beautifully with the purest arcade titles . We therefore approached this new experiment full of expectations, however colliding with a not exactly perfect realization. Pac-Man just as we know it Pac-Man 99 strips away all the frills Namco has given it in recent years. Away with the glitzy Neons of Pac-Man Championship, away with the alternative and more imaginative modes and away with even that slightly inclined view used to modernize the product. We therefore return to the origins with a single, very classic, symmetrical level and the need to survive as long as possible without being hit by Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde, the four bitter ghost enemies. This would be enough to pay homage to an immortal icon, pitting 99 players against each other in a distance marathon, to have a title capable of engaging us for entire days. Arika, the development team behind the project, however, decided to move things by adding a whole series of penalties capable of ending our game prematurely. So while you eat the balls on the course and think about where to move to the next crossroads it can happen that your opponents devour some ghosts and send completely white Pac-Man onto your playing field. These obstacles will start chasing you and, hitting you, will slow down your movements for a few seconds, thus making you an easy target for ghosts. Fortunately, you can also try to absorb the white jammers by staying away from danger for a few moments or even destroy them all at the same time by eating one of the four power ups hidden in the corners of the maze. Pac-Man 99: Behind the DLCs hide skins created to pay homage to the Namco classics The game is thus transformed into a continuous coming and going of moments of apparent peace in which your immortality is active and moments of panic and terror when even a single blow could sanction your defeat. So far the basic mechanics don't seem anything difficult to assimilate except that eight different commands appear on the sides of the screen, ready to overturn different aspects of the game, also resulting so decisive as to be able to easily influence your final placement in the standings if used correctly. Too bad that at this juncture, Arika has totally forgotten to put a short tutorial or even a trivial explanation of the commands in the menus, thus letting the player experience and learn on his own skin, always arriving there by deduction, essential mechanics to compete equal with the other players. A frankly difficult choice to understand in terms of design and more associated with a real lack than a feature to make Pac-Man 99 more competitive. There is very little free to play Pac-Man 99: Playing for free is still a great thing The end result is a title that hides the depth of the game in an anti-intuitive way, necessarily requiring the need to read up on external sources to know the mechanics in detail. Furthermore, with Tetris 99, the Arika studio had managed to pack a competition that could really always reward skill and ability, where luck was a present but still marginal element. In Pac-Man 99, luck plays a much more decisive role, not only because the generation of the various jammers in the labyrinth is completely random but above all because of the great speed with which one passes on the screen from an extremely complex situation to one of relative calm , confusing the targeting commands of the opponents and frequently thwarting our attacks. The ability to decide with a tap on the screenmo the player to target is certainly much more effective but it is an option reserved only for portable mode, another imbalance that should not arise in a game of this kind. Finally, let's turn up our noses even in the face of the enormous amount of content sold as DLC, not only aesthetics such as skins and sprites for Pac-Man, arenas and ghosts, but entire ways to play against the AI or in an unprecedented points mode , all features hidden behind a paywall of thirty euros in case you want to take home the complete package or fifteen if you want the complete collection of aesthetic variants and icons of the labyrinth. Pac-Man 99: 98 opponents to face is no joke, especially if you don't know the mechanics!", "date": "2021-04-12", "grade": "7.0"}
