{"name": "Quake 3 sul browser", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/quake-live-recensione.html", "text": "Quake 3 was released in 1999 in the height of the golden age of multiplayer first-person shooters on PC, a genre which, after five years of experimentation and refinement, had matured to the point that titles entirely dedicated to this discipline began to come out (to the delight of those like us who reveled in the ~football~ contrast between Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament). Those who at the time hailed ~the advent of the end~ for single player games were fortunately wrong, but the fact remains that ten years later the myth of Quake 3 is still alive and well, a flame kept burning in the bedrooms of tireless modders, as well as in the computerized classrooms of university campuses all over the world (ahem... good times). Seizing the opportunity to indulge the imperishable nostalgic spirit of veterans (and to attack the new generation, daughter of these roaring years between Web 2.0 and social networks), id Software has embarked on the Quake Live project. The ingredients of the recipe are simple: take the good old Quake 3 Arena - complete with the Team Arena expansion - and offer it in a renewed free version, playable within the browser, with the idea of supporting the project thanks to the contribution of IGA Worldwide (leading company in in-game advertising). It is worth debunking the common misconception that it is a ~web based~ version of Quake 3, with all the connotations of ~ubiquity~ and immediacy of access that characterize games and applications based on Flash or Javascript that dot the Net . So don't expect to be able to ~login~ to the Quake Live site from your office PC or a friend's PC and launch yourself into a quick match as if you were at home: Quake Live is no longer independent from your machine than any software canonically installed, as it requires no less than 250 MB download. Virtually the entire, ancestral, Quake 3 installation package in the form of a Firefox / Internet Explorer plug-in, which is slyly semi-transparently downloaded to the user during a mandatory training session against AI, in a small pre-loaded map. The ingenious trick obviously only works the first time (and indeed you will find yourself in the same situation more often than intended during the numerous updates of the downloaded material), but by completing it diligently you will have provided enough data on your ability (or lack thereof) to allow the game to offer you the appropriate challenges. The main innovations of Quake Live compared to the classic of the past are in fact precisely those that project it into the 21st century: matchmaking system, persistent statistics for each player, achievements, organization of tournaments and competitions, friend lists and anything else your wanderings for modern gaming platforms you have become accustomed to. Once operational and after configuring a few simple options (Quake Live is so light that in all likelihood it would run on your mobile phone) we are presented with a series of matches, distributed among the 25 maps available for the 5 game modes provided, i.e. capture the flag, clan arena, team death match, duel and free for all. In general, the game content is very familiar, with very few new features of note, apart from some popular maps created by players in the past and now elevated to official arena status. However, it is appreciable that both the different arenas and the textures of the characters have received a nice hand of finishing touches, thanks also to the decade of loving care dedicated to the game by the community of modders, where id has gone to enlist some key figures in order to make the project possible. Small changes aside - without forgetting some questionable imperfections, such as the Quake Live advertising billboards that dot some maps and will likely be filled with advertising banners once out of beta - the gameplay has also undergone significant improvements, including weapon balancing, air control and anti latency measures. For the rest, the game seems to jump out of memory, authentic in its visceral frenzy, violence and - why not - simplicity. Quake 3 has always been a less ~technical~ FPS than Unreal Tournament, devoid of alternative fire modes, double jumps and double overshoots and so on, but the fact remains that it returns to performing ignorant rocket jumps after years of shooters hyper-realistic, it was a considerable pleasure. Comment As you may have understood, if you are evaluating whether or not it is worth playing Quake Live and giving it a chance, the answer is undoubtedly positive. Maybe it won't ~take~ you to the point of making you give into e-sport, but in addition to saving the few euros that the game vi would cost on Steam, you will end up with an improved product of undoubted value, if only for the integration with the browser, the ~social~ component and the matchmaking that project it out of the stone age. To try! Pros Violent. Frantic. Fun. Quake! New interface, matchmaking and stats It's completely free Against Especially for old school nostalgics... ...who might even prefer something really new", "date": "2009-04-03", "grade": null}
