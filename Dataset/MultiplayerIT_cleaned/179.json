{"name": "Need for Speed Carbon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/need-for-speed-carbon_b.html", "text": "On the track There are three game modes that we can access in NFS Carbon: fast running, challenges and career. There's not much to say about the first: you choose the car and circuit from those available and get on the track. The challenges already offer more entertainment: it is a series of races in which you have to participate to gain access to new circuits (the extent of which varies according to the degree of difficulty of the challenge: there are three), and which sometimes involve the classic race with opponents, sometimes they are based on the achievement of checkpoints, on time limits or on particular rules (this is the case of the drift race, for example). Finally here is the career, obviously the main mode of this Need for Speed, in which we will participate in the races with a very specific purpose: to recover the dominion over the territories that we abandoned years before, when the police made a maxi raid and arrested most of the participants to clandestine racing. To succeed we will be helped by our ex-girlfriend (who in the game is played by the beautiful and talented Emmanuelle Vaugier - if you have seen ~Saw 2~ you certainly remember her) as well as by a ~crew~ that we will build as we proceed in the game. The members of this ~crew~ will not only provide us with advice, but will modify our skills during the races, sometimes competing alongside us (and, to be honest, actually winning the races for us, pace of fun) . The game NFS Carbon offers us, as usual, a large number of cars, with the unprecedented addition of muscle cars. In the ~fast run~ mode you have the possibility to use all the unlocked cars, and precisely to unlock others you have to try your hand at the more complex modes, such as the career. In this sense, we will start with one car and gradually we will be able to have others, in a crescendo that will lead us to conquer not only new cars but also and above all new territories: in Carbon there are four, each dominated by a different boss. You can choose to roam the streets freely and access the challenges from time to time (with the possibility of finding checkpoints and starting spectacular chases with the police) or view the map and conveniently select the desired event. Each territory is conquered when all or most of the events are completed: at that point the boss of the moment is faced, in several rounds, for the definitive conquest of the area. The elements that distinguish Need for Speed are not lacking in Carbon, in this case it is possible to customize your cars in various ways: on a purely aesthetic level or in terms of performance. If the modification of the latter is rather schematic and superficial (you buy the ready-made ~packages~), the same certainly cannot be said of the aesthetic modifications: you can buy new wheels, spoilers, paints, vinyls, modify the bodywork by applying appendices etc. etc., all drawing from a database of really existing products. Technical realization After Ubisoft's course debut on Wii, in truth mediocre (with GT Pro Series and Monster 4x4 World Circuit), the arrival of a title in the Need for Speed series arouses great curiosity both as regards the technical realization and the control system issue. Speaking of the graphics of NFS Carbon on Wii, there is no doubt about the quality of the design, with rather detailed polygonal models (although far from what is seen in Gran Turismo, as is normal) and, in particular, locations that display of particularly populated urban cross-sections, without ever any pop-up problems or rendering defects. Unfortunately, however, everything moves jerkily, well below 30 fps, with a slight improvement only when using the boost (which, by the way, causes all the graphics to be decorated with a very nice blur effect ). A result that leaves us dumbfounded, above all because we have seen much better on GameCube and Wii should guarantee double the power compared to its predecessor Nintendo. How to explain such a result? It was probably due to haste and carelessness, a hypothesis confirmed by the lack of any localization of the product (the speech is in English, without even subtitles). The problem, as could be expected, does not afflict the sound sector, which is produced in realistic effects and in a signed and engaging soundtrack, nor the filmed sequences in which the various actors (including the beautiful Emmanuelle Vaugier) play convincing on digital backdrops. The control system on Wii NFS Carbon offers different configurations of the control system, but also in this case thehaste with which everything was prepared: the basic layout, which provides for the use of the Wii-mote horizontally as a steering wheel, guarantees the gaming experience closest to the spirit of a racer, where the other configurations appear nothing short of weird and out of place: the rotation of the Nunchuck on its own axis to steer and the tilt of the Wii-mote to accelerate and brake, for example. Once you select the Wii-mote-only-controlling arrangement, however, you run into the fact that the Nunchuck needs to be plugged in to navigate some setup menus properly... the problem is you can't keep it docked while playing, so you have to leave it nearby and connect it when needed. Along the same lines there is another problem, albeit minor: the Wii-mote cannot be used as a mouse to indicate destinations on the map, and moreover while navigating the menus you have to use the d-pad with the remote vertically , and then turn it over when playing. Apart from these details, how does the Wii controller actually behave in the game? Leaving the sensitivity on ~medium~, the Wii-mote reacts to stimuli in a rather faithful way and the configuration of the keys is quite intuitive even if it does not favor the use of the manual gearbox at all, entrusted to the directional cross. And the accuracy? Well, precision does not belong to this version of NFS Carbon, there is a slight latency in the response to commands which in some cases forces unforeseen collisions, generating very, very frustrating situations. In general, adding a steering wheel adapter to this title as a bundle, as happened with Ubisoft products, would have greatly improved the feeling and also made the gaming experience more comfortable and bearable: playing with the Wii-mote in that position and straight arms is a great resistance workout for the deltoids. Comment Predictably, the first wave of multiplatform titles in the Wii version should be soon forgotten, because it is obvious that the developers had too little time to get something good from the innovative controller but also and above all from the technical capabilities of the machine, which also boasts an architecture very similar to that of the GameCube. In the specific case of Need for Speed Carbon, we are faced with a product really rushed away, without a minimal localization in Italian but above all with graphics that had the duty to flow smoothly even at the expense of the level of detail, and which instead trudges along in a waste of even excellent polygonal constructions. Control via the Wii-mote, in this sense, is surprisingly good and guarantees a discreet experience, even if there is no steering wheel adapter (in this case really necessary). In conclusion, NFS Carbon is a nice arcade racing game, of some substance and capable of guaranteeing great immersion... but the Wii version is far from being the best. Pros: An excellent Need for Speed Lots of customization possibilities Quite functional control system Cons: Completely insufficient frame rate There is a lack of a steering wheel adapter No translation into Italian Need for Speed has always meant arcade racing: the Electronic Arts series has a long history and a tradition of great successes, also due to the ability to renew itself year after year. NFS Carbon is precisely the last episode, released for all gaming systems including the Wii, where it will have to deal with new hardware from all points of view.", "date": "2007-01-08", "grade": null}
