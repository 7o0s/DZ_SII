The experiment of contaminating shooter mechanics with the typical vastness of an MMO has succeeded, and we have had ample confirmation of it in these three years that have separated the title's debut from the PlayStation 4 release. gameplay and game structure emerged solid from the beginning with the only doubt of the frequency of the release of new content, essential to allow players to become attached to their character and the game world, without giving them excuses not to return to visit the server. Although the absence of a leading competitor could have led to a certain laziness in the implementation of the updates, the developers of Daybreak Company (formerly Sony Entertainment Online) have shown how much the ideas and community support have remained constant and unchanged over the course of weather. Now, after a few months of closed beta and a very short open beta that preceded the official launch, we have finally managed to immerse ourselves again in the crowded battles that afflict the planet Auraxis, this time comfortably seated on the sofa and with the PlayStation 4 pad squeezed between hands. Planetside 2 finally lands on PlayStation 4 keeping all its MMOFPS qualities intact A difficult start Despite the name change, Daybreak Company has remained a software house extremely close to Sony and as agreed has focused on a conversion of the title from PC without neglecting any aspect. From the graphic component to the contents, passing through weapons, equipment and armaments, nothing has been left out in the creation of what is currently the most interesting free to play on PlayStation 4. Once we downloaded and installed the 13GB of Planetside 2, we immediately jumped in into the fray with a no less friendly start than on PC. First you need to choose a faction from the three available. All, needless to say, determined to conquer the planet Auraxis without taking prisoners. The lore, however, is diametrically different from what one would expect from an MMO, which usually tends to dwell on explaining the narrative background of the various races and factions involved in the events. Nonetheless, to broaden the player's sense of affection with his virtual alter ego, there is a tendency to offer a well-stocked editor in terms of aesthetic customization, all secondary elements with respect to the actual gaming experience which, however, are decisive in terms of involvement. In this Planetside 2 goes against the trend, putting three factions of humans at the center of the story where one side is as good as the other and there are no supporting stories or events to give a minimum of context to the reasons for the clash. Also in terms of gameplay, it is completely irrelevant to choose one faction rather than another since within each one there will be the possibility of taking part in the battle in any role and will not affect weapons, equipment and vehicles in any way. disposition. It is not known the reasons behind the clash between Vanu Sovereignty, the Terrestrial Republic and the New Conglomerate, which are distinguished only by the colors they belong to, respectively purple, red and blue, useful for identifying the opponents in the vast and equally populated game scenarios. In the same way, having arrived on Koltyr, the planet reserved for new recruits, the atmosphere has not changed since bluntly we found ourselves at the center of the battle. Planetside 2 is like that, devoid of pleasantries. It took us a couple of hours before we became familiar with the controls, the base, the map and the objectives since there is no real tutorial, but the first thing we learned the hard way was the presence of the friendly fire, a mechanic not to be underestimated especially in the large and populated battles that we found ourselves facing later in the game. We were literally overwhelmed by all the terminals present in the home base and by the colorful icons on the map, with the only option to follow the flow of the other players of our faction and imitate their movements. This was probably the first and most important lesson of the Daybreak Company shooter, a title that cannot be tackled alone but requires constant support from teammates. Playstation 4 trophies In spite of its vastness and the many hours of gameplay it offers, Planetside 2 is rather stingy in terms of trophies, among which there is nohe platinum. In fact, there are only 12 of them, eight of which are bronze, three silver and only one gold, all quite standard if we talk about first-person shooters. They range from mastering every type of weapon in the arsenal like rocket launcher, machine gun and sniper rifle, to racking up ten thousand kills and reaching the 100th combat rank. In the heat of the fight Playing with the group does not necessarily imply that there must be constant voice chat or text interaction with members of your own faction, but it is necessary to follow and understand each other, always keeping an eye on the map, never moving alone and relying on peculiarities of the classes to be able to face every situation. On the front of the classes there is a good choice, with the player who can change it at will as in a normal FPS, choosing between the traditional Doctor who can resurrect and heal his companions; the Engineer, vital for repairing vehicles and equipped with a self-propelled turret; the Soldier, equipped with a jetpack; the Heavy Soldier, sturdier and capable of missile launchers; the Infiltrator, equipped with a camouflage module and sniper rifle; and finally the Max, a very powerful android, available only in certain circumstances, generated by mixing living tissue and mechanical prostheses. The right composition is essential to conquer the large strongholds that require long and exhausting battles to be torn from the opposing faction. In reality, the mechanism is very simple: there are so many players in vast maps that once you have conquered an objective, you risk losing another one, precisely because it is left uncovered, or of not being able to stop the counter-offensive by giving up the outpost you just obtained again. Troop movements on the huge playing field give rise to new skirmishes and firefights even in seemingly uninteresting places, just because you are moving in opposite directions with your platoon and find yourself face to face with the enemy in the middle of nowhere. In this sense, partly justified by the vastness of the maps and partly to give greater depth to the gameplay, the means play a fundamental role. The handy quads leave the infantry free to move quickly to move from one engagement to another, while the troop transport has the advantage of becoming a spawn point and the tanks are essential to weaken the enemy defenses before the infantry charge. The tactical value of these means is very important, given that without the right support it is difficult to overwhelm the enemy who can count on safe and close rebirth points. Here too we had to work a little before gaining the right confidence behind the wheel, given the lack of an adequate tutorial. Despite the beauty of the battle, the merit of the involvement goes to the technical department which, although it does not settle at 60 frames per second as on PC, maintains the detail of the textures, the quality of the polygonal models and a large quantity of effects, both as regards weapons and means, and for the suggestive views of Auraxis. The disputed planet is divided into more or less large areas, visually very different from each other: the scorching sun of Indar alternates with the frost of Esamir, while on Amerish and Hossin a luxuriant and uncontaminated nature makes a fine show. As mentioned at the beginning, Planetside 2 is free to play, in the true sense of the word since to play it on PlayStation 4 you don't even need a Plus subscription. However, the economic model is once again not very permissive, forcing the player and spend real money to gain experience faster and be able to afford new weapons and equipment that would otherwise require a lot, perhaps too much, time and dedication to be conquered.", "date": "2015-07-06", "grade": "8.3"}
