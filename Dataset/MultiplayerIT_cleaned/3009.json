It is an autonomous expansion where all the ideas that didn't find space in the original game or that came to the authors after the development was completed. We are facing the classic proliferation effect, with the success that has led to the multiplication of the variants of the basic formula up to its extreme consequences. In a certain sense Mind Control Delete is a pure video game, where Superhot lent its mechanics to narration, however hallucinated. From this point of view it is less incisive than its predecessor, because it deliberately chooses to marginalize the profound meaning of what happens on the screen (or to put it back in its place, to be more radical), to become a pure amusement park. If we want, we are conceptually faced with a kind of Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions, which answered a fundamental question born from the basic title: we have a complete game system, how can we exploit it? Well, philosophy aside, how could Superhot's hilarious mechanics be exploited? Gameplay But what is Superhot: Mind Control Delete? Basically we are faced with a long collection of missions that exploit the core mechanics of Superhot in every possible way, thinking about it. As you know, Superhot is a first-person shooter in which the movement of the enemies (and their projectiles) is linked to that of the protagonist: when he is still, time passes very slowly, and then flows at normal speed when movements are made (movements , attacks, and item picking). The gameplay is made up of micro-sequences lasting a few minutes, sometimes lasting a few seconds, in which you have to survive the aggression of a certain amount of enemies, eliminating the required number. However, the construction of the missions of Mind Control Delete is very different from that of Superhot, despite the apparent similarities. Where the original title built the shootings as if they were puzzles, thus asking the player to find a way to solve them, while leaving him a good margin of personal initiative, here the action is cleaner, i.e. the player certainly has more space. but at the same time less interesting situations are created because the direction deliberately chooses to put itself in a more secluded position, in a certain sense weaker. To achieve this, the developers have made greater use of the use of randomly generated content, in particular the generation of enemies and the position of some weapons, as well as the addition of some upgrades that can be unlocked by overcoming the various levels, which once activated greatly alter the gameplay, opening it up to new strategies. In this way they have been able to offer more content (about three times Superhot), but inevitably some of them are more frayed, almost insignificant. Style Where Superhot: Mind Control Delete is perfectly in line with its predecessor is in the graphic style, almost identical to the original. Then we have the same red low-poly enemies that explode into shards when hit, as if they were made of crystal, and very similar weapons and architecture. There is certainly more variety and the graphics have taken a few more liberties in building the levels, but the overall feeling is the same. The same goes for the soundtrack which exploits the same effects and pursues the same underlying rhetoric, with constant references to the meta-videogame nature of what we are doing. If we like, this is also the main problem of the entire work, which constantly refers to its origin, resulting in a kind of gregarious game from a purely philosophical point of view. Those who have appreciated the mechanics of Superhot will surely like it... because it's made for them. As also underlined by some narrative moments (which are unlocked between the various missions and go to compose a supporting story of the original one), which invite us to stop and ask us if we haven't had enough yet, basically treating us like addicts (probably is the most successful part of the experience), Mind Control Delete answers the plea ~give me more, please~. You know those who can't stop in front of a buffet and eat until they feel sick? Well, let's say this standalone expansion is made for them. It's not ugly, far from it, but leave some time as it finds. It simply lacks the genius and surprise of the progenitor.", "date": "2020-07-09", "grade": "8.0"}
