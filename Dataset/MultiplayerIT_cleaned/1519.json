{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-3.html", "text": "What and how many are the new features in Pes 3? Very many, and all of considerable thickness. The first that catches the eye is probably the new ~shop~ mode which allows, thanks to the points acquired after winning a competition or completing the training mode, to unlock additional features such as new choirs, free transfers, teams and hidden players or choose whether to double the game speed, in order to make the title even more frenetic and fast. Glimpsing through the various menus, you immediately notice how there is news in every sector. For example, the edit section has reached unprecedented heights of completeness in this version, allowing you to customize every smallest aspect of the teams and players to your liking. The real fulcrum of the single player mode, or the master league, has undergone the same excellent treatment: the teams that it will be possible to choose have reached the remarkable figure of sixty, divided into four main leagues which are in turn divided into sub-divisions, based on the rule of promotion and relegation. To top it all off there is a league played between the best formations (and accessible only after obtaining a prominent position in the first division) and the Wefa Cup, which can easily be compared to the Champion's League. The management of transfers, the signing of players and the team's balance sheet play an increasingly important role in this version, and the considerable amount of options and statistics present do nothing but make this mode complete and long-lived. Finally, the training section has undergone an increase in the modes present and the options available, thus becoming a good school for novice players, but also for veterans of the series, thanks to challenges of progressive difficulty for each type of training. Pes Vs Winning Eleven The most inveterate lovers of Konami football simulation will surely have had the opportunity to try Winning Eleven 7, the latest incarnation of this series for the Japanese market. A comparison between the two titles is therefore a must, as interesting. Technically the two games are practically identical, the only differences in fact reside in the slightly slimmer footballers in Pes 3 and in a slightly higher graphic cleanliness for Winning Eleven 7, which can also boast a better audio sector. The game mechanics, on the other hand, are different: Pes 3, by virtue of greater speed, is directed towards a more immediate and probably more spectacular action. Winning Eleven 7, for its part, allows for greater technicality and realism, probably indicated for long-time players of the series and more oriented towards simulation. Overall we are faced with two heavyweights as regards football simulations, and the preferences for one or the other title fall into the subjective sphere at this point. A wonderful football tribe Everything said up to this point is only a premise for what interests Pro Evolution players most, or how to play the title. Well, Konami has finally given European players back a version of its football series that looks good compared to its Japanese counterpart: the fluidity of the players' movements on the pitch borders on perfection and the animations introduced are of excellent workmanship. The latter will not only have a scenographic purpose, but will prove to be very useful on more than one occasion to get the better of the opponents, whether they are human or controlled by artificial intelligence. For example, the ~veronica~ can be mentioned, which can be performed by rotating the right analog stick, which if performed with the right timing will allow you to easily overcome your opponent. Pro Evolution Soccer 3 therefore plays very well, starting with the variety of actions that it will be possible to embark on during the game, to the multiplicity of offensive solutions that we will be able to use, up to the game mechanics, perhaps only a bit unbalanced due to the speed of the action, quite frenetic but not confusing. The management of aerial play seems to have reached a perfect balance between spectacularity and realism in this version, just as the behavior of the players controlled by the CPU appears impeccable most of the time, even if it sometimes happens that the defenders tend too easily to double, leaving some nerve areas of the defense uncovered. A lot of attention has been paid by Konami to reflect the values of the players compared to their real-life counterparts: while the mosttechnically gifted they will have minimal difficulties in executing dribbles, stops or particular feints, the same thing cannot be said for the others. This particular aspect will ensure that each team has weak points and strongest sectors, forcing the player to adopt different tactics during the course of the match, in relation to the ball carrier. As far as the game is concerned, two pleasant novelties are the possibility of accessing the replay at any moment of the game and the introduction of hand ball, which adds a further touch of realism to the games. The reproduction of the players on the field is very faithful to reality, and, especially for the most representative players, the similarities with the real counterparts are very marked; the 60hz also give a decisive boost as regards the fluidity and naturalness of the players on the pitch. The only negative notes reside in a fairly marked shimmering in some stadiums and above all in the persistent lack of referee and linesman on the field and in the realization of the spectators, which are reduced once again to textures squashed on two-dimensional sprites. The commentary of the match is entrusted this time to the De Capitani-Tecca duo, who, despite producing superior results to the previous chapter, return an audio sector that is still not up to par with the rest of the game, above all in terms of expressiveness and synchronism with what is happening on the playing field (it will often happen that the comments are unrelated to what actually happens during the game). It should be noted that curiously in the version distributed in Italy of the game there is only the text and the commentary in our language, while for the remaining European ones it is necessary to contact the import market. Comment Konami seems to have finally noticed the European players and with Pro Evolution Soccer 3 has packaged the best football simulation ever appeared for the Pal market. Pes 3 is fun, enjoyable, spectacular at the right point, perhaps a bit too fast and therefore less technical. But they are trifles for a title that demonstrates obsessive attention to every single detail: long-lived and satisfying in single player thanks to the master league, overflowing in multiplayer, where the challenge against other human characters offers far superior fun to computer-controlled players . Absolutely recommended, therefore.N.B. In addition to the review, we have packed a 15 minute live video of the game for you and a playable demo on PC is also available! Pros: 60hz, fluidity and excellent animations Numerous game options The best football game available for the Pal market Cons: Squads not always updated with the latest transfers Slight glitches in the game mechanics While Japanese players are inundated with three versions of their favorite football simulation every year, European football fans have only one fixed appointment on the calendar, which falls punctually in the autumn period. Pro Evolution Soccer 3 (henceforth Pes 3) therefore arrives for the Pal market, aware that even fans of our continent seem to have opened their eyes to which football simulation to buy every year. In its third incarnation, the programmers of the game have fully reacted to the criticisms leveled at the previous games. The important introduction of 60 Hz in fact gives the game a fluidity never achieved before and comparable to the Japanese version, a true point of reference for fans of the series.", "date": "2003-10-27", "grade": null}
