Children of Morta, for example, will be a role-playing game with rogue-like mechanics and these days, so as not to miss anything, Frostp will also arrive on the digital shelves unk, a management software that we literally devoured last week before offering you this review. We started out really confident in the project, given the past titles, but we also approached it with caution since a management system of this type was not exactly in the development team's ropes and a misstep was very likely. To find out how they fared, just keep reading our article. Heart of ice The setting is perhaps not among the most original ever but it is still quite stimulating. We are at the end of the 1800s and the whole world is gripped by a grip of frost that has slowly decimated the population and pushed people to migrate to unknown destinations, in the hope of finding a new Eden from which to start again. Unfortunately, the vision of the world is lost in the narrative, placing the fate of a handful of London citizens solely in the hands of the player, who arrived in the north after crossing the completely frozen oceans. Here a crater seems the perfect place to be able to build a small urban agglomeration to be developed around a central generator, the only source of heat and an indispensable tool for our survival. This imposing machine stands in the center of the camp and it will then be up to you to decide how and what to build around it. The game, as we said, is a fairly classic management game where it will be required to collect the limited resources scattered around the very small map and make thoughtful choices about what to build: the houses are obviously the focal point from which to start, given that they offer shelter to the citizens and they are the only protection useful for making it through the night, but alongside them there will be other buildings with the most disparate functions. While playing Frostpunk there is a constant atmosphere of tension, and the fear that something could go wrong is always around the corner. Coal, an essential raw material to keep the reactor running, is extremely difficult to keep, especially on high difficulties, and you must try to burn it only and exclusively during the coldest days in order to avoid running out of supplies when the storms arrive. It is therefore impossible to sit comfortably in front of your monitor and calmly plan move after move since accidents and the climate will not give you a break, always forcing you to develop your city quickly by making often drastic and immediate decisions. There are dozens and dozens of buildings to choose from, from various types of houses, to places dedicated to food production, to indispensable buildings to be able to start putting your head out of your comfort zone and explore the immense white expanses that surround you. For choices that are never trivial and always to be considered wisely. The heart of the village thus takes on a concentric shape with the inhabitants and the buildings hugging each other as they try to warm up close to the generator, which is often not enough on its own. Frostpunk, to make things much more difficult, involves some interesting variables such as the alternation of day and night (forcing your workers to rest and not produce resources) and whole weeks of snowstorms where the temperature can drop even below 100 degrees, forcing you to burn even more coal to keep homes warm. Precisely one survives, one sends hunters in search of prey and one begins to develop technologies through a particularly well-structured talent tree so as to be ready for increasingly rigid and dark periods, because when the frost arrives, desperation will take over windward and without prospects you will no longer have a world to govern. They seem like words of circumstance but hope is a fundamental element in Frostpunk and shows the willpower of your citizens. Start not feeding the population and they will get discouraged, they will even turn against you until they get to the point where they become completely uncontrollable. To mitigate all these problems can therefore be enactedof laws, which often trade a little general discontent for greater control, but which will almost always also bring a downside. For example, you can make workers work 24-hour shifts during times of crisis, or force children to gather resources and become part of the machine, or let them stay safe and only help engineers and doctors with light jobs. And one could also just juggle moral choices if it weren't for the fact that at a certain point in your growth you will also have to deal with the Londiners, rebellious determined to abandon the city under your command to return to what remains of London, just to further complicate the situation. Then come other choices to make, pursuing a rigid military path of order and command or relying on the spirituality of the citizens in order to create a united and cohesive group that can even reverse the trend and convince others to stay. Then there are choices between morality and medicine concerning amputations and burials, even the use of mechanical parts and organ transplants in the last stages of the game: increasingly in-depth levels of complexity with which it is extremely fun to play and deal with , perhaps reliving the same scenarios over and over again only to find or follow alternative solutions. Moral choices that lead you to think beyond the simple barrier of the video game, an element of great importance and, fortunately, increasingly common in modern titles. Here, however, we come to the weakest part of this Frostpunk and that is the very limited number of scenarios available: only three at the moment, with a coming soon which should guarantee the arrival of other missions in the future. In addition to having to build a city and survive the worst storm ever, with all the necessary slides to manage the difficulty and the amount of resources available, there are also missions where you can protect and preserve some seeds or check the continuous arrival of other lost groups , which could wreak havoc on your delicate safe toy. A big limitation on replayability is also the non-procedural nature of the map which always places resources and places of interest in the same place, a choice that unfortunately castrates the desire to take back a new nucleus of adventurers after the first game. However, nothing that seriously undermines the very high quality of this strategy which remains in all respects a small pearl, a must try if you like the genre. It would also be a shame not to reward a production that not only tries to invent something new but which reveals a truly obsessive attention to detail. The various generators give off heat and melt snow in areas of the map under their control, while workers leave footprints and trace paths as they walk through the white blanket, only to see it covered the next morning after a heavy overnight snowfall. The interface is also excellent, really intuitive and full of tooltips to quickly learn how to govern your village, adorned by ice crystals around the camera when the temperature reaches prohibitive values. Finally, it is the particularly catchy soundtrack that leaves a magnificent memory of this experience, capable of accompanying you for all the various hours that this title will be able to give you.", "date": "2018-04-23", "grade": "8.0"}
