{"name": "LEGO Star Wars II: La Trilogia Classica", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lego-star-wars-ii-la-trilogia-classica_a.html", "text": "First impact Promoted the choice to rebuild the three original episodes with bricks, we just have to take a look at the game. The first impact is excellent, the animated sequences are shot respecting the canons of the series despite the protagonists being apparently not very expressive toys. But this charges the title with an unparalleled ironic vein and leads us to compare the naked lego characters, whose movements parody the original heroes, with their cinematic counterparts. ~Because my ally is the Force. And a mighty ally it is.~ First impact Returning to the practical elements, it is good to specify that to unlock the subsequent episodes it is necessary to finish the first chapter which, obviously, starts from Mos Eisley. In the smuggling capital, Obi Uan must prance and swing with his lightsaber as if he were twenty years younger, while at his side Luke, armed with a blaster, takes care of eliminating enemies from a distance. Without a doubt, the Force is always the true protagonist capable of broadening the horizons of every game related to Star Wars and also in this case jumping, moving, throwing and pushing are something more than simple verbs. ~Because my ally is the Force. And a mighty ally it is.~ Joda said it and it is what those who try their hand at making a game related to Star Wars must often think, because the force allows a shooter or a classic action game to become a puzzle game or a platform without too many frills and The Original Trilogy exploits this possibility to the bone. Compact trilogy Similar to the first chapter in the Lego Star Wars II structure, it expands considerably both in terms of game possibilities and in terms of longevity, dropping us into all the famous sequences of the three episodes. The small group of characters that gradually follow us, and that we can use by moving from one to another in the middle of the action, acquires a series of unprecedented possibilities. In the first place, not only can the Jedi reassemble mechanisms and objects to be used to progress and to reach particular places it will be necessary to carefully use both the droids and the apparently secondary characters such as the hairy Ewoks, skilled in entering the smallest crevices. The action is frenetic and assisted with tricks such as self-dodging and a simple and instantaneous lock system, so everything is fine even if the blaster in certain situations proves to be a weapon that is far too precise and lethal enough to make the Jedi a simple tool to have fun jumping and slashing, or a mere key to unlock passages and mechanisms that allow us to advance through the level. At least this happens in the larger spaces which are numerous but are certainly not a reason for regret since they transport us directly into the atmospheres of the film, from the large hangars of the Death Star to the wooded lands of Endor. Returning to the peculiarities of the characters, it is fun to note the additions drawn directly from the entire film saga. Chewbacca, without needing to lose at any board game, rips off his opponents' arms, Han and Leia are equipped with a grappling hook gun and R2D2 (C1-P8 for us) acquires the ability to glide on the ground for short distances, an added element by Lucas in the new trilogy. Chewbacca, without needing to lose at any board game, rips off opponents' arms In some moments it becomes necessary to find a disguise, or rather a comfortable helmet dispenser, which allows our characters to pass through controlled doors in the case of storm troopers or launch the infamous thermal detonators in the case of bounty hunters. Finding disguises is pretty easy, the hardest part is keeping them considering that one blast from an enemy blaster is enough to destroy them. The number of vehicles also increases, including animal mounts, and it is also possible to activate the famous imperial walkers with which to cheerfully devastate the ranks of stormtroopers that pour into the screen in full Lemmings style. To complete the work we think the action scenes related to the most famous vehicles of the saga, such as the A-Wing that knocks down the walkers on Hoth or the speeder bike launched at breakneck speed on the forest moon of Endor. Rich dish The Classic Trilogy has a veritable world of extras. Some secrets are hidden in the game, others can be found by replaying levels in Free Mode, a mode that allows you to choose different characters to explore a given level. Still other secrets, and attached extras such as the tool that allows you to build custom characters, can be bought with points or unlocked by collecting particular objects and further expand the game with timed missions, objective missions, collectible objectsectionaries and bonuses of all sorts. At any time, a second player can join the game and help us. Rich dish At any time, a second player can join the game and help us. The cooperative allows us to more easily evade the devices to be operated simultaneously and to make the game action spectacular, as well as obviously allowing us to play with a friend, but it does not introduce any new features and above all it is not an online accessible mode, which, to use a clich but indicative, it's a real shame, especially for those who have a Microsoft console and a Live subscription. Rich dish Aesthetically functional, with irony If there is one element that rarely disappoints in a Star Wars game it is the audio and The Classic Trilogy is no exception. From Williams' soundtrack to the sampling, everything fits together and is used in the best way. The dialogues are missing and are replaced by moans whose tone is adapted to the original joke, and even in this case every fan will think of the original joke without however nullifying the humorous tone of the scene they are witnessing. In fact, the addition of comic expressions on characters such as Darth Vader fits well with the visual tenor of the game and despite this, the title never loses its link with the Star Wars universe even if the costumes are often represented only by simple details such as a cloak or helmet. The graphics, as I like to say in these cases, are functional. The characters look like authentic Lego and the environments, despite being spartan, contain all the elements necessary to recreate the cinematic settings. The 360 and PC versions, provided you have a latest generation graphics card, obviously benefit from particle effects and reflections in quantity, as well as obviously being able to be played at higher resolution, an element capable of improving non-optimal textures and making the title cleaner and more pleasant to look at. Despite the rougher look Lego Star Wars 2 does not lose significant elements on any platform and is widely enjoyable, and above all fluid, in all its incarnations. Cross-platform As mentioned in the review, LEGO Star Wars II is absolutely enjoyable in all published versions. Clearly, the Xbox 360 and PC versions, if equipped with the latest generation graphics card, are the most satisfying. The cleaning and definition of the textures that cover the bricks go to build a really pleasant whole Goals 360 By completing the bar at the top of the screen, collecting all the minikits scattered throughout the game and completing the levels, you get golden bricks whose total amounts to 99 and which gradually unlock extra modes to be tackled to get more bricks and finally visit Lego City and forget about any financial problems. The extra modes are: Super Story Mode which requires you to complete an Episode in under an hour, Time Trial and a series of Bounty Hunter missions. Other content is unlocked as you progress through the game and must then be purchased using ~money~ collected by playing. There are almost 50 unlockable characters, supported by imperial vehicles such as the Tie Fighter or the Tie Interceptor and everything is seasoned with the editor that allows you to assemble new characters using all the parts made available by our progress. Comment Lego Star Wars II is finished in just over six hours, even played in total relaxation, and it is an all too easy title once you have mastered the characters and found the right compromise with the semi-fixed camera which sometimes represents a significant obstacle. On the other hand it is the entire universe represented in the first Star War trilogy, extras included, and this is a much greater merit. Puzzle game, action, platform and film adaptation are combined in a single product that can be played and replayed over and over again thanks to the incredible number of extras. Recommended to everyone. Pros: very faithful to the trilogy full of extras of all sorts varied gameplay full of ideas Cons: extremely simple the semi-fixed camera is often annoying Talking about the Star Wars plot is like talking about the lemonade recipe. Who does not know the deeds of the brave Luke Skywalker? The son of the dark Anakin, a great star pilot, at least according to those who measured themselves against our adaptation. Equally famous are Lego, the bricks with which every privileged Western child has built his little worlds and with which many enthusiasts continue to make real collector's items. One of the most famous brands linked to the colored brick par excellence is precisely the Lego Star Wars and the older ones will surely remember that, after the end of the phenomenon and the rivers of gadgets, it was Lego that brought X-Wing and lightsabers back into children's homes. It is therefore a tested combination that probably finds its most fertile ground in the old trilogy rather than in the spectacular causticity of the last three episodes.", "date": "2006-09-21", "grade": null}
