A year and a half after the release of the latter, here comes the third episode, officially announced during the last Apple keynote precisely to show the graphic capabilities of the new iPhone models: if however it was obvious to expect an evolution technique for a series that has always pressed its hand on its aesthetic opulence, on the other hand some innovation in terms of gameplay was also desirable, which has remained substantially unchanged from the first episode. So let's see if Infinity Blade III manages to amaze beyond its visual appearance ... One swipe will bury you An even pleasant animated introduction struggles to shed light on the plot of Infinity Blade III, destined to leave all those who have not had the opportunity to read the novels inspired by the series dumbfounded: an aspect that is not exactly pleasant, even if the story plays a truly marginal role for a game whose focus remains on taking down gigantic monsters in white weapon duels. From this point of view, little or nothing has changed compared to the previous chapters, with a combat system that allows you to dodge or parry the blows of the enemy by acting on the virtual keys placed on the lower part of the screen, while swiping with your finger in the direction right it is possible to repel the opponent's blows with one of your own: stunned the antagonist with particularly effective defensive actions, it is time to go on the attack always performing swipes, preferably combining them in combos that differ according to the type of weapon used . We are therefore from the parts of the more classic ~winning team does not change~, for a formula that Chair did not want to distort: it is difficult to blame the US software house, both for the young age of the brand, and for the simple fact that the gameplay of Infinity Blade III still works remarkably well. On the other hand, room for maneuver was widely available in the field of boundary elements, an opportunity exploited in various respects even if indeed with fluctuating results. To begin with, there is no longer a single setting to be explored repeatedly as in the first two chapters, replaced by a mission structure set in different scenarios, which can be selected from a map (from which you can also access challenges and Clash Mobs) and which can be tackled by the two main protagonists Siris and Isa. The value of greater variety is contrasted by the small size and linearity of the levels, devoid of many of the forks that made exploration in the second episode stimulating. Even the fact of having two playable characters is a less positive element than it might seem: the differences in terms of behavior in battle are minimal, with the experience being watered down by giving the user the task of managing two different equipment and to produce unexciting backtracking sessions to repeat a mission with the other protagonist in order to reach treasures and rooms accessible only to one of the two. The appreciable variable of a huge dragon that appears randomly and which must be chased away using quick time event mechanics contributes to reviving the situation a little, but it is certainly not an element capable of affecting the gameplay too much. Infinity Blade III puts a lot of irons in the fire, but some of the new introductions are not fully convincing More is less An appreciable work has instead been done as regards the evolution of the characters, with the experience points which this time not only increase the four main statistics (health, attack, shield and magic) but at certain intervals they also unlock special abilities that expand slightly gameplay, such as the ability to take advantage of custom combos for each weapon other than the standard ones. Other novelties concern the services offered by the refuge island which serves as the base of operations for Siris and Isa: you can create potions by mixing the ingredients collected during the missions, upgrade your weapons and even receive the occasional visits from a merchant who brings with him equipment - often rare - heavily discounted compared to the base price. Too bad that Chair has fallen into the temptation to stuff the title with invitations to in-app purchases that would have been appropriate in a free to play product rather than in a game sold for 5.99 Euros: therefore the time necessary for the alchemist and to the blacksmith to do their duty can be reset by spending tokens, inalso dispensable to purchase potions, keys and all those objects that go beyond the standard equipment. This currency is given extremely sparingly upon completing certain game objectives, and those who want more are forced to put their wallets in their hands. It must be said that Infinity Blade III can be completed easily without spending anything, but it is difficult not to turn up one's nose at a choice of developers which frankly did not really feel the need. One even gets the impression that the level of difficulty of the adventure has been deliberately unbalanced to entice the purchase of extra content: if in fact the standard opponents during the missions offer a mild challenge after all, the various bosses show off a superiority right up to the too marked that forces the user to have to retrace his steps to scrape together money and experience points or to spend the precious tokens to obtain objects capable of turning the tide of battle. In short, if in terms of gameplay Infinity Blade III represents an evolution that raises more than a few perplexities, from a graphic point of view there is very little to object to the Epic production. Especially on the most advanced hardware of the Apple stable, the title showcases settings with attention to the smallest detail, impeccably animated large monsters, excellent lighting effects and incredibly defined textures, once again raising the bar of visual quality achievable on the iPhone and iPads.", "date": "2013-09-23", "grade": "8.2"}
