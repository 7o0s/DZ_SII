This peremptory, decisive sentence welcomes us into the game world imagined by the two Brazilian boys from Long Hat House, the producers of the title. Their passion, after two recent small masterpieces such as Iconoclasts and Celeste, remind us that metroidvania and pixel art still have so much to offer. But Dandara is not only the protagonist of the homonymous title published by Raw Fury. He is also (or rather, was) something of a legendary figure of colonial-era Brazil. It seems that he protected some fugitive slaves from the fierce masters, fighting with the techniques of capoeira. A figure perhaps more legendary than real, but in every legend there is a pinch of truth, right? This premise helps to immerse yourself even more in the fascinating world of Dandara. And this time we talk about the actual video game. I'm looking for a permanent center of gravity The world hosting Dandara's actions is difficult to define. It's called Salt, and it's a universe in suspension, organized according to its own laws of gravity. A universe with a fascinating lore, which leaves almost all the understanding of the game events and knowledge of past events to the player, who must interpret everything by observing what takes place before his eyes. It is he who has to pull together the strings of Dandara's actions, to find meaning in them. It is a fascinating operation, which concerns a world now empty, collapsing, on the precipice of Oblivion. The forces of the Eldarians have invaded the Salt, the population is scattered, hiding almost everywhere. The ancient cosmic forces that protected him have been defeated, and he has fallen asleep. But before the Salt ceases to exist a heroine is born from the Cradle of Creation, and brings with it the light of hope: it is Dandara. In what looks like an excellent metroidvania, while sharing many mechanics with action-platformers and even respectable environmental puzzles, Dandara will have to explore all the territories of the Salt, up to the front line of the Eldarian forces. The entire production revolves around the concept of gravity, and this is the element that distinguishes Dandara from all the other metroidvanias, making it immediately recognizable. The various areas of the map are able to ~rotate~ according to a precise logic but independent of the actions of the player, who will simply have to be able to orient himself. At times it seems like a desperate undertaking. Dandara is not able to move linearly, as in almost all related titles. Instead, it is able to jump between one platform and another: it is up to us to draw an imaginary line between the current platform and the next, so that the heroine can get there safely, without colliding with the many enemies at screen or with natural obstacles. On Nintendo Switch the touch controls make the mechanics even more intuitive, which in any case is perfectly functional elsewhere too. Furthermore, the vibration of the Joy Cons returns a perfectly fitting feedback with the situations. If the Salt has lost its permanent center of gravity, Dandara must restore it. Jumping from platform to platform, eliminating enemies along the way with small waves of energy, which can be charged up to be more powerful and reach further, and recovering health along the way by using Essences. But Dandara is also a very difficult title, which must be faced with due lucidity, on pain of immediate death and the inability to continue beyond the first macro-area of the game. Enemies, to begin with, are much tougher than us. Dandara's health is limited, and to upgrade it we will have to collect Salt, the game currency, released by enemies or by (a few) destructible objects scattered around the scenarios. That's not all: the progress of the game is saved only when we arrive at a camp, a small tent where Dandara can rest. There are very few of them around, almost always at the entrance to a new, unexplored area. This is also the only place where the protagonist can be upgraded, at rather high prices. The beauty of oblivion Dandara is a title that knows how to offer an interesting difficulty, without ever being really frustrating. This is certainly an advantage, but there are others worthy of note. The progression system, for example, is that of an excellent metroidvania, where nothing, not even the smallest element is left to chance. If at a certain point it is impossible to continue, you probably have not noticed a detail placed by the developers just before, or you are missing an upgrade to look for somewhere else. If you are venturing into a new area, for which you are not yet ready, you will understand immediately because the enemies will tear you apart without stopping.ability to defend yourself. There are several power-ups to collect: an energy rocket launcher to knock down some solid surfaces, an ancient amulet to activate entire areas slumbering in the Oblivion, and more. It is important to note that every detail is justified by what turns out to be a dreamlike and fairy-tale context, which has left us fascinated. From time to time the title offers the best of its level design and ideas thanks to the boss fights. They are ancient and mammoth beings that will be knocked down according to a precise strategy, and will require more than one attempt to be defeated. Very often they completely alter the playing area they have known up to that moment, leaving the player bewildered but also incredibly satisfied with the heights reached by the gameplay. The same satisfaction that is linked to the discovery of a particular chest hidden in a specific point of the levels, which at first glance seemed totally unreachable. But no one is perfect, not even Dandara. And the mechanics responsible for level rotation are certainly not: when we are continuing inside it, the modification leaves the player completely bewildered, above all because it does not find correspondence with the actual layout shown by the game map, which instead remains unchanged. In this way, very often, we don't understand exactly where we need to go, or how to reach certain points, even when we've already done everything we had to do. It must also be said that the pixel art of Long Hat House is of excellent quality, only from time to time you notice some detail that could have been perfected, or that in any case has received a lower level of care. Of course, some of the areas are clearly a confusing filler full of enemies, to connect areas of far greater importance to each other. But they are still secondary details, we have reported them as a duty: they never risk ruining the gaming experience.", "date": "2018-02-10", "grade": "8.0"}
