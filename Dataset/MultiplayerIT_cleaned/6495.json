While not shining for its originality, the title produced by Bethesda and developed by Tango Gameworks, i.e. Shinji Mikami's team, managed to conquer the public thanks to an adventure characterized by a flowing story and gameplay still capable of meet the needs of fans. Now Resident Evil's father has no intention of stopping, and after about six months he gives us the opportunity to return to his ~Hell~ thanks to the first of the three DLCs programmed for his creature. Titled The Assignment, the additional content substantially expands on the original game by offering the gamer a view of some of its events from a different perspective, thanks to a ~new~ protagonist and some different scenarios. Avoiding getting caught up in too many spoilers, let's just say that the plot revolves around the ambiguous detective Juli Kidman, and tries to give some answers to some outstanding questions regarding the events of Sebastian, Ruvik and Mobius. Obviously, it will also generate other questions, but these will then be addressed in the next final DLC, that is The Evil Within: The Consequence. With The Assignment we return to the nightmare born of Shinji Mikami in the role of detective Kidman Darkness as an ally As in The Evil Within, the atmosphere is disturbing and there is a sense of restlessness and absolute abandonment, threatened by the looming figures of monstrous creatures that stir in the shadows. Step by step the protagonist seems to become almost the heroine of a black fairy tale, swallowed up in the bowels of a dark and disturbing reality. If anything, what changes compared to the original is the general layout of the gameplay, which while maintaining the commands and other aspects unchanged, here is more stylistically focused on the stealth and puzzle components, with very few action phases. Proof of this is the fact that Kidman lacks the armory, strength and physical skills in close combat of Sebastian Castellanos, and must therefore resort to cunning to overcome obstacles. In practical terms this translates into the need to act stealthily, studying the movements of the enemies and outflanking them, often in the dark after turning off the supplied flashlight, taking advantage of the air ducts or occasional covers. Sometimes it is also necessary to remove them from the points that you want to overcome with tricks. These range from the simple throwing of the classic empty bottles in an area far from the one where the protagonist is hidden, to vocal calls to be made with the square button of the pad, to traps and other expedients, such as the ringing of a telephone to attract the attention of creatures in another clearing. When possible, you can also try to lock them up in a room, grab them from behind or take advantage of some elements of the scenario to eliminate them, but always paying close attention, because in the event of a mistake it can then become complicated to get over the fight, and you can die in a flash. And it is precisely in this aspect that, in our opinion, the truly survival essence and beauty of this DLC reside: the fact of having to act like a normal person, committed to resisting creatures beyond any imagination, the feeling of constant danger amplified by the lack of resources to be able to adequately defend oneself in the event of combat, and the need to keep one's ears and eyes alert to any abnormal sounds or movements that could signal the presence of potential danger or betray Juli's presence, are all tension-inducing elements and totally immerse the player in the adventure. In this sense, a valuable contribution is given by the excellent graphics sector, which once again manages to fully restore all the disturbing atmosphere of the universe created by Mikami, and the sound one. In the first case, in addition to a slightly higher set of textures than that of the original game, which especially embellishes the areas to explore, the design of the environments once again stands out, perfectly fitting for the type of story, then the particle effects and the skilful games of light and shadow. The drawing of the monsters is also beautiful, in particular that of a new enemy that we do not want to anticipate. While in the second, the speech in Italian is good and the audio effects are excellent with a whole series of grunts, terrifying sighs, more or less natural noises and anything else that can be used to put the right anxiety on the gamer. The soundtrack operates in the same way, capable of adequately accompanying the various moments of the story, especially those of greater narrative tension. In short, we liked The Assignment: the story che narrates smoothly, delves into some themes of The Evil Within and as mentioned at the beginning lays the foundations for the next DLC, the gameplay offers a good level of challenge and empathy, and the technical sector is excellent. The only flaw, perhaps, is its overall duration in relation to the cost of the package. We completed the campaign in about four hours, but it's likely that we could finish a little sooner if you avoid scouring the game areas thoroughly and don't try to unlock some trophies or recover all the collectibles and game files. text, or a little later if you decide to play on a higher difficulty level than normal.", "date": "2015-03-13", "grade": null}
