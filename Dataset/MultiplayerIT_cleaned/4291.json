Brew Town represents a rather honest proposal and manages to stand out in the mass of management, simulations and city builders for being based on a rather original idea than usual. It's not about growing civilizations or populations, nor about managing themed cities with successful animation or television series, but we are simply running a craft beer business. All of us, more or less, have had experience with homebrewing: whether through clumsy attempts to create one's own beer at home (~it's very easy, it takes~ they will have told you), or through the hipster friend who loves to experiment with handcrafted flavors (a bit like The Simpsons' Red Mint beer). You therefore have in mind the conceptual foundations of Brew Town, which combines the production of beer with the need to manage its sale through various channels within an ever-expanding business. There are different phases to follow, from the production of beer to the bottling up to the sale and distribution, which are simplified in a very schematic way through a certain amount of pre-established options but still propose a good stratification of projects and actions to be completed in the course of matches. Furthermore, being a free-to-play, the management of waiting times is a constant throughout the game, and their reduction is the key on which micro-transactions are set. What's better than a beer? Two beers In the map seen from above (with the possibility of zooming in) there are various structures all dedicated to the production and sale of beer, with various possibilities for modification and expansion. It starts from the hop harvest by touching the seeds that appear on the field and then moves on to fermentation, from here to bottling and then to the management of the finished product through various channels. Each step is enriched with various nuances: the production can be divided into various types of beer at different quality levels which can be studied by the laboratory and further improved in certain phases. The real ~brewing~ can take place simultaneously on several parallel structures, the number of which can be expanded through further investments in order to expand the scope and bottling is carried out in a special structure that requires ~corking~ like obsessed on the screen to churn out bottles at maximum speed (except possibly purchasing additional facilities such as the possibility of holding down the key or preparing several bottles at the same time with each touch). The bottles thus produced can be distributed in pre-established shipments according to the requests received at the headquarters, or sold retail in the pub (also subject to various upgrades and modifications) or in special discounts to eliminate inventories and make room in the warehouse (obviously the latter can also be expanded). You can even change the look of the bottles by designing the label with an editor, allowing for impressive results. The chain of actions basically does not change that much as production increases, it is simply a question of optimizing resources by investing the money raised in new parallel structures to increase the quantity or by evolving the various laboratories to improve quality. To vary the action a little, it is possible to tap on some elements that pass on the screen to get extra money and caps, but the setting obviously plays on waiting times and these trigger the usual waltz of micro-transactions. The latter are based on the purchase of caps, or the second in-game currency after money, which is instead earned by playing and can be invested in the purchase or expansion of structures. The caps serve to reduce expectations or obtain advantages in structural terms, such as permanent increases in efficiency in some stages of production and distribution, but it must be said that if you have a minimum of patience it is possible to bypass the whole issue by simply accepting a few minutes of waiting and making the various components of the production chain evolve in a balanced way.", "date": "2018-04-25", "grade": "7.5"}
