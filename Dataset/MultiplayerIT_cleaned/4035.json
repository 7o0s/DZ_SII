{"name": "Disgaea 1 Complete", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disgaea-1-complete-recensione.html", "text": "The release of Disgaea 5 Complete represented a new springboard for the Atlus franchise which, despite continuing for more than ten years, has always been appreciated only by a small niche of players, lovers of strategic RPGs and, above all , of Japanese animation and humor. With the Complete edition, Atlus has therefore also embraced the Switch user and a whole new generation of players who perhaps had not yet discovered the crazy multiverse of Disgaea. A tempting opportunity, therefore, to tread the hand and offer new fans of the series the opportunity to find out how it all began with a Complete version of even the very first episode, dated 2003: at the time it was in fact released on PlayStation 2 and then also converted over the years for systems such as PSP, Nintendo DS and more recently PC. The problem, in fact, is that this Complete version is just another conversion. The story of Laharl and Etna Disgaea was the first chapter of the strategic series signed by Nippon Ichi - which however actually began with the funny La Pucelle: Tactics on PlayStation - to introduce some characters who would later become extras, supporting characters and antagonists. The story revolves around Prince Laharl, heir to the throne of the Netherworld, a dimension where bizarre demons are battling to take the place of the former ruler, Krichevskoy. Laharl awakens from a long sleep in a hostile landscape and decides to take matters into his own hands and defeat every rival to take back his rightful place. To help him there is an army of evil penguins, the Prinny, but also a messy devil, Etna, and a naive angel sent to spy on Laharl, Flonne. It is a trinity that, as we have said, holds a special place in the hearts of fans of the series, but their absurd interactions are the core of the story, a succession of crazy and senseless episodes that only have the pretension of entertaining the player without exploring deep metaphysical meanings. In Disgaea we laugh heartily, but the story is a decidedly secondary aspect and also the additional campaign, introduced in one of the previous conversions and re-proposed here in its entirety, is only an excuse to show off a new series of increasingly complicated missions. Titled Etna Mode, this campaign is unlocked once you finish the game and basically tells the same story, all over again, but from Etna's point of view. Apart from this, unfortunately, the present Complete edition of Disgaea does not include other unpublished contents and also the additional characters that come directly from the other episodes, such as Plenair and Zetta, have been implemented without narrative junctions or missions that justify their presence in this chapter: they are unlocked through the Dark Assembly and are added to Laharl's army without much ceremony, moreover categorized as ~monsters~ and therefore limitedly customizable. A game from fifteen years ago Indeed, one of the main characteristics of Disgaea as a series is the freedom it grants to the player in micromanaging his army of heroes, monsters, freaks and other otherworldly creatures. The progenitor of the franchise inaugurated the tradition of reincarnated units, which reach level 9999 and deliver blows with billions of damage: explaining every detail is almost impossible, but the game is a real riot of statistics, numbers and parameters that must be learned to know and understand. Let's take the worlds contained in the objects, for example: procedural missions that allow you to upgrade weapons and equipment practically infinitely, guaranteeing a longevity that few other strategic players have. Disgaea is in fact a hard and pure tactical RPG; the player directly controls Laharl only in her castle, where she can interact with subjects who offer various services such as shops, refreshment points and so on. A portal allows us to undertake the new missions of the campaign, comfortably divided into episodes like a sort of cartoon, while another NPC makes us bring together the aforementioned Dark Assembly, or a committee of demons who will have to decide whether or not to satisfy our requests : in these cases it may be useful to bribe the members of the assembly or inflate them with blows to convince them to vote in our favour, thus unlocking new functions and bonuses. The fights therefore take place in isometric maps and the player, once his units have been deployed, can move them one at a time during his turn. Unlike many other strategic, however, in this case it is possible to choose whether to make the individual units act immediately or whether to wait for the end of the turn, perhaps in order to trigger devastating combined attacks.i involving multiple characters. Every move and every action is based on the parameters of the individual units: a high movement capacity allows you to move in larger spaces and even the weapons change range and area of effect depending on the type, not to mention that they grant special skills and attacks peculiar. All this, on paper, may appear fun and inviting, and indeed it is, but it is also rather archaic and cumbersome: the most recent episodes of Disgaea, such as Disgaea 5 Complete to be precise, have modernized themselves a lot and have clearly improved some game dynamics that were once innovative but are much less so today. The Geo Panel system is a prime example: inaugurated by Disgaea 1, it essentially forces the player to pay attention to the battlefield if influenced by the Geo Symbols that change the colors of the panels, associating advantages and disadvantages that can be manipulated by moving or removing the Symbols themselves, perhaps triggering destructive chain reactions that can affect both enemy and allied units. Although original, this intricate feature has been revised and corrected over the years, while here it is still a little too immature. Because in the end the problem with Disgaea 1 Complete is precisely this: although it is still a valid title, it is still a 2003 game that Atlus has simply repackaged without making any changes or modernizations, if not from a purely technical point of view. The game has remained pretty much the same as the last PC incarnation - which was itself another port - and the developer has simply replaced the old sprites with high-resolution counterparts that show off animations and details in step with the times. It is a restyling that was only partially successful, however, because it only affects the sprites, some illustrations and the menus, but not the vast majority of the maps and related textures, anchored to their PlayStation 2 origins. The work done is, however, quite superficial, given that we noticed some old sprites or grainy particle effects in the pile. Fortunately, this Disgaea 1 is Complete at least in terms of sound, given that it is possible to set the Japanese track to hear the original voice actors hoarse in the most comical scenes.", "date": "2018-10-02", "grade": "7.0"}
