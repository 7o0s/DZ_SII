{"name": "Call of Duty: Mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-mobile-recensione.html", "text": "The Call of Duty: Mobile review comes a few hours after the news that the game has already totaled 20 million downloads between iOS and Android, and frankly it is not surprising: the partnership signed by Activision and Tencent seems to have worked great, giving life to what is probably the best shooter available on mobile for feeling, immediacy and quality of content. Once the game has been launched, the download of which is strictly free, it is possible to try your hand at a tutorial and with a mode designed take the first steps in this experience: a cooperative against soldiers controlled by artificial intelligence. However, those who already know Call of Duty can easily go to the next step and access the competitive multiplayer modes, also divided here between friendly and ranked matches. The latter randomly select the playlist, while in the first case we are given the possibility to choose preferred modes and maps from those present in the package: Front Line, a quick battle between two teams; Team Deathmatch, in which two teams compete to reach a certain score; Domination, territorial mode in which you have to conquer and control circles in the scenario; Search and Destroy, the classic race to see who places and detonates a bomb without the opponents defusing it, reversing roles in turn; and finally the Battle Royale, which leads as many as one hundred players to challenge each other within a large island, with no equipment other than the one found once landed and with the boundaries of the active area gradually shrinking. Maps and options With the exception of Battle Royale, all Call of Duty: Mobile modes have been designed for a total of ten participants and can take place within eight of the most famous (and compact) scenarios ever to appear in the Activision series. Any examples? The iconic Nuketown, with its fictitious urban glimpse for nuclear tests, or Hijacked, which leads us to fight on a large yacht with multiple levels and stakeouts, or Crash, with the remains of a crashed helicopter in the most romantic period of the year. Fans of the franchise will have no trouble recognizing their favorite locations, reproduced on mobile devices in a fairly faithful way and capable of giving life to furious, frenetic and fun firefights. Not in friendly games, however: playing you will soon realize that the rooms are full of inexperienced users to say the least or bots who just sit there getting targeted, making things all too easy for you and allowing for very fast progression towards the experience level needed to unlock all content currently available in the game. In short, classified matches represent an obligatory choice for those who want a consistent challenge, and in fact immediately reveal themselves to be able to offer more multifaceted and demanding situations, with rapid reversals of the face and surprise attacks. Before experimenting with them, however, it will be better to have found the best possible compromise regarding the controls. Control system Activision has removed support for physical controllers from Call of Duty: Mobile, and this is very sad because the game could really allow anyone to try their hand at the experience of the famous shooter quickly and for free. Perhaps the choice was dictated by the impossibility of dividing users who use joypads from those who use touch commands, but perhaps in the future the publisher will retrace his steps. Not that things are going badly at the moment, however: the developers have managed to develop a convincing layout, highly customizable, with two repositionable analog sticks that manage movement and view, as well as the blessed automatic fire option that presses the trigger as soon as we frame an enemy in the aiming reticle. It is possible to deactivate it if you are masochistic or if you have two thumbs in your right hand, but there is really no story: it is an automatism that allows you to concentrate on the movement of the character rather than having to take your finger off the view to shoot, also risking wasting precious ammunition. The malus for those using the autofire consists in a substantially lower damage inflicted when shooting without the iron sight, but this ends up balancing the two alternatives very well. Of course, if you catch someone playing on PC via emulator with mouse and keyboard you will still be dead before you know it. Gameplay, progression and technical realization Adjust the touch controls well (for example by activating the automatic run and modifichanging the sensitivity of the view), Call of Duty: Mobile is surprisingly close to the experience that the shooter Activision offers on PC and console, proposing the more traditional and fun elements, such as perks and killstreaks, which allow you to use UAVs, explosive drones and bombings. The progression is quite rapid during the first hours, dotted with bonuses and unlockables given out with great frequency. You don't feel the need to resort to the inevitable microtransactions, which however can actually be a problem where the upgrades and equipment (rich and with lots of tools and accessories to modify weapons) create a pay-to-win situation . It is possible that some refinement work has been done regarding the matchmaking in order to avoid such situations, and in fact our experience so far testifies to the opposite: you win very easily, even in the Battle Royale mode. clearly more the graphics engine and the result is a lower visual impact than standard maps; but here too nothing seems to have been left to chance, given that you can choose whether to act alone, in pairs or in four, select the first or third person view, get behind the wheel of vehicles and adjust the automatic collection of loot to avoid to embark useless objects and uselessly fill the backpack. An excellent job has also been done on a technical level: on the iPad Pro the game runs smoothly with the settings at maximum, at 60 frames per second, offering a fluid experience without uncertainties. Approaching the assets, you notice jagged shadows and decidedly unclear textures, but in the end we are talking about elements that remain in the background and which, from a distance, do not break the spell that seems to project us into some of the real, iconic Call of maps Duty. The audio sector is full of voices and quality effects and the microphone is supported for voice, automatic or touch-to-talk chat. On the infrastructure front, it must be said that the matchmaking is very fast and it only takes a few moments to find yourself in the game, but there is no shortage of episodes of excessive latency which inevitably end up affecting the reliability of the netcode in certain situations.", "date": "2019-10-04", "grade": "9.0"}
