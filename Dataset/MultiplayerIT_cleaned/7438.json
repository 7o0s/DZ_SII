The common opinion is that the SEGA title - while not reaching the peaks touched by the original - is an honest two-dimensional platform, capable of maintaining a good balance between classic and modern elements and also of guaranteeing a higher level of challenge than the current average . All elements that contribute to making this iOS version developed by SEGA Studios Australia decidedly interesting: let's go, therefore, to see if the illusion retains its charm even on Apple devices. Desperately looking for Minnie In terms of presentation, this new Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse definitely pays homage to its illustrious ancestor, starting with the identical plot: Mickey must therefore rescue Minnie from the clutches of the evil witch Mizrabel, who has kidnapped and locked up in the manor that gives the title to the game. This building also constitutes the freely explorable central hub through which it is possible to access the various levels that make up the adventure, divided into scenarios, each of which ends with a boss fight. With the exception of uninspiring static cutscenes, the visual sector of the product is of excellent quality: compared to the console and PC counterparts, the loss of details, polygons and visual effects is evident, but by iOS standards we are on decidedly high levels . The settings appear accurate and detailed, equipped with lively and suggestive backgrounds and supported by a graphics engine that makes no effort to manage the frequent transitions between purely 2D sections and others in which one moves even in depth; a considerable variety can then be seen both in the scenarios and in the enemies, while the protagonist has undergone more than fair treatment with regards to both the polygonal composition and the quantity and fluidity of the animations. We can therefore say that Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse manages to capture that typical Disney classic feeling, also helped by the excellent work done in the audio department: the beautiful orchestral music is inspired by the original soundtrack (which, moreover, is made available in a special menu), and a convincing narrative voice accompanies Mickey's deeds as he progresses in the adventure. A great presentation is not enough for Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse to become a classic Speaking instead of the playful aspect, Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse fails to behave equally well, without however highlighting huge flaws. The SEGA title can be blamed mainly for being a platform without real treble, which flows away pleasantly without ever really being able to affect, balancing a good level of challenge with a rather short overall duration. With the exception of the aforementioned excursions into the third dimension, the game remains quite faithful to the traditional platform canons, delegating most of the responsibilities to a level design that does its duty but perhaps lacks a little personality. The enjoyment of the experience is also somewhat undermined by a control system that cannot guarantee the same comfort as a physical support, an element that comes to light especially in sections that require that extra touch of precision for jumps or movements: in any case the command setup is appreciable, with a mobile virtual stick placed on the left side of the screen and the jump that can be activated by tapping on any point on the right side, with the only key delegated to throw the apples, the only offensive tool of Mickey Mouse beyond the inevitable ~culata~.", "date": "2013-12-02", "grade": "S.V."}
