{"name": "The Valiant", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-valiant-recensione.html", "text": "We don't see an immeasurable publication of good western strategic games on the market: it's not an easy genre to develop, it requires a lot of experience, a good slice of risk, plus a due awareness of speaking to a demanding audience. The Valiant, developed by KITE Games, a team from Budapest, brings a low fantasy medieval breath to PC and console, without overdoing it, drawing from 13th century European history, with discreet humility, but a certain attention to detail. If it is true that on PC similar situations are quite common, the willingness of the publisher THQ Nordic to adopt a multiplatform approach (except Switch) is surprising for a title that yes, works with the pad, but has a genetic structure from mouse and keyboard. Let's see why in The Valiant review. The valiant Theoderich The Valiant features fun and varied guerrilla battles The plot of The Valiant has its own absolute narrative honesty, the kind of story that doesn't need to bother big situations to engage and excite. Everything revolves around a biblical artefact, Aaron's rod, divided into three parts in antiquity and found in the prologue by Ulderich, close friend and brother in arms of Theoderich, the valiant protagonist. The cause of the events that lead to the unleashing of their fratricidal war is to be found precisely in that piece of rod found in the desert: 15 years after the discovery of the artifact and Theoderich's abandonment of the Templar career, our hero will be forced reluctantly to reform an army, to stop his old battle buddy from finding the remaining pieces and bringing a nefarious power to earth. The rhythm works, it holds the punch between drawn interludes, certainly the most successful, and those with the game engine, the less brilliant, but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Thanks to a credible dubbing and a rather cast of heroes and situations varied, the progress in the 16 missions of the main quest is lived in a crescendo of strategic design ideas. We are not talking about ingenious gimmicks, but about situations that live well in the context of the growth of the story and of the player: there are missions that are a little more stealth, others of liberation, others of finding, others of pure survival in the face of hordes of enemies. The credibility of the plot imagined by the Hungarians, in a mixture of history and fiction, entertained us with ease, without getting bored and even touching parts of Italy that made us smile, such as Ancona, whose medieval port is for the first time in a video game as a battle map. The many teams on the field In The Valiant you will have different teams of fighters to master, each with its own characteristics The gameplay of The Valiant offers strategic management in real time, perfectly enjoyable via pad, in which you can command a maximum number of teams of fighters. Some teams will have a hero as their leader (they can therefore awaken) others not and will therefore be fleshed out with new units, provided that they have conquered a base camp on the map and have the resources. Some team examples: fighters, spearmen, archers, knights and so on: each type of team benefits from bonuses and talents that your reference hero earns with the points that can be spent by leveling up. It doesn't end there: each map gives experience based on the objectives that are achieved, to which are added unique pieces of equipment applicable to the heroes. Even though the skill trees are pretty lean, it's a simple and functional reading and progression system. Mastering this flow is much less simple: the progression of battles is ruthless and already at a normal level it will be necessary to become fully familiar with the characteristics of the heroes, the qualities and weaknesses of each team and the opportunities of the game environment (such as forests , which hide but slow down). Everything stems from a seemingly simple system: resistance, health, vigor and revenge are the four parameters in play. Vigor and vengeance are used respectively to activate the skills and special moves, while health begins to decrease only when the resistance runs out, which however can be regenerated, as a sort of barrier. The many melees in which you will find yourself involved therefore hide a fair multitude of approaches and management: the cavalry is strong in breakthrough, but does not do much damage, while the archers are strong at a distance, but bad if engaged from behind in melee, and etc. Mixing choices and consequences is not easy, also because the enemies proposed by the campaign are always growing, both in number and in tactical intelligence. So don't scourge yourself if, at a certain point, bored by the few resources and many battles, you will unfortunately feel the need to change the level to Easy. Apart from this, however, the missions are well designed: in addition to the variety of approaches and objectives, each map has a correct duration with checkpoints linked to the conquest of fields or objectives. The average we have experienced is about an hour per map, but with an alternating thirst for completion: sometimes we worked hard to find all the objects, others we aimed to run to finish it because we were in bad shape. Surely The Valiant is not a title for everyone, because it also requires you to understand when to strategically retreat and respawn your troops. The game interface is also correct, even with the pad, it is the confusion of the melee that determines the need to learn to read them well, understand who is fighting with whom and whether or not to send the cavalry to fight the archers from a distance. War choices that gas, but which can also lead to defeat. The art of growth The Valiant takes us on a journey through 13th century Europe and the Middle East, also passing through... Ancona The mission of Theoderich and the traveling companions he finds during the journey is dotted with small battles: this is the most fascinating aspect, as it is deliberately far from the great clashes of more high-sounding titles. The guerrilla logic is a factor that amused us, also thanks to an RPG component that is certainly not very deep, but appreciated. The ability to unlock achievements and therefore experience, as well as use the levels to learn new talents and grow a skill tree, is a welcome addition, which provides a series of interpretations to each fight: knowing you can count on new moves , like a type of arrow that blocks or a morale field that spurs the troops, is galvanizing and gradually differentiates tactics, transforming free-for-all into something more cohesive, sensible, administrable by the player. Choosing which heroes to deploy is also an important issue: you won't be able to bring them all, so they must be carefully selected based on the style of play. On the audio front, as mentioned, the team has done a great job of bringing in professional voice actors of various nationalities, conveying the differences between French, German, Italian and Arabic pronunciations well. The technical part is certainly the least demanding in terms of resources, but it does its job: the interlude sequences are certainly more interesting, created with an artistic style that winks at noir comics. For review duty but not testable for obvious reasons, the picture is completed by two multiplayer modes in the formula of team battles and hordes, which in any case add tasty meat to an already excellent broth.", "date": "2022-10-18", "grade": "8.5"}
