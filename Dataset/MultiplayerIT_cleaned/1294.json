Connected to the adapter and then to the USB port, they actually represent the tool intended to give a serious jolt to one's sense of modesty. In fact, using them means moving one's singing performances from the intimacy and secrecy in which they were kept, to the inclement power of one's sound system. This, in fact, represents the only real obstacle to being able to enjoy a fun, well-finished and original game like few others in recent times. Yes, because the work of Studio London truly represents a turning point for the music game genre, destined to reap great success in the single player mode, but literally to explode in the multiplayer one. But let's go in order, starting from the choice of songs which can count on about thirty songs, all obviously more or less marked pop-style: on the other hand, for a game of this type that must be usable by anyone, it is right and sacrosanct that it is. In addition to international artists such as Madonna, the Village People (unmissable), Sugababes, Dido, Jamelia, Pink, Ricky Martin and so on, Sony has wisely decided to add a handful of localized songs for the most important countries. For Italy, the choice fell on Daniele Silvestri with Salir, Paola and Chiara with Vamos a Bailar, Alexia with Egoista, Subsonica with Nuova ossessione and La Differenza with In un istante. An overall squad therefore destined to satisfy anyone, in the true sense of the word. The most immediate method is obviously the one that allows you to choose a song at will and immediately juggle between notes and melodies: each song is accompanied on the screen by its own video clip, with the text to follow at the bottom together with some colored bars capable of indicating the intensity and the correct tonality of the song. Being able to make your voice coincide with the aforementioned bars means singing in the correct way, thus earning the points destined to constitute the final evaluation. The mode just described can be tackled both individually and in pairs: in the latter case, you can opt for cooperation with a single final vote, or for a battle on the edge of the best intonation. In da club But that's not all: solitary singers will in fact be able to embark on a personal musical career, through the appropriate mode designed to transform a budding promise into a true superstar. All this starting from small clubs and venues, in which to perform on a reduced list of previously selected songs, in the hope of ~impressing~ the audience and obtaining as much approval as possible. Step by step, his rise to popularity will pass through ever larger and more prestigious venues, with record deals to sign and singles to launch on the charts. Far from being a simple filler, the Become a Star mode is a real test for your vocal cords, as well as a fun and stimulating incentive to improve your performance. But as in any self-respecting game of the genre, it is in the multiplayer mode that Singstar gives its best: the variety of game possibilities offered is surprising, especially considering that in the end the fulcrum of the game is simply singing. For example, ~Warm up the audience~ requires the player to keep the interest of the spectators high, otherwise the microphone will be transferred to a friend who will have to turn the tide of the situation. Pass the mic on the contrary, as the name suggests, requires each player to sing a fraction of the song, and then pass the hand to his mates: the possibility of playing in teams by dividing people into 2 groups, combined with calling the whole random to the microphone of your friends, represents the ideal ingredients to transform an evening with friends into a real delirium. The picture is completed by the possibility of connecting the EyeToy video camera, to film performances and record short fragments, to be reviewed later. In reality, this faculty, in addition to treading the hand on the moments of true humiliation that it is possible to go through with Singstar, does not represent anything particularly stimulating that makes us lean towards adopting it instead of normal video clips. Comment Singstar is a product of excellent workmanship, extremely accurate from every point of view and offered at an extremely competitive price. But Singstar is above all a bomb of fun, capable of gluing anyone who has even one to the screena minimal interest in music is destined to revolutionize all home evenings with friends or family. And given the overall quality of the final product, it is to be hoped that the Sony production will be able to reap the success it deserves, in order to give the pass to a series of additional discs with new songs and modes. We can not wait. People sing everywhere: in the shower, in the car, in bed, on the street, at work why not make them sing in front of the PS2 too? This must have thought Sony producing Singstar, the effort of the British of Studio London recently arrived on the shelves of all Europe, including Italy. But what is Singstar juice? Basically, it is karaoke evolved and raised to the nth degree, the offspring of that real Japanese craze that is slowly trying to take hold in the West as well.", "date": "2004-06-08", "grade": null}
