{"name": "The Banner Saga 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/167185-the-banner-saga-2-linverno-continua.html", "text": "Looking for The Banner Saga on Metacritic, one certainly cannot remain indifferent to the metascore of 80 that the effort of Stoic Studio can enjoy. The independent team founded by three former BioWare employees has certainly deserved all the fine words spent on its first work from 2014 to today, including those contained in our review where we considered it one of the most interesting turn-based strategy players of the last two years. In reality, since its genesis, The Banner Saga was conceived as a real trilogy, starting with its first chapter from Kickstarter to conquer the PC market, before landing on mobile and finally also on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, where the game arrived at the beginning of 2016. Just in time to allow everyone to catch up before the release of The Banner Saga 2, which took place a few days ago: console and tablet owners will have to wait for the moment, given that the game was only released on PC. We therefore carried out our test of this new adventure on this platform. Stoic Studio successfully brings us back among humans, varls and dredges in The Banner Saga 2: don't miss it! Where were we? Before delving into The Banner Saga 2, we feel compelled to warn anyone reading this review without having played the first chapter. The conception of a sequel that we have today is not applicable in fact to the case of The Banner Saga 2, deeply linked to its predecessor to the point that it could very well be part of a Telltale Games-style episodic publication. We tell you this because talking about The Banner Saga 2 without recalling any element of the previous chapter becomes quite difficult (therefore watch out for spoilers), but above all because the developers themselves demonstrate that they imply the need to have already played the first The Banner Saga before approaching to this new chapter. If desired, among the initial options there would also be an introductory video, but it is still to be seen only as a way to refresh one's memory about the past; without completing The Banner Saga it therefore remains perfectly useless. Having made this premise, let's try to pick up the thread of the story without making too big spoilers: what is told by The Banner Saga 2 picks up exactly where the adventure we experienced two years ago ended, also continuing the numbering in chapters foreseen by the members of Stoic Studio. If you still have it on your PC, at the beginning of this second part the player can import the final save from The Banner Saga, while if not, he can still choose to play one of the two protagonists Alette and Rook. In the case of automatic import, this choice will be linked to the ending obtained from the exciting battle that concluded the previous chapter, while in the case of a manual choice, it can also be seen as a way to continue with a different outcome from the one achieved in 2014. After having officially started, we find ourselves again in the middle of the desperate journey undertaken by the caravan led by the player, destined to save the population from the mysterious threat that is sweeping the whole world. Recall that the latter is populated mainly by three different races: humans, varls and dredges. The varls are a species of giants with long horns and immense strength, once enemies of humans with whom they then allied to fight against the dredge, strange humanoid beings with behaviors that are somewhat reminiscent of both zombies and robots. Precisely as regards the races, The Banner Saga 2 actually offers some interesting news that we will not reveal here so as not to spoil the pleasure of discovery; it is enough for you to know that they do not distort anything that has already been shown to us, but give more breathing space to events that really demonstrate that they touch all the individual parts of the setting developed by Stoic Studio. At this point, it is right to remember the great effort that the developers have made to create a game universe that is as complete as possible. As in the past, the game map assumes more of a descriptive function for names and places, which, like other elements of The Banner Saga, draw mainly from Norse mythology. Once again it is a pity not to be able to further explore the various areas, even if compared to the first episode in this second chapter we find ourselves visiting more heterogeneous areas: between old magical forests, claustrophobic caves and inevitable mountain landscapes, the monotony is a little more distant. As before, more than before If the plot of The Banner Saga 2 picks up exactly from its predecessor, more or less the same thing is donealso from the game mechanics. In fact, the adventure continues to be divided between the part in which you fight and the one in which you carry on the caravan along its exhausting journey. Those who have already played the first chapter will therefore find themselves perfectly at ease with the gameplay, which from the beginning calls them to juggle a series of particularly complex decisions to make. The game does not hesitate to reward us or make us feel guilty for a mistake: for example, if we run out of food while we are travelling, part of those with us will start to starve, thus weighing on our conscience. However, the managerial component is only a small part, given that the life of a boss is full of complicated decisions to be made throughout the day. As far as combat is concerned, it still rests its foundations on the double track composed of life / strength points and armor. The first acts both as a counter for the extent of the wounds that a character can suffer before dying, and for the maximum damage that he can inflict during his attacks, thus causing a seriously wounded fighter to lose effectiveness in battle. Through the armor you can instead reduce the amount of life points that are taken from us when we suffer an attack. The dynamics studied by the developers give life to a series of clashes that are never banal, based on a dynamic generation system of clashes that only on rare occasions puts us in front of challenges that they already know. To be successful, it is necessary to properly learn the strengths and weaknesses of those who make up our line-up, exploiting the synergies created by special skills to create powerful combinations against enemies who often surpass us both in number and in brute power . From this point of view, the introduction of new types of units is particularly beneficial, thanks to which The Banner Saga 2 can also give greater scope to the contents seen in its predecessor. In stylistic terms, this second chapter remains a joy for the eyes of the beholder, thanks to the highly inspired hand drawings created by Stoic's artists. The dialogues between the various characters are interspersed in the most important moments by short animations, the only flaw of which is that they are not present in greater quantities to allow us to enjoy even a few more moving images. Even in combat, the graphics remain more than excellent, thanks to various details and animations related to the races and classes that populate the universe of The Banner Saga. In the technical sector, the soundtrack composed by Austin Wintory, who has now become an institution in this area of the videogame industry, continues to amaze. With the first episode, The Banner Saga 2 also has in common the absence of Italian language support at launch, which then arrived quite late in the case of the title released in 2014: given that the texts are often long and complex , knowing enough English remains a fundamental requirement.", "date": "2016-04-25", "grade": "9.0"}
