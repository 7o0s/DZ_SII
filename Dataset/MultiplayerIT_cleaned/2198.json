{"name": "Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding-PAL-", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/amped-freestyle-snowboarding-pal-.html", "text": "Simulation? Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding was born as a simulation. This is enough to place a clear distinction between the Microsoft title and SSX which has very little simulation. Every aspect of the ~snow board~ sport, very popular in North America, has been recreated to perfection with obsessive attention to even the smallest details which, however small, always make the difference. Amped is certainly not a racing and you understand it from the first moments of the game. Venturing another comparison, we are faced with a game that wants to transfer to the snow what Tony Hawk's Pro Skater represents on the road. We don't expect crazy descents from insidious slopes but acrobatics, jumps and all those circus acts that characterize the ~freestyle~ discipline. The game modes available are career, single race and multiplayer. If your dream has always been to climb the freestyle world rankings, know that Amped offers you the opportunity to enter the professional snowboard circuit. The road ahead to reach the masters of the specialty is very long and the best way to start the adventure is to create your digital alter-ego and prepare it for competitions. It is important to start out in the races sporting adequate equipment and therefore the first thing you will have to do is visit a vast wardrobe from which to choose trousers, jackets, hats, goggles and everything that proves indispensable on the snow. We will then move on to the board whose choice will certainly not be easy as there are dozens of models of every size and color that differ from each other in terms of characteristics such as grip, jump, speed, etc... Once you have settled your look and equipment, you can finally test your skills in the first of a very long series of competitions. Let's pose for a photo To achieve success, it will not be enough for you to perform more or less complicated tricks as your future on the circuit will depend not only on the competitive results but also on the attention that the press will reserve for you and on the fundamental support that will come to you from the sponsors. To climb the rankings and gain credibility, you will therefore have to face tests that involve performing stunts in front of the jurors who will assign you variable points based on the spectacularity of the tricks performed. It will also be important to make a good impression in front of journalists and photographers, positioned along the routes and ready to immortalize your evolutions. By passing the tests you will be awarded experience points to be used to increase your speed, push and jump skills... If you manage to convince jurors and journalists, reaching certain points required to pass the tests, you will then be presented 'appointment with sponsors. Also in this case your task will be to perform stunts, while trying to satisfy the specific tastes of each sponsor. The sponsor's interest level is represented on-screen by a bar that will gradually fill up whenever you perform a trick the sponsor likes. If you manage to fill the bar, reaching up to ~Amped~ (literally ~excited~ or ~drugged~), you will snatch an advertising contract which will in most cases involve the supply of clothing or equipment. The challenges aren't finished... From time to time you will have the opportunity to challenge the most successful champions of the specialty, who you will face in parallel races in which you will have to try to perform the same stunts as your opponent. If you are skilled enough to win the challenge, you can steal some of his skills from the champion you just beat. But what a beautiful grove! The tracks do not play a purely scenic role as their conformation heavily affects playability. The 120 routes present are not the result of the imagination but inspired, more or less heavily, by the famous descents of some well-known American locations including Brighton (Utah), Stratton (Vermont) and Snow Summit (California). What is striking about the paths is their incredible extension in width, certainly not in length. On the sides of the main slope there are other slopes, huts, woods, frozen rivers and anything else that is really found in the mountains. It follows that you will have considerable freedom of movement as you can head in any direction, making your way between rows of trees or rocks. Amped, like any self-respecting simulation, is certainly not an easy game and at least initially it will test your patience. In fact, you will have to deal with a sissomewhat difficult control theme with which you will have to practice a lot before being able to perform the most complicated stunts. After familiarizing yourself with the control, your patience will be rewarded by the gratification that will come with passing the tests, with the availability of new tests but above all with the incredible variety of actions you can perform. Beyond the career mode, Amped offers the possibility to immediately challenge the most famous champions in a single challenge or to organize an exciting 4-way challenge with three of your friends. Unfortunately, the poorest section of the game is the multiplayer mode and the fact that allowing 4 players to challenge each other by playing alternately (no split-screen!) certainly doesn't help to improve the situation. A compilation of 150 songs From the technical side we get only good news. Amped easily manages to offer a decidedly superior completeness and visual realism to SSX, placing itself as a point of reference for future productions. The appreciable design of the courses, the excellent textures and the realistic animations contribute to increasing the feeling that we are faced with one of the best proofs of the power of XBox. Some details such as the snow that rises when an athlete passes, the trail left by the board on the snow, or the single snow crystals that sparkle in the sun, are instead gems that cannot fail to leave you speechless. Likewise, the sound is also particularly cared for. The effects are always adequate and so realistic that, for example, many of you will recognize the unmistakable noise caused by the passage on fresh snow. As for the music, I had a hard time believing that 150 songs were included in the game but in the end I had to give in to the evidence. On balance, your ears will enjoy 10 CDs of good music of various genres ranging from hip hop to reggae. If this weren't enough for you, there would be nothing left to do but create your own beautiful compilation by transferring your favorite music to the XBox hard disk. In conclusion... Amped is a surprisingly large and realistic game. This latest feature will perhaps make it less accessible to those who prefer a more arcade style of play, also due to a control system that is not exactly immediate. However, there are many qualities of a game that manages to excel on almost all points of view, especially on the technical side, even if you miss the pure speed competitions and a multiplayer mode as complete as the single game. In any case, I would recommend the purchase of Amped to all winter sports enthusiasts (practicing and not) and to anyone who wants to have proof of what the Microsoft console can do. Pros: Simulation Exceptional freedom of action Great completeness of options 120 routes 150 songs!!! Cons: Little immediate control Multiplayer mode a bit disappointing No speed races Materials: Tips The golden age of snowboarding The snow sport par excellence no longer seems to be skiing. For some years now attention has been slowly shifting to snowboarding, derived in part from the much older alpine sport but above all from skateboarding which, as you know, has nothing to do with snow. An important contribution to the diffusion of snowboarding has also come from the world of video games thanks in particular to the resounding success achieved on consoles by SSX and the ~semi-sequel~ SSX Tricky. In fact, the debut title from EA Sports Big surprisingly arrived on PlayStation 2 a year and a half ago proving to be not only the best game of the genre ever conceived but also the first real killer application available for the Sony console. The strengths of SSX have proved to be a gameplay that is as simple as it is engaging and an at least bizarre realization of the snowy slopes. Taking advantage of the success of its illustrious predecessor, Microsoft too has decided to celebrate the arrival of XBox in Europe with a game inspired by the same sport. However, Amped: Freestyle Snowboard has in common with SSX only the white snow, a lot of ambition and nothing else...", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
