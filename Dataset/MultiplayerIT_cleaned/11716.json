{"name": "Link's Crossbow Training - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/links-crossbow-training-recensione.html", "text": "A peripheral sold on its own always attracts less interest than the same peripheral sold with a bundled game. This premise so dear to Nintendo indicated the high road for the creation of Link's Crossbow Training, included in the package of the famous Wii Zapper, often rumbled and then made official during the last E3 conference by an excited Reggie. A plastic support - white of course - in which to insert wiimote and nunchuk to thus transform the controller into a light-gun, ideal for games of the genre already available and the many (we bet) that will invade the market in the coming months. Together is better We were talking about the bundle strategy, which becomes practically fundamental on this occasion since the Wii Zapper is not a product capable of ~selling itself~; either due to the current scarcity of games capable of exploiting it, or above all due to the simple fact that using only the wiimote does not constitute a situation as different as it was, in the past with ~traditional~ consoles, the transition from pad to light gun. Finally, the intrinsic goodness of the Nintendo peripheral must also be considered, sincerely not such as to put it at the top of the wish list of Wii users. But we will talk more about this later; now let's focus on this Link's Crossbow Training, which as the name suggests to anyone with some knowledge of English, sees the hero of the Zelda series as the protagonist, Link precisely, grappling with his own crossbow. The aim of the game is therefore basically to shoot a whole series of animated enemies or simple targets scattered throughout the levels; the latter are about ten divided into 3 stages each, and although the core of the gameplay is decidedly simple and remains almost unchanged, they denote a particular ability to offer a good variety and differentiation between them. All this thanks in the first place to the Zelda universe, whose settings together with enemies (and friends) are taken up to offer the player glimpses of environments already visited in Twilight Princess; a certainly positive aspect, given the particular atmosphere that has always been a cornerstone of the Nintendo series. Secondly, the decision to introduce three different ~approaches~ which provide for movements on rails with the positioning of fixed shots, or 360-degree rotatable shots or even with free movement of the protagonist via nunchuk, is appreciable. Despite being a very simple and low-budget product, Link's Crossbow Training is a fun title capable of offering several layers of insight, as per tradition for a good portion of the Kyoto house's productions. Therefore, if you want to go through the levels without caring too much about the rest, just to complete the game, you can reach the credits in about an hour. But, on the contrary, wishing to deepen the experience will find us facing a decidedly demanding and intriguing challenge. Yes, because your performances produce a score, with which you can get medals. To increase the accumulation of points it is essential to perform the combos, that is to hit the targets in series without errors; and it is also very important to keep your eyes open to shoot a whole series of contour elements such as vases, pumpkins, doors, scarecrows capable of donating precious extras. To this end, it also becomes necessary to use the secondary skills, such as the zoom (Z key) or the charged shot (trigger held down for a few moments) capable of generating a small explosion. Longing for crossbow Link's Crossbow Training is therefore a product that is anything but poor, on the contrary it turns out to be quite fun and undoubtedly able to excite those who have a certain predilection for games of this type. That said, it should first be clarified that it is a low-budget title, which is sold in a bundle with the Wii Zapper at the price of 29.90; a more than honest figure, and which makes a package so attractive that at a higher price it would certainly have had more difficulty in convincing us. Without a doubt, the care and the Nintendo imprint are felt, and although the contents are rather limited allowing you to see all the levels in an hour, the high replayability rate limits this defect. In this sense, the multiplayer mode is very questionable, available but which does not allow you to play simultaneously. And some doubts remain for design choices, such as in the levels that require you to move the cursor on the edge of the screen to rotate the view instead of perhaps delegating it to the nunchuck; but all in all it's frankly difficult to consider Crossbow Training a poor game. As far as the technical component is concerned, comand already mentioned, the graphic engine of Twilight Princess was used, developed on Gamecube and therefore certainly not capable of taking the capabilities of the Wii to the limits. However, where polygons and textures do not arrive there is fortunately an excellent artistic direction that makes everything very pleasant. Similar speech on the sound side, which can count on an impeccable musical accompaniment and spot-on effects. The Wii Zapper We dedicate a separate paragraph to the Wii Zapper, since Nintendo's would-be light gun deserves to be examined carefully. Let's start from the beginning: it's not a light gun. The Wii Zapper is simply a support, a piece of plastic in which to insert wiimotes and nunchucks to give the whole thing the appearance of a gun and thus increase identification with the titles capable of exploiting it. We are therefore talking, in addition clearly to Link's Crossbow Training, also to Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles, and the imminent (for us Europeans) Ghost Squad and Medal of Honor Heroes 2, without forgetting the House of the Dead collection. Unfortunately, the result in practice cannot be considered satisfactory, or at least superior to the classic solution on the Nintendo console. Yes because -obviously- even with the Wii Zapper it's not actually about shooting the screen as with a weapon, but about moving the cursor which is always present on display. A substantial difference, which transforms the gaming experience; and so in the purely practical act the adoption of the peripheral makes aiming less immediate and precise, since moving the viewfinder requires moving the arms and not just tilting the wrist as with the simple wiimote. Even on the balance of the weapon once held, both with nunchuck inserted and not, we have some doubts; in this sense the machine gun shape, therefore elongated compared to a simple pistol, is unfortunate. We believe that a ~beretta type~ solution, even with the nunchuck untied, would certainly have been more practical and functional. Nothing to say instead about the housing slots, rather solid and which make both the insertion and removal of the controllers easy and quick. It should be made clear, however, that the Wii Zapper setting makes quick access to the wiimote keys practically impossible, thus limiting its use to shooters on rails or in any case to slightly more complex game mechanics. The conclusion is therefore as simple as it is unflattering: with the exception of the greater involvement that the Wii Zapper can provide in shooting games, in all other respects it proves to be an inferior solution compared to the standard use of the controller. Comment At the price of around thirty euros, we believe that Nintendo's offer can be taken seriously; next to a peripheral with good build quality but with a questionable specific weight within the mechanics of games capable of exploiting it, an amusing title is in fact included, certainly short and not without defects, but which remains faithful in many respects to the brand of Nintendo quality and which is enhanced by the charm of the setting adopted. It's not the new Duck Hunt nor will it be remembered among the best Wii games, but in all likelihood it won't make you regret the -little-money spent.
