{"name": "CarX Street", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/carx-street-recensione.html", "text": "There are very few open world-based driving games in the mobile sector, and the reasons are obvious: they are rather demanding products, both to create and to run with dignity, and so the rare exponents of the genre often have simplified to say the least. However, this is not the case with the new title developed by the Russian team CarX Technologies, available in free-to-play format on iOS, but destined to arrive shortly also on Android and PC via Steam. In fact, we are talking about a racer equipped with a respectable technical sector, a discreet physical engine, a driving model that incorporates the classic simcades and a lot of substance. So what is it like to explore an entire city and participate in different races while we collect the money needed to buy yet another upgrade or a new car, all from our smartphone? Find the answer in the CarX Street review. Structure: open world done and finished CarX Street, a rather agitated race, in which there is also a lot of money Let's start right from the structure, which is obviously the most characterizing aspect of CarX Street. After making us choose one of the three starting cars, aesthetically identical to their real counterparts but with fictitious names (we, for example, chose an NX5, which would be the 2005 Mazda MX5), the game opens the doors to its city: a generously sized scenario, which we will be able to explore freely on board our car, for the simple pleasure of doing so (there is also a dynamic day-night cycle!) or to participate in the races scattered throughout it. we can call up the map at any time, zoom it in and out (but at the moment we notice some flickering problems), then touch the points of interest and decide whether to trace a GPS route that takes us up to there or make a quick trip with a variable price based on distance. At the beginning we will be allowed to try our hand only with a series of races against time, obtaining a cash prize commensurate with our performance, but by upgrading the car and leveling up we will be able to access much more interesting challenges. In fact, there are five different clubs, each with a progressively higher entrance fee and a series of races reserved for members in which we will finally be able to challenge other riders on the streets of the city, within more or less long routes, and try to cross the finish line first by exploiting not only our skills at the wheel and any knowledge of the track, but also the boost offered by the ever-present nitro, which activated at the right time will give us the cue to ring in that last overtaking before the finish In short, it is a traditional structure, but the point is that it is managed with relative ease by a mobile game. There is also an emphasis on the upgrades and cosmetic changes that we can make to our vehicle to make it faster and prettier. The upgrades will naturally be the key to being able to move up a category and thus participate in increasingly complex challenges, however, remembering to refuel when necessary: a variation on the theme of action energy that clarifies the free-to-play mechanics of the game but it appears quite elastic, complete with advertising trailers to fill the tank a bit. Gameplay: a simcade in your hands CarX Street includes several options for car customization The first impact with the CarX Street touch controls, we admit, was not the best due to the strange choice of inserting two different buttons, hard and slow, both for the accelerator and for the brake: only the latter would have been enough in combination with auto-throttle to significantly simplify setup and make it truly adjustable. However, it must be said that the transparencies help and so the interface does not become invasive. The game does not support controllers, but above all it has two customizable layouts only up to a certain point, and so the steering via accelerometer practically becomes an obligatory choice. Fortunately, it is enough to increase the tilt sensitivity a little to obtain a very precise and reactive response, without the blocks that often occur with these solutions; and so it's a pleasure to drive, avoiding obstacles at the last second and setting the curves differently depending on the type of car we have. CarX Street, a tour of the city at night The physics engine is there and felt: the weight of the vehicle is rendered convincingly, as well as any impacts and cornering behavior, which requires the use of the brake since we are not dealing with a pure arcade. During the races you don't notice FrAnother thing is the notorious ~elastic effect~ we talked about in the Need for Speed Unbound review: if you gain ground against your opponents, they won't recover it as if by magic. The race and boost loop works, but it couldn't be otherwise: as mentioned, the formula put in place by CarX Street is traditional, not to say dated, and is therefore very well tested. After that it is clear that in terms of stipulations and general variety, better could have been done, but once again the concept is that such an experience on mobile is not on the agenda and one is surprised by what it has to offer. offer. Online multiplayer CarX Street includes a very interestingly integrated online mode with an MMO-style approach: while viewing the map, we'll just have to press a button to switch to the ~live~ version of the scenario and notice the other players roaming the streets. However, the multiplayer sector has recently been added and we have not yet been able to understand how it works as regards access to the races. Technical realization: almost there CarX Street boasts some truly evocative landscapes, alternating hilly views with urban areas CarX Street is a technically very ambitious game, as you can imagine, and in fact it tends to struggle with the maximum settings even on a latest generation device such as the iPhone 14 Pro, also causing the terminal to overheat rapidly. Fortunately, from the settings it is possible to scale some values to make the system a little lighter, but the pop-up phenomena and some conspicuous slowdowns in group races clarify how heavy this title is. Also in this case there is no surprising: the cars in the view of the saloon are really beautiful and it is possible to rotate them with incredible agility, but they also perform very well on the road and move within a scenario featuring various suggestive glimpses, which, as mentioned, also has a dynamic day-night cycle and therefore continuously changes the incidence of lights on surfaces. During the guide we will also have five different views available.", "date": "2022-12-04", "grade": "8.0"}
