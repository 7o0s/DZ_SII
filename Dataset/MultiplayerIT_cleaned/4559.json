A few months later, the Japanese publisher decided to update that same product to the 2018 edition, thus maintaining the same basics and basic approach, but updating the squads and applying some refinements in order to diversify the offer. But let's proceed in order. In its mobile reduction, the Konami soccer game boasts very well thought-out mechanisms, which offer two possible solutions in terms of controls: a traditional system with large buttons on the screen or one that brings into play a series of simple gestures that activate various actions : normal passes, crosses, through balls, pressing, slides and of course shots on goal. Net of some uncertainties here and there, the new setting proves to be very effective and intuitive in a few minutes, guaranteeing a fluid and pleasant experience, also made up of many good strategic implications. The problem lies in the structure, which does not have traditional championships and even less a reproduction of the Master League, but falls back on a purely freemium vision that puts us in front of teams managed by other users, with a view to an asynchronous multiplayer, encouraging us to grow our team victory after victory. A path that unfortunately turns out to be long and very boring at first, when the degree of challenge of the matches translates into a string of 10-0 in which it is possible to score even starting from your own penalty area, ball and chain, bypassing the entire opposing team and arriving at the conclusion that the goalkeeper will not even dream of trying to intercept. Weight added? Pro Evolution Soccer 2018 Mobile materializes the ideas recently expressed by Electronic Arts, that is, it transforms the experience into a service to be updated every year rather than redesigned. The concept naturally has its own reason, given that in this specific case we are talking about a product with a very solid and fun base, but we have to go and see how many and what changes are introduced. On the single player front, unfortunately, the setting has remained the same: no championships, only asynchronous multiplayer matches which during the first few hours are really boring due to the very low difficulty, supported by a set of events (including the one dedicated to David Beckham) that add a minimum of variety to the offer but don't distort it, whereas instead it would have been necessary to include at least some tournaments. Similarly, on the competitive online front we have not appreciated substantial steps forward: the fluidity of the experience is not constant, the matches are full of small jerks that spoil the rhythm and undermine the precision of the commands, while the netcode shows alongside a number of uncertainties (wrong passes, unresponsive artificial intelligence) exponentially higher than what can be seen during single-player gameplay. The commentary in Italian, which can be downloaded separately, has also been updated only with regard to the names of the new teams in the 2017 / 2018 championship, while the vast majority of sentences have remained the same. The most evident renewal, absurdly, is the one that probably interests users the least, with new songs for the signed soundtrack.", "date": "2017-11-13", "grade": "6.5"}
