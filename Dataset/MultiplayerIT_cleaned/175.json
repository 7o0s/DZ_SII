{"name": "Cars - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cars-recensione.html", "text": "Often and willingly, finding ourselves in front of a title taken from a famous film franchise, the first reaction is to turn up our noses believing that the game in question is a mere commercial product aimed at exploiting the high-sounding name it bears rather than trying to propose something new or simply good. Most of the time all this is true: tie-ins, products inspired by movies, are very often mediocre video games, and if it goes well they end up being good titles. Only in very rare cases do we discover great games. Cars is yet another videogame transposition of one of the biggest box office hits of last season, will it be able to pass the road test? The remote control like a steering wheel The controls are very simple and intuitive. You turn left and right, brake and jump. There are no items to take on the course, nitro, stars, bananas, power ups or objects to throw at enemies: it is essentially a question of running and finishing first, nothing more. Jumping isn't actually very useful in competition and isn't strictly essential, in fact, you might as well never use it without missing it. Its function is more often linked to obtaining particular objects in the extra-race city missions, i.e. it will be used to take something too high up that would otherwise be unreachable. During the race the controls work quite well, but with reservations. By bending the Wii remote too much, the car no longer seems to detect the desired movement but rather will steer in the opposite direction. Once you get the hang of it, it will therefore be a good idea not to overdo the steering otherwise you will risk ending up off the road very often. it is essentially about running and finishing first, nothing more The remote control like a steering wheel The drifts therefore don't always work perfectly also because if we touch the brake the reaction of the car is to stop and not to let go in a ~slide~ as happens in OutRun or Ridge Racer. In the options there are no modes to set the sensitivity of the steering, but only to change the keys, so some tests will be necessary before starting to corner decently. If our car leaves the track, after 3 seconds it will automatically be brought back to the center of it. The problem is that (for most of the tracks) there are no invisible walls, but also visible blocks that prevent us from thinking ~ok, I'll cut the track so I gain a few meters on the opponent~, so our first instinct will be to go off the track to gain as much ground as possible, with obviously negative results as the car will disappear after a few seconds. Once we've learned this too, we'll try to follow the track but a more ~free~ setting of the race would certainly have benefited the game more. Cars mini games Between one race and another, Cars is stuffed with about thirty sub-quests, missions and mini-games. Some are based on the collection of particular objects scattered around the ~world~, others on competitions and still others try to exploit the wiimote in the most original and varied ways. In some of them you use the remote control as happens in Super Monkey Ball for example, in others you have to collect postcards that are hidden in the most disparate places. We have to scare the tractors in some hilarious skits set at night, without the guardian discovering us, and we will help Luigi to collect all the abandoned tires in the area behind Radiator Springs. Going forward in the game we will earn points necessary to unlock other tracks, cars, but also pieces of film, artwork, sketches and behind the scenes to be enjoyed completely in Italian with the same voices as the film. The making of Cars The technical level reached by the developers of Cars on Wii is equal to that of the GameCube version with some additions. The cars have a few more polygons and the lighting effects are more convincing. The game runs at 480p in 16/9 and this helps the general image quality a lot, especially if we opted for a component as a video connection. Occasionally you may notice the presence of some pop-ups on the horizon and some polygonal interpenetration. The real problem with Cars, however, is the lack of speed sensation that it gives to the player. As previously mentioned, we are faced with a purely ~racing~ title, i.e. where there is nothing to do except accelerate, turn and arrive first at the finish line; having said that, it was reasonable to expect from Cars a greater sensation of frenzy and action. the technical level reached by the developers of Cars on Wii is equal to that of the GameCube version with some additions Maybe for youTo meet the needs of the little ones, the developers have thought of making the title easier to manage with non-exaggerated scrolling. Furthermore, if we go off track and the CPU will let us back in, it will often ~cheat~ by placing us well ahead of the point where we went off and thus giving us a small advantage. For the first half of the game, Cars will be really easy and smooth for the most savvy, only to become slightly more challenging at the end. The audio sector is on the one hand very rich, with all the original voices of the cast, dubbed skits, in-game speech during the races and so on, but the other side of the medal is a poor variety of songs and background music, which eventually become repetitive and monotonous. The effects, on the other hand, are normal and mostly reproduce the noises, the ~roars~ of the engines and the ~cartoonish~ effects of the film. Comment Cars is a good racing game, fun, varied and especially suitable for children as it is very simple and easy to play. The Wii Remote could have been used better in competitions but is great fun in the mini-games, which are a great diversion and provide plenty of silly moments between competitions. It is mostly a carefree game without too many pretensions, with a rather questionable technical realization but which can equally be pleasant by virtue of the excellent Italian dubbing taken by weight from the animated film from which it is taken. Recommended only for true Disney film lovers. Pros Lots of minigames Open world Great voice acting Cons CPU often cheats Too simple Lack of speed feel Cars is available for GameCube, PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360. The tested version is the one for Nintendo Wii. Lightning McQueen also comes to Wii! Lightning McQueen, Mater and all the merry Radiator Spring gang reunite on Wii in this new production from the acclaimed THQ-Disney duo. Often and willingly, video game adventures taken from films faithfully follow the story already appreciated on the big screen, leaving very little imagination as regards plot and story. Cars, on the other hand, follows a completely new and different path compared to the film, the setting is that of free roaming, or ~free wandering~ through a digital world faithful to the cartoon settings faithfully reproduced in every detail. The developers of the game are the Americans of Rainbow Studios, specialized in racing titles with the ATV series Offroad Fury, Motocross Madness, Matt Hoffman's BMX and Splashdown for PlayStation 2. Lightning McQueen, Mater and the whole Radiator Spring gang reunite on Wii The heart of Cars is obviously the story mode, beautifully staged with dozens of beautifully animated interludes dubbed completely in Italian. The comic verve and the characters are the same ones already appreciated in the cinema: between one skit and another, the races will be the real fun of Cars. Initially we are in the desert and the first competitions take place in the city, with low-powered cars and relatively short tracks. As the level progresses, it will be possible to choose more powerful cars up to Nascar-style competitions. Obviously, the wiimote is used to race as if it were a real steering wheel, just like in GT and Monster 4x4 again for Nintendo Wii. If you have already purchased one of these last two games it will also be possible to use the racing wheel you already own.", "date": "2007-01-10", "grade": null}
