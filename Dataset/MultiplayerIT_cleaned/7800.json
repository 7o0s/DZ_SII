In any case, the Galactic Civilization series has always been his flagship, the one capable of convincing everyone and obtaining often enthusiastic reviews from critics and audiences. Many still consider the second chapter as one of the best 4X space ever, superior even to the successor. For this reason, the wait for a new episode was spasmodic among fans and the review of Galactic Civilization 4 can only start from the question: will he have managed to reach the heights of his predecessors and say something new in the genre? 4X The civilizations to choose from are very varied The answer to the question with which we closed the previous paragraph is actually quite open: it could succeed, but not under the current conditions. But let's go in order. As you may have understood, Galactic Civilizations 4 is a turn-based 4X strategy in which the player must take control of one of the eighteen available factions and lead it to conquer the Milky Way, colonizing planets, exploring the most remote recesses of the galaxy and fighting against other civilizations galactic that, look at it, have our own goals of domination. Once you start the game, you realize that there isn't a real campaign to play, but you can only opt for the sandbox mode, which can of course be customized in many ways. We are not at the level of Distant Worlds 2, but the modifiable settings are still many, starting from the number of opponents with whom we will have to face, passing through the production speed, up to the various difficulty levels. Playing in cooperative mode the game is less customizable, but in that case to compensate there is the presence of another human being with whom to share the space. If desired, it is also possible to create one's own factions using the powerful internal editor, which really opens up great possibilities in terms of game customization. Game universe Exploring space is always fascinating The game mechanics themselves are really many and it is impossible to describe them all, a statement which, it must be said, is true for any 4X, so we will try to give you as general a picture as possible, to make you understand the game experience as a whole, more than trying to illustrate every single function. The scale on which we move in Galactic Civilizations 4 is truly enormous, with the galaxy structured in such a way as to be explorable on multiple levels and in multiple directions. They range from individual planets to the entire Milky Way, passing through star systems, which in turn form sectors (sets of star systems), connected to each other by a technology called Subspace Streams. Games all start with limited travel options, as you need to do some research before you have the knowledge to travel between sectors of space. In any case, the result has something amazing, because it goes from the particular to the general with a remarkable conceptual fluidity. The maps are all easily readable and offer both graphical and textual information. From the middle game onwards, a bit of confusion is created, but it is quite normal that this is the case, given the forces in the field and the dimensions that the various civilizations assume. From this point of view Stardock has done a truly exceptional job in making the colonization of space something adventurous, with events that develop in different sectors and that force the player to think differently from other 4X, built as they are to underline certain distances. That of the sectors is certainly the most relevant novelty of the entire game, which elevates it compared to the previous chapters, creating new problems for the players to face, first of all that of the defense of the Subspace Streams, which if lost can lead to slowdowns in the support of sectors still in the process of being colonized or of sectors where the enemy forces are present in a massive way. Combat system It doesn't look like it, but the interface is clear enough Another important novelty is the introduction of a more fluid micro-management system, based on the concept of core world, i.e. planets to which all the colonies of the surrounding star systems refer. To give an easily understandable example, in the Solar system the Earth is a core world, while Mars can be made into a colony. This is a substantial distinction, because the latter are obliged to send their resources to the former, with the risk of creating strong internal disagreements. Be that as it may, the player is called to directly manage only the core worlds, a choice that greatly simplifies lifea, especially after dozens of planets have been conquered, scattered in various sectors. The idea is to avoid having to use helpers managed by artificial intelligence, while avoiding unnecessary complications that would only waste a lot of time. On average, each core world has about four colonies that feed it. Of course there are enemies to deal with as well, especially the other factions. This is why mastering the combat system is very important. Like any self-respecting space strategy, in Galactic Civilization IV it is possible to create fleets of ships of different kinds. The spaceship edit is quite complete Of course there are also spaceships that perform tasks other than fighting, such as colonizing, scanning the planets for resources and exploring unknown sectors, but the greatest focus, especially from the middle game onwards, will be on military ships, which can be designed directly from the player with a powerful editor. Usually the fights take place automatically during single turns, except for the sieges of the planets which can take longer. The player does not have great possibilities for intervention in the clashes, which are determined above all by the strength of the units on the field. At the end of each fight, a summary screen is presented, which notifies us of the result and provides us with various data to understand it. Some problems In the advancing phases the pace of the game slows down quite a bit In addition to fighting, the player can resort to politics to pursue his own goals, better defining his civilization through the system of ideologies, ie seven philosophies of government, each with two branches of specialization (let's call it that), which allow you to address some macros choices and which determine relations with other civilizations. To develop ideologies you need to spend culture points. The latter, unfortunately, are quite mysterious, in the sense that it is not very clear how they are assigned. Others are linked to the system of ideologies, such as that of characters, that of artifacts and that of executive orders, which make some pleasantly complex choices and also create interesting narrative implications, well integrated into the strategic fabric. As you may have understood, we are dealing with a really complex game, whose entry curve is quite steep. Despite this, once you understand the main mechanics and become familiar with the interface, created in a fluctuating way, playing becomes more and more immediate. By fluctuating interface we mean that it is the victim of quite strange choices: it is excellent for the management of the planets and for that of the starfleet, but at the same time it lacks useful shortcuts. Some breeds are more beautiful than others For example, if in order to construct a building it is necessary first to have researched a certain technology, no direct link is given to it, but it must be researched in the skill tree screen. Another problem is represented by the so-called tooltips, text pop-ups that appear when you hover the cursor over an interface element, which have the nasty tendency to disappear immediately when you move the mouse. Another problem, always related to the interface, is related to the production queues, which are difficult to modify, it is not clear if due to precise design choices or some bug. The fact is that they waste a lot of time, because those cursed icons don't want to obey. Broken rhythm An animated sequence However, the most serious problem of Galactic Civilization IV is another: the pace of play in the second half of the games. One of the strengths of the Stardock title, its size, is also its biggest flaw, if you think about how long each turn takes when you have dozens of planets to control spread across several sectors, spaceships to move and political choices to Do. The core world system helps, but can't stop the game from crashing. The slowdown also corresponds to the heightening of the perception of being faced with a really cold title, in which the player's choices never seem to be too significant, because the implications are inevitably positive. The strong feeling of asepticity of the whole is transmitted both by the more purely political systems and by the combat one, with the ships that seem a mere sum of numbers and nothing more, moreover little influenced by the design chosen by the player. Artificial intelligence, excellent in space, takes care of resolving the situation a bit, where it proves capable of conceiving good assault tactics, trying to exploit star systems as much as possible in cHere he is, but mediocre in diplomacy, with choices that quickly become predictable. Galactic Civilizations 4's race design is unique From a graphic point of view, Galactic Civilizations 4 makes its own, thanks to the many customization options and the details of the various space maps. The period spent in early access has also been good for the fluidity, which has proved flawless even in very crowded situations. During the test we came across very few bugs, all venial and not compromising the gaming experience.", "date": "2022-04-28", "grade": "7.0"}
