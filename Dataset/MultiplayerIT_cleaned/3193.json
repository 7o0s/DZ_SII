The spread of the Coronavirus has forced practically all sports to suspend ongoing competitions, including the American baseball league which in normal times would have found itself at the starting line of the championship after the so-called spring training. The start date of the new season was in fact set for March 26th, but like many other sports, MLB also had to give up to postpone the start to April 18th. While waiting for that day to arrive, fans of what is one of the most loved sports in America can therefore resort to MLB The Show 20, the new edition of the successful series curated by SIE San Diego Studio. As in the past, MLB The Show 20 arrives in a completely deserted landscape at least as far as simulations are concerned, exclusively on PlayStation 4 as we were used to so far. Next year, however, there will be something new: as part of the licensing agreement between the league and Sony there will in fact be the arrival on the multiplatform market, thus also allowing owners of other consoles to get on the mound. But this will be a matter of discussion in 2021: for now, let's see what the Californian team has in store for us this year. The modalities: many confirmations, few novelties The offer of MLB The Show 20 in terms of modalities does not offer particular differences compared to the previous edition, thus also maintaining the March to October introduced a year ago with MLB The Show 19. For those who may have missed the latter, we remind you that the aforementioned mode represents the fastest alternative to experience an entire MLB season by addressing only the key moments, thus skipping part of the one hundred and sixty-two games that would otherwise be expected to complete the regular season alone. Compared to what we saw a year ago, the developers have enriched the season with further topical moments to experience in the first person, also offering greater possibilities for customizing the team through the buying and selling of players. A work that therefore goes to put a few more bricks on what has already been built, which as we will see also unites the other aspects of MLB The Show 20. The Road to the Show mode, for example, introduces some new role-playing dynamics inside it , without however distorting the career mode (still far from a story mode) studied by SIE San Diego for its own creature. The Franchise mode, perhaps the most popular among MLB The Show 20 players, instead offers as a novelty the possibility of customizing some parts of the chosen team, thus allowing you to add a personal touch to your run towards the World Series. It is a pity, however, that some aspects are still missing, such as building your own stadium from scratch, an element loudly requested by fans.Diamond Dinasty remains more or less the equivalent of FIFA 20 Ultimate Team, enriched in this new edition with the new Showdown sub-mode where by taking charge of a different team than the one you control in this mode, the player faces a series of challenges. All of the modalities can count on the arrival under license of the teams that make up the minor leagues, thus adding those of the so-called AA and AAA to the very famous MLB teams. A boon above all for those in search of extreme simulation, thus obtaining the possibility of going and looking for truly existing prospects to bring to the fore. The gameplay: defense first The gameplay of MLB The Show 20 follows quite closely that of its predecessor, compared to which this new edition presents some inevitable improvements. Once again, the additions concern above all the defensive phase, which in reality had already been retouched a year ago above all as regards the management of the wingers. After a few games in this new chapter, the impression is that SIE San Diego has somewhat revised all the dynamics of movement and management of the players involved in defense, thus allowing the player to obtain greater control in the more complicated phases, enhancing at the at the same time the characteristics of the individuals who are in the field. It happens from time to time to witness some somewhat inexplicable errors, but it must be said that things like this also happen in real life: obviously, when they happen in the game against you, they make you a little angry. As for the phase of serve, it should be noted the addition of a new assessment of the impact of the bat with the ball, which requires a further effort on the part of the player to swing with the right timing. The new parameter is in fact called ~perfect~, and allows you to be pratically sure of bringing home a home run or at least a line drive with which to win one or more bases. For the rest, MLB The Show 20 remains broadly what we have learned to know in recent years, allowing the player to choose his favorite batting and pitching style from a set made available to satisfy both those looking for an experience a little more arcadey, and those who want maximum simulation. However, the fact that MLB The Show 20 is similar to the previous iterations of the series should not mislead: despite the total absence of competition, the developers have in fact created a product over the years in able to satisfy even the finest palates, with a learning curve that can be steep especially in the first stages but which after a certain number of games manages to pave the way towards great satisfaction. Playstation 4 trophies MLB The Show 20 brings with it twenty-six PlayStation Trophies. The inevitable platinum-type supreme recognition is accompanied by seven gold, nine silver and nine bronze. To get them all you have to get busy between the various modes that make up the simulation made in San Diego, including the need to shoot a home run from over 120 meters. Graphics - the best for the generation In technical terms MLB The Show 20 proves that it is ready for the next generation of consoles. Indeed, the effort of SIE San Diego repeatedly seems to have to be satisfied with the hardware at its disposal, arriving at squeezing both the PlayStation 4 in the basic version and the Pro edition of the Sony home console like an orange on a juicer. We will therefore probably see any upheavals from a graphic point of view with the arrival of PlayStation 5 and company on the market, remaining for now on the levels of MLB The Show 19 with an extra pinch of cleaning. The care for individual players and for the game environment therefore remains at the highest levels, but the rendering of the game in terms of frames is affected by the limitations, especially in the phases in which there are more players involved in what happens on the screen. In any case, these are quite sporadic moments, which go to scratch what would otherwise be a perfect rendering on PlayStation 4 Pro, as well as the maximum obtainable in this specific generational phase.", "date": "2020-03-16", "grade": "8.4"}
