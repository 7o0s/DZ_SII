In addition to having a single player campaign with objectives, in fact, the game had an online multiplayer sector which pitted two teams each made up of sixteen players (possibly replaced by bots), within a rather vast scenario, in which they were two different fortresses, that of the red team and that of the blue team. The armies had kidnapped their respective princesses, keeping them locked up in an iron cage, and in the ~Save the Princess~ mode, the team's goal was therefore to penetrate the enemy base, take the princess and take her away, in a sort of variant of the traditional ~capture the flag~. To make the action more multifaceted and interesting, there were not only the various classes for the characters, each equipped with specific skills, but also tower defense-style mechanisms, with the possibility of collecting raw materials around the map and building doors , traps and anything else to slow down the advance of the opponents. Fat Princess Adventures, however, does not take up this formula and instead focuses on cooperative gameplay, with a sort of cartoonish and simplified version of Diablo. A guessed move? Fat Princess Adventure is a very simple and linear action RPG, in some ways inconsistent Peace made The red and blue armies, which were in conflict in the first episode of the series, have decided to make peace and so the two princesses and their respective parents have also become great friends. For someone, however, it does not go well: an evil queen decides to have the two plump heirs to the throne kidnapped, taking them to the most remote areas of the kingdom, and our task will naturally be to save them, facing the adventure alone or in a cooperative multiplayer for four players, both locally and online, of the jump-in / jump-out type; which means that we will be able to carry on the game regardless of who joins the group, or in turn enter another user's session to help him. In Fat Princess Adventures the developers have therefore opted for traditional gameplay in an action RPG style, eliminating the strategic mechanisms and competitive elements, and paying more attention to the available classes, four instead of the original five: warrior, engineer, mage and archer. The first two use melee attacks, with the warrior armed with a sword and shield, also able to perform a charge that stuns enemies and makes it easier to hurt them, and the engineer who instead wields a large war hammer and has the pockets lined with bombs of various kinds. The wizard and archer classes are instead of the ranged type, they attack from a distance and suffer from close quarters, projecting powerful spells or arrows onto their targets, and handling the melee attack with a breath of fire and a dagger respectively. During the campaign it is possible to grow the individual classes, simply by using them to eliminate a certain number of enemies but also by collecting parts of the equipment around and spending the coins earned to upgrade them. Furthermore, at each checkpoint you will have the possibility to switch to a different character, so as to be able to count on a certain degree of variety. Playstation 4 trophies The twenty-nine Fat Princess Adventures Trophies are earned by completing individual chapters of the campaign, replaying missions in Grindhouse mode, upgrading characters to the max, and killing increasing numbers of enemies. Nothing transcendental, therefore, and a Platinum quite easy to obtain. Quests, monsters and bosses The idea of a Diablo-style action RPG, albeit characterized by a cartoonish style, wouldn't be bad at all, were it not for the excessive simplification of the structure. The capital of the kingdom serves as a hub for missions, but it also includes rather trivial side quests, which we can complete to get some rewards and which generally consist of moving from point A to point B. Once en route to the next destination, the action focuses on fighting and loot gathering, with the former offering a fair degree of challenge, but at the same time suffering from a general inconsistency of impact, with slashing that ~glide~ on enemies rather than returning an appropriate sensation of impact, a key factor in making these stages fun. There is a good variety of opponents, which change according to the scenario, and fairly interesting boss fights, in which it is necessary from time to time to understand what the enemy's weak point is and exploit it to sinkand our shots. The campaign consists of seven chapters and lasts between seven and eight hours, depending on how deep you go even in the secondary missions, but is supported by a Grindhouse mode that offers single missions at higher difficulty levels, and which therefore adds something to the life of the product. From a technical point of view, the game is well done: the exploitation of the depth of field for the enhancement of certain scenarios is greatly appreciated, the colors are always lively and you often switch from light to dark shades to avoid excessive linearity. Even in terms of the characters, the design appears successful, although the cartoon style clashes with the abundance of blood, creating a somewhat paradoxical situation, while the frame rate is generally stable but suffers from rather evident drops when we force the hand , moving rapidly while being chased by droves of enemies. The Italian dubbing is appreciable for its quality and interpretation, but we found the obsessive repetition of some sentences irritating, certainly the result of an original approach which, however, does not render very well in our language.", "date": "2015-12-11", "grade": "7.0"}
