Remastered Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/139418-wings-remastered-edition-le-ali-della-nostalgia.html", "text": "At the time of the Amiga Cinemaware was not just a software house, but a genre in its own right. It was probably the studio that most of all brought the videogame medium closer to the world of cinema, despite having very limited means available. The Cinemaware titles were a successful mix between mini games of various genres and cinematic cut sequences, such as the dialogues with large and detailed characters shot from the waist up (a rarity at the time), or the interlude sequences animations that were even rarer on systems with limited computing power and the storage space of the most common media, floppy disks, laughable by today's standards. Let's say it better: if we improperly wanted to indicate triple A released in the late eighties or early nineties, surely there would be exponents of the Cinemaware catalogue. Some time ago we addressed the problem of how the classics are judged in more modern times. If we were faced with the original Wings of 1990, with its 16-bit 32-color graphics and with all the charm of the time and the weight of history that it carries on its shoulders, despite not having been Cinemaware's best title, we would have avoided vote and we would have told you about it for what it was then, pure spectacle with its three phases of arcade gameplay interspersed with notes in a notebook and mission reports that recounted the First World War with an unusually dramatic atmosphere. The losses of the comrades, in competition with the player for the medal of best pilot of the squadron, had a strong emotional impact, giving greater importance to the individual missions and making every mistake a reason for discouragement. Alas Wings! Remastered Edition is no longer the game it was then, despite being almost identical. Wings will be successful! Remastered Edition to revive the Cinemaware classic? Memory loss Wanting to name some heirs of the Cinemaware school, many titles come to mind. The cutscenes are the most successful part of the remake It will seem incredible, but it is possible to draw a line that starts from there and reaches up to the various Tomb Raiders, Uncharted and many other heavyweights of modernity. It's not as fine a line as it might seem at a superficial glance, given that, as already mentioned, in 1990 Cinemaware was a master in packaging one of the most advanced forms of integration between video game and cinema languages. Too bad though that our line would stop in front of Wings! Remastered Edition, dodging it to head elsewhere. Although it is a remake evidently obsessed with perfectly reproducing its source of inspiration, it barely manages to touch its greatness. You may have already understood why, but it is right to explain it: Wings was a game that amazed because it was highly experimental and superior to any competitor. It wasn't just a question of playability or graphics, but of perspective on the future of the medium. Wings! Remastered Edition in this sense is regressive, because it inherits nothing from the original, except the appearance. As then, but different Let it be clear that the game is everything. Then there are the three phases of combat with aerial clashes experienced by a third person unusual for the genre, in which the camera is placed behind the pilot so as to show the movements of his head; These bombings are now unthinkable there is the shooter phase, in which you have to shoot down the targets indicated in the briefing, such as infantry or supply trucks, with machine gun shots, with an isometric perspective in the style of Zaxxon and Red Baron; finally, there is the bombing phase, which is unlocked after a few years of war, in which you have to hit targets on the ground by aligning the plane's shadow with the target. In this last phase the shot is from a bird's eye view, in the style of a Xevious. Here, the main problem of Wings! Remastered Edition is that in 1990 its three phases were going to relate to titles of those years such as the aforementioned Red Baron and Xevious, resulting superior, at least from the point of view of involvement and spectacularity, because they were inserted in an enormously advanced game context. At the time, the giant plane of the bombing phase had its effect, as well as the fluidity of the 3D air battles, which, even if very short, lasted long enough to feel like true aces of the skies. Unfortunately, having lost the historical qualities, it is obvious that something else is expected from a contemporary product. Great cinema has become pantomime For example, it is reasonable to expect that the air battles are not all the same for dozens and dozens of missions, often resolving in a few minutes, if not seconds, of battle withmeet opponents led by a modest artificial intelligence, which poses a real risk only when it tries to come on us. Twenty-four years ago we often fell in love It is also legitimate to ask that the 2D phases take into account not so much the technological evolution of the medium as a whole, but rather the giant leaps made also in the world of pixel art; did it take so long to better design the bare backgrounds of our aerial raids? For a professional, of course. The gameplay would also have to be reviewed at all stages. For example, the inaccuracy of the aircraft's machine guns in the phases of attacking ground targets is no longer tolerable, just as a phase like that of bombing is no longer acceptable, in which practically nothing is done except drop one or two bombs while dodging enemy artillery fire. Not that we were expecting who knows what, but at least a re-reading of the phases in a more technical sense yes, or a revision of the mechanics to make them more dynamic. Many of Wings' remaining limitations in this remake were due to the limitations of the machines it ran on then, but they really don't make sense today except in honor of a misunderstood retrogaming taste. In fact, what's the point of playing with a remake identical to the original if I can enjoy it thanks to one of the many re-releases? Even the interludes have remained the same, but seeing the new version of the take-off phases of the plane or the cutscenes with the airships is really sad. We repeat that the problem is easily decipherable: at the time those cutscenes were the best the market had to offer, today seeing the sequence of a few seconds at the beginning of each mission made in mediocre 3D who should impress? Behold, the paradox of Wings! Remastered Edition is all here: it disfigures in importance and ambition in the face of the game it would like to update. If you really can't help it, dust that one off.", "date": "2014-10-22", "grade": "4.5"}
