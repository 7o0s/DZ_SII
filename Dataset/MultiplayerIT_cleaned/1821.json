{"name": "Soccer Kid", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soccer-kid.html", "text": "[***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] This ~Soccer kid~ is a horizontal scrolling action game with platform elements that is structurally very linked to old school games (being part of them...). The main character, a boy named ~Determination~, has to face five different world locations (with their respective sub-levels) to replenish the lost pieces of the international soccer cup. Throughout the adventure, however, our little hero will bring with him his most trusted friend, his balloon, thanks to which he will be able to help himself to face the obstacles that the urban jungle offers him (runaway cyclists, policemen, workers, rats, eagles, etc.) and to reach otherwise unreachable areas. The aim of the game is to complete each level, perhaps even finding the hidden stickers that unlock the many bonus games. The structure of the various stages follows (but only slightly) that already seen in games such as ~Super Mario Bros~, complete with obstacles to avoid and platforms to cross. The aforementioned ball plays a fundamental role in the mechanics of ~SK~. In fact, only thanks to it is it possible to eliminate enemies, make super-jumps, break down walls and so on. If desired, the sphere can also be used to collect the various bonuses and power-ups scattered left and right. Some of these increase the score (an element that is disappearing in the latest generation games) while others make our little Maradona invincible for a limited time. What he can do with the ball translates into dribbles, shots, lobs, overturns, etc. And all with the push of a single button. You can also get on the ball to use it as a trampoline and then make improbable leaps from the ground. The playability of ~SK~ is quite good even if a few minutes of practice is necessary. The keys used are only two and with these you can perform several actions. The entertainment offered by the Telegames product is of good quality bearing in mind that we are dealing with a game designed several years ago. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Although now obsolete, from a technical point of view ~SK~ represents a nice title. The sprites are quite large, well colored and animated. The parallax movement also performs its duty sufficiently. The level design feels a tad old-fashioned and, keep in mind, the graphics of the original Amiga game weren't substantially changed during this port. Be that as it may, this product remains nice to look at thanks above all to the attention to some details, to the good choice of the color palette and to the greatness of the characters on the screen. The good brightness of the levels makes the contrast rendering of the Nintendo laptop a little less problematic. The protagonist's movements like a true champion while he does his best in bicycle kicks and stuff like that are very nice. So with regard to the visual aspect, this cartridge is nice but not brilliant, and in any case we are aware of the fact that it is a title released for the first time several years ago (around 1995). On the sound profile there are nice but slightly fluctuating accompaniments (of those loops that immediately come to mind) and effects that do not stand out for their precision and novelty. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] The amount of entertainment that ~SK~ is able to offer the gamer is good (a handful of hours) as well as its quality. The only flaw lies in the save system, really badly designed. Consider that it is possible to register your position only after having completed each stage (and each stage consists of several sub-levels). This seems like an inappropriate choice especially for a game that runs on a laptop. Because of this, a lot of patience is required for the procedure in the adventure which, by the way, is already complicated enough by itself. The Telegames title is a good product recommended, however, only to those who have never used or completed it. This is because the differences with the original are null from all points of view. For others it should be noted that only those who suffer from pressing crises related to retrogaming could consider buying ~SK~ to return to childhood and take a dip into the past. The youngestni, on the other hand, will find in this cartridge a nice pastime with a football background. Too bad only for the save system. Pros: Fun and addictive. Good dose of difficulty. It's ~Soccer Kid~! Cons: Technically not the latest. Inappropriate save system. It is Soccer Kid that appeared a long time ago. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] How many memories this ~Soccer kid~ (alias ~Marco's magic football~) ... Many years have passed since the fingertips of gamers from all over the world were engaged in the adventure of the child who did his utmost among urban obstacles thanks to the help of his friend ball. Many, especially the younger ones, did not have the opportunity to enjoy this fun game years ago. And perhaps this is precisely the reason that prompted Telegames to bring its ~SK~ to the Nintendo laptop (or perhaps to make money?). A beautiful memory for many, a pleasant novelty for others.", "date": "2003-01-09", "grade": null}
