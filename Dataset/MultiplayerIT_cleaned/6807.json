On the other hand, with a promotional effort close to zero, KillHouse Games could not expect the world to go looking for them with the lantern. Luckily, almost a year ago, Door Kickers happened under our eyes, and it was love at first sight. The game fills an important void, that of top-down elite squad simulators, and it does it excellently. To date we can consider it the best real-time strategy game with SWAT involved. Seventy missions, infinite ways to approach each scenario and as many ways to fail miserably. And since SWAT means business, failure doesn't make it into the ops manual. So we try and try a mission even thirty times in a row, changing the approach, armaments, disposition of the agents. If we just can't make it, we move on to some other cases, unlock new weapons, and come back tougher and more prepared than before. Because every aspect of this game is an incentive to improve. And it is remarkable that KillHouse Games has managed to study a game system that is never frustrating. Scenarios can be closed with an excellent result in less than a minute (even those on several floors) so it's not worth starting from scratch. And then the fast pace, the hundreds of shots fired per second and the disproportionate number of corpses we leave behind as soon as we break in, keep the interest alive even after countless attempts. Above all because every mistake teaches us something, always. As the game also says, you can finish a mission with a few dead agents, but the fact remains that our tactics sucked. And if these words don't hurt your pride, then you've got the wrong game. If you want to live a SWAT day, either enlist or play Door Kickers Ready for everything Each mission rewards us with experience points for the agents involved, who thus rise in rank, improving their skills. We also get stars to spend on new equipment and doctrine points for the skill branch. From the point of view of armaments, the game does not let itself be prayed for and offers dozens of options for each class. The classes are four and defined by the type of weapon: pistol, machine gun, shotgun, shield, or silenced weapon. There are advantages and disadvantages associated with each class and weapon, so you can imagine how many combinations are possible, without considering the choice of body armor and secondary accessories, which we will return to later. Preparing our team before a mission is one of the game's subtle pleasures. In all, there are ten agents on the team, but the actual number on the field varies according to the task. If it is true that each mission opens up to many different approaches, however, we must consider what the objective is. When there are hostages in the middle, for example, it is better not to be announced by shooting from the windows like crazy, or to throw grenades into a room without first having peeked through the door with the special portable camera. Likewise, raiding a drug factory from a single entrance and in a loud fashion will give the traffickers enough time to destroy much evidence. But when it comes to defusing a bomb, we believe there's no need to tell you that speed is everything. There are many other variations to consider. Do the enemies know we're coming? Do we need a taser for a high-stakes arrest warrant? Finally, it is the very conformation of the scenario that recommends the use of certain weapons rather than others. If we are in an open field, a precise machine gun is better than one that knocks down an elephant, while enemies with vests and AK-47s must be stunned by a blinding grenade and hit at least on two sides so as not to give them time to recover and reply. Variety is one of the strong points of the game, and the developers promise to add new missions for a long time. Even so, however, you will be spoiled for choice. Between the plane in the hands of terrorists and the drug cartel barricaded in a seaside villa, no day's work is the same as another. The art of giving orders The tactical component of Door Kickers is flexible and very satisfying. You can always play in real-time, dragging one agent at a time, although it's hard to get great results like this. Much better to pause the game and issue commands to each individual agent, then restart the action and admire the result, or horrify at the disaster. The long gestation of the Early Access game allowed the developers to create a systema very specific but easy to master, which even allows you to initially assign all the commands necessary for the entire mission and then stop and watch the agents complete a raid on three floors without touching the mouse anymore. This is certainly one of the greatest satisfactions that Door Kickers can offer, and is always accompanied by a medal and experience points at will. Going into more detail, we can establish how an agent's point of view rotates during the assigned route, decide when to stop and when to start again, perhaps at the exact moment when another throws a blinding bomb. Any action can be coordinated with that of other SWATs. Agents with silenced weapons also have the ability to hold a target at gunpoint and fire only when we decide to. Then there is the doors to consider. In this case it is the equipment we were talking about before that makes the difference. We can break into them by hand or with a quick tool, place a charge that stuns whoever is on the other side, break through them with hammers, rifle shots or, if there is a padlock, break it with large pincers. Some methods are faster, others noisier, and it's up to us to decide which is the best choice based on the situation and the tactic we have in mind. Imagine an orchestra in which each member must play his part precisely and in time. Here, if you are good at giving commands, seeing your team in action is like listening to a symphony played by a large orchestra. Pure pleasure. Never a moment of rest The final version of Door Kickers includes the campaign mode, which was absent during Early Access. There are a total of three campaigns, divided into missions connected by a logical thread. This mode needs to be strengthened, but the developers are aware of this and in fact they are working to add new campaigns, narrative scenes between one mission and another, missions that take place simultaneously and developments based on the results obtained in the different phases. At the moment the only relevant change is the wounding of the agents, who do not heal from one mission to another in the campaign, or the definitive death if we activate the Iron Man option. Unfortunately this is not enough to create an emotional bond between us and our agents, above all because everyone can interpret any class, depriving us of true customization. With any luck, this aspect will also be considered in the months to come. While on the one hand the automatic generation of campaigns is still in the works, we can instead already use the random mission generator, which we assure you will get your hands on after a long time. In fact, the standard missions have different possible enemy arrangements and, with three medals to unlock for each level, you will be replaying them over and over again. Those who still want an endless gaming experience can access the level editor, intuitive and easy to use. Finally there is the button that opens the mods screen. There are dozens of them, although many need to be updated to work with the newly released version of the game. Currently the mods expand the number of weapons available, add new uniforms and activate graphic changes, such as bullet holes on the bodies of enemies and corpses that do not disappear from the screen as they do now, leaving a black silhouette from the crime scene. From a graphic point of view we have little to complain about, because the scenarios are very detailed and very distinct from each other. Unfortunately, the game engine does not allow the action to be carried out simultaneously on several floors, and the command that allows us to climb the stairs sometimes leaves some agents behind. But they are niceties, and could be fixed with subsequent updates. Meanwhile we have seventy missions to finish in record time.", "date": "2014-10-27", "grade": "8.9"}
