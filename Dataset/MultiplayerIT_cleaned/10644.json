While representing a sport considered minor, EA Canada's attention has never waned on its creature, and with the 2010 edition we are faced with a product that is now mature, refined and extremely next-gen both in construction and in content. many of them online. Those who grew up watching the anime ~Tutti in campo con Lotti~ on TV can perhaps have an idea of the passion and feeling that lie behind a golf club and a green, the same emotions that today Electronic Arts tries to make us experience comfortably seated in the armchair of our house. It's not a rich man's sport Gameplay, graphics and modes, compared to last year, have remained almost unchanged with the 2010 chapter. Why consider yet another sequel, then? The new Tiger Woods brings improvements and refinements in practically all sectors of the game: Electronic Arts has kept the formula used unchanged (already excellent in itself) and has focused on the criticisms made by the fans, making some welcome additions, eliminating errors and coarseness , inserting some unedited gimmick that manages to make a big leap forward this year as well. At this point, it is difficult to find constant room for improvement: Tiger Woods is now a mature product. The major changes have been introduced in the putting phase, i.e. the approach to the green where the hole is located. With a button you can view the put preview, i.e. the hypothetical trajectory of our shot. It's not that easy, though. There is always the cursed wind to consider, which now blows in a ~dynamic~ way, changing direction, speed and intensity suddenly and constantly. Just like it happens in reality. Tiger Woods 10 focuses heavily on atmospheric effects and their influence on gameplay, and it is perhaps the point where it could have been improved the most. Even the rain, just mentioned in the previous chapters, this year is really ~alive~ and unpredictable. Its effects are noticeable both instantly, by changing the trajectory and power of our shots on the ball, and also over time, given that a downpour will also change the tightness of the playing field and the relative physics linked to the rolling of the ball. It will take several holes before the effects of an incessant rain appease its wrath on the grass of the green, with the sun slowly drying up the puddles and water residues. Champion class Like any self-respecting EA title, obviously also in Tiger Woods 10 tons of options, modes and competitions could not be missing. First of all, it is necessary to dwell on the excellent tutorial which introduces us to the use of the various clubs and teaches us how to perform the main strokes through one of our private trainers. As soon as we feel ready we can dive into the heart of the competitions, tackling the PGA Tour, a real championship that takes place through a series of competitions (each 18 holes long, obviously) marked by a calendar along the lines of what has already been seen in other sports games made in EA. The exciting side of the game is the rpg-like structure: just like in a role-playing game, as we progress with the challenges our technical characteristics constantly increase, making us improve more and more. It is necessary to start from the creation of the player, in which it is possible to create our digital alter ego also using the Xbox 360 Live Vision camera. The CPU is able to process our face in 3D starting from a lateral and a frontal image with truly amazing results. Always following the structure of an RPG, in Tiger Woods you also accumulate dollars, useful for buying special objects, accessories and costumes. You can win money in two ways: by winning races or by making particular shots that earn us trophies (for example, hitting a hole from outside the green). One of the substantial innovations of this year is the possibility to ~see~ the power of your putter with a marker on the shot bar. There is no longer any need, therefore, to change among the many putters available in the past, but only one is used and with that one the desired intensity on the ball is changed directly with the right analogue. Live Online Tournaments Where few improvements were possible, EA still managed to improve. But although giant leaps were not possible in the gameplay and in the technical sector, the developers have well thought out to implement new services and online modes. The ~Live Online Tournament~ is figlio of these decisions and it is a series of competitions to be faced against people connected to Xbox Live. At the end of each hole, data and statistics appear on the players who are playing at that specific moment, that same course where we too are. It is thus possible to compare our records to those of all the others, monitoring one's progress and skill. In addition to single player and local multiplayer, there are obviously numerous options for playing on the internet. Thanks to the PRO Tour it is even possible to challenge the real real champions, facing the same holes, with the same weather conditions, during the real tournaments going on around the world. The CPU is updated via the internet providing us with the real statistics against which we are called to compare ourselves. There is also an option called ~Live Tournaments~, through which we enter competitions lasting 24 hours, in which we are free to tackle as many courses as we want, trying to keep the lowest number of shots possible. All stats are automatically compared to other players through the internet. However, these modes are modeled on the single player, not allowing the simultaneous challenge of multiple players. Tiger Woods 10 is a deep and multi-level game: it allows you to set your preferences from every point of view, in order to make it playable by both an amateur and a lover of extreme simulation. From the options (there are dozens and dozens of them) you can in fact eliminate all the aids assisted by the CPU, such as the backspin power up, the spin in the air and the put preview. You can also increase the height of tall grass, tee distance and hole placement. Xbox 360 goals Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10 doesn't give us many goals in a quick and easy way, but he does leave us sweating a lot to get all his points. Watching game credits is perhaps the only really simple one, the classic ~Create a player using the camera~ has also been eliminated. The objectives are all quite long and complex to achieve, especially that of playing against a member of EA Tiburon. On the other hand, hitting the hole from off the green unlocks absolutely nothing: such a shot should absolutely have been rewarded! The Green is greener than ever The biggest innovation in the technical implementation of the game is certainly the Live Weather, a system that reproduces the real weather conditions of the holes we are playing in real time, connecting via the internet and ~spying~ on the sky and the wind at the various corners of the earth where the real game paths are present. The system works well to give a touch of unpredictability and constantly diversify the game conditions: we can find a beautiful sunny day, like a rain and wind storm. Or a beautiful sunset cooled by a light breeze. Rain, water and some effects have been significantly improved compared to previous years. The same thing cannot be said of the polygonal models of the players, which look exactly the same as the first next-gen Tiger Woods that appeared many years ago now. Even the animations are always the same, but at least new camera movements have been inserted (the virtual direction that follows our shots) and some more spectacular shots, such as the one just behind the hole. The sound sector, enhanced by the usual EA Trax quality, has been greatly improved thanks to the use of hundreds of voiceovers, noises and various applauses from the audience. You feel the warmth of the people a lot, their incitements are alive and all this contributes a lot to the realism that Electronic Arts has always aimed for. The settings are all very beautiful and solid from a polygonal point of view, embellished by an excellent lighting system that makes them warm and in pastel colors. It's nice to take a walk in the fields of Tiger Woods: it's almost like being there.", "date": "2009-07-10", "grade": "9.0"}
