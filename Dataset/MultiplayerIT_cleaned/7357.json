Being ninja today Without even pretending to sketch out a plot sketch, Shadow Blade puts the user in the role of the ninja Kuro, engaged in tackling a series of levels divided into three settings without a real why: not that an action game necessarily needs a history to exist (especially on iOS), but the total absence of a setting is a bit perplexing. Fortunately, the discouragement only lasts the time of accessing the actual game, when Shadow Blade proves to be a product perfectly at ease with the modern dictates of mobile gaming. The gameplay is therefore very intuitive, so much so that the tutorial phase is really short: the aim is to reach the end of each of the 41 stages that make up the package in the shortest possible time, killing the enemies that stand in front of us and collecting ninja stars and badges. A structure that goes hand in hand with an equally simple and effective control system, which in its default version is based entirely on touches and swipes without the aid of any virtual button: it is therefore sufficient to hold down the finger on one side or the other of the screen to make the protagonist run in that direction, while a swipe makes him leap and a quick tap allows him to swing his sword. On these bases it is possible to build vaguely more elaborate actions such as a double jump or an attack from above, but everything still falls within the confines of absolute intuitiveness: for the nostalgic, an alternative scheme is still available which makes use of classic keys, which allow greater precision by sacrificing some of the dynamism of the experience. The gameplay develops on a strictly two-dimensional plane, drawing liberally from the archetypes of the action genre, thus putting on the plate obstacles to overcome (above all chasms and spikes), trampolines, mobile platforms and so on, breaking everything up into levels that complement each other in a turn of the clock or a little more. Shadow Blade is an action game as fun as it is short and not very original All good, then? Not exactly. Despite being an undoubtedly immediate and fun title, it is hard to be enthusiastic about Shadow Blade for a whole series of reasons. To begin with, the game is really short: within an hour you can easily complete all the stages, including the nine belonging to a category called ~hardcore~ but which has nothing difficult about it. The replayability factor isn't particularly high either: you can retrace your steps to try to get all three ninja stars awarded at the end of each level, a pity that it is absolutely useless since there are no extra content to unlock thanks to they. What is most regrettable, however, is to note how Shadow Blade basically does not possess any distinctive feature: every element of the game - from the settings to the characters to the level design - knows already seen, conveying the feeling that the Dead Mage developers wanted to limit themselves to carrying out a little homework without trying too much in creative terms. A laziness that manifests itself in certain junctures of the adventure and that has its climax in the final stages of each world, simple arenas in which it is necessary to kill all the foreseen waves of enemies: beyond the fact that in this way the weakest component of the gameplay (the fights, in fact), one can only be disappointed with a solution that seems far too comfortable. Having said that, we are still talking about a product offered for sale for less than two Euros, which in any case entertains to the right extent without however infecting the player with advertisements and invitations to in-app purchases as the most recent malpractice imposes. Among the merits of Shadow Blade, a very good graphic component must also be included by right, commendable above all for the use of bright colors and for the excellent quality of the animations.", "date": "2014-01-20", "grade": "7.5"}
