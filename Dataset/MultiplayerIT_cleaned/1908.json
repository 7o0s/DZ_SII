A REVISED AND CORRECTED RPG There is no doubt that it is an RPG, but that it is a canonical RPG... no, it is not at all, in fact it differs quite a bit from the classic Japanese-style RPGs with their linearity, instead embracing the genre in a more western way, which is demonstrated not only by the non-linearity of the unfolding of the actions, but also by the subjective view, typical of fps. As soon as you insert the DVD into the console, a short film will start in which a voice will urge you to wake up from sleep and tell you that you have been chosen to perform an important task; after the movie you will find yourself on board a ship where a character with pointed ears will ask you for your name which you can type with the pad; once this is done, a guard will let you go up on the deck of the ship and, let me tell you, the feeling you get when you get on it is truly incomparable thanks to the splendid colors used to reproduce the sea and the whole landscape in general in which you are at. Be that as it may, another guard will welcome you to Morrowind, (in particular you are in the port of Seydan Neen), and will ask you which race you belong to: at this point you can choose who you want to play during the adventure. You can choose between Argonians, Bretons, Dark Elves, High Elves, Imperials, Nords, Orcs, Red Guards and finally Wood Elves, each characterized by its own specialties such as resistance to poison or fire and many others. Once you have chosen your race, you will enter an internal environment where a character will ask you for your class and your zodiac sign. As for the classes, you can choose one of the 21 already available, alternatively you can choose to answer questions in such a way that, based on your answers, you will be assigned one, or you can create your own ~personalized~ class by selecting 5 skills primary and 5 secondary. The various selectable classes can however be grouped into three categories, namely classes specialized in combat (warriors, barbarians, etc.), classes specialized in magic (magicians, healers, etc.) and classes specialized in the arts of evasion (thieves, spies, etc. ). Each character will be characterized by primary and secondary attributes, each of which corresponds to one or more skills: for example, the ~strength~ attribute is associated with the ~armourer~, ~blunt weapon~, ~axe~, ~long blade~ skill. ~ and ~stunt~. As for the zodiac signs, 13 are available and each one will be characterized by certain skills but also by particular weaknesses. However, it is logical to create a character as ~coherent~ as possible, i.e. by choosing a magician for example, it will be useful to select from the 13 available zodiac signs the one who brings benefits in the field of magic with his astral influences. Now you will have created your character and you will be able to start the adventure with the peculiarity however that you don't have the slightest idea why you are in Morrowind... the only thing you know is the fact that you are escaped from prison by order of the Emperor. Don't worry though, since your first mission will be quite simple, which I think is the right thing to avoid that the less patient or experienced player gets tired of playing prematurely due to ~not knowing what to do~! After a long wait, Morrowind has arrived! WALKING THROUGH VVARDENFELL... As in any rpg, even in Morrowind as you play you will have to level up your character, improving his skills and to do this there are three ways: 1) use a specific skill as often as possible , for example by walking a lot you will increase your agility or by using a certain weapon you will learn to handle it better and better 2) be trained by a character upon payment of course (as it is true that the whole world is a country!!!) 3) read a book and learn the secrets about the skill. The level advancement will take place when you get 10 points in total, that is for example three points in a primary skill and seven in a secondary one...etc. During the adventure you will meet many pngs (non-playing characters) with whom to interact, and the feeling you get walking in the city among its inhabitants is really realistic and fun. With each character you will be able to interact and converse and in every moment what you do or say will have repercussions on the unfolding of the game. In this regard, the AI of the characters will be excellent in the early stages of the game, expiring a bit when you realize that if you ask a character the same thing several times, he will always answer you in the same way... but, guys, for how realistic,it's still a video game! Definitely not a simplistic video game though... far from it! The interaction with the environment is total; think that any object you will find, starting from cutlery to candles and so on, you can collect and store in your inventory and then use it at the right time. Furthermore, you will be able to make new spells or potions yourself, in addition to the ~default~ ones present in the game and this, if on the one hand it could create a certain confusion in some of you who are not yet rpg experts, it certainly pushes the depth to high levels and title complexity. A further difference compared to the classic rpg, a difference that probably won't please many, is that the fights, in addition to not being very frequent, are structured in a different way, that is, they are not turn-based fights, like the ones we are dealing with. been used to games like final fantasy and many others... THE XBOX PAD... It behaves very well in managing the character: with the left stick you walk or run depending on the pressure you exert on the stick; then there is a button for the inventory, the map and the spells, one for the main actions such as speaking or opening a door and finally the two buttons for jumping and attacking; the right analog stick instead takes the place of the mouse ...so let's say that the control system is Halo-like ! (strange if you consider the two completely different genres, but very functional in both cases). After a long wait, Morrowind has arrived! EVEN THE EYE WANTS ITS PART... Here we are at the purely technical judgment... in my opinion everything that appears on the screen, even if it won't make your jaw drop to the ground, is of excellent workmanship, with texture always up to it and with that water... so beautifully crafted that it looks real! The settings are really evocative and in this regard I wanted to tell you my impression: more than the purely technical aspect of the creation of the environments, what struck me is the feeling that comes from walking through the world of Morrowind, among its hills and its trees, while you observe the sun as it travels across the celestial vault until night falls, during which you will stop several times to look at the stars ... beautiful and poetic, there's no denying it! The effect of the gradual appearance of objects on the horizon is also well done, thanks to which, for example, a tree will not appear suddenly but will do so slowly as you get closer, showing more and more details. The only notes I feel like making on this aspect concern the fluidity... mind you, it's not that it's not fluid enough, it's just short pauses during loading and some inconstancy in the framerate, but fortunately nothing that affects playability anyway . After a long wait, Morrowind has arrived! MUSIC MASTER! This aspect of the game is also well done, and if you have a 5.1 system you can enjoy positional audio that will immerse you totally in the adventure; even the music, albeit a bit repetitive in the long run, blends perfectly with the dreamlike and surreal atmosphere that characterizes the world of Morrowind. Too bad, however, that not only the speech, but also the subtitles have not been translated into our language ... a serious shortcoming in my opinion! CONCLUSIONS What can I say...despite the (few) criticisms leveled at the technical aspect and the AI of the characters, the final judgment can only be positive for this fascinating, intelligent title with an incredible longevity. But, as I said at the beginning of the review, this is not a game for everyone. If you love RPGs and don't believe that so much vastness and freedom of action can discourage you then don't think twice, Morrowind is the game you were looking for and it will keep you glued to the TV for weeks and maybe months. If, on the other hand, you love frenetic action and the adrenaline that a fps gives you, and you don't have the desire or time to rack your brains over a video game, then Morrowind could prove to be too demanding a choice. After a long wait, Morrowind has arrived! The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is the sequel to two games that saw the light on PC in 1994 and 1996 and which respond respectively to the names of Arena and Duggerfall, RPGs that stood out for their vastness of settings and their interactivity of the all innovative. The programming of the game in question began no less than 5 years ago, and now that we finally have the xbox version in our hands (I remember that the pc version has already been available for a few months), we realize how Morrowind wants bringextreme limits the player's freedom of action and interactivity that distinguished the prequels, in a game in which mysticism, cultures, magic, bizarre creatures, thieves, elves and warriors come together to give life to a gaming experience that many fans of the genre will define UNICA! Yeah... I said MANY enthusiasts... but not ALL. Some will find the game flawed in its best intentions; having a totally explorable world available, in which there are no rigid schemes to follow and in which everything you do will have consequences on your destiny, could prove to be a repetitive and dispersive gaming experience for some of you. But let's go in order ... for those who want to arm themselves with a lot of patience and feel they have the soul of a true courageous adventurer in them, I will try to illustrate in detail the various aspects of the game starting from the ... PACKAGING Inside of the case you will find in addition to a conspicuous manual, a geographical map of Vvardenfell which is precisely the archipelago in which your adventures will take place ... this will certainly make you begin to immerse yourself in the magic and dreamlike charm of Morrowind.", "date": "2002-11-27", "grade": null}
