Therefore, it is difficult to invent something really new in a subject so common and widely explored by countless games, and that is why Miniclip with the here present Football Strike has preferred to refer to the used safe gameplay launched by Flick Kick Football, adding just just don't make it a simple carbon copy. Attackers VS goalkeepers The approach taken by the developers is that of a title almost exclusively oriented towards online multiplayer, with games that take place between two randomly selected users who put a pre-set amount of coins on the plate to participate, generating a jackpot which then ends up as a prize to the winner at the end of the match. Not even here we are talking about something particularly original, but it is a tested system and here again it proves to work properly. Like Flick Kick Football, Football Strike is also based entirely on set kicks, with the player having to swipe across the screen to establish the speed and trajectory of the shot that will be taken by the soccer player on screen, with the obvious aim of scoring as many goals possible. However, unlike the illustrious predecessor - where the challenge factor was represented by the silhouettes of the defenders to overcome to put the ball into the net - here the focus is centered on the duel between the attacker and the goalkeeper, two roles that it is necessary to try to interpret in the best possible way if you want to win games. We therefore alternate first in the shoes of the striker who has to pierce the net and then in those of the goalkeeper called to dive to intercept the opponent's shots: of the two, this last part is undoubtedly the one that works less, for demerit of a non-impeccable detection of the user's swipes, a factor that can cause sensational butterfly exits. An undoubted advantage of Football Strike is instead that of not settling on a single register but of trying to offer a minimum of variety, as can be seen from the further items that can be selected from the main menu. In addition to a convenient section useful for practicing without disbursement of virtual currency, it is possible to challenge another player in a free-kick competition in which whoever scores the most points by hitting the targets that appear inside the goal wins, and there is even a Career mode which offers a series of challenges characterized by increasing difficulty and modifiers of various kinds. Even with all possible efforts, a gameplay like that of Football Strike is in any case destined to be repetitive, and Minclip has therefore taken care to insert a whole series of small expedients to stimulate the user to continue kicking the ball: there are chests (in the form of sports bags) to be opened to obtain new customization elements and upgrades, trophies that guarantee in-game cash sums upon achieving certain objectives and even a sort of wheel of fortune that guarantees prizes of various kinds every day. The downside, as often happens in free to play, is the massive presence of several paid contents, which in some cases can lead to even the most unpleasant of pay to win: with quantities of virtual money that are very difficult to accumulate just by playing it is therefore allowed to purchase not only exclusive uniforms and accessories (inspired by those of real teams such as Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund, Zenit St. Petersburg and others), but above all balls and skill cards that provide improvements such as to make the needle tip in an almost mathematical way of the balance in favor of the player who owns it.", "date": "2017-09-21", "grade": "7.2"}
