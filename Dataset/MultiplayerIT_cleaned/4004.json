With a year and a half of its career behind it now and some great titles that are hard to believe for hardware of this type, it is impossible to deny that Switch is however giving its best when it comes to games closer to the style of Guacamelee!. The riot of metroidvania and derivatives that has taken possession of the Nintendo eShop in recent months has shown how the hybrid (and above all portable) nature of the Nintendo console marries perfectly with this kind of experience. Just with regard to the first title of the Drinkbox series it was hardly possible to expect the opposite, given the previous appearance on the late PlayStation Vita. Now that the doubt about the technical quality of the port is resolved, let's start the Guacamelee review! for Nintendo Switch with stating that the Switch is the perfect console for this game and genre, once again. The Story of a Luchador For those who have never had the pleasure of crossing Juan, Tostada, Uay Chivo and Calaca on their way, know that they represent one of the best light-hearted interpretations of Mexican luchador folklore and tradition. Juan, the protagonist of the story of Guacamelee!, is none other than a wrestler who finds himself entangled in a situation much bigger than him. To remedy the problem generated by Calaca and his army of skeletons, he is introduced by the luchadora Tostada, to discover the mask that will change his life. Wearing this, in fact, Juan becomes the greatest luchador ever and, through a journey that will take him from caves to small settlements, from giant trees to hell, we will follow the bizarre events and we will get to know a large group of villains, to stop on the way to the clash with Calaca. The Guacamelee! campaign, in its ten hours of duration, will accompany you in the discovery of an extraordinary and colorful world, full of secrets to be identified and also able to give away some interesting boss battles. What makes Juan's journey special is the care shown by Drinkbox towards the Mexican tradition, treated with a level of passion difficult to find in other productions and which, over the years and the additions of the various revised and corrected versions, has not fact that raise its value to unimaginable levels. Play Guacamelee! it could be an all-encompassing experience not only for metroidvania lovers, who would be faced with a serious candidate for the best title of the genre in recent years, but also for all those who appreciate artistically brilliant works. The gameplay we know Guacamelee! it's a full-fledged metroidvania. This means that the progression in the game is marked by a series of levels more or less separated from each other, which have a multitude of passable crossroads within them. During the progress of the campaign and after the destruction of special statues, Juan will be in possession of new abilities, usable through the combination of the A key and the analog stick. We go from the simple head to the vertical hook, from the frog splash to the rope on the wall, passing through the possibility of transforming into a chicken (and reaching such inaccessible areas) and that of changing the realm between that of the living and that of the dead. These additions to its capabilities will allow the player to take advantage of the environment and new opportunities to reach previously inaccessible places, and thus go in search of new secrets and optional locations. The number of skills that can be acquired is exorbitant and what makes Guacamelee! unique in its kind is the possibility of using each of these also in combat. The combat system, in fact, is the most original and profound ever seen in the panorama of modern metroidvania. Keeping faith with the tradition from which it takes its cue, the Drinkbox title will put you in a position to chain attacks to create real combos, taking advantage of Juan's skills to perform special moves and conclude it all with grips capable of throwing forward enemies or perform suplexes in classic wrestling style. There is also the possibility of exploiting the change of kingdom to hit otherwise intangible opponents. To top it all off there is another feature, introduced only with the Turbo Championship versions, or that of accumulating an additional energy bar, capable of unleashing a superhuman force once activated, the Intenso. Juan, surrounded by a kind of flames, acquires aat unheard-of speed and its power increases dramatically, making clashes against a large number of enemies simpler and more spectacular. Even the two completely new areas of the revised and corrected version increase the challenge for the player, both in terms of platforming and combat, culminating in a climb that makes the famous Tule Tree envious, and in a clash with a trio of bosses very special and stylish. Technique at the service of style The technical aspect of Guacamelee! on Nintendo Switch is what makes it so unique at first glance. And this happens because the game engine is totally subservient to the reproduction of a stylistic figure of superfine quality. It is true that not everyone will be able to appreciate Drinkbox's aesthetic choices, but it is impossible not to recognize that the metroidvania on luchadores is a little jewel in stylistic terms. All drawn by hand, with a 2D so well done that it is hard to believe, is embellished with a fluidity and animations that are truly out of scale. To season such a high-level work we think the level design worthy of the best exponents of the genre which, helped by the possibilities generated by the skills, allows you to exploit the environments not only horizontally, but also with a verticality that we hardly happened to find somewhere else. The sound aspect is also a joy for the ears, with typical music that meets beautifully with the effects of the battles and environments in which we find ourselves passing.", "date": "2018-10-17", "grade": "S.V."}
