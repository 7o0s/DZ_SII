In fact, it was created by a team of veterans who have behind them projects such as BioShock and Dead Space. It is no coincidence that the title branded The Deep End Games has some points in common with both, while pointing in a completely different direction. We tried it, discovering that not all the good premises have materialized properly... Perception has finally come out of the dark, to drag us into the dark The devil from Echo Bluff Perception is based on a particularity which, combined with the background of its developers, has allowed The Deep End Games' adventure to hit the $150,000 goal on Kickstarter. This happened a couple of years ago when we thought the title would be released in June 2016 but things, of course, did not go like this. Among other things, some problems have been added to the delay: the physical copy which will not arrive in time for the launch, but the digital one has been in our hands for some time and will be available for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on May 30th . Having said that, let's go back to talking about the main peculiarity, not entirely new but still not abused, of a game which, although inevitably resting its foundations in the visual dimension, has a completely blind girl as its protagonist. Cassie, however, is lucky enough to be very intelligent, has sophisticated applications available to help her and hears us very well, so much so that she perceives reality in a way similar to that of Daredevil, using noises to build a mental image of what that surrounds it. Let's not talk, let's be clear, of abilities comparable to those of the Hell's Kitchen devil, but the surfaces that take shape when they are invested by the sound effects allow Cassie to orient herself in an airport and even in the snow, on the road that leads to a haunted mansion by voices, noises and mysterious presences. The gloomy villa located near Gloucester is an unsuitable place for a girl who, however resourceful, remains blind, but Cassie can't help but reach her, tormented by disturbing visions that come from a distant past. The story of Perception has its roots in the past finding its point of origin in the appearance of a dark presence that has left behind tragedies, ghosts and mysteries. Cassie, somehow tied to everything that has remained trapped in the mysterious villa of Echo Bluff, suddenly finds herself involved in a strange nightmare made up of cocoons, mechanical dolls and steampunk details that refer, as part of the style, to the roots of development team. At first things seem to make little sense, but room by room Cassie puts together the pieces of an increasingly disturbing puzzle, a mystery that leads us to a tree through a mad mother, drownings, fires and assorted dramas. All these events, told through vivid vocal flashbacks, represent the thread that we must follow, groping in the dark, crossing a house that changes around us and that takes us through time, towards the inevitable final twist intended to reveal a bigger design. Reaching it is not particularly difficult even if it is not the case to underestimate the threats that surround us. The house is haunted by a presence that constantly seeks us out and follows too much noise. When it finds us, or when we are targeted by other entities, the screen turns yellow and then, as the creature gets closer, it turns more and more towards red, warning us that we are one step away from the end and loading the last save automatic. In fact, we have no way of defending ourselves except by finding refuge in one of the innumerable hiding places scattered around the house which include baskets, large paintings, beds, curtains and so on. And they happen to escape by the skin of their teeth, feeling pleasant waves of relief, even if the creature isn't the most intelligent and the adrenaline is a side note for a dominant exploratory component, made intriguing by Cassie's orientation difficulties and the gadget with which the protagonist fills her sensory gaps. Hawk ears Sometimes there are no sound sources to reveal what surrounds us. This, it goes without saying, is a big problem for those who see with their ears, but when the world doesn't help our protagonist understand what surrounds her, she can beat her stick on the ground using sound waves to create a sonar effect. and it's a foundational mechanic in a game that explicitly asks us to give ourselves suspension of disbelief. And he asks us for different aspects which include aprotagonist who is frightened by a phone call when shortly before she found herself in front of a wardrobe that moved by itself. In these cases it's up to us to remember that Cassie is blind and that what we see on the screen is a much clearer representation of what the protagonist perceives. Once this is done we can enjoy a lot of dialogues between jokes, exchanges, phone calls from friends, mysterious messages, operator jokes for the application for the blind and tons of memories scattered around the house. All seasoned with gems that are used automatically but give depth to the experience between text-to-speech function that allows the mobile phone to read the texts, an application that puts us in touch with an operator in charge of describing the photos we send him , loudspeakers to be used to make some environments and some other gems permanently visible. In all of this, the game allows us to reduce the reflections of the protagonist, but considering the importance of the story, we advise against it, especially since the dubbing effectively accompanies us through the chiaroscuro of a title that confronts us with a few green lines and blue plunged into darkness. This is what we can see and although the effect produced by slamming the stick on the ground is pleasant, the graphics of Perception are undoubtedly modest. But it is at the same time functional to the condition of the protagonist who forces us to face walls, puzzles and threats almost gropingly, deceived by disturbing noises that dominate unchallenged, with the soundtrack which, excluding a couple of surprises at the end, remains confined to the smartphone of the hero. And it's a good thing that's the case because narrative dimension and atmosphere are the pillars of a title that is rather linear and far from difficult to deal with. Proceeding with caution is enough to neutralize most of the threats in a game that leads us by the hand towards every clue, in total contradiction with the condition of the protagonist, and which confronts us with puzzles that are too simple. Then, towards the fourth chapter, the danger suddenly becomes more intense and some action emerges which combines with an intensifying pace of dialogues, memories, noises and happenings. The adrenaline rears up and Perception finds its dimension, but the final act is still linear, it is rather short and has the defect of making us regret the fact that the first three chapters are not made of the same stuff. If we add to this some interpenetration, overlapping audio tracks, the absence at least from the current version of the 16-bit Mode 7 mode and some bugs, the result is undoubtedly below expectations, especially from the point of view of the mechanics and of the design. Yet the engaging narrative, some intriguing gimmicks and the continuous evolution of the house manage to keep the desire to get to the finale alive.", "date": "2017-05-25", "grade": "7.0"}
