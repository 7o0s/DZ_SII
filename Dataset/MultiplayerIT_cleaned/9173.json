The conversion on iOS, let's say it right away, is practically perfect and surprising not so much for the implementation of all the contents present on the other console versions - and all offered at about a tenth of the launch price on the other platforms, it must be said - but above all for the optimal adaptation of the control interface. The game is essentially Sega's answer to Nintendo's Mario Kart, with the gathering of all the most prominent stars of the publisher's historical catalog and their inclusion in an arcade racing game that makes the absurdity of the tracks and 'use of power-ups and weapons to collect along the tracks its key features. However, as befits an arcade racing production that boasts the field experience of Sega and Sumo Digital, there is a certain attention to the guide itself that balances the gaming experience in a balanced way between skill at the wheel and careful use weapons (in addition to the classic luck factor associated with these). Attention to the setting of the curves, the use of the drift system and the knowledge of the tracks and their secrets are essential elements for a good success in racing, both racing against the AI and against human opponents (locally or via Wi-Fi), which largely eliminates the feeling of randomness and confusion that in many other similar titles is determined by an excessive and indiscriminate use of bonuses and power-ups. This is perhaps the characteristic of the Sega game: the greatest pleasure derives from the driving ability where Mario Kart always reigns supreme in the balance of weapons and in their perfect use, without making direct comparisons from a qualitative point of view. The iPhone version All the abundant contents of the console versions have also been included in the iPhone App: alongside the standard race, which we find in the classic ~fast race~, ~grand prix~ (for points on a certain number of tracks), single player and multiplayer modes (local or online via Wi-Fi, working but still a little slow in organizing matches), we find other game modes that expand the possibilities of use. The classic ~time trial~ joins the ~Missions~, in which we find ourselves running following a very specific purpose (collect coins, cross portals and so on), the multiplayer battle mode, taken directly from the Marian tradition, is focuses on clashing with weapons and power-ups, while the points progressively earned with each progress in the game can be spent on expanding the roster of playable characters and the game's tracks. Therefore, there are no reductions in content, but the adaptation of the control system is what surprises most positively in this iOS version, proposing constant automatic acceleration and steering that can be carried out simply by tilting the device, with two keys dedicated only to drifting and brake/reverse in addition to that for power-ups. A minimum of practice is needed to better master the control via accelerometer, but above all by raising the sensitivity a little, everything becomes very intuitive after a few minutes of play. Although it is certainly not the first driving game on the iPhone to exploit this solution, we have not often seen such a precise response to inputs and in particular such a successful synergy between this type of control and the performance of the races, considering in this the shape of the tracks and the rhythm of the game, with its long drifts to be carried out with great simplicity and able to give a great sense of speed. From a graphic point of view, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing is the perfect small reduction of what was seen on the major consoles and perhaps a step forward, at least as regards the definition, compared to the Nintendo DS version: not very complicated polygonal models but a 'huge amount of elements run fast and fluid to the sides of the screen, with the typical Sega colorful and bright style to characterize everything, from the tracks to the game menus, while with the various characters belonging to the publisher's historical catalog you travel the tracks that recall his greatest successes.
