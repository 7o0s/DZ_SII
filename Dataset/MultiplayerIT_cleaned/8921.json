Unfortunately Kerberos found itself forced to launch an incomplete version of the title on the market due to financial problems that threatened to kill the project. The result is a tiring journey through difficult menus, glitches and problems of all kinds. But under the hard shell there is a strategic complex, suffocated and to be refined, but also to be discovered with scientific and diplomatic stations, mysterious races, planets to colonize, random events, weapons of all kinds, fleets to create, complex planetary statistics, trade, combat and secrets. The star maps then, apparently smaller, contain many more planets and are much more pleasant to explore. In short, the potential, as for the first Sword of the Stars, is there, but how much do the defects weigh? Let's find out. Lost in space To welcome us we find captivating menus and screens full of atmosphere. But, as anticipated, the suggestive radial indicators and the aesthetics do not correspond to the actual quality of navigation between the title's options. One of the most worrying signals is found directly in the graphics settings, which ask us to set the desired resolution by typing it manually. In the HUD there is obviously a nice big button with a question mark at the top but this is limited to indications on a single screen without giving us clues about the in-depth management of provinces, ships and planets. A real problem given the complexity of the Kerberos title which immediately presents itself as a tasty morsel but decidedly difficult to digest. Sword of the Stars II is in fact a massive game that adds statistics of all kinds and numerous management variables to the already complex formula of the series. Between fleets, bases, automatic missions, general government, statistics of all kinds, editing of the provinces and increase in factors related to diplomacy and morale, there is something to get lost. To keep the population happy it is necessary to have a careful management of finances, worry about security, build research stations and also diplomatic stations, which are essential both towards other empires and to facilitate the internal management of the provinces. In addition to this there are also the research, which is also more complex, and the fleets, complete with admirals and related special abilities, for a very articulated title but unfortunately made difficult by an interface that is both dispersive and incomplete. To find some basic information it is possible to use the manual, the old-fashioned way, but this certainly cannot compensate for the defects of the interface. And in any case, it lacks useful information about the complex management mechanics of the title that determine the health of the provinces and therefore of our commercial network. Fortunately, there are also features that make things easier, such as automatic management of missions. The fleets are in fact able to accomplish objectives and automatically return to the base without the need for the player's intervention. Obviously in the case of fleet-to-fleet combat, the matter passes into our hands, but as regards the rest, from colonization to exploration, everything can be managed automatically. Unfortunately there are no commands capable of stationing a fleet, perhaps to guard a border, without necessarily taking action. But despite the imperfections of this feature, the defects of the interface transform it into a real game-saving decree. Touches of class and galactic thuds Although a single player proper is missing, the maps, to which two have been added with the latest patch, are extremely customizable with detailed settings about the technological level, the initial assets, the difficulty, the possibility of having random encounters or that of trigger catastrophic events such as a meteor shower. The encounters include the fearsome ancient races but can also reserve pleasant surprises and, like random events, contribute to giving a sense of life to the universe, partly balancing the lack of a campaign or more articulated scenarios. To further vary the gameplay Kerberos has then implemented, both in single and in multiplayer, various conditions related to victory that substantially modify the gameplay. We range from the annihilation of the adversary, in absolute or even military terms, we pass from the development of the planets and the fleet and we arrive at the percentage of control of the territory in a grand strategy style. Obviously each of these modes changes the player's priorities even if it is always better to have a valid onefleet to face all possible attacks and unexpected events. The multiplayer does not differ from the single even if the human antagonists are undoubtedly less predictable and tend to improve over time by experimenting with the statistics and challenging the interface. To remain competitive it is necessary to be willing to do the same but in the case of Sword of the Stars II we are talking about really massive timing. Disconnecting does not cause the game to crash and it is possible to set the AI to continue playing in our absence. It is also possible to block your slot or leave it open to players designated by us. The strategies available for the artificial intelligence that has to replace us in the event of a connection drop or absence are Maintenance, Defense and Expansion. The first will see the CPU only engage in research, leaving our empire unchanged. The second will put the AI on the defensive. The last one instead will see the CPU play at full speed with attacks on enemies and attempts to conquer. A universe full of life The playable races of Sword of the Stars II are Humans, Hivers, Tarka, Liir, Zuul and Morrigi and represent as many factions, each with its own expansive strategy, which have evolved by exploring the galaxy thanks to Faster Than Light technology. But there are other breeds out there. Some populate single planets but it is said that they do not have particular abilities to be discovered through the use of scientific stations. In fact, research occupies a very prominent place and allows you to magnify the strengths of the factions, such as shields or weapons, and to fill the gaps that distinguish the technology of each playable race. But there are those who keep even more impenetrable secrets and have been wandering the galaxy since time immemorial. These are the Elder Races that do not always welcome us with open arms and have left various devices, often very dangerous, to wander in space. Player VS Interface Combat takes place in real time unlike the management component which is turn based. But even in this case Kerberos has managed to get in the way of a difficult interface to say the least. Irresponsive buttons, unintelligible icons, and an increased difficulty in selecting and directing your ships turn a potentially fun space RTS into an incredibly strenuous activity. Fortunately, many bugs have already been fixed with the first patches but the interface, which needs a lot of practice and some guides written by extremely willing players, should be redesigned. Furthermore, before fighting it is necessary to manage with dignity the management component directly connected to the combat which includes fleets, admirals and ship editors with the various weapons it makes available. In fact, the risk is that of being swept away, after having worked so hard to give the correct orders to the ships, without even understanding why. In any case, practice can work wonders and it is also possible to have fun experimenting, provided however that you turn a blind eye to bugs and assorted shortcomings. As we said, the ship editor, which allows you to change the structure and specifications of the buildable vessels, is also an important element for combat and is also the apparently most intuitive one of the title with icons indicating the customizable parts such as engines, additional modules for cargo or crew and of course the armaments. These can also be tested in a special shooting range created with the game engine which allows you to actually try the effects of our modifications. Too bad that generic targets and lack of specific information on weapon effects make this addition practically superfluous. A title of this kind would in fact need an intuitive and rapid information system with comparisons between the effects of the weapons, the shields of the enemies and details on the numerous variables. At least it lets you watch The factions are clearly differentiated both in terms of aesthetics, with pot-bellied or tentacled ships, and in terms of strengths and weaknesses. The style remains between sci-fi and oriental cartoon and from an aesthetic point of view the jump is clear with excellent lighting, capable of enhancing explosions and lasers that abound in combat, and valid animations that underline the peculiarities of the ships such as organic protuberances or huge reactors. The sound that envelops and lets itself be enveloped by the evocative spatial depths is no less. Too bad for the lack of a Story Mode and Scenarios that would undoubtedly have benefited from the peculiar aesthetic identity of this intergalactic 4x. Although improved, the visual sector also bears the signs of the early release of the title and features glitches di all sorts of which stand out numerous uploads also to switch from one menu to another. Given the incomplete nature of the title, the immediate purchase could be a gamble, unless you want to support the team. In any case, given the speed with which Kerberos got to work (after all, the plan was to release the title on the fly to raise cash and complete it on the run) the various gaps in the title could be filled in a not excessive time. After the first adjustments, a substantial patch has already arrived with various tweaks and fixes that include additions to the encyclopedia, improved icons and the elimination of a long list of bugs.", "date": "2011-11-22", "grade": "6.0"}
