Less than a complete turn of the calendar has passed since the release of Anno 1404, and, not even time to get used to its already excellent foundations, the developers have released in record time an expansion pack in which they have been included, as well as several improvements and added, even some features expressly requested by users. In the century that divided the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, at the helm of the most powerful city of the time, new adventures, missions, discoveries and challenges await us. New scenarios and unexplored horizons Year 1404: Venice does not try to revolutionize the experience of enthusiasts, but rather to change and expand it in such a way as to increase the longevity of the already impressive parent, offering 15 new scenarios in addition to those already present and a whole series of goodies. It should be noted that the expansion does not focus on large numbers of buildings, units or other easy-to-wear details, as add-ons often do: in fact, there are a couple of new ships and buildings and the management scheme remains almost unchanged. The novelties are all enclosed in a few but very effective features which with their simplicity are able to improve what already seemed perfectly balanced. The most important of these is certainly the new system of espionage and sabotage which allows, not only from the slogan of the package, to destabilize and annihilate the enemy without even wasting a warship or an army, in the perfect style of those the Venetians: it is in fact possible to send undercover agents in enemy cities and establishments and, provided that it manages to achieve the objective, order a series of sabotages which, depending on the building in which they are committed, can have a different effect on the tranquility of the town. starting from burning the villa of some patrician up to assassinating someone or directly inciting the population to revolt, perhaps after you have been the cause of the lack of food used as an excuse to incite the masses. It is also possible for the precursors of chemical warfare to poison the waters in such a way as to cause pestilence. There is no shortage of ad-hoc sabotage designed to exploit the weaknesses of certain opponents: against Turkish factions, for example, it is possible to send dancers to engage the inhabitants of the houses and false prophets to spread heresies. Common places? Maybe, but the comic and farcical style with which everything is represented certainly cannot give rise to offenses from anyone. But be careful that the enemies tend to send agents in turn, so it is important to continuously inspect your buildings and create a good police system to contain any damage caused by the new Ezio Auditores away. Still with a view to a system centered on more or less sneaky mess-ups, each city now has a council to which the player must account for his actions and have his actions approved. By the way, you can buy seats in opposing cities to infiltrate your own agents directly into the enemy's decision-making system - they definitely got the Venetians at Ubisoft all figured out. The filings of the case Graphically speaking, Anno 1404: Venice was able to positively surprise us. Already the basic title defended itself with a respectable graphic sector, able to offer pleasant glimpses and more than successful effects, although the price in terms of engine heaviness was quite high. In addition to being decidedly lighter than its predecessor, perhaps thanks to imperfect optimization work in the past, Venice improves further with a beautiful series of models inspired by the lagoon city, which seems to reappear bright and detailed as it has never been, very different from the darker vision of a city full of intrigues and subterfuges given in another title that saw her as the protagonist: Assassin Creed II. No complaints on the sound front, nor on the spot on character voices, while perhaps something more could have been done in terms of ambient sounds, which turn out to be few (albeit good). The computer AI system is excellent, able to present us with both good commercial partners and adversaries, not inclined to commit senseless or ridiculous actions as often happens in titles of this kind (suddenly broken alliances, suicide attacks) but rather always ready to welcome the proposals with a smile, only to then secretly send an agent to set fire to the ship with the player's share of the loot. Inmultiplayer trigues Compared to its predecessor, this expansion finally offers a multiplayer mode in which up to 8 players at the same time can compete for domination of commerce, both in LAN and via the Internet, through the scenarios present in the expansion and exploiting its various features. The implementation of the multiplayer, which took place at the express request of the enthusiasts, demonstrates how the interaction between users and developers can give remarkable results, giving hope that other software houses will decide to follow the example and listen a little more to the opinion of the their customers, or that Ubisoft itself does it on other fronts, such as DRM.", "date": "2010-03-29", "grade": "8.0"}
