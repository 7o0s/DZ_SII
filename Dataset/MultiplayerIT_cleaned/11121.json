{"name": "MySims - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mysims-recensione.html", "text": "Bravo, very good, I'm like lightning, I'm the factotum of the city Having ~physically~ created your alter ego through a vast menu of choices of faces, hair, clothes and even vocal timbre, here you are arriving by train in the charming town you have to take care of. A quick visit to the mayor and off to the first assignment: build a house. Because it is precisely through a myriad of subgames and missions given to you by your guests that MySims will proceed. The construction, for example, is very similar to that of the progenitor of the series: you have land and different materials, so get busy with your imagination to obtain at least a habitable environment. However, a house must also be furnished, and so here you are looking for raw materials to create furniture and tools: wood. The city is full of trees grown without a reason and in a mess that can be cut and recycled. Furthermore, each object, and also each person, will give you ~essences~: these essences can be used to give a certain ~tone~ to the objects. The requests are in fact very different from each other, and they range from the young DJ to the surly museum director, who prefers an austere and gothic home: how to make a piece of furniture suitable for his needs? By adding a few negative essences (or even ghosts) to his piece of furniture through yet another sub-game (the laboratory) and here is the misanthrope more than satisfied, or, with musical or happiness essences, the DJ will be just as happy. You will also be able to collect apples, fish, have social relationships with citizens (ranging from chatting, dancing and giving gifts) to arrange roads and fountains, all so that the town returns to attract citizens and tourists. Despite the large amount of reliable and feasible tasks, don't think of MySims as a complicated game: in reality all the actions are uniquely repetitive and it will always be a matter of clicking the left mouse button, regardless of what you have to do. MySims is visibly aimed at a young to very young audience and unsuitable for the veteran gamer who enjoys a real challenge or those craving an adrenaline-pumping experience. Repetitiveness is around the corner and the absence of real difficulties (basically just go back and forth collecting the right essences and materials) will make the gaming experience all too simplistic and devoid of surprises. We certainly didn't expect snipers or alien invasions, but something in this direction could be done (a fire to put out for example). Oh what a beautiful life, what a beautiful pleasure... Technically speaking, MySims is mainly affected by two factors: the first is that it was designed for two less graphically performing consoles than a PC, the second that it was probably created for the little ones. In fact, the characters are incredibly cartoonish and their vast range of expressions takes directly from the emoticons used on the internet, the style and animations. The enormously disproportionate head towers over a squat and simplistic body which could be that of a Lego man, and the general animations, however fluid and pleasant to look at, are affected by the extreme mechanicalness given to three-dimensional models. But the background is all the more astonishing: the blades of grass moving in the wind are very pleasant, the flowers that grow slowly are bucolic (if you have sown them, of course) and the ripples of the water are poetic... the buildings are decidedly less satisfying: immobile, not very detailed and immutable, never dirty, the curtains never move, a very similar argument can be made for the interiors, valuable to look at, but also terribly static. From the sound point of view there is not much to say: the characters, as per tradition in the series, speak a language of their own that is incomprehensible to the player (at least in speech, the writing is subtitled, and it is also possible to choose which answer to give, style graphic adventure) and the background music is pleasant but repetitive, the environmental sounds, however rare, are well made but also irrelevant. A sound sector equal to the rest of the game: relaxing, calm and repetitive, far from being a masterpiece. Comment MySims is a pleasant and even educational game: the simple steps and the pleasant and unreal graphics make it perfect for the little ones while the more experienced or more ~violent~ players will find it boring at times, repetitive at others and generally frustrating: l The impossibility of hitting those annoying little men who demand everything and never say thank you weighs enough. For the others, there is an entire city in decay just waiting for its savior: good luck to all. Pros Your children and siblings will like it Many subgames Virtually infinite longevity...
