Barring particular surprises, this umpteenth journey, more or less new based on one's previous experiences, will prove to be the last antecedent to that Kingdom Hearts 3, which we have been waiting for about ten years now. Moving through a couple of major chapters and a myriad of secondary iterations, we talked for a decade about how each new exponent would be the definitive link to the third numbered title in the series. And so came the various Birth by Sleep, Coded, Unchained and so on. Needless to hide behind a finger, we all knew at the release of the two previous collections - the I.5 and the II.5 - that Square Enix, Nomura and his entire team would find a way to bring the last chapter back to the home console important released on Nintendo 3DS: Dream Drop Distance. With the upcoming release of the previous remastered on Playstation 4 and the addition of this latest iteration, the circle will be complete and perfect. Nine titles that together form the path of the saga waiting for that tenth, which will put an end to everything. Nothing can stand in the way of reaching the conclusion of this journey that has lasted more than fifteen years. So let's go and see how this Kingdom Hearts II.8 presents itself on the market, analyzing the three works contained within it and locating it in an increasingly confusing time line. Kingdom Hearts II.8 HD is the conclusion of a unification work that accompanies us to the grand finale! X back cover For those who got lost several years ago in the infinite amount of titles that the series has generated, they will surely be displaced by the presence of a real film within this collection. Kingdom Hearts X Back Cover does nothing but enclose, in about an hour of scenes in total computer graphics, what is the path lived by the masters of the five factions of X - first Japanese browser game, then transformed and perfected in its mobile version with the addition of the Unchained denomination, which only came to us last summer. If the very pleasant portable title tells a story set a thousand years before that of Sora and his companions from the point of view of a series of children able to use the Keyblade, the film presents us with the political and power implications of the masters of those same children, as well as the events that led to the first, very famous, Keyblade war. Assuming that anyone accustomed to Kingdom Hearts knows what we are talking about, for all the others it is enough to know that, in a universe poised between light and darkness, very few individuals are able to handle artifacts - the so-called Keyblades - which we know be of three different types (light, dark and of people's hearts). These weapons of boundless power are capable of bringing either peace or chaos, based on how they are used. Although the development of the thousand years preceding the beginning of the adventure of Sora and his companions is not really known in detail, the certainty is that of not wanting to replicate that bloody war which has been narrated for the past millennium. In practice, the experience translates into about an hour of good scenes, decently written and even better animated. The visual impact is far from that of other Square Enix film productions, but we cannot hide a certain pleasure in seeing what Kingdom Hearts could become if it became an animated series. According to Nomura himself, this totally new and unpublished work, precisely because of the portion of the story it tells, can be used at any time and without the need to be inserted before or after another title from the same collection. By narrating facts so distant in time, the only purpose it fulfills is to give a context to the Keyblade war and therefore add another piece to the general picture. What makes Back Cover even more important than its own position in the history of Kingdom Hearts is the fact that it definitively exposes Nomura's desire to relegate the relationship with Disney to something totally marginal. If it hadn't already been understood for several years, the collaboration, initially fundamental within the project, has gradually turned into something secondary. Therefore, Back Cover of Disney characters is completely devoid of them, if not through a vague reference to a universe initially united under the name of ~World of Fairy Tales~. A final note regarding Back Cover should be made on the production effort relating to the cast of exceptional voice actors. No high-sounding name like the main series which includes (goes) the never too late Christopher Lee in the role of Ansem the Wise, but everything is still of the highest qualityllo, with actors already tested and recently heard also in Final Fantasy XV. Dream, fall, distance Talking about the remastered version of Kingdom Hearts 3D is both easy and difficult at the same time. In the first case because it is a work that makes you cry out for a miracle for how it manages to bring a Nintendo 3DS title from five years ago to the PlayStation 4. On the other hand, because this very miracle makes it difficult to describe the operation as a simple remastered. Also regarding this, Nomura had been quite clear in recent weeks, stating how the re-release of the portable title could be considered a real remake. Not only from an aesthetic point of view, but also as regards the readjustment of the mechanics linked to the double screen and the touch nature of the platform on which it was conceived. First things first: Dream Drop Distance takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts II and Kingdom Hearts Coded. With a well-established group formed by Sora and company, Yen Sid is ready to warn the Keyblade lords of the possibility that the master Xehanort has returned to his human form after the defeat of his Heartless Ansem and the respective Nobody Xemnas. King Mickey's mentor is therefore determined to submit Sora and Riku to the test to decree or not their official passage to the rank of Masters of the Keyblade. The two are thus sent to an alternative form of the past in which they are called to close the seven locks of the ~sleeping worlds~, those places closed in limbo and not entirely free from the darkness. This pretext has allowed, among other things, to insert new worlds for the series next to the old acquaintances. Finding themselves in the Middle City, Sora before and after Riku, they will meet a series of characters who take the place of the old inhabitants of the city. Goodbye Final Fantasy and welcome The Worlds Ends with You. The crossover in this case takes the form of the characters of a 2009 Square Enix title for Nintendo DS, a questionable choice but justified by the platform for which the title was initially intended. Another extremely particular peculiarity of the title is represented by the ~fall~, a means through which Sora and Riku will discover at their expense that they are not in the same version of the worlds they will visit, but in two parallel realities within which they will live their stories in totally autonomous way. Two campaigns inextricably linked to each other, but alternated by a bar, that of the ~fall~ in fact, which will be discharged regularly during the use of a character until it falls asleep and the immediate change of playable alter ego. This mechanic, which only Nomura's madness could be able to bring about, where on Nintendo 3DS it was so fast as to become frustrating, has been extremely softened in this re-edition. Therefore, the times for emptying the bar and the duration of the fractions with each of the characters have lengthened exponentially. Speaking more specifically of the adaptation of the title, it is incredible to note how each of the mini-games and activities present in the portable version has been adapted and brought back in this remastered. There are the ~dives~, comparable to the old gummiship routes; or the simple but never too obvious possibility of using the DualShock 4 touch pad to caress one's spirits, to which we will return shortly. The ~fluid motion~ and the ~change of reality~ are back: characteristics on which the combat system and exploration are based and which essentially consist in the possibility of exploiting the environments to move quickly and in hitting enemies with particular attacks, in based on the specific action taken. Spirits, as mentioned before, represent one of the two faces of the new creatures introduced in this chapter: the Dream Eaters. Difficult to summarize in a handful of characters the amount of variables that these little creatures can generate, but it is enough to know that there are two versions of each Divorasogni: the nightmare and the spirit. While the first represents the new real threat of balance, the second feeds on the nightmares themselves and for this reason it is possible to create and hire various types of them. Here is also Kingdom Hearts approaching the prevailing ~collect them all~ from Nintendo. Each of the spirits has its own level, a fortunately not too stringent affinity system and a personalized skill tree, on which to spend the so-called union points and unlock commands to be entered into Sora and Riku's consoles. A system similar to that of Birth by Sleep, but which takes full advantage of the introduction of these new little creatures. We conclude the excursus on the adaptationof this Dream Drop Distance talking about the aspect that most leaves you speechless: the visual impact. The fear that we would be faced with a title that is really difficult to digest on PlayStation 4 was rampant. Nomura and his team, on the other hand, amazed us, managing to reproduce almost all the environments in high definition, which certainly do not stand out for their depth or destructibility, but which are a real miracle considering the starting platform. The character models have substantially higher polygons, and all the particles have been recreated from scratch, coming frighteningly close to those featured in the Kingdom Hearts III prologue. An incredible work related to this remastered / remake, which will not fail to set new standards within this slice of the market and which pushes us to warmly recommend the title also to all those who have already played the game on a laptop by now five years ago. Playstation 4 trophies The collection boasts a total of 70 trophies, divided into 55 for Dream Drop Distance and 15 for Birty by Sleep 0.2. Where the first boasts 47 bronzes, 5 silvers, 2 golds and the coveted platinum, the brand new chapter has to settle for 13 bronzes, 1 silver and 1 gold, thus lacking the most coveted trophy. The tasks remain more or less always the same. We find the request to finish the campaigns at various difficulty levels, kill a certain amount of enemies and unlock the various secret and top secret endings. There will be a lot of play to reach 100%. A fragmentary passage It's the moment of truth, the first taste of a home Kingdom Hearts two generations away from that unforgettable pearl that is the second chapter. With the help of Unreal Engine 4 and a generation gap which is the only element capable of repaying the wait, we got our hands on this prologue. Trying to avoid talking about the plot of the title as much as possible, also given its fleeting nature in terms of longevity, it is enough to know that the events take place after the end of Birth by Sleep. Aqua, master of the Keyblade, Kairi's initiator of the use of the weapon and brotherly friend of Terra and Ventus, is determined to find a way to find her friends and for this she embarks on a journey that can take her out of the Realm of Darkness in which she remained locked up at the end of the chapter for the Sony laptop. With these premises, the entire narrative arc of the title takes place, able to answer a few of the questions left open and introduce many others. Nomura was clear: this prologue must be played as the last element before the next Kingdom Hearts III, and it actually turns out to be a real prologue. From the gameplay point of view, being the incipit of the next numbered chapter of the series, we return to the classic setting of attacks and spells. The command menus disappear and the mana bar is consumed again every time a spell is cast. However, this has not prevented the development team from integrating some of the innovations of the last ten years. Hence the ~Focus~ reappears, an indicator capable of recharging through the damage done and which allows you to launch a series of attacks in succession, against a number of previously highlighted targets. Next to it are the ~situational commands~, which are nothing more than the union between the reaction commands of the second chapter and the command styles of Birth by Sleep. What emerges is a whirlwind of screen effects, variety in combos and spectacularity that it is difficult to remember in the videogame panorama. Kingdom Hearts has always been the festival of colors, but in this case what we are facing goes beyond any possible imagination and seeing a classic Blizzaga that transforms the Heartless into icicles or a Bramamagia that makes Aqua twirl by releasing profusion particle effects is visually crazy. There's not much more to say about a title that, when it takes off and you can't do without it, ends leaving a bad taste in the mouth of an adventure that lasted a handful of hours. Beautiful, interesting, which portends a third chapter capable of concluding the saga in the best way, but which is nothing more than a beautiful taste. It is right to spend a few lines on some nice ideas such as that of the wardrobe: this is nothing more than the aesthetic customization of the protagonist, with an inordinate amount of clothes and accessories that can be unlocked after completing a series of objectives. Although extremely marginal, these are elements capable of prolonging the experience of true ~completists~.", "date": "2017-01-23", "grade": "8.5"}
