The desire for Dead Space stemmed more from the desire to return to those game mechanics than from the need to give further explanation to Isaac Clarke's nightmarish adventure, which at the limit managed worthily even blocked as it was at the end of the first chapter , uncertain and suspended in sidereal space. In the same way, the well-oiled mechanisms of new generation survival horror seemed to not even need a major revision, appreciable as they had already presented themselves in the first chapter by a good portion of the public, although the alleged ~woodiness~ - to tell the truth distinctive character of the game mechanic itself - has not made inroads into all hearts. However, the prospect of a sequel still feared some disturbing ghosts for those who had appreciated the first chapter: two million copies sold on the three reference platforms could not be a very positive result, considering EA's approach to the brand and the 'impressive investment made at the launch of the progenitor with lots of multimedia initiatives in tow, including comics, anime and assorted spin-offs. The main fear for this second chapter was therefore the possibility that the publisher would tend to distort the brand in an attempt to offer it as a more mainstream product in order to maximize sales. Fortunately, the fears turned out to be unfounded, not so much due to a complete absence of remodeling of the product, but rather due to the quality of the operation carried out by Visceral, which on the solid basis of the first chapter has built a partly different sequel, overall very similar but ultimately better than the progenitor as a whole. In several respects the comparison with the first two cinematic Aliens comes to mind: the first terrifying, seminal and profoundly ~alien~, the second more rounded and packaged in a more canonical and enjoyable product, more corresponding to the film form, but at the same splendid way. Similarly, the production of Dead Space 2 shows clear signs of meticulous commercial planning, but the final result still has a strong and unmistakable identity. It's not over yet The beginning of Dead Space 2 is one of the most intense seen in recent years in a video game. Among visions, memories and nightmarish images Isaac Clarke finds himself in the midst of an infestation of necromorphs, unarmed and prevented from moving. There is no time for the tutorials that video games have accustomed us to these days, the first thing to do is run away without looking back and on the other hand Isaac has already been through several to need help (~I did a quite a bit of practice~, he cuts short when the inevitable interlocutor-guide explains to him that he has to shoot the limbs of monsters) and in his passage through hell he has evidently also found his own personality, discovering himself reactive, heroic and at times even ironic . What will not fail to strike the veteran player is Isaac's new position in the narrative fabric. One of the most characterizing choices, albeit dubious, made for the protagonist in Dead Space was his ostentatious silence in the face of the events of the game. A choice perhaps dictated by the desire to create a direct link with the player in the style of Half-Life's Gordon Freeman but which certainly clashed with the protagonist's sentimental involvement in the story, with his personal mission in search of his beloved. This characteristic has been abandoned in Dead Space 2 which presents us with an active Isaac, tormented by memories and lacerating inner dramas but also by an unshakeable decision to carry out his mission, protagonist this time as the engine of the story rather than a simple and stunned witness. This has allowed the construction of a much richer and more lively plot than in the first chapter, always rather closed within long wanderings from point A to point B but enriched by engaging dialogues and more profound characters, as well as changes of scenery and continuous and radical settings inside the base (the ~Sprawl~) near Saturn where we find ourselves operating, a much wider and more varied environment than only Ishimura (in any case an important presence also in this sequel) which characterized the progenitor as the only horizon. On the other hand, the premises at the origin of the story are completely different: no longer the discovery of the ohorror in search of the loved one but the awareness of an inescapable destiny, the conviction of having to fight against an army of aberrant monsters, an entire government of ultra-religious technocrats, against one's own love obsessively settled in the subconscious and, ultimately , against themselves. Space engineer A feature particularly appreciated in Dead Space also returns in this second chapter: the weapon upgrade system. During the levels we come across various workbenches where Isaac can show off his engineering skills by changing the power, capacity, reload speed and alternative fire of the various weapons. This is done by spending the precious ~nodes~ conquered for levels within tree graphs that allow a personalized choice of upgrades to be made. Space is dead, long live space The game structure has remained the same, excellent, of the first chapter beyond minor evolutions that enrich the experience. Dead Space 2 is therefore a full-blown survival horror, an expression with which we identify an action game with a third-person view, with a horror setting with some minor ~puzzle~ components and a generally sustained difficulty given by the great aggressiveness of the enemies and the relative shortage of support elements (ammunition, energy). Borrowing characteristics from similar titles, Visceral have managed to put together a gameplay that manages to stand out and take on its own and characteristic identity, also thanks to various particular choices. There is no doubt that there have been influences from other titles of the genre, first of all Resident Evil 4, but there are several distinctive elements. Starting from the combat system based on the dismemberment of enemies, to be hit in their deformed limbs and transformed into real weapons, which requires a rather precise aim to save ammunition and keep threats away. The traditionalist player will certainly notice the lack of the HUD, with all the information provided directly by the protagonist's suit and by the weapons themselves and shocking, at first, it can be the absence of any ~detachment~ phase from the game, given that the Access to inventory, shops and the weapon upgrade 'bench' happens in real time, without pausing the action, which of course helps keep the tension high. As a good space engineer, Isaac Clarke can count on a couple of special abilities related to kinetic and gravitational energy, and channeled by the suit that allows him to move objects at a distance via telekinesis and momentarily block (or slow down) objects moving through the ~Stasi~, the latter consumable and rechargeable. Generally, the puzzles - indeed quite rare - that we come across during the game are also based on these two special abilities, which usually require the activation, repair or modification of various futuristic machinery by the engineer Clarke. The impression (but a precise count has not been made) is that the ~puzzle~ moments have decreased somewhat compared to the first chapter, but we could also be led to think so simply by the greater amount of enemies and clashes that follow one another along the I walk. Xbox 360 goals 50 unlockable achievements for 1000 points are the maximum loot available in Dead Space 2. A part of these are related to the progression between levels (but not many), most are distributed between particular requirements to be achieved in single player and in multiplayer . The complete collection is a rather difficult undertaking but within the reach of the true enthusiast. Something is changed The major changes implemented in this chapter are perceived above all with regard to the level design, since the expansion in the extension of the scenario has made it possible to eliminate one of the defects that stood out most in the first chapter, or the frequent use of back tracking. Having to deal with the entire Sprawl and its surroundings, the graphics were able to indulge more in even significant variations of the setting. We then find ourselves crossing corridors similar to those of the Ishimura but also bizarre and unexpected places such as a school, a subway, a church, aboard a huge excavator and much more in a succession of different events, scenarios and situations that , at least for a good part of the game - but with a certain decrease in pace towards the final part, it must be said - they follow one another without stopping. The variety of situations, imposed by a succession of events resulting from a careful and rhythmic direction is also amplified by the new management of the zero gravity zones, inserted in arather uncertain in the first chapter and here you become real multidirectional levels thanks to the new possibility given to Isaac to hover in the air thanks to the stabilizer rockets, which also allow incursions into open space with breathtaking views, in every sense (apart from the beauty of the graphic sector, the amount of oxygen in the suit is in fact limited and must be kept under control). Some choices have clearly been made to better fluidify the game action, such as Isaac's greater agility (almost imperceptible but present) and a more balanced difficulty balance that eliminated those frustrating points that were needed in some sections of the first chapter (damn asteroids!). In any case, it is not an easy game, even at the medium level the last sections are an extremely demanding challenge, in particular due to certain new types of enemies that we do not feel like revealing here. As regards this aspect, however, there are few changes compared to the first chapter, with some new necromorphs added which however do not distort the already tested combat mechanics (apart from the new entry mentioned above). Even the new weapons introduced, each obviously equipped with its specific alternative fire, do not represent shocking introductions for the balance of the game and veterans will probably continue to prefer the good old plasma cutter or the powerful line gun, although some new ideas, such as the javelin launcher capable of impaling enemies and blocking them, represent an interesting novelty. Multiplayer Despite the efforts made in the construction of the mode, the multiplayer is little more than a filler, a gaming experience that, although fun for the first few hours, is not comparable to that in single. Basically these are matches with two opposing teams: on the one hand the humans (basically various clones of Isaac Clarke) and on the other the necromorphs, with a particular scoring and rewards system that allows you to evolve your fighting skills by unlocking progressive skills (similar to what happens in Call of Duty). The use of ~monsters~ is perhaps the funniest element in the entire sector, given that it is a decidedly new perspective, but in principle the modality in question seems more like a distortion of the spirit of the game. The beauty of horror The graphics engine developed by Visceral has already given excellent proof of its capabilities in the first chapter of the series, but in Dead Space 2 it seems to have taken a further step forward. The characterization and graphic style are the same as the progenitor, with its particular angular and aseptic vision of the structures and technology that contrasts clearly with the organic corruption of the monstrous aberrations with which we find ourselves fighting. The monolithic grayness of the Ishimura is relieved here by the staging of an entire city and its surroundings, which allowed the graphic designers to indulge themselves more in the representation of larger and more colorful environments, in some cases characterized by particular lights and colors that are unpublished for the adventures of Isaac Clarke. Some moments, within the well-crafted script, manage to amaze and amaze in their spectacular nature, in particular as regards some glimpses of exteriors and certain exits into open space often characterized by a particular yellow and cut light capable of giving a touch characteristic to the photography of the entire game. There is very little to reproach the developers in terms of graphics and sound, which are confirmed to be of the highest level and characterized by a further evolution compared to what we saw in the first chapter, above all as regards the variation imposed on the levels, which moreover they occur in greater numbers than the progenitor (15 chapters that require about a dozen hours to be concluded). The only note, from a personal point of view, concerns the level of violence which in some cases is almost excessive and in any case makes the game absolutely not recommended for a very young audience, as on the other hand the PEGI 18 should make it clear. Last consideration: the tested version is entirely in English and our hope for the Italian localization (which will obviously be complete: texts and dubbing) is that it is of the same level, possibly without repeating the Dario Argento case.", "date": "2011-01-24", "grade": "9.2"}
