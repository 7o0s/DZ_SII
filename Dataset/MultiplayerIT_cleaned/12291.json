{"name": "Exit 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/exit-2-recensione.html", "text": "I am the one who will get you out of trouble So goes the motto of Mr. Esc, undisputed master of escapology, the only man in the world able to save all people in difficulty with only his wit and agility. Exit 2 faithfully follows the structure of its predecessor: the protagonist is grappling with 10 different settings, each of which consists of a further 10 levels with variable difficulty. The player's one and only purpose is to bring all the characters to safety within the level, studying their structure in order to mediate the various abilities of the people encountered along the way and to bring them safely to the exit door before the time limit you inexorably reach zero. The levels are structured like the games of past generations: platforms, blocks to move, lifts and objects to use to ~unblock~ the path and thus continue on one's path towards freedom; the control system reflects the absolute simplicity of the game: one button to run, another to grab objects and all the rest of the work must be done thanks to the skill and intelligence of the player. To underline even more the strong connection with all that genre of games of the past, the Exit levels do not allow mistakes: if the order of the actions to be performed is wrong, the only solution to continue is to rely on the classic ~ try again~ to restart the level, moving in a different - and hopefully more sensible - direction. The second pivotal point of Exit, the pivot on which the ~puzzle~ element of the game rotates, is determined by the types of characters to be saved, which differ not only in their anatomical aspect but above all in their ability to interact with the inserted elements within levels. The boxes -for example- can in fact be moved only by certain categories of characters, others can make long jumps, still others are not afraid of water and finally there are those who are unable to perform any task -wounded- who need to be carried shouldered by Mr. Esc or another of the saved. The saved characters can be controlled in a completely independent (and parallel) way to Mr. Esc thanks to the use of the analog stick and the use of the Triangle key, with which to perform the actions, moving to a particular point of the stage and above all recovering precious objects -sometimes unattainable- for the great escapologist. Because of this interlocking skill it is therefore absolutely necessary that the actions of saving and exploiting the saved are carried out in a precise and careful order, this is in fact the only way to successfully complete the level in game. Due to the many levels and the developer's ability to customize the levels both according to difficulty parameters related to the presence of obstacles and actions related to the characters, the game features an excellent level difficulty calibration system, where the former are used as a real training ground for understanding the tools in play, while the latter represent a real challenge even for the most demanding players. For those really not accustomed to either Mr.Esc's skills or the ~save and run~ game mode, Exit 2 offers all players an additional set of 10 levels used as an opening tutorial to the game, very useful for understand the commands, the athletic skills of Mr. Esc and above all to explore in detail all the abilities of the types of characters to be saved who will then meet during the game, a tasty preview to the game as well as a real tool of learning escapology. In addition to the now classic 10x10 structure of the levels present in the game, it is possible to download further extensions to the game via the internet thanks to the packages made available on the game's official website, a great way to extend the Exit escape experience. The game modes end here, but two particular mentions must be made: the first goes to the option that allows the player to see the profiles of all the characters saved in the game, a real card containing the date and city of birth, hobbies and particular information, absolutely useless but to commend the imagination of the developers in creating more than 300 different profiles; second special mention at the end credits, in all respects a very long level of the game to be faced by commanding Jet, the bitter enemy (and colleague) of Mr. Esc, the man equipped with a Jet Pack who prefers to save people by flying for the stage. Absurd as it may be, although Exit differs from many other products for an absolute simplicity of the controls, it is proprio in this element that resides the main defect of the game: the imprecision Absurd as it may be, although Exit differs from many other products for an absolute simplicity of controls, it is precisely in this element that the main defect of the game resides: imprecision. Defect already widely present in the first chapter of this saga on the escape, the developers for how much effort they have made have not managed to file too much the presence of a series of shortcomings of the control system; Mr. Esc's jump is probably one of the elements most affected by this imprecision, given that the game - due to its puzzle structure - often requires that you overcome obstacles with jumps which, if badly executed, lead to the game over screen . Another of the elements still unfortunately lacking is the AI of the characters to be saved, often really difficult to move especially between one floor and another of the level, with the obligation to study their path in stages (for example: ledge-staircase escalator, escalator-object) and thus lose precious seconds, especially as you progress through the levels. All defects on which it is possible to postpone and which do not drastically affect the gaming experience, but which it is hoped that in the probable Exit 3 they will be filed once again until their complete elimination. Graphically Exit 2 is as beautiful as the first and perhaps even more: the minimalist style, line (which seems to wink at the school of comics of the caliber of Spy Vs. Spy), colored with absolutely saturated palettes that give it a particular retro touch. The audio sector will certainly not remain in the history of video games, the ~jazzy~ tunes are more able to tire (if taken in large doses) than turn into catchy songs and above all the samples of the characters' voices are repeated by them until death, from the moment they appear in the video until they are saved (the fact that some levels often last several minutes clashes hard with this element). Comment Exit 2 is a beautiful puzzle, built on ancient and certainly still well-functioning foundations, all implanted on one of the most bizarre and beautiful graphic creations on the PSP. The one hundred levels available make it a decidedly long-lived game, and the levels that can be downloaded from the official site extend the gaming experience even further. Unfortunately Tecmo with this chapter innovates very little compared to the first, evidently riding the wave of success encountered to propose a game extension enriched with a few new features. The usual problems with the control system should be noted which, although not weighing excessively on the value of the game, still represent a further obstacle to enjoyment. Pros: Definitely long lasting. Well calibrated difficulty. Extra levels to download via the internet. Cons: Poor controls in some key situations. Understated music. Too much the same as the first. Escapology. For years this word has been used only and exclusively in the field of illusionism, indicating the ability of magicians (or illusionists) to know how to free themselves from straitjackets, cages and so on. For some, escapology is as good as the survival instinct, there are those who have made it an art of escaping from the most renowned prisons in the world and still others -like Tecmo- who have even managed to create a video game around it. Exit, this is the name of the game in question, is not an escape manual from the worst imaginable situations, a compendium built solely on the player's ability to be able to put each piece in its place to clear the way to freedom. When about a year ago Tecmo showed up on PSP with Exit it was a real surprise: a game with decidedly stylized graphics, with a simple and accessible structure in which the only aim was to be able to rescue a certain number of characters within small 2D environments full of obstacles. Going against the tide but appreciated by the public and critics, the sequel to the adventures of Mr. Esc has finally arrived in stores, in the perennial and constant search for a way out: Exit 2.", "date": "2007-05-11", "grade": null}
