{"name": "Seattle mi fa morire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/136644-infamous-first-light-seattle-mi-fa-morire.html", "text": "Hard life in Seattle. It always rains and it's cold even in summer. And if you are disbanded, without a home and with serious drug addiction problems, it is even more so. Nothing a healthy dose of superpowers couldn't fix, but how the X-Men teach different scares the community. Better to hide, in short; living off her wits and dreaming of a new life in Canada. This is the life of Abigail Walker, the Fetch we met in Second Son and her brother Brent, the only person who understands her and who can rein in the rage that can explode in a flash of purple neon. inFAMOUS: First Light is not quite the DLC we all hoped for: too bad Playstation 4 trophies inFAMOUS: First Light rewards the player with 25 trophies, divided between the campaign and arenas. The easier ones are related to the minimum completion of the challenges, killing enemies with the Stasi and with the Singularity. The silver ones, on the other hand, besides being the most, make us very busy in arenas and speed races in the city. Gold and Platinum are for those who thoroughly dissect First Light, both in terms of completion rate and Story. City lights First Light tells a part of Fetch's life, a very dramatic part, the long period that made her become a ruthless assassin thirsty for revenge. To stage its growth Sucker Punch has chosen to divide this stand-alone DLC (ie it does not require Second Son) between present and past. Flashbacks, two years earlier, see Fetch and his brother in Seattle, while ~today~ recounts his training at the hands of the usual Brooke Augustine in the mega prison Curdun Cay. The player, in the three or four hours of duration (going rather quickly, without completing all the secondary ~tasks~) moves between these two temporal planes, useful not only from a narrative point of view but also in terms of given gameplay that training (in the future) gives us new abilities to use in the past. In short, super powers that go beyond space and time. First Light's Seattle facility is exactly the same as Second Son's but in Bignami format. Meanwhile, the map is smaller, we can, indeed we must deviate from the story missions not so much to try alternative game solutions to the main ones but only to allow us to earn the points necessary to boost Fetch. In fact, growth passes through the collection of Lumen globes, that is, we have to support numerous speed competitions or collect them as usual throughout the city, often suspended above the roofs. Unfortunately there isn't much else. Being the DUP's control over Seattle at the beginning there are no strongholds to destroy or checkpoints, there is also little to fear from the Police, but also from the Akulani, despite these playing a fundamental role in the early parts of the DLC. It's a bit of a pity because if already in Second Son the city wasn't particularly alive, now it's even less alive, few civilians and few even those who should shoot us on sight. In this sense, we immediately invite you to play First Light on a difficult difficulty level: artificial intelligence shows all its flaws here since it cannot count on the brute force of numbers as in the past and except for very rare occasions it is difficult to die: super speed and the super jump allow us to survive with relative ease. Without forgetting that going forward the powers of the neon immediately become very powerful, lethal both from a distance and up close. It goes without saying that the progression, given the duration of the DLC, is a rather rapid game of strength and already after an hour we are real war machines, complete with an Anomaly smart bomb that we manage to reload quite quickly once used. The curiosity of wanting to unlock the upgrades is therefore the only reason not to jump headlong into the story missions, undoubtedly not very exciting even if they are fairly varied between sniping, escort, ~investigation~ and drone hunting sections. Mind you, the fundamentals of combat worked in Second Son and they work now, but it's all very easy (and with very close checkpoints) and even when the armored soldiers of the DUP arrive, the danger is relative. The final section in this sense is a little better, the wide spaces and a setting different from the city one are a breath of fresh air, but even here the game puts its effort into making the player's life too easy. A totally failed DLC, then? Not exactly. Narratively speaking, First Light is really well written; the origins of the protagonist fit perfectly into Second Son and the ending is really perfect as an introduction to the Fetch we met last spring. The partbest of this expansion are the arenas. There are three, with a different level design and to be played with two distinct game modes, ~objective~ and in a sort of horde mode, all under the banner of the competitive drive given by the world rankings and by a score multiplier system that it pushes us to always throw ourselves into the fray. They are much more fun, frenetic and rewarding than city fights and above all more difficult, especially the last arena. Furthermore, something not to be underestimated, they are made up of a whole series of challenges that give us numerous points to spend on upgrades. And if you have the final save of Second Son on your PlayStation 4, you can also play them with Delsin, without restrictions, good or bad. Where First Light makes its mark is in the technical part, and this is known by still being dazzling by the visual lashings of Second Son. Bathed in practically constant rain, Seattle is the usual show of lights and refractions, with signs (there's even the one from old grunge memory, Sub Pop!) and the purple of Fetch's neon lighting up the streets like discos. It's just a pity that there are few people to enjoy the show. But the panorama of the bay at sunset is also a true spectacle, a little less so, however, are the models of some secondary NPCs, without forgetting the aforementioned artificial intelligence that has given us behavioral pearls bordering on glitch.", "date": "2014-08-27", "grade": "6.8"}
