{"name": "Kingdom Two Crowns: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kingdom-two-crowns-recensione.html", "text": "The Kingdom from which the series that brings us up to this review starts is a Flash game published online in 2013, whose success then prompted the independent Noio team to also create a desktop version, which arrived on PC and consoles to then be converted also for mobile devices. The good feedback obtained by Kingdom New Lands in the various locations then led to the creation of a real sequel, published these days on the screens of PC and console owners with the name Kingdom Two Crowns. A game very similar to its predecessor, with respect to which however some too punitive aspects are filed and the ~two crowns~ that make up its name are added, linked to the cooperative mode through which to play together with another person. The platform on which we tried Kingdom Two Crowns was Nintendo Switch, probably the one that best suits its use due to the characteristics of the game. But let's not waste any more time, because Kingdom Two Crowns undoubtedly deserves to be discovered in detail: the kingdom needs us! Plot and gameplay: beware of the crown Kingdom Two Crowns starts with a brief introduction, in which we are shown the protagonist (or the protagonist, randomly) of the game: a landless ruler, accompanied by a ghost towards the small camp from which to build his own kingdom. Starting from four pieces of wood, the goal is in fact to expand and bring prosperity to a group of people to grow in number, gradually integrating other workers who can contribute to our cause. If you don't know Kingdom, reading these words you will be thinking that Kingdom Two Crowns could be a classic strategy, made up of menus with many elements. In reality, there's nothing more wrong: the interface doesn't have any window or other element, while the control system is based on very few buttons, through which you can move the ruler and collect or distribute precious coins. In fact, the player has the task of exploring the various levels in search of them, then deciding whether to invest them in the construction of other pieces in his camp or in the recruitment of people who are found in the surrounding areas. The latter can be transformed initially into builders or archers, and then add other types of units to the list over time. Carefully planning your investments is the fundamental aspect of Kingdom Two Crowns, given that the kingdom does not live in peace. What we do during the day is threatened by the so-called Greed at night, little monsters who, with the favor of the moon, come to attack us systematically. At this point, therefore, the defenses that we have set up become fundamental, understood both as walls capable of withstanding the attack until the morning, and as archers placed in their vicinity. Apart from numerically defining our army, we are left with nothing else: who goes to fight and how they do it is completely managed by the CPU, thus making us simple spectators at this stage who can only pray that the arrows hit. In fact, archers do not have an infallible aim, and also for this reason we would have liked to have been able to have a more incisive role in this phase without being forced to only look. In the event that things go wrong and our ruler loses his crown, the roguelike dynamics of the previous chapter give way to something a little lighter, allowing the player to restart from the rubble of his kingdom with a new ruler. In addition to being less punishing, in this way Kingdom Two Crowns allows the player to explore the various islands that make up the campaign mode, where you can establish new camps to be enlarged to go exploring in search of other additional elements. Among these there are, for example, mounts other than the horse that we find in the dowry at the beginning, but we won't go any further and leave you the pleasure of discovering everything. Graphics: a 16-bit picture At first glance, Kingdom Two Crowns is yet another title that relies on 16-bit graphics to appeal to the most incurable nostalgics. Although there are actually many other games that have resorted to a vintage style by now, Kingdom Two Crowns still manages to stand out for the care of all the elements that are on the screen. We therefore start from the wonderful backgrounds, never repetitive, to the maniacal care towards the details of the structures and the people who populate our kingdom. With such a beautiful title to look at, exploration is also naturally encouraged, allowing the player to attraversing forests populated by deer and discovering all the additional elements we were talking about previously. Since we haven't done it yet, it is good at this point to clarify that the dynamics of the game take place only in two dimensions, thus allowing us to go only to the right or left while our actions are reflected by the watercourse that is in the very first floor. If you're the type of gamer who likes to stop and contemplate what they see on screen, Kingdom Two Crowns will give you a lot to enjoy while also taking advantage of the great soundtrack and audio effects made by the developers. The cooperative mode is for now only of the split screen type, but the possibility of playing online should be added in the future. Playing together with a friend it is possible to count on two sovereigns on as many mounts, thus obtaining quite important benefits: while one of the two goes in search of coins, for example, the other can stay in the camp and decide how to invest them, thus saving time precious towards the arrival of the night and therefore of the Greed. If faced alone, Kingdom Two Crowns can in fact be quite difficult in some moments, as well as repetitive due to a game structure that is still based on the need to collect and then expand.", "date": "2018-12-14", "grade": "8.5"}
