For In Space We Brawl, the all-Italian team Forge Reply started from this last factor, the ~therefore~, pledging to put the controls in the hands of as many players as possible as soon as a working prototype was developed. All in a free, improvised, genuine way, the kind we like to identify with the beauty of the concept of ~indie~. Many of the hours of playtesting, thanks to which the Milan-based studio was able to understand if its idea had concrete potential and then polish it, expand it and balance it, in fact, did not take place in a controlled environment, but were carried out by taking a build functioning of the game, a table and four camping chairs and taking them for a walk through different squares of Italy, with the aim of putting the controller in the hands of as many ordinary people as they pass by. An approach with which we tried to recreate as close to reality as possible what would have been the concrete usage scenario of the product he was working on and which, results in hand, definitely paid off. In Space We Brawl reviewed, an all-Italian indie surprise for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 Sputnik Leading Like Ken Masters In Space We Brawl is a slightly different twin stick shooter: instead of aiming to survive hordes of various kinds, to maximize a score or to mix with various forms of adventure, between exploration and puzzles, the Forge Reply title aims at pure competitiveness by looking towards an apparently very distant dimension, that of fighting games in matches, but which in fact proves to be very close. The aim of the game is in fact to win against the direct contenders, defeating them round after round. Two to four users can therefore go down to an internship and beat each other up, until only one remains (intact). In short, we start by taking the controls in hand like a Geometry Wars or a Super Stardust and we end up playing something that looks a lot like Power Stone and Super Smash Bros., proving that we have understood their essence perfectly. Because In Space We Brawl works, entertains and above all is able to keep you glued to the screen, game after game. There are 11 shuttles available which, in addition to basic parameters such as speed, life, secondary energy and so on, in some cases can also differ from each other in terms of constitutive characteristics (the self-regeneration of the Cypher, the circular saw of the Grinder). Added to this is the possibility of choosing from as many secondary weapons, ranging from classic laser beam machine guns, from manually steerable missiles to cannons that work with a sniper rifle logic, up to a sword capable of parrying blows and piercing opposing barriers and a tractor beam that allows you to capture an object and throw it with varying effectiveness, depending on how skilled you are in exploiting the acceleration and inertia of your ship. In short, the range of approaches that can be experimented is really wide, allowing to identify the ~Ryu of the situation~, with which one hopes to be able to get away with even if the game has been in hand for a few minutes, supported by particular solutions, which require more sophisticated and much more insight. The formula is further stratified and mixed when environmental variables such as asteroids, solar storms, black holes, CPU-driven aliens and other external factors enter the equation, which can represent a danger but at the same time an opportunity to be exploited against rivals. All of this is enhanced by two widely configurable modes (Championship and Tournament), where it is possible to choose to play in teams, possibly even in three against one, with the outnumbered participant who can count on the support of turrets controlled by an AI . In short, Forge Reply demonstrates that it has a good knowledge of the playful and psychological mechanisms underlying experiences of this type and above all that it knows how to apply them effectively. It is also enough to think of a small but pungent twist such as the bounties that can be placed ~in the dark~ on others (or even oneself), an element that introduces a pinch of chance and sharpens the rivalry, through which to try to further round off the final score and soar on the podium. Play trophiesStation 4 In Space We Brawl is a PlayStation 4/PlayStation 3 cross-buy with practically minimal differences in terms of graphics and functionality, which effectively become null in terms of Trophies. 21 the number of objectives implemented, some of which concern the Challenge mode and are quite easy to obtain, as well as some substantially linked to the frequency with which multiplayer is played, while others will really make you sweat, such as the one that requires obtaining a S in each challenge or to kill 250 opponents with certain secondary weapons, in case you find that you don't have much personal feeling with one of them. For four, but not for all In Space We Brawl is an arcade capable of re-proposing the fun of couch multiplayer, rubbing shoulders with friends, of classics such as Micro Machines. By its nature, it is therefore not recommended for everyone. First of all, solitary players, who should carefully read the warnings: the only concession to them is the Challenge mode, where you face a series of challenges aimed at teaching the fundamentals of the gameplay and some of its peculiarities while being judged with a . A process that, among other things, also serves to unlock elements to be exploited in multiplayer, a bit like in the typical single-player fighting game modes, reaffirming the spiritual affinity between two such different areas. Attempting to improve in the 21 tests (some of which are really demanding) can take away a few hours, but that is absolutely not the real raison d'tre of the Forge Reply project, whose soul and body lie elsewhere, i.e. in sharing the experience with others. And it is precisely in the sharing methods that the biggest problem of the Italian team's proposal lies, attributable instead to the very characteristics of the package it intended to propose: In Space We Brawl does not have any online game functionality, limiting itself to local multiplayer, a lack that precludes the possibility of having a good time for anyone who cannot organize game sessions so easily with fleshy acquaintances and joypads.", "date": "2014-10-17", "grade": "7.5"}
