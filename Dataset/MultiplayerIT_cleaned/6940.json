{"name": "Calciando con le stelle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/136776-soccer-stars-calciando-con-le-stelle.html", "text": "Soccer Stars rightfully falls into the category of applications whose title has little or nothing to do with the content they offer: in fact, here there is no trace of soccer stars of the caliber of Messi or Ronaldo, and to be honest, the playful subject is not it's not even the game of football proper. Soccer Stars, on the other hand, is a sort of revised and corrected version of Subbuteo, with a marked predisposition to multiplayer and a free to play model that is honest enough to allow you to play even without spending real money. So let's see if, despite the rather misleading name, Miniclip's product deserves to be downloaded... Soft streak Soccer Stars could be defined as an old-fashioned free to play, or one of those titles that without too many frills offers a very simple gameplay alongside an interface and a technical realization that defining functional almost seems like a compliment. The Miniclip developers are evidently faithful to the rule which does not necessarily require a mobile product to be very elaborate in order to win the hearts of users, and have therefore staked everything on immediacy. Soccer Stars is based on one-on-one matches, with each user having five pawns available with which to try to send the ball into the opponent's net: you take turns, holding down a finger on the desired puck and dragging it back to define the trajectory and the power of the shot. The first to score two goals wins (three in the most advanced leagues), in a game system that is truly accessible to anyone but which does not disdain tactical nuances which - combined with ballistic skill - can be decisive for victory: beyond of the possibility of choosing between different formations for one's pawns, it is good practice to use a minimum of strategy to decide which element to move, in order to avoid, for example, leaving one's half of the field completely unguarded, allowing the opponent to have a free line of fire. A mix of immediacy and depth that makes Soccer Stars rather fun and exciting, even if not immune to some hints of frustration since it often happens that matches are decided more by the good fortune of a player rather than by his real skills, perhaps with goals which arrive thanks to clearly fortuitous banks and rebounds. We are also sorry to note that, although there are no technical limitations in this sense, the Miniclip product does not support local multiplayer, a decision evidently made to feed the game's internal economic system which we are now going to illustrate. Soccer Stars is a fun and immediate free to play with very minimally invasive microtransactions Money football Each game played in Soccer Stars requires both challengers to pay an entrance fee in gold coins (the main virtual currency of the title), which goes to make up the prize pool that the winner will win. It is possible to choose between seven leagues, different in cost of participation and consequently also in reward, with the more advanced ones that probably collect the most experienced players and therefore the most difficult challenges. A system that leaves the door open to the possibility of running out of coins, an eventuality that in theory would force the user to resort to the appropriate internal store of the application to buy packs of tokens: fortunately, Miniclip hasn't been too zealous in this sense, allowing anyone to get free coins by watching advertisements or by requesting a small free amount which can be drawn on at most once an hour. Every day, then, the game offers the opportunity to try your luck with a slot machine that pays out in the precious currency needed to play the games. In short, it is really difficult to find yourself with your back against the wall forced to put your hands on your wallet in order to move forward, with the developers who have preferred to tread their hand on extra elements, these yes put on sale at prices that are difficult to sustain only with victories in game: you can buy new formations, different designs for the pawns (inspired by the flags of the various nations and beyond), scratch tickets or slot machine shots, all of which are absolutely not essential in terms of gameplay. Also on the entertainment front, Miniclip performed excellently: in addition to single games against random opponents, it is possible to challenge one's friends, participate in knockout tournaments or train alone to refine one's technique.", "date": "2014-09-01", "grade": "7.8"}
