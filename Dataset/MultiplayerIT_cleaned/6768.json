Each room of the abandoned mansion represents an enigma, a piece of a puzzle which, once composed, will provide the answers we seek. Or maybe not. Over the course of the scarce three hours needed to complete the adventure, created by the Italian team redBit Games, we are faced with rather traditional situations, but in a mix between ~point and click~ and puzzle game with hidden objects. The static scenarios can be explored from multiple angles depending on the case, revealing different views that perhaps allow you to get in touch with key objects for the continuation of the story: a rocking clock, an antique record player, a mosaic, an electronic device or more . The gameplay of the game basically consists of this mix of exploration and interaction: you have to discover the secrets of each room and collect levers, wooden boxes, pieces of glass, artifacts and everything that lends itself to combining with a part of the room. 'setting for us to be given a clue or to be able to access a small hidden treasure. In terms of management, which is the first aspect of the experience with which one has to deal, the work done by the developers appears attentive and punctual, without flaws, which certainly does not represent the norm in the mobile sector and within of this particular videogame genre. Unfortunately the objective of the scare is not achieved, or at least it is difficult for a shrewd player to be taken aback by some sequence. Haunted Manor 2 - The Horror Behind the Mystery offers a good mix of puzzles and hidden objects Thrill Fans of Myst-style adventures already know what to expect from Haunted Manor 2 - The Horror Behind the Mystery, and from this point of view the game does not disappoint, lavishing a generous amount of puzzles to solve and organizing the visit to Sterling's house in a way to divide the areas into watertight compartments, without ever resulting in backtracking. Likewise, the touch interface is simple and immediate, given that you just need to touch a point in the scenario to interact with it or reach it. There are no visual cues as to what can be done where, which forms the ~hidden object~ component of the experience - the challenge of locating hard-to-see objects and placing them in the inventory for later use. In the presence of particular devices and puzzles, a second element also comes into play, that of clues: a laid table, for example, gives us a precise scheme to apply to a composition so that it reveals its secrets. These annotations are automatically inserted into a notebook that our character always carries with him and that we can freely consult, but whose indications often do not represent a decisive aid in solving the puzzles. As often happens, there are in fact situations a little more obscure than others, or mechanisms that are particularly cumbersome to use (see the marble puzzle in the early stages of the adventure, which reacts decidedly badly to touch inputs and forces an extremely long and frustrating); however this does not affect the enjoyment of the game, which manages to maintain its solidity up to the (great?) finale. Without acute details, without proposing revolutionary solutions (also in terms of technical realization, even if the work done on the audio sector should be appreciated) and therefore without attracting a different user from that of lovers of the genre, who will certainly find themselves at ease among the dark rooms of this umpteenth haunted house.", "date": "2014-11-12", "grade": "7.5"}
