Deathtrap, I choose you! Despite her slender appearances and cheeky look, Gaige (this is the name of our Mechromante) is endowed not only with a nice temper, as evidenced by the Echo tapes that provide a minimum background, but above all with a series of skills that make her an extremely interesting class and adaptable to various styles of play. Merit of a skill tree with three very different branches, and above all of a truly ductile active skill: in fact, this allows Gaige to summon Deathtrap, a flying robot capable mainly of attracting the attention of enemies and hit them with deadly melee slash. Put like this, the Mechromante class might seem like a simple variation on the theme of the Commando and its turret, but such a labeling - however justifiable - would certainly appear limiting. The three branches of skill in fact allow you to model a character very different from the one played by Axton: two branches focus mainly on the type of interaction between Gaige and Deathtrap, while the third focuses more on pure and simple combat. Let's start from the first branch, coherently called ~Friends Forever~: here are concentrated support skills that can be assigned to the robot, which can, for example, restore the shields of one of its companions or guarantee a bonus on melee attacks for each enemy killed. as well as Gaige's own skills largely related to the increase or regeneration of shields and energy. The second section is instead called ~Little Problems~ and is indicated for fans of elemental effects with particular regard to electrical damage: in addition to various skills that allow Gaige to maximize the yield of these types of attacks, there is room for a couple of useful skills for Deathtrap that allow him to shoot laser beams or to enjoy the same elemental power of the weapon used by the player. A separate discussion instead for the third and last branch ~Ordered Chaos~, devoted body and soul to combat and which is based on two fundamental skills called respectively Anarchy and Discord: the first allows you to accumulate points every time you empty a magazine, which can be used to increase the damage of weapons at the expense of accuracy, while the second is activated by reloading ammunition prematurely and guarantees bonuses to accuracy, rate of fire and energy regeneration. However, the use of Disagreement consumes Anarchy points, thus forcing the user who chooses this path to balance the exploitation of the two skills. As is evident from the overview we have just described, that of the Mechromancer is a class full of interesting content and probably the most varied in terms of skills among all those made available by Borderlands 2, which can pave the way for a stimulating process of character development for players who decide to use it for their own adventures on Pandora. Anyone who joined the Premiere Club by pre-ordering the title is entitled to a free download of the DLC, and this is certainly a good thing: the most ardent fans of the Gearbox product are the real target of this downloadable content, i.e. those who will not limit themselves to complete the game only once and that in most cases they had probably reserved their copy months in advance. For all the others, the Mechromancer Pack represents a whim with an undoubtedly high price but which on the other hand offers a character with a portfolio of skills that are in many ways more intriguing than those offered by the standard classes. We would therefore advise these users to take a good look at Gaige's skill tree and do the math, while we just have to invite the members of the Premiere Club to immediately put this new class to the test: it could be love at first sight...", "date": "2012-10-12", "grade": null}
