{"name": "Summertime Madness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/summertime-madness-recensione.html", "text": "Last August we told you about Summertime Madness, the debut game of the Italians of DP Games whose premises had left us at least intrigued in the face of a promising project. Against the backdrop of a Prague devastated by World War II, a painter cooped up in his studio paints relentlessly to escape the horrors outside in what clearly proves to be an unequal struggle - a slow but inexorable current dragging him ever deeper into madness. One night he finds himself in front of a distinguished man, who appeared out of nowhere, ready to offer him a pact: to enter one of his paintings to have the possibility of getting away from the death that runs along the streets, finding peace and abandoning a now doomed city. However, there is one condition in this agreement, namely that if the painter fails to find his way back before midnight, his soul will remain trapped in the painting for eternity. A way to alleviate an announced suffering? A perverted game against a desperate man? Being the devil, everything can be, but our protagonist has reached the point of no return and in order to have some respite, he accepts the agreement. Thus begins the race against time that we tell you in the review of Summertime Madness. An (only) suggestive experience The first impression one gets upon entering the world of Summertime Madness is, as we ourselves had months ago, that we find ourselves inside a beautiful dream: the artistic sector is very pleasant, nor could we have expected otherwise from a game that makes painting its main element. To contrast the gloomy and terrifying atmosphere of a Prague under the yoke of bombing there is a simple but impactful landscape, a not too small oasis of serenity on the bank of a river. One would even want to sit and contemplate the void, if an enormous clock and the constant chimes every half hour didn't remind us, inexorably, of the passage of time. Within this surreal, colorful imagery that pulsates with its own life, we will be called to solve various puzzles relying only on our intuition and observation skills: no texts or indications of any kind served under the nose, if we want suggestions on how to proceed we will have to look for them or extrapolate them from the environment. An idea certainly not original, which goes well with the concept of show don't tell which we discussed in a recent article dedicated to Little Nightmares II without, however, being able to match aesthetics and substance. Summertime Madness gets lost in its own visual suggestions, letting them take over the play system to give life to a very short and unsatisfactory experience, even frustrating at times. We knew that the story of the ~damned of Prague~, as we like to call it, would be over in the space of three hours but on balance they weren't as full as we would have expected: a lot of this time is wasted in understanding puzzles of to which we have often found the solution by trial and error, rather than by reasoning, since the elements to make more concrete assumptions were lacking. If at the beginning this suspicion is fleeting, since in most cases there is a way to orient oneself in the resolution, overcoming the part where the preview stopped six months ago, one finds oneself catapulted into a level that is visually very accurate but poor in revealing itself to the player. Summertime Madness: a curious architecture There is not that sense of satisfaction that often pervades us when we overcome a puzzle, proving that we have passed the challenge of wit, because especially in the final stages the game relies too much on its titular madness generating frustration even in its brevity - which, we repeat, in itself it would not be a problem if it were filled and not forcibly diluted with far too cryptic puzzles. Arriving at the end of our bizarre journey, we did not understand its meaning and perhaps this is the most strident aspect of Summertime Madness: not knowing how to convey its story, in spite of a conclusion that invites us never to lose hope, which from rubble of war can still sprout life. Of the two modes offered, Classic (six hours) and Advanced (three hours), we chose the first to be sure we had enough time: two and a half hours later we found ourselves watching the credits, aware that we had spent half only on the final part, going far and wide in the hope of catching a hint on where and how to proceed. We do not deny the amazement and disappointment in realizing that we have already played three quarters of the game and are one step away from the end. Where the constant tolling of invisible bells mark the approach of our supposed doom, the senseof urgency that should accompany us is slowly losing its meaning; as well as the compass of Summertime Madness, which after the very first lines begins to show those cracks which in the final phase of the experience become impossible to ignore. It almost seems that the aesthetics want to make up for the playful shortcomings, transforming the game into a hybrid between walking simulator and puzzle game without being able to really be either. A pity, given the inviting debut. Summertime Madness: an exploration phase", "date": "2021-02-19", "grade": "6.0"}
