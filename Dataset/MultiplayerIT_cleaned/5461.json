Such a choice, from a marketing point of view, could therefore seem at the very least risky, however when you develop a title shaped around the career of multiple world champion Valentino Rossi, you can certainly afford this luxury. Valentino Rossi: The Game is fundamentally MotoGP 16 enhanced by the collaboration with the centaur from Tavullia, whose charismatic presence broadens the boundaries of classic production by embracing other disciplines on two and four wheels, a renewed career mode in the sign of the VR46 Riders Academy (the ~ for young motorcycling promises), new challenges and an overview of the twenty years of success of the national Vale. In short, a much tastier and more abundant dish than what one would expect from an annual sports series. Lots of content and various new features in Valentino Rossi: The Game, the new MotoGP dedicated to the Doctor The Abundance Fair One of the most interesting and impressive aspects of Valentino Rossi: The Game are the numbers involved in the project: hundreds of official riders divided among the various classes of the present and past world championship, about fifty tracks (including variants) and fifteen different game modes, which, as already mentioned in the introduction, also lead to the world of motoring with rally and drift tests, without forgetting the Flat Track discipline on dirt bikes, much loved by Valentino Rossi. Before analyzing the heart of the game, however, it is necessary to say a few words about the commitment made by Milestone in (finally) renewing the various menus, decidedly more usable and pleasant than in the past thanks to a more modern and captivating arrangement of the various items, with a interface dominated by yellow tones - the Doctor's favorite color - and elegant contrasts between gray and black. The soul of Valentino Rossi: The Game is naturally represented by the new career mode, which differs from the past ones for the introduction of new disciplines within the calendar with the express purpose of improving driving skills. In fact, each discipline promotes specific driver skills, whose growth recalls those of role-playing productions: at the end of each race, attributes such as braking, physical condition, agility or ability in the wet are improved, which make control easier and more natural. of the vehicles as the seasons go by. The main aim is always to go up the ~food chain~ starting from the Moto3 championship up to victory in the MotoGP premier class, a path in which one is accompanied by the nice personal assistant Sara and by a chat that mimics WhatsApp, where the Valentino Rossi himself with audio and text messages. The special events, accessible individually in the VR46 World item of the main menu, are divided into the aforementioned Flat Track, also present in the ~Americana~ variants with elimination rounds and ~Endurach~ for teams; in the Special Stage, Monza Rally Show and Monza Masters' Show rally races aboard the Ford Fiesta Rally; in Drift races with a powerful Ford Mustang and in tests with the very fast Yamaha R1M on the Misano circuit. In addition to the classic GP version, there are several variants of this track designed for the Drift and Flat Track disciplines, the latter also practicable on the Tavullia ranch (faithfully reproduced in the game) where Valentino Rossi trains with the guys from the VR46 Riders Academy and with some historical friends. In addition to the career mode and the VR46 World, the MotoGP World item is also included in the Race tab of the main menu, in which it is possible to organize entire championships or individual Grands Prix of different categories, ranging from the 2016 and 2015 MotoGP classes up to the old 125cc and 250cc two-stroke, passing through the 500cc 2 and 4-stroke and of course the Moto2 and Moto3 categories of the current championship. A veritable plethora of vehicles, sponsors, teams and licensed riders that will delight any motorcycling enthusiast. For individual Grands Prix, various options can be determined such as the number of laps, the type of session (single race or with free practice and qualifying), the weather (clear, cloudy, rain), damage, disciplinary flags, consumption tiresand so on, to the advantage of personalizing the experience. The second label of the main menu, called Rossi Experience, contains a selection of very interesting secondary modes built around the legendary career of the driver from Tavullia. In ~Eventi Storici VR46~ it is possible to retrace the sporting history of Valentino Rossi in twenty different events, starting from that famous 18 August 1996 when the Doctor, 17 years old at the time, obtained his first victory in the 125cc, after an exciting duel with the expert Martinez. Each event, similarly to what happens on Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo, is accompanied by short films in which the good Valentine passionately recounts his memories and the emotions he experienced. The presence of historical events is also reflected in the number of circuits available in the game, given that in addition to all the official ones of the current championship there are some old glories, such as the South African Phakisa and Assen in 2002. The ~The Doctor~ Challenge offers twenty-three events in which the player, aboard the bikes ridden by Rossi, must be able to beat the best times obtained in his career by the champion, while in Challenges, currently not accessible, specific races will be offered for a limited period of time with selected bikes and circuits by VR46 himself. Finally, Rossipedia, as the name suggests, is a veritable mini encyclopedia: in this mode it will be possible to discover anecdotes and curiosities about the rider's history, as well as view the original motorbikes, liveries and helmets in detail in a special showroom to be replenished by spending VR Points, credits that are earned at the end of each race, which are also useful for unlocking the numerous accessories to customize the driver. Other modes include time trials, also available for Flat Track and Yamaha R1M, split-screen and of course online multiplayer, which we have not been able to test at the moment due to the completely deserted servers, given that the game will be launched next June 16th. Between asphalt and dirt road A lot of variety, of course, is also reflected in the stratified gameplay, and although some disciplines are more simplified than others, we can say that Milestone has done a good job overall, made possible also thanks to the experience gained with MXGP and Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo. usual it is possible to shape the driving experience by modifying the physics according to the Standard, Semi-Pro and Pro parameters, with a progressive difficulty in controlling the vehicle. For cars there are not the same options, but it is possible to adjust the automatic brake, braking assistance, stability assistance and the inevitable ideal trajectory, especially useful in rallies (similar to Dirt's Gymkhana mode) where it is necessary to go through chicanes and very tight hairpin bends on the Monza track, reworked for the occasion. As far as the bikes are concerned, the advice from Rossi and his collaborators at the Academy has certainly paid off: the guys, in fact, have been in close contact with the developers, constantly testing the new builds at the Tavullia ranch, suggesting modifications to contribute to the behavior of the media. The Pro physics are consequently even more in-depth than in the past, almost making you feel the need for some ad hoc peripheral to better tame the bike, although the DualShock 4 behaves very well. This is especially true with the powerful MotoGP bikes or with the old 500s, which ~slap~ violently, rear up and run wild if you don't choke the accelerator and brakes carefully. The behavior of the off-road bikes in Flat Track mode is also gratifying, where the approach to riding, made up of ~early~ drifts, is radically opposed to the precision required on the track. The Drift mode aboard the Ford Mustang is certainly the most simplified of the lot, given that drifting successfully is all too simple and the penalties are too lenient when compared with those of similar products. The control of the Ford Fiesta in rally mode is more interesting, where the influence of the good Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo is evident, although the approach is certainly more arcadey. The car sometimes seems a bit too light and the bumps aren't always convincing, but overall, even in this case, it's an interesting discipline to break the pace of racing on two wheels. Without particular charm or bite the tests with the Yamaha R1M, used in training by Valentino since the tests with the MotoGP bikes are not free. Again, the influence of Milestone's work with RIDE is felt. Time to change Despite a greater care dedicated to the elementsat the edge of the track, to the cleanliness of the shaders and the fidelity of the tracks, as well as the usual refinement in the models of the bikes and riders, there is no doubt that Milestone's proprietary engine has had its day, finding itself short of breath when compared with the quality offered by the latest graphics engines. Outdated effects such as that of rain, imprecise textures, bikes that sometimes seem to levitate, aliasing and little incisive particles when they should actually make the difference, as in Flat Track races, trace a profile that, unfortunately, in 2016 certainly cannot be considered cutting-edge, while carrying out its task with dignity and better than in the past. Compared to the previous iteration and to RIDE there is certainly an improvement in the animations of the pilots, especially during accidents, with more realistic falls where the weight of the unfortunate people involved is more effectively felt, although there is still no lack of interpenetrations and slightly grotesque situations. An analogous speech to that for the graphics, at 1080p and 30 frames per second on PlayStation 4, can be done for the sound, although in this case the gap between highs and lows is even more evident, especially as regards the roar of the engines, ranging from punchy and lifelike thanks to great sampling to others that vaguely resemble an annoying hum. Even the soundtrack doesn't hit the mark, while Guido Meda always carries out his task with enthusiasm in the pre-race. We cannot comment on the solidity of the netcode at the time of writing due to the impossibility of carrying out tests against other players.", "date": "2016-06-11", "grade": "8.0"}
