Games whose characters don't emit energy balls or perform dozens of hit combos keeping the opponent suspended in the air like a balloon, but offer a realistic representation of the exchanges, based more on timing, responsiveness and a pinch of strategy. The Taekwondo Game - Global Tournament offers precisely this type of experience. Developed by a Swedish team, Hello There, the game uses animations created by capturing the movements of real taekwondo experts, therefore particularly fluid and convincing, even if ~masked~ by a pleasant cartoon style (with four different skins for the characters), and there delivers a set of moves composed mostly of kicks, with a view to sports competitions in which you have to hit your opponent to score points and win each match, when time runs out, based on our performance, rather than on the ability to put KO the enemy. The download from the App Store and Google Play is completely free, but only includes the extensive tutorial, which teaches you how to manage energy and perform the basic moves, which work through a combination of direction and buttons. To unlock the full game, with three different tournaments set in Iran, Mexico and Korea, however, you have to pay a decidedly affordable sum: just 89 cents. However, this is an offer valid until January 7, so hurry up. The Taekwondo Game - Global Tournament is a fresh, interesting and well done ~sports~ fighting game You need some kick The interface of The Taekwondo Game - Global Tournament appears particularly tidy: on the left side of the screen there are the keys to move left, the one to move right and the block, while on the right there are the upstroke, the lowstroke and the ~focus~, which is a maneuver that requires a few moments of loading to be launched but which produces considerable damage. The symmetrical arrangement of the icons is not only pleasant to look at, but is also rather immediate and functional. Finally, in the upper part of the display, the energy of our character and of the opponent on duty is represented, but be careful: these are not health bars to be reset, but indicators of fatigue which, once depleted, albeit temporarily (recharge very in a hurry), they will put us at the mercy of the enemy, rendering us unable to fight back. Hence, the experience of the game acquires depth and strategic value, given that we will not be able to proceed by throwing head-on blows hoping to catch the opponent off guard, but we will have to calculate times and distances to score a spectacular roundhouse kick, a kick ~return~, one ~guillotine~ and so on; with the further possibility, when cornered, of performing a ~clutch~ and exchanging our position with that of the enemy. The system works very well and does not require particular practice to be well assimilated, especially if you have a minimum of experience with fighting games, however the feeling is that the contents of the package run out too quickly, without ever proposing a challenge worthy of this first name. Similarly, the presence of a multiplayer mode only locally can only leave a bad taste in the mouth, given the potential of such a title online.", "date": "2014-12-31", "grade": "8.0"}
