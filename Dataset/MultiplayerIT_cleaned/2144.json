Since the review has already appeared on the pages of Xbox Italia I won't dwell too much on the plot, which is in any case well cared for and exciting, also thanks to the stupendous CG films that will accompany us during the game alternating with less complex but equally eloquent ones based on the game engine itself. Princess Yuki has been kidnapped by dark entities and it is our job, as good Samurai, to bring her back ~to the fold~. Obviously it is not that you can challenge demonic and infernal forces without paying consequences and in fact at our first encounter with a huge demon we will take a good beating. In the balance between life and death we will be helped by the spirits of the Ogres clan who will give us the power to control souls, which once made ours can be used to increase our powers and our abilities. Strengthened by our new power, we will start the attack again, being able to count now on more balanced clashes (in fact, shortly after we will have to collide with the first demon and we will have to defeat him!!!). well in short, in short, we will have to save the princess and her little brother who must be sacrificed to awaken the terrible nobunaga who wants to resurrect in demonic form to finish his work of conquest. During the adventure we will be able to make use of various edged weapons that can be enhanced with the absorption of the very souls of the defeated enemies. Our powers will be based on the three different elements of air, fire, lightning which will give our weapons exceptional powers. More or less this is the story of Onimusha in short, obviously with the necessary cuts, otherwise what are you playing for!? In the Game Very well, now that the story is done, let's begin to delve a little deeper and above all let's see what's new in this exclusive remix version for xbox. The game has remained fundamentally the same (story, plot and characters) but with some nice additions that have made it less static and more intriguing. First of all, you've read it a billion times around, new souls have been added for you to suck. These green souls are used, if collected in sufficient quantities, to become invincible for a while and to recover energy at the same time. The nice thing is that even demons are hungry for these green souls, because by absorbing them they go into a sort of ~rage~, they become much more aggressive and unleash new and very powerful flaming blows. Very often, therefore, a fight will break out for who will have to take the soul, realizing that those who engage in the suction cannot do anything else, remaining exposed to the attacks. It also applies to enemies but they attack in groups, so there will always be someone free to come against us. The yellow souls that raise the energy level and the white souls that raise our magical power have been kept. Those present in the greatest number are always the red ones that are used to enhance our weapons and some objects that will come in very handy during the adventure such as medicinal herbs that can be transformed into complete medicine or arrows that can become incandescent. Upgrading weapons will be essential especially to be able to pass through some doors with seals that will react based on the level reached by our weapons. This is one of the expedients that the programmers have found to ~stretch the broth a bit~ as they say, forcing us to long periods of only colo fights in order to reach the right level of the various weapons. Another slightly weird thing is the fact that weapons can only be upgraded in special magical mirrors (where you can also save) and therefore sometimes you will die with the right load of souls but far from the mirror. A little frustrating but you get used to it or rather you find yourself often making mini upgrades instead of doing the big load and doing everything at once. Furthermore, to vary the action a bit, sometimes we will also be asked to use the other main character Kaede, a ninja woman who is Samanosuke's companion who will be able to access areas that the samurai cannot reach. A short experience to live in one breath The general setting both in terms of controls and puzzles to solve is very similar to the classic Resident Evil style (find the key, move here, open the, go back and take this, swap that.). Where the title surprises though is in the fights. In fact, Onimusha lends itself to total massacre like a fighting game, and slashing with swords and halberds has never been so fun. Contrary to RAnd where escape was often the best way to survive in Onimusha as there are no limits of weapons and bullets, you really have a lot of fun. The game therefore takes on the appearance of an action game rather than a survival horror, with which it shares only a few monsters that are perhaps a little gloomy. In this Xbox version, there are also many more enemies to face than in the previous version, several new settings and situations that are the same but proposed in a different way. The difficulty level has been increased a bit, making the matter a little more difficult, although still within everyone's reach. Among the new enemies there is the infamous killer doll who will torment you throughout the game with no possibility of being beaten. When you see her, run away, because otherwise she won't leave you until she kills you! But the idea is great! Furthermore, to compensate for the greater number and level of wickedness of the opponents, the system of shots that our alter ego can carry out has been improved. Depending on how long we hold down the attack button it will be possible to carry out an attack ranging from normal to devastating, complete with a flaming blade. In short, there are several original ideas, and the remix is really successful, albeit carrying the intrinsic limitations of the original idea behind the game (limited movements and movements, you can't jump ...). Sure technically it doesn't work miracles, but it defends itself well, with excellent light effects and polygonal models. We are far from the furious gameplay of Devil May cry (do it for xbox too, I beg you!!!) but the narrative rhythm is also more calm. We are a little sorry for the lack of accompanying animations, such as those that perhaps link a door opening (in this case the DVD starts reading the data and we get a nice ... ~loading~ on a black screen). Even to climb a ladder there is no animation ... you could have done a little but that's okay! Once the game catches you, you won't let go until the end. End. Exact. Maybe it comes too early since you can finish the game in just three hours if you want, but in hindsight perhaps a longer duration would have ruined the gaming experience by prolonging it to boredom (strengthen more and more, open here, open there). The End In short, Genma Onimusha is a great game, suitable for all those looking for action and adventure on their xbox. The conversion is perfect and from a technical point of view we point out the full screen and 60hz (sony, learn!). several additions will make it usable even a second time and maybe a third time, but once the interest in the story is lost, the desire to try something new will remain. Don't expect technical miracles from this product, just a healthy and exciting gaming experience. Funny, heroic, brutal, passionate. Need anything else!? PROS: Excellent setting Go-go action New features compared to the original version Amazing CG movies CONS: Maybe short Weapon upgrade system Technically not incredible Materials: Tips First Review Genma Onimusha by Claudio Serio Mini-Trailer Genma Onimusha A bit of history.. Onimusha was first heard of even in Pso's heyday. The game was supposed to be a kind of survival horror in medieval Japan. The project was soon diverted to ps2 both for lack of valid launch titles and because the project was assuming connotations that the limitations of a 32-bit hardware would not have allowed to express at its best. So here is that Onimusha disappeared from the pson line-up to return in great shape on the Sony flagship. The passage was not unscathed, however, since it was a kind of porting adapted to the greater computing potential of the Sony console. The pre-rendered backdrops (not like the legendary one had shown with Code Veronica all in pure 3D) made many turn up their noses and although the 3D effects and models were of an excellent level, a little bit was still not convincing. Finally, with the advent of the Xbox, Capcom decided to give a further arrangement to its ace, making them reach their definitive form.", "date": "2002-04-28", "grade": null}
