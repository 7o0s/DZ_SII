{"name": "Beast mode", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/168259-shadow-of-the-beast-beast-mode.html", "text": "Shadow of the Beast still represents one of the milestones of the Amiga today, it's the classic game you pull off the shelves of memory when you want to remember the good old days, prehistoric eras when PCs were far from being a Master Race, the consoles began to have success and the Amiga churned out technically impressive products such as the title Psygnosis. In fact, everything could be said about Shadow of the Beast, which was difficult, punishing, sadistic and perhaps even repetitive, but not that it was not planned well. Graphically it was incredible, considering that we are talking about 1989, not to mention the soundtrack: in short, it was the classic Psignosys title, with attention to every aspect. Now 26 years later Sony has decided to aim at the nostalgic heart of older gamers and intrigue the younger ones with a low-budget remake that takes the story and atmosphere of the original to bring everything into a sort of ~metroidvania~ quite simple , with a particular combat system. Will it be a comeback in style or a pathetic move like the return of an 80s band? Between nostalgia, quotations and very long combos, here is our review of Shadow of the Beast True revenge The story follows the original quite faithfully, we will therefore wear the bestial clothes of Aarbron, a monstrous being and particularly expert in hand-to-hand combat in the service of Malethot, a very bad lord who has the hobby of devastating neighboring kingdoms. During yet another raid, Aarbron kills a man who on his deathbed transfers his memories to him. Thus he discovers that he was not born this way, that is, ugly as the alarm clock at six in the morning and very bad, but that he is a child transformed with magic and that the one he has just killed is his father. Rightly angry with Malethot and his band of minions, Aarbron decides to embark on a vengeful mission to make the dark lord and all those who stand in his way pay back. All this we will have to deduce simply from the images, because a fundamental characteristic of this game is the total absence of the slightest explanation regarding what is happening. The developers have in fact preferred to make the protagonist even more beastly by preventing him from understanding what the other creatures say, unless you unlock the translations in the extras section, with the points accumulated by playing. These are the premises of a game with the classic two-dimensional side view that still has a three-dimensional engine that doesn't represent anything exceptional. In fact, the game doesn't boast particularly impressive graphic effects, just some dynamic lighting effects, indeed, the blood effect is quite ugly, while as regards the textures and characters we have lights and shadows. On the one hand, the polygonal model of the protagonist and some bosses is particularly detailed, on the other hand, the monsters and settings don't shine with particular beauty. However, occasionally Shadow of the Beast is able to return quite suggestive settings, especially in the levels set outdoors. In fact, it happens that the shot breaks away from the character for a moment to show us deserts full of monstrous bones, huge caves full of monsters and teleports or centuries-old prisons of horrible and gigantic beasts. We don't have certain information on the game engine used, but there seems to be the Unreal Engine or a modified version of it that does its job in an efficient way overall. The architecture of the levels is quite fluctuating, with particularly well done outdoor sections, alternating with slightly more visually banal indoor moments. Obviously quotations are the masters, especially in the first hour of the game, but also in the appearance of some monsters, in the explosive eyes that levitate in mid-air, in the monstrous hands that will try to snatch us in the desert settings, not to mention the fact that we will also be able to unlock the original title and try to play it again in all its draconian difficulty. However, this Shadow of the Beast does not want to be a mere tracing of the original title, but a game with its own dignity, which it hopes to achieve with a very particular combat system. Watch your back! In the original the fights were basically based on giving a single punch at the right time to the monster of the moment that arrived from the front, in this remake the fight is structured in an almost completely unrelated way from the exploratory phase. At one point, as we walk, we'll be blocked by two portals - one in front and one behind - from which a constant stream of enemies will pour out. To kill them, one shot will be enough, but we will have to decarefully decide our moves to avoid being caught from behind. We will therefore be able to stun them, parry, go behind them, perform special attacks to get extra points, heal our wounds or summon demonic shadows to help us. Each kill will accumulate a blood gauge which, once filled, will allow us to unleash a ~Chain of fury~, or rather a series of particularly brutal attacks that will allow us to eliminate enemies left and right by pressing a key and direction at the right time. Once the wave is over, we will be able to continue our journey and the fight will be judged on the basis of how many times we have been hit and the multiplier of the score obtained. Each clash increases the final score of the level, which obviously is entered in a world ranking divided by difficulty levels. At the beginning, bringing home the skin is very simple but over time we will have to learn to manage the two fronts almost like a rhythm game, stunning, killing and parrying attacks, in order to always eliminate the closest threat. Doing so is at least as satisfying as solving a puzzle game, but in the long run, despite the variety of enemies, it's a mechanic that can get tiring. To make things easier, we can use the points we earn to improve our combat skills and stun enemies for longer, collect more blood with each attack or increase the number of special moves we can use. If desired, there are also runes scattered throughout the levels that will allow us to unlock special perks, such as the ability to slowly heal between fights or stun enemies with a perfect parry. Playstation 4 trophies Part of the Shadow of the Beast Trophies can be obtained simply by finishing the game on the various difficulties available, however to get the most important ones you will need to get all the runes, unlock the upgrades and be able to get excellent marks in all the fights of the level. In short, despite being a ~minor~ game, the challenge offered is really difficult! Your soul Every now and then we will have to face bosses, linked to particular easily understood attack patterns, which will break this pattern but almost always with quite affordable clashes that will not change the pace of the game much. In the exploratory phase we will have to solve small puzzles related to timed levers, teleporters and shadow games to gradually unlock the various sections of the levels, but even here we are certainly not faced with insurmountable puzzles. As for the collectibles, we will be able to unlock the aforementioned runes, globes of light that will give us points or decide the fate of the other players. A bit like Dark Souls in fact, Shadow of the Beast features asynchronous multiplayer linked to the point where other players have died and left their souls. Once we have found the exact point, we will be able to decide whether to ~free~ the soul and give its owner an elixir to bring it back to life (otherwise he will be forced to have penalties to be reborn in the same point) or tear it apart in the shortest possible time and earn of the points. As far as longevity is concerned, let's say that the game is in line with what is paid and can be completed in a morning of intense play, provided that one does not want to explore every nook and cranny at all costs, choose the highest difficulty or attempt the climbing the rankings. In this respect Shadow of the Beast actually has a good replayability factor, because obviously once finished it we will be able to play a second game using the upgrades already unlocked and improving the character even more, however we don't really know how many may want to embark again on a series of fights that are quite similar to each other. The very structure of the game, either for quotations or for lack of ideas, reflects very much that of the games of the past with the last one which summarizes all the enemies faced and a final battle that completely messes up the cards on the table and quotes shamelessly another great classic of the time, which we don't tell you to avoid spoilers.", "date": "2016-05-16", "grade": "7.8"}
