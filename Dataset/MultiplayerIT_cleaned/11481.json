{"name": "Twisted Metal Head On - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/twisted-metal-head-on-recensione.html", "text": "Several years have passed since the penultimate chapter of the Twisted Metal series made its appearance on PlayStation 2, and to be exact we are talking about Twisted Metal Black released in 2001. Meanwhile, in 2005, all the fans of this very famous series were able console with Twisted Metal Head On released for PSP portable console, which despite its defects and problems related to the control system of the Sony console, has still been able to give a lot of emotions to fans. Another three years have passed, and finally the new chapter of the series sees the light on PS2... even if calling it ~new~ is not exactly accurate: it is nothing more than a porting of the game for PSP, improved in terms of graphics, and enriched with new game modes and a few extras, not to mention a completely new chapter entitled Twisted Metal Lost, which contains some of the levels that should have been part of Twisted Metal Black 2. In short, for those who were tired of having to play on the small screen of the PSP with a control system not up to par, or for those who have been abstinent from Twisted Metal for too long now, this porting could make you rediscover the pleasure of tearing your opponent to shreds with a nice homing missile! Seek and Destroy! In all these years, the Twisted Metal series has not undergone major changes in terms of gameplay, it has remained in fact the same old arcade shooter that we all know, and the formula that made this series famous returns in this new edition for PS2: high-level playability, immediacy and above all fun! For those who have never heard of it, the concept on which TM is based is quite simple: first of all we must select the vehicle we intend to use, and immediately afterwards we will be catapulted into one of the game arenas together with other players, in which the only goal is to devastate the opponents with missiles, machine guns, bombs, rotating blades, energy beams, and much more ... As already mentioned, this title is actually made up of two Twisted Metal, or the Head On, porting of the one for PSP, and the Lost, the theoretical successor of the Black. Ultimately they are very similar games, but obviously there are some differences that distinguish them: for example the selectable characters are different, the setting is also different (Lost in fact takes up the dark one of Black), and finally there are some differences level of playability, but nothing earth-shattering. First we will choose our vehicle, we will therefore have to take into account, according to our needs, the values of speed, armor and governability, furthermore each vehicle has its own unique special weapon. For everything else there are no differences, and we will have to take advantage of the weapons that we will find in the game arenas to eliminate our opponents. In addition to traditional weapons, in Twisted Metal it is also possible to exploit energy attacks (frost ray, mines, shield, invisibility, etc.) which are always available, but which drain an energy bar each time they are used. The energy bar tends to deplete rather quickly, and once depleted it takes a few seconds to fill up again, so it is good to use this type of attack sparingly. Both Twisted Metal Head On and Lost essentially offer two game modes, single player and multiplayer, both divided into sub-modes. If we decide to play solo, we can opt for the story mode, which is precisely the main mode that will allow us to progress in the game according to a logical thread, or for the Challenge mode (whose rule is whoever stays alive wins), or again for the Endurance mode (we are against an infinite number of vehicles and we must destroy as many as possible). In multiplayer, however, it is possible to carry out a deathmatch (one against one), or play in co-op (together against the CPU). Having decided on the game mode and our vehicle, we will finally be able to launch into battle to rediscover what made the old Twisted Metal great: high-level playability that allows you to immediately immerse yourself in the spirit of the game! Old fans won't be disappointed! But that's not all...there are many other additions in this new PS2 edition: secret minigames in each level of the game (for example you have to compete with an opponent or run an obstacle course), then a pseudo-adventure ~ on foot with Sweet Tooth (the clown with the fiery head) in which the only objective is to explore some locations, there are also unedited footage of the Twisted Metal 1 amps, and a video with interviews with the programmers. The technical aspect The graphic aspect is perhaps the Achilles heel of TM Head on, considering that we are now in the era of consnew generation oles that boast breathtaking graphics to say the least Of course, you can't make comparisons between a PS2 and a PS3, but the problem is that this title doesn't even hold a candle to titles of its own generation. The textures lack detail and are a bit too grainy, every now and then there are some graphic problems such as pop ups. Even the colors leave something to be desired, decidedly dull, especially as regards the Head On (since Lost has a dark setting which implies the use of a certain type of colour) in which the bright colors do not render they should. Obviously we are not at the graphic levels of the first PS2 games, but we shouldn't even expect who knows what from this title... it is always and in any case the porting of a PSP game, and from this point of view the work done is more than commendable. Even the sound sector is perplexing, because if on the one hand we find the typical sound effects of Twisted Metal slightly improved, on the other we realize that a much better job could have been done. The soundtrack, which consists mainly of metal and techno tracks, goes very well with the type of game since it manages to instil a considerable charge in the player, increasing his adrenaline levels in the most chaotic moments ... certain, however, that if the genre does not is to your liking you could get the opposite effect. Comment Twisted Metal Head On, despite being only a port from the PSP and not having any online mode, as well as nothing exceptional from a technical point of view, is still to be considered an excellent title with considerable merits ... almost all focused on playability. Let's not forget that there are many additions compared to the PSP version and many extras, such as the chapter called Lost, and which is sold at a budget price ... a must therefore for all fans of the series, and for those looking for lots of healthy entertainment without too graphically. Pros: Playability at high levels Many modes and extras Cons: Improved technical aspect Absence of online mode", "date": "2008-04-16", "grade": null}
