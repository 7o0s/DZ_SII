Where does a new chapter come from right at the end of 2019? you might ask. Yet there is perhaps little to be surprised about. Bubble Bobble is one of those great classics that, if you think deeply about your past, was almost never lacking in any arcade, even if perhaps in our territory the twin Puzzle Bubble was a little more widespread. However, the first chapter of the main series was released by Taito in the now distant 1986; living in the age of eternal returns, it was more or less reasonable that sooner or later he would come back too, after naturally getting a makeover. Most of the time these are risky operations, because they are either managed by listless developers or aimed at nothing more than grabbing a handful of money by taking advantage of the fame and notoriety of the franchise, to the detriment of quality. Fortunately, this is not the situation of Bubble Bobble 4 Friends: what you may soon hold in your hands is a real new chapter in the main series, made with love and fidelity to its predecessors. Plot Bubble Bobble 4 Friends even has a plot, an infinitesimal narrative thread that can only make fans of the newfound franchise happy. In what is probably a child's bedroom, full of toys, we immediately notice two puppets standing out clearly in the background: they are Bub the green dragon and that infamous Super Drunk, also known as Grumple Grommit, one of the main enemies of the protagonist heroes in the previous chapters, dressed in his usual green tunic. At one point, both come to life: Super Drunk immediately takes the opportunity to hit the dragon on the head for free, and the battle begins from there. Thanks to magic, Super Drunk transforms the child's room into the classic levels of the Bubble Bobble series, and the main adventure begins. Bub's task (and the other three heroes, if you play in company) will be to face hordes of enemies and then defeat five different bosses in five different worlds; the last enemy will be Grumple Grommit. All in a series of situations, adventures, small puzzles, enemies and powers that always and constantly wink at the first three chapters of the franchise released over the years, namely Bubble Bobble, Bubble Bobble 2 and Bubble Memories: The Story of Bubble Bobble III. In fact, it is no coincidence that the title of the new adventure bears that ~4~ in its name, with the pun dedicated to the local multiplayer sector of Nintendo Switch (4 / For Friends). Nintendo Switch: Multiplayer Bubble Bobble 4 Friends is a title developed by ININ Games exclusively for Nintendo Switch, although it cannot be excluded that in the near future it may also land on other platforms and on PC. The choice of Nintendo Switch is not accidental, primarily because it is one of the best-selling consoles of recent years, portable and among other things a candidate to sell thousands more units during the 2019 Christmas holidays; secondly, the specific characteristics of Nintendo Switch are ideal for enhancing the multiplayer sector. Bubble Bobble 4 Friends multiplayer is exclusively local: there is no internet functionality of any kind, and this is perhaps one of the main shortcomings of the production. In any case, you will be able to face all the levels of the main adventure in the company of three other friends: it is sufficient that each of those present has only one Joy-Con for Nintendo Switch. In addition to the unpublished levels of the production, on the left in the main menu you will notice the icon of an arcade cabinet: from here you can also play the first Bubble Bobble, perfectly emulated in Bubble Bobble 4 Friends (with a reduced screen). Also in this case you can play in the company of a friend, but at most two (as in the original episode, after all). Functionality and technical sector The potential of Nintendo Switch has been adequately exploited by Inti Games in creating Bubble Bobble 4 Friends: the title, for example, supports HD Rumble and the intelligent vibration system of the Kyoto House console. Nothing exceptional, and other features such as motion sensors are logically left aside, but it's nice that despite the recent Nintendo Switch Lite some developers still want to insist on using them. The use of the touch screen in portable mode is instead very marginal and limited to navigation in the main menus. The technical sector of the production is discreet, with good animations and models for the main characters, while a dmuch less inspired design for enemies and final bosses. No slowdown whatsoever to report, indeed the loading times are also very fast; however, the general artistic direction presents fluctuating results, and much of the player's enthusiasm will derive from reliving the adventures of his past in a modern key, rather than from the real originality of the fourth chapter itself. Gameplay Bubble Bobble 4 Friends is divided into five different main worlds, each of which is themed around the different toys in the child's room that form the backdrop for the narrative. For example, the first ten levels are all set on a shelf; the third on bricks that closely resemble LEGO; the fourth on the tracks of the electric train, and so on. In all there are five different worlds, each of which has a total of 10 levels (one of which is dedicated to the final boss). 50 levels in all are not very many for the price requested by the developers (a good 39.99 euros), but they are not a few either; to add, then, the possibility of playing Bubble Bobble via emulation, without satisfying particular conditions. The overall difficulty level is very affordable, perhaps even simple for longtime players; certainly to be faced with a real challenge it will be necessary to give up the upgrades, which will be immediately unlocked after the first game world. The power ups are equipped (if desired) before starting the levels: they consist of armor and clothes that provide new powers to the protagonists. Obviously, they also affect the gameplay. One of them, for example, allows you to shoot bubbles farther, so as to trap more distant enemies without taking too many risks. Others deliver electrically charged or explosive bubbles that have devastating effects on the surrounding area. Apart from this novelty, everything else is extremely faithful to the historical episodes of the franchise, from the game mechanics to the elimination of enemies, passing through the letters in the bonus bubbles scattered throughout the various levels. Collecting them will be essential to get three stars in all worlds, as well as to complete the title 100%.", "date": "2019-11-25", "grade": "7.2"}
