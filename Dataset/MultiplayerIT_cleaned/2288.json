{"name": "Iridion 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/iridion-3d.html", "text": "Graphics & Sound Images of this Iridion 3D had been circulating on the net for some time, issued more or less regularly during the phases of its development and certainly the strong point of this game seemed to be its wonderful graphics. Seeing today in motion what yesterday could only be guessed (or rather hoped for) through those few shots, makes a certain impression. Without a shadow of a doubt, Iridion 3D makes use of some of the best graphics seen on the Nintendo console. In fact, the obsessive care with which everything has been implemented is incredible. The game view is (only) in the third person behind our spaceship and the action scrolls in the sense of depth, just like in Star Fox. Above all, the skilful use of parallax planes fascinates and amazes, so astute as to be able to confuse even the most savvy gamer about the real number of reconstructed dimensions. Personally I had to wait for the second level of the game to be sure that I didn't have a 3D engine in front of me and if this seems absurd to you, when you have played it a bit you will share my reflections. The detail achieved is very high, both for the seabed and for the - numerous - enemy ships. The backdrops - inspired and different for each level - make use of multiple extremely contiguous parallax planes that return truly ~realistic~ perspective projections (the one that best conveys the idea is the first, claustrophobic level). Furthermore, in the outdoor levels, changes in the environment, light conditions and anything else as needed take place continuously, but gently, for a truly incomparable show. Obviously, the enemy spaceships are no different, boasting a high quality of detail and extremely fluid and dynamic animations, undoubtedly the result of the use of a large number of sprites; moreover they appear very recognizable even from a distance, as soon as they appear on the screen, still far from us. Laser effects and explosions are also excellent. As you will have understood, without going on praising the graphics of Iridion 3D, this is, in one word, super-wonderful. Finally, then we also have a sound accompaniment suitable for the graphics sector. Music and sound effects express well the audio capabilities of the small Game Boy Advance and are a pleasant support to our happy raids between seas, skies and planets. The music boasts an obvious (obligatory?) techno matrix on which rock and/or evocative tunes where necessary have been arranged - in a valid way. The plot The plot? But what storyline do you think a shoot 'em up needs to justify itself? None! And in fact I ignore that of Iridion 3D, I seem to remember only that we have to save the earth (or was it the universe?) from some alien threat, coming precisely from the Iridion system. The presentation that starts when the console is turned on, however, tries to give some explanation and foment pathos, but does not fully succeed in its intent. Fortunately, technically it is appreciable (at least from the middle onwards) and characterized by a style that is a bit anime. In the end, he really knows how to strike hard at the heart, showing an attack on the twin towers that he knows so much about today. However, do not worry about these sad omens: all this concerns the distant distant future. The flaws After scholastically dividing the analysis of the game into sectors and for this igniting Cartac's repressed protesting nature, I am about to deal with the playability/longevity factor in this last paragraph. Ouch ouch ouch... Here come the pains. Sin. Yes, it's a real shame having to shut down a game after having praised it left and right. Unfortunately it is like this, it is useless to go around it. In short: Iridion 3D fails where a video game must instead place its only raison d'tre, namely playability. The recent history of video games (over the last 5 years or so) has accustomed us to cases in which graphically stunning games are poor, naive from the point of view of content and above all of playability. Even Iridion 3D, I regret to admit it, is part of this large group. Strange fact. Yet the controls are easily manageable and quick to respond, the game dispenses some power-ups to enhance our spaceship, the graphics tickle our brain, but, I admit, I've never felt particularly stimulated to action. Read on and you'll find out why. First, when the battle gets hectic and there are too many overlapping attacks orlarge opponents that make the view tangled, it is difficult to understand which safe position to move towards and / or aim properly. This depends on the third-person view behind our vehicle, which, however spectacular, in the most chaotic situations is uncomfortable for identifying whether or not we are on the same level as enemy fire or the enemies themselves who are coming against us. Even the colors used, often dark in tone, make the intelligibility of the action problematic. The full-blown darkness of the GBA then delivers the coup de grace. If we add a high difficulty, even to NORMAL and already at the first level of the game (I dare not imagine HARD) it is well understood how the problems afflicting the visual make the action frustrating, if not prohibitive. Even after a few hours of practice, things certainly do not improve, the learning curve seems in fact almost flat, i.e. the game already shows its maximum unbeatability from the first level, thus preventing linear, stimulating and pleasant learning. We then add that, we have a finite number of lives (five), the possibility of obtaining extra ones only upon reaching 10, 20 and 40 thousand points, the impossibility of continuing and we would have understood how the programmers obtained a high longevity even in the face of only seven game levels (still quite long). We conclude by pointing out the archaic use of passwords to save progress in the game. The flaws Pros: First-rate graphics system Very good sound accompaniment Cons: Defective playability Artificial longevity Password saving Missing the slightest multiplayer mode 1 PAST - The present game belongs to a genre that I have always loved, namely that of scrolling shooters. A genre that has almost decayed today, relegated to a niche market as miserable as its users who are tenacious in supporting it. Moreover, the few software houses engaged on this front are mainly Japanese and in recent times (happy but still few) exponents of the genre have been seen almost exclusively on the dying Dreamcast. PRESENT - To have brought the scrolling shoot 'em up genre for the first time to the now legendary - and controversial - GBA, it still appears to be a Japanese house: the unknown (I admit my ignorance) Shin'en. If the soul of the GBA really lies in retrogaming, well it can only please a similar product in which to be re-proposed is not an old title, but an old concept (albeit now hackneyed) currently almost disappeared, but once thriving and beloved by the public.", "date": "2002-01-05", "grade": null}
