And it's a shame, not only because it's really an excellent film, but also because the tie-in dedicated to it by Gameloft is undoubtedly one of the best exploits in the recent history of the French software house. Adventure mission As is to be expected, The Adventures of Tintin: The Mystery of the Unicorn faithfully follows the events of the film, obviously allowing itself some liberties and diluting particular sequences in order to create real levels. The story is told both through remarkable cutscenes made with the excellent game engine, and through much less exciting, if not downright boring, static images: in both cases, unfortunately, the English dubbing is of a poor quality that clashes with the other high production values of the Gameloft title. In any case, we are faced with an adventure that makes variety its main strength, expertly mixing a series of playful elements that end up blending very well with each other. Alternating with the commands of Tintin, Mil and Captain Haddock, the user browses stealth sections, Assassin's Creed-style acrobatics, environmental puzzles, shooter phases and the inevitable quick time events (here, however, made in an exemplary manner), all often and willingly in the context of a single internship. Precisely thanks to this tendency not to be tied too long to any particular genre, The Adventures of Tintin: The Mystery of the Unicorn flows along like a beauty, despite the fact that at its core it is a fundamentally simplistic game with no great depth. The level of challenge is heavily calibrated downwards, and the linearity of the proposed situations sometimes ends up leading to the concept of an interactive film: however, everything is done so well and with such a marked taste for diversification that it is hard not to appreciate the time spent with the Gameloft product. Also because the developers have been very good at attracting the user's attention even during non-interactive sequences: in fact, in these situations it is possible to tap on the screen to collect coins and puzzle pieces otherwise unattainable during the in-game phases. These serve respectively to buy extras from a special shop and to form portraits that must be reassembled in order to have access to the 3D models of the various characters. In short, the work done on the surrounding elements is also appreciable, something that is often forgotten in the mobile sector, especially when it comes to products of this type. To do this, however, Gameloft has not neglected the fundamentals, starting with an efficient control system and an intelligent execution of quick time events. The real highlight, however, is represented by the graphics, which can count on well-defined polygonal models and decidedly resembling those of the film, animated in an excellent way and which move within scenarios with attention to every detail. There are some absolutely spectacular visual solutions, such as the one relating to the storm clouds in the stage on board the plane: the icing on the cake of a decidedly above average tie-in.
