Sadly Doki Doki Literature Club! it is also impossible to really tell, unless we give gigantic previews: we will try to avoid them, but we will necessarily have to make some mention of the contents. Consider yourself warned. But first things first: the game begins with the classic Japanese visual novel protagonist (but in this case the development team is Western) who has to choose which school club to join. The Girls of the Literary Club In great doubt, she follows the advice of a friend of hers and joins the literary club, attended by three other girls, all with particularities: there is the exuberant little girl, the dark beautiful and the super organized president. The story continues in a fairly typical way, with the player being invited to compose poems day after day by choosing the right words to impress one of three girls (the fourth is excluded for a specific reason that we are not going to tell you). So far nothing strange. Indeed, to be honest, it seems to be faced with a typical and apparently banal visual novel, which treats its subject lightly and superficially. The drawings themselves, well done, follow the typical canons of the genre and do not let us glimpse what will come next. Yes, because as already mentioned, Doki Doki Literature Club! at one point it changes, becoming much more gloomy and sad. The veil of appearances seems to fall and the general levity is disintegrated by themes such as depression, possession and others.

Just Monica Starting the adventure a second time, it is immediately clear that something is wrong, between glitches, attempts by the game to take possession of our pointer, paradoxical texts and disturbing absences. We are playing the same title. We are reading the same texts (almost all). The girls are the same. But we are experiencing something very different. In a literary club, poems are composed by choosing the right words In short, we are pervaded by a very strong sense of unease, which grows and keeps us company until one of the hidden endings, with the representation becoming more and more disturbing. Usually the first is the most chilling one, in which you find yourself ~observed~, but we guarantee that Doki Doki Literature Club is really worth playing several times! to discover the fate of all the girls and have access to the various plot solvers. Do you think that at a certain point the game / player interaction becomes so profound that our every gesture is read and commented on within the gameplay. Doki Doki Literature Club! it therefore reveals us as gamers, putting us in an unpleasant and in a certain sense guilty position, despite the horror apparently being on the other side of the screen. We unwittingly become part of the game and our gestures become pieces of the gameplay itself, to which we begin to give a different weight. We thus understand that the relationship with the characters we interact with is very different from what is normally sold to us: we are their jailers, as in a certain sense we are of all videogame characters. The only way out, but not too much, is the hidden positive ending, even if it is really difficult to understand how to get there if you don't pay attention to all the details (or if you don't look for a solution on the internet). In total Doki Literature Club! it lasts about 8-9 hours, a time you don't regret a single second of.", "date": "2017-10-20", "grade": "9.0"}
