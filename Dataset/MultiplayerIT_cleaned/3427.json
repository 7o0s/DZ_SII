{"name": "Stela", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stela-la-recensione.html", "text": "Among the most important protagonists of the recent addition of unpublished titles to the Apple Arcade catalog, Stela is the new title of SkyBox Labs, a project initially intended for Xbox and PC and which was subsequently also extended to iOS devices. This is not a new name in the playful panorama, and perhaps the most attentive of our readers will remember having already read about it on these pages during the GDC last March, when our Vincenzo Lettera had the opportunity to try a version preliminary title. Now that Stela is finally available, let's try to understand with this review if the work of the Canadian development team can aspire to be recognized as something more than a simple clone of Limbo and Inside. Escape aimlessly The references to the works of Playdead are evident from the very first bars of the adventure, which as per tradition begins without any hint of the plot or indication of the gameplay: in the role of an anonymous girl dressed in white who wakes up in a desolate place, the The user is forced to flee from an unidentified threat with no apparent goal or motivation. Such a dense aura of mystery is fascinating and sensible if supported by a certain underlying coherence that Stela seems to lack, however: Limbo and Inside were equally obscure in their premises, yet they worked thanks to precise design choices, while the work of SkyBox Labs it looks like a mere collage of suggestions put together for the search for an aesthetic quirk. It therefore happens that during the approximately three hours necessary to complete the adventure we witness changes of scenarios that look more like a succession of separate stages than the stages of a real journey: we go from barns infested with deadly insects to forests inhabited by disturbing anthropomorphic figures, from steppes flooded with flaming arrows to ancient laboratories bristling with pitfalls, but there is no real sense of continuity. At least these variations bring with them minimal changes to the gameplay that shuffle the cards of a structure that would otherwise be very basic, considering that the protagonist can only run, jump and perform a few contextual actions: each setting has a leitmotif that reflects in the requests made to the player, which can lean more towards stealth, action or puzzle solving. Too bad, however, that Stela lacks the really solid foundations to be able to effectively support all this scaffolding, starting with the control system. The touch controls are slippery and unresponsive, and the fact that the software often does not understand the user's input well produces even more deaths (and consequent frustration) than those already normally taken into account by the typical trial and error dynamics of this sub-genre. There is no shadow of options and settings, and even the possible use of an external pad does not improve the situation much, also due to a design far from the painstaking care of Playdead titles. The puzzles most often prove to be rather trivial, while the action phases often suffer from too narrow input windows or lack of clarity on which elements of the scenario can be walked on and which cannot. An undoubtedly impactful graphic style also contributes to this confusion but perhaps not exactly functional to the gameplay, which between a very large camera, minute characters and a decisive exploitation of silhouettes and dark shades does not always make it clear where you are going. However, the merits remain of a product that is very beautiful to look at, with an artistic direction that makes itself felt thanks to effective changes of shot and an appreciable differentiation between the various scenarios, also punctuated by an orchestral soundtrack - yes - truly impeccable .", "date": "2019-10-18", "grade": "6.8"}
