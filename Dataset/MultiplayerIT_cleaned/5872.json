Super Dangerous Dungeons doesn't have big pretensions, but it's a sincere and fun free platformer The essential Although this conversion came later, in reality Super Dangerous Dungeons was born before Tiny Dangerous Dungeons, and it can also be understood from the playful setting: if in fact that title is a full-fledged ~metroidvania~, complete with a single large explorable scenario and a protagonist capable of progressing thanks to various power-ups, here the formula is much simpler and more immediate, with 45 short levels divided into four scenarios that focus entirely on the platform component. Few frills also in terms of setting and history, which simply sees the anonymous protagonist engaged in delving into the depths of the dungeons in search of precious treasures. Fortunately, the substance is all concentrated where it is really needed, that is in a gameplay that - despite its elementary being - practically always hits the target. The user's goal is common in all stages, and consists of collecting a key and then reaching the door that allows access to the next level. The control system is equally trivial, and consists only of two arrows to move the character left and right and a key to make him jump: from such an essential setup it is reasonable to expect considerable precision, and indeed in this sense Super Dangerous Dungeons it behaves more than well, and if we exclude the minimum of practice necessary to adapt to the particular physical laws that regulate the motion of the protagonist's leaps, everything runs smoothly from the very first moments of the game. However, the Adventure Islands Games title does its best to make the adventure as painless as possible, putting on the plate a set of initial levels that act as tutorials offering a challenge rate that is absolutely affordable by anyone with a minimum of familiarity with the game. type. Severe but fair After the initial run-in, things undoubtedly become more difficult in Super Dangerous Dungeons, but without ever reaching frustrating heights of difficulty: in the more advanced stages, the game can certainly prove to be challenging and lead the user to frequent deaths, but nothing that cannot be overcome with the right amount of patience. The internships are small in size and it is basically possible to reach the exit of each of them in a matter of seconds, which represents at the same time a positive and negative factor for the title: on the one hand it makes it an ideal choice for making a few short games in his spare time, on the other hand he literally breaks the legs of longevity, considering that for an average expert player it shouldn't be difficult to reach the end credits within an hour or so. However, a Time Trial mode is reserved for challenge enthusiasts which requires you to complete the individual dungeons (or even the entire adventure) in the shortest possible time, with the aim of aiming for the top of the online rankings which also take into account the number of deaths during the run. For a free title that is supported thanks to not too invasive advertisements (and which in any case can be removed by spending 1.99) one certainly cannot complain, also considering the actual qualities in terms of game design: the levels are well studied and prove capable of always offering different and stimulating solutions, and even the paintings dedicated to the bosses are convincing even if they limit themselves to always repeating the same pattern. From a technical point of view, then, Super Dangerous Dungeons has undergone a clear restyling compared to the basic graphic component that characterized the original browser game: while always referring to a pixel art that winks at 8-bit titles, the work by Jussi Simpanen denotes greater complexity as regards the settings and animations of the protagonist, here much more fluid and varied. The sound is less convincing, with the effect of the jump even annoying and music that literally leaves the time it finds.", "date": "2015-11-24", "grade": "8.0"}
