Far from the immediacy of a control system that has now become an integral part of all football-loving gamers, on Wii PES thus became a sort of deep and complex strategy game in which the utopian idea of controlling the entire team, and not just the player in possession of the ball, it seemed to finally come true. All with a wiimote The Wii debut with Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 was actually well received by the market, with over a million copies sold in total; an interesting figure, which however was not even remotely reached by the following year's version. Perhaps the casual evolution of the user of the Nintendo console, perhaps the few new elements compared to its predecessor, perhaps the game's reluctance to adapt to local multiplayer games on the same TV and the very steep learning curve have contributed to cooling down the enthusiasm around a concept evidently not easy to digest, despite the great potential. In this uncomfortable situation, and with Konami's already declared interest in adapting its series to future Natal and Wand, PES 2010 makes its debut on Wii surrounded by very little fanfare, much more subdued than its predecessors , without wanting to bother the 360 and Ps3 editions. That it is a signal from Konami of the will to abort the further development of the project, we are not given to know; what we do know, however, is that PES 2010 adds very little to the 2009 edition, limiting itself to rather marginal elements in addition to the obvious update of teams and squads. In fact, the major innovative element is to be found in the management of free kicks, now capable of offering the game a wider range of possibilities with lots of variation of the trajectory and effect simply by rotating the inclination of the Wiimote. At the same time, edge kick specialists can enjoy a further choice, which results in an even more effective and calibrated shot ready to head towards the top corner. If, on the other hand, you find yourself having to defend yourself from a set piece, it is now possible to manage the position of the goalkeeper with great freedom. For the rest, PES 2010 makes subtle corrections to elements such as dribbling and the defensive phase, more specifically the doubling of marking, even if the chronic problems of the game mechanics continue to place the attack phases in a position that is certainly advantageous with respect to the management of the coverage. I will raise the cup! As for the options and game modes, everything has remained largely unchanged; online support, the Champions League, the Master League, the use of Miis, and so on. Exactly like last year, also on this occasion, alongside total control via the Wiimote + Nunchuck system, the possibility of using the Classic Controller is offered to face the title exactly as with any normal PES for Ps2, version from which technically comes this for the Wii. The aesthetic component therefore remains anchored to now outdated standards with low quality textures, modest animations and certainly not impeccable fidelity of the players in the resemblance to the real counterparts. More generally, even the foundations of the gameplay, anchored to dictates far from the refinement of modern football titles, now feel the weight of the years a lot. We would like to go into further details on the news, but unfortunately there is little to talk about; in summary - as clarified - there are only a handful of aspects that distinguish this new chapter from the previous one, and consequently it is easy to find yourself in difficulty at the time of evaluation. On the one hand it is true that PES 2010 represents the best football available on the Wii, both for those who want to play it in a ~normal~ way via the Classic Controller, and for those who have the desire and patience to try their hand at the exclusive variant for the Nintendo console. At the same time, however, the almost total fidelity with last year's version and the far from subtle sensation of an exhaustion of the innovative vein of this Wii edition raise more than a few doubts about a possible purchase.", "date": "2009-12-29", "grade": "8.7"}
