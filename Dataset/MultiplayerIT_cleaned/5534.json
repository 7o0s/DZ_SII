It is evident that for years the sports market for sofa athletes has dried up, relegating less popular sports to white flies. We also welcome the welcome return of Tiger Woods on the cover, a champion who had to overcome quite a few personal difficulties in his career. We were saying, golf games: if it is true that the square is occupied by few players, PGA Tour 2K23 manages to put income these two years of pause, proposing a generally smoother, richer, correct and accessible experience than its predecessor, finally opening up to a slightly more horizontal gameplay in terms of offer, even for those who chew golf a little less. Follow us in the PGA Tour 2K23 review to understand whether or not the new HB Studios game has made a hole. The 3 pressure system Tiger Woods returns to PGA Tour 2K23 If you come from the previous episodes, you will have already made the call to the Swing Stick system, or the swing performed through the inclination and release of the right analog. It is a system that is certainly open to a non-trivial but rewarding learning curve, the problem is the path that leads to that longed-for satisfaction: it is an ingenious but punishing system, which is linked to our thumb ability to draw - in every sense - precise swing trajectories. Every slightest mistake involves sending the ball where we didn't want it and consequently frustration to digest and overcome. Well, HB Studios has wisely opted to insert a new, at least for the series, highly appreciated swing system, the 3 pressure swing. We rely on the X to start charging the power, the blow is released and balanced: the result is gameplay that is closer to the concept of event-driven video games that we know best, which has given us greater control and precision in the medium term. If this is not enough, you can always change the difficulty level designed to ensure less frustration in the initial stages. All of this, of course, gathers the part around the tee; in reality, the beauty of 2K23 is not so much the shock part - which is still hilarious - as much as the study of the field, its conformation, slopes and wind. Once the stroke is mastered, the game confronts us with a flow of calculation of variables, as well as an examination of distances and position of obstacles. The choice of stick remains a recommended element, while we will have to decide independently the type of shot, the angle and the effect. The approach is particularly complex, i.e. approaching the hole from the green, in which studying the course proves to be even more important than in the past: even in the initial holes, the avant-green will almost always hide pitfalls that will make you tighten of anger the punch but which, at the same time, will give enormous satisfaction when you learn to read the surface and catch the first pars. Top golf everywhere The fields of PGA Tour 2K23 are certainly well done and often lush, but don't get too close to the view To the 17 courses inherited from the past, in the 2K23 edition HB Studios has added 3 more: South Course of Wilmington Country Club, The Renaissance Club and the St. George's Golf and Country Club, plus 3 more promised in the post-launch (Pebble Beach Golf Club, Spyglass Hill and Torrey Pines). It's a decent sum, but the quality fluctuates: there are excellent courses, well made, others a little less inspired. We don't know what your expertise is in this regard, but the fairways offered by HB Studios are mostly Anglo-Saxon, taken from among the most famous in the United States and the United Kingdom. It's understandable, on the other hand they are important nations from a golfing point of view, it's only sad to note how the team has focused on this precise offer, without risking less famous courses, but perhaps more inspired in terms of environment. Of course, if you want you can always design them yourself with the Course Designer, or download one of the old courses already uploaded by the community, which has literally flooded PGA 2K21 with more than 300,000 creations. But let's get to Topgolf, perhaps the most interesting playful addition: if you don't know Topgolf, know that it is an ~indoor~ golf driving range, in the sense that within special structures players aim with electronically tracked balls at targets, with the aim of making long shots and getting close to the targets. You can play in co-op as well as online, adding this mode to the activities to do in PGA Tour 2K23, which has become a multinational institution in the last 20 years. It works and even if a bit branded as a subversive trend by traditionalists, it's a nice addition that introduces a modo different than to undertake a gaming session. Gigetto, our golfer The PGA Tour 2K23 career is certainly a fun activity to experience, between character creation, skills and various challenges We come to the more purely technical, interface and aesthetic characteristics. PGA Tour 2K23 is certainly a beautiful sight: we played it on PS5 and perhaps for the first time we can opt for the Quality mode with satisfaction, as golf is not exactly a frenetic sport that requires an important screen flow, although the Performance mode ensures more precision in the swing. A matter of choices and dexterity. Models and animations of the protagonist and the staff are good, less those of the audience; the slopes are instead well made, worthily transmitting the local flora, passing from lush trees and lakes to tropical beaches. However, it is clear that the technical part is not the one where the team has invested the most time, perhaps once again kept low by a game also present on the old-gen, with just 60 frames and some small improvements for the PC, Xbox Series X |S and PS5. We also noticed not very slow loading times, but we hope they will be fixed. The possibility of creating your own avatar is back, with an editor that is not huge, but absolutely decent; we therefore started the career of Gigetto, our avatar, thanks to the MyCareer mode, an actual simulation of a PGA Tour season, updated, modernized and enriched with a whole skill tree-style progression system, which can be unlocked by doing tournaments; skills, among other things, will be activated in certain situations, helping the player to progress. The same goes for the game currency, which can be collected to buy clothes, accessories, sticks and grips, but also through the now inevitable micro-transactions, even if unrelated to skills and exclusively linked to the aesthetic part. In general, the career is full-bodied, satisfying and stimulating, certainly resulting in the most engaging playful component among those proposed and now an inevitable ~countryside~ style feature in sports games. By the way, Tiger Woods and other current golf celebrities are back, accompanied by other sports celebrities such as Michael Jordan and Stephen Curry. Everything works, however it must be said that the interface is not absolutely flawless: it will take a long time to learn how to navigate the menus, skills, advancements and in general the whole setting on the screen is not very clear. On the other hand, the audio is good, which sees the commentators express their opinion by commenting on our hole with a certain abundance of detail and emphasis. All exclusively in English, of course, just as cross-play for online is unfortunately absent.", "date": "2022-10-15", "grade": "8.4"}
