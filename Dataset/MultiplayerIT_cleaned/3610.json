{"name": "Super Mario Maker 2: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-mario-maker-2-recensione.html", "text": "Let's start from the undeniable assumption that Super Mario Maker has been a success: it was released at the end of 2015, when Wii U was now ready to be buried, and still managed to sell four million copies. He was appreciated by the critics, including our editorial staff, and above all he was loved by the public, who supported him for a long time with his creations. So it was normal that sooner or later, also considering the success of Nintendo Switch, Super Mario Maker 2 would arrive, of which you can read the review. However, the path that led to the arrival of this game didn't seem to us to be supported by an adamantine logic. Despite Super Mario Bros., and with this name we refer to the two-dimensional saga, not to the plumber's adventures in general, despite - we said - being by far the most famous and best-selling Nintendo brand in the world, it is not particularly valued in Kyoto. Which constitutes a huge paradox. At the beginning of 2019, the remake of New Super Mario Bros. U was released, a good two-dimensional platform dated 2012, the Wii U launch game; in Deluxe edition, but still a remake of a title from seven years ago. In all this time, Nintendo has not continued this series, a saga already partially compromised by the reiteration of the same contents, the same engine, the same aspect. In our opinion it would have been more sensible to develop a new two-dimensional chapter, this time properly funded (at least on a par with the three-dimensional saga) and, only later, to give birth to Super Mario Maker 2, integrating the new Skin taken from the recent (and unfortunately hypothetical) episode 2D. It didn't happen that way. But in Kyoto they are aware of the problem, if we want to call it that, and in fact the Super Mario 3D World Skin has been included in this sequel: the Skin of a three-dimensional game, which in fact has very little to do with the others, and creates a unexpected internal consistency problem. Editors Let's take a step back and talk for a moment about the essence of Super Mario Maker 2, namely its editor, which is even more functional and intuitive than its predecessor. Nintendo has chosen to fully support the line that sponsors Switch, namely ~where, when and with whoever you want~, in fact it is also possible to create levels from the TV, joy-con in hand (also in multiplayer, a curious addition but nothing more) . An option that is certainly welcome, which however fails to compete with the best method of creation, namely the touch screen. In this regard, the fingers are just fine (the smaller you have, the better), but the stylus is essentially incomparable: predictably, the ideal tool for using the editor remains the one already appreciated on Wii U. The changes to the interface are few, but considered and precise: the various elements have been divided into many categories (for example ~enemies, ~devices~, etc...), and each of them is visually represented by a wheel. In this second episode all the contents are available immediately, you don't have to wait days and hours for them to appear: the same lessons of Yamamura, the pigeon game designer (yes, that's right), have become optional. However, fortunately, these are not the most interesting news. Firstly, if in Super Mario Maker the keystone was represented by Super Mario Bros., here Nintendo has done everything possible to enhance the qualities of the individual Skins (in addition to the one just mentioned, those of Super Mario Bros. 3 are available , Super Mario World, New Super Mario Bros. and, as anticipated, Super Mario 3D World). A choice symbolized by the introduction, only apparently secondary, of the descents and climbs, absent in the progenitor for the NES: the inclined planes not only allow Mario to slide (Super Mario Bros. excluded), but allow to concoct more varied paths. This dethronement also led to the elimination of amiibo support, which we didn't like at all, given that Super Mario Maker had been one of the games to make the most of them, both visually and playfully: as a result, the power-up that granted to Mario, although small, to break the blocks anyway. However, the most interesting novelty lies in the introduction of secondary objectives, tasks to be completed before the level can be completed: the collection of some coins (red or traditional ones), the killing of a particular enemy, a condition to be met (get to the end of the journey with the cape, for example) and so on. It may seem like a minor novelty, but it is not. We also liked the new environments (desert, snow, sky and forest), as well as the possibility to switch them between main and secondary zone (a pipe from the desert can lead to snow, for example), and finally thestages can be significantly expanded both vertically and horizontally. In the castles and aquatic sections, the water level can now be raised and lowered, which complements the already impressive base from the first episode. We have only two small criticisms to make here. First of all, however beautiful and interesting the night mode is, which gives each setting new characteristics, not only visual ones (in the ~sky~, for example, gravity becomes lunar), it must be said that it is too difficult to unlock: you have to insert an ~Evil Sun~ in the editor, hold it down, and then click on the newly appeared Moon. After that, the mode becomes available next to the environments, as it should have been from the beginning. The second thing that didn't convince us, and which we'll talk about better shortly, is the Super Mario World 3D Skin. At the moment we limit ourselves to pointing out that, unlike all the others, when it is applied it tends to eliminate all the elements already inserted in the stage. Online Even the Online mode, just like the editor, represents a refinement of the one already admired in the first Super Mario Maker. Also in this area Nintendo has worked with the probe, adding small details capable of significantly improving the overall experience. First, the levels have been tagged: ~racing~, ~short but beautiful~ (no jokes), ~difficult~, ~competitive~, and many others. Initially they are affixed by the creator of the stage, then they can be modified by users. It is an interesting novelty, which goes hand in hand with the thematic differentiation - mainly due to the secondary objectives - which we were talking about earlier. It is normal that some want to play only traditional stages, and that others appreciate more atypical levels (for example those based on shooters, with the Clown Koopa ship, or entirely based on research or puzzles): with this new setting, you will be able to avoid wasting time with internships that don't interest you. Just like in the first Super Mario Maker, before publishing your creation online, you must complete it offline: a sacred method to avoid uploading impossible courses. The Infinite Challenge is also back, a series of levels, randomly selected from the online bulletin board, to be tackled one after the other: they are divided according to the percentage of completion, into four categories ranging from ~easy~ to ~Super difficult~. Those who prefer to play, rather than create, have been given more emphasis in the online rankings: as in the first, there are many medals for the most popular authors, but now there are also rankings for the best players, both in single and in multiplayer. In this regard, it should be noted that the multiplayer mode, in particular the offline one, is less important than we expected: to be able to jump in company - at the moment - it is necessary to download a stage, open it from the Memobot (your own store of levels, in substance) and from there start it in two or more players. There are four selectable characters, but as expected there are no differences, if not visual, between them. Online multiplayer is more interesting: you can challenge each other on the net both from the sofa, but in this case you need a Switch and a copy of the skull game, and by looking for online opponents. In the version we tested it was not yet possible to compete against the users of your Friends List, but Nintendo has confirmed that the option will be added soon. Offline In Kyoto they have well thought of introducing a Story Mode, absent in the original, but already appreciated - albeit set differently - in the reduction for Nintendo 3DS. Let's start with two facts: it's fun, varied and well done, even with a different narrative pretext than usual (Mario has to rebuild Peach's castle). At the same time, it cannot compete - not even remotely - with a traditional Super Mario Bros. adventure: not even with the less inspired and more recent ones linked to the New Super Mario Bros. derivation. This is both by vocation and by choice. First of all, the levels are composed with the editor, so they don't present any element of surprise compared to the tools usable by any other user: no new settings, no new enemies, no coherent path of the stages, and so on. Secondly, the Story Mode is a sort of implicit editor, which suggests to users how to create interesting levels: not necessarily by imitating the tradition therefore, but ranging, exploring the possibilities granted by Super Mario Maker, with its secondary objectives and all other oddballs (enemy columns, switches, margimmicks with devices...). We reiterate it: a fun mode, the absence of which would have been serious, but which alone does not justify the purchase of the game in the slightest. The visual impact itself is rather questionable, given that the polygonal graphics, and the possibility of going in depth, clash rather violently with the rest of the product: it can only be seen in the map of the castle, which you visit to access the various missions, but however, clashes with the various levels, and with the style - truly commendable, with the shadows under the sprites - admired in the various Skins. In this regard, we close our review with the speech that we refer from the beginning of the article, namely 3D World: on an identity level, the very antithesis of New Super Mario Bros. The latter is a structurally two-dimensional game, which exploits the polygonal interaction to renew the series. Super Mario 3D World is a 3D game, with a hybrid control system, which introduces 2D mechanics to be more linear and intuitive: however, despite being a remarkable work, and while winking at two dimensions, it comes out neutered if deprived of the depth. And in fact, on only two axes, it is crushed by New Super Mario Bros., which guarantees a variety of jumps, and above all a rhythm and speed of action, completely unrelated to 3D World. It remains a useful option for creating slow and puzzle levels, but it clashes with all the other Skins both in terms of control system, speed, distances and identity: it is no coincidence that it is not interchangeable with the others. It's simply not a game of Super Mario Bros. (two-dimensional): the only series from which Super Mario Maker, set up as it is set up today, is supposed to pilfer DNA.", "date": "2019-06-26", "grade": "8.6"}
