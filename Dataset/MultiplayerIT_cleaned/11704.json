{"name": "EA Playground - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ea-playground-recensione.html", "text": "In a lot of places, actually. EA Playground follows in the footsteps of a genre born exactly together with the two-screen portable console, when Sega proposed Project Rub and Nintendo itself followed suit with the Touch Screen version of the hilarious Wario Ware Inc. Actually Playground was born within the EA's attempt to capitalize on the unexpected success of the Wii, whereby the portable version could be mistaken for the classic ~afterthought~ or at the very least as a quick and painless way to exploit the huge installed base of the DS and thus finance the ~major~ product, but upon careful analysis it reveals itself as a game capable of standing on its own legs, albeit without surprising bystanders with special effects and out of the ordinary qualities. Are you taking me to the playground? In a video game panorama like the current one, in which for the poor reviewer it is much more difficult to explain to readers the premises and dynamics of increasingly complex and tangled games than playing them, being faced with the simplicity of Playground is almost disorienting, especially when we consider that, although intended largely for an audience of children, we are still dealing with an EA product, always on the crest of the wave when it comes to cutting-edge trends. In Playground, all you do is choose an avatar between the two present, a male and a female, give it a name and enter the playground that gives its name to everything, nothing more. Inside the park you will also find quite a few brats like you each intent on their favorite game among the nine present: those with a star on their heads are ready to challenge you, as for each game there are three different levels of difficulty and before you can compete with the best kids you'll have to defeat those at your level. Furthermore, each child offers you different challenges, namely the ~main~ one, by winning which you will unlock the mini-game in Quick Mode, and one or more variations on the theme, with identical mechanics but with differences, for example, in calculating points or in the required objectives; once you have won all the challenges, you will be able to move on to the next difficulty level within that particular game. With each victory, the defeated character will give you a certain number of marbles, which constitute Playground's currency: in fact, they can be sold to certain playmates, perhaps the ~most prominent~ of the park, in exchange for stickers that unlock skills, moves and hints for each game. The exploratory element of the park is almost completely absent, as the challenges are immediately identifiable and the only request that will be made to you will be to win some before accessing one of the four areas into which the park is divided. I'm the champion! The life of the video game protagonist lasts: while every child in the park is dedicated to one and only one activity, you will have to specialize in all of them to complete the adventure... We said, there are nine mini-games: let's analyze them a little more in detail, without however making judgments, if not general, on their goodness. The preference for one game rather than another will in fact be greatly influenced by personal tastes and inclinations; what interests us now is to ascertain the solidity of their realization, which, we can already anticipate, cannot be questioned. Football - You will challenge one or more children to score as many goals as possible in a goal defended by a goalkeeper who is anything but irresistible... There are balls of different colors, some of which give more speed or are worth two points. The possibility of stealing the ball from the opponent with a tackle is fun and fundamental... It's a game that brings to mind the practice matches that we used to organize as children... Palla bollata - Or Dodgeball, if you prefer: you'll have to hit the opposing team with the ball , located on the upper screen. Whoever is hit is eliminated, vice versa by intercepting an opponent's shot a teammate is brought back to life. The ~special move~ is a more powerful shot, you'll basically just use that. RC Racing - Remember RC Pro Am, Super Off Road or even Micromachines itself? Well, this is a stripped-down version, complete with Mario Kart-esque weapons and power-ups. being faced with the simplicity of Playground is almost unsettling I'm the champion! Skate and splash - The half-pipe  la Tony Hawk where you can ring in as many stunts as possible, only here to perform them you will have to connect a series of progressively numbered points using the stylus before time runs out. Very hectic! Blowgun - Here the ~noble~ reference is instead Operation Wolf, or maybe House of the Dead for the younger ones: aim the opposing children with the stylus, blowing into the microphone to shoot the bullet.Saltarello - The ~mechanics~ of the classic Campana in Playground have been transformed into a kind of Bemani in which you will have to replicate the sequence and times dictated by the opponent. Baskets - Like Calcio, this too is a replica of the ~half-field~ matches that were organized as children: you simply have to score more points than your opponent, bearing in mind that there are certain areas of the field from which to score baskets will net you a loot greater Trampoline - Jumping on the trampoline will take you to gradually greater heights: the points will be awarded by the balloons that you will burst, being careful to avoid the birds that fly, rightly so, on their own. You can hinder the opponent by pushing him or jumping on him! Insect Hunting - We fail to make too many judgments here to present this as the most frustrating minigame of the entire collection: armed with a screen and guided by the stylus, you will have to catch the butterflies flying by the dozens around the upper screen , avoiding the bees which, however, are also very numerous... Fortunately, bonuses arrive every now and then to help us... Apart from a few (for example in Skate and squirt you can only use the touch screen), most of the mini-games give you the possibility to exploit the features of the DS or resort to more traditional control systems. Here too the choice will depend on your inclinations, but it probably won't take long to realize that, for example, shooting by blowing into the microphone in a blowgun is much more fun, while, conversely, the directional cross makes controlling the trampoline jumper extremely intuitive. Video game bullying There is no game whose realization stands out, positively or negatively, compared to the others, and as we said you will prefer one or the other depending on your tastes. Ultimately, however, they will all remain at least pleasant to play, and will actually become more frenetic and difficult as the difficulty levels go by: at the higher levels, either for the mechanics or for the objectives to be achieved, some of the games can give some a hard time even for players far more seasoned than the children to whom the product is ultimately dedicated. Completing the main adventure is, for an expert, a matter of an afternoon, but actually a child could spend several hours on it. To increase longevity we think on the one hand the possibility of playing each minigame individually, on the other the multiplayer up to four players which, especially in the most competitive games (those where it is possible to hinder the opponent with various improprieties, for example) and frantic, it is very funny; it is also a half-wasted opportunity, however, because not only the exploitation of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection is missing, but also any multiplayer mode with a single card, which would have helped a lot even if somewhat limited. There is no game whose realization stands out, positively or negatively, compared to the others Video game bullying The graphic style with which Playground presents itself to us is, in a word, strange: everything in 2D, there is nothing particular to report for the discreet backdrops, while the characters, perhaps in an attempt to reconcile childish cuteness on the one hand and trendy teenager style on the other, they are rendered and out of context, resulting in truth to be a bit disturbing also because they move like the characters of Celebrity Deathmatch and always have a strange grin on their face Are they related to Chucky? The review could also close with this joke, but we still have to talk about the sound, which is very simple: if it hadn't been there, no one would have noticed it, it is so anonymous and poor. It's not bad, it's simply insignificant, which is increasingly noticeable in productions that are not of the highest level. A bad trend, in the opinion of the writer, on the part of developers. If you are looking for a gift for your little brother or cousin, EA Playground is recommended and the numerical evaluation you find here leaves some time, having been made on the basis of elements that a critic must necessarily consider, but which nothing take away from the enjoyment that a child can find in this series of mini-games that are always well made, simple and fun. The only problem is that the competition on DS is strong, from Wario Ware to Mario Party just to name the most illustrious names, the fact remains that Playground, albeit less ~sensational~, gets along worthily even against these sacred monsters .Pros There are a good number of mini-games and they are all well done. Cons Fun but not complete multiplayer Kids with a killer grin!", "date": "2007-12-27", "grade": null}
