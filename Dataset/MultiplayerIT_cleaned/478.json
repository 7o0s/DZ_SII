{"name": "Mega Man Maverick Hunter X", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mega-man-maverick-hunter-x.html", "text": "Mega make up Mega Man Maverick Hunter X is nothing more than Capcom's tribute to a historic episode from 1993, released on SNES with the simple title of Mega Man X and recognized by many as one of the best adventures of the blue robot. The reason for such an appreciation does not lie so much in innovative play mechanics compared to the prequels (also because the Capcom action game has never changed much in this respect), but rather in a more adult and sophisticated style, which broke the tradition in this sense. Set several years after the previous ones, Mega Man X saw our protagonist on the hunt for rebel automatons called Mavericks: these, once placid servants of humans, in fact longed to conquer the world behind the guidance of their wicked boss Sigma, naturally massacring their old masters. Of course, X (this is the new name of the blue hero) took on the task of stopping them with blaster shots, and as it is equally obvious, not even a minimal part of the plot has been changed for the PSP version. The additions from a narrative point of view instead concern appreciable manga-style drawings that flank the text boxes during the dialogues, enriched by a considerably over the top dubbing but still suitable for the purpose. However, the spearhead of Mega Man Maverick Hunter X is undoubtedly the cosmetic realization, entirely polygonal and capable of exploiting the potential of the Sony handheld in a remarkable way. The action always takes place on a 2D plane, but scenarios and characters acquire an extra dimension on PSP, resulting at the same time respectful of the original design and avant-garde in strictly aesthetic terms. Fans of the saga will therefore have no trouble recognizing familiar landscapes and enemies, while new users will find themselves faced with graphics made up of evocative backgrounds, well-finished polygonal models and absolutely noteworthy special effects. On the other hand, the speech regarding the sound sector is less enthusiastic, characterized by ups and downs especially in the music: the tracklist, composed entirely of remixes of the original 16-bit score, convinces up to a certain point, with some captivating and others decidedly less successful. Master Blasters However, the improvements of Mega Man Maverick Hunter X compared to its inspirer stop substantially in the audiovisual department, seen and considered how the Capcom product is played in the same way now as it was back in 1993. Which is undoubtedly good for fans of the saga, while it could make the rest of the users turn up their noses: a rather high level of difficulty and a game scheme that defining ~classic~ is an understatement remain aspects that traditionally divide those who deal with Mega Man between those who love him and who hates it. In any case, Mega Man Maverick Hunter X is formed as usual by a series of stages with various settings, each of which presents a boss at its end, whose defeat allows you to inherit the weapon to be able to use it in the following levels. In short, really nothing new: compared to the past, only a few small differences in the behavior of some enemies and as regards obtaining upgrades, distributed in an unprecedented way between the levels, are to be recorded. But it is still a remake, which as such aims to re-propose a winning formula by altering it as little as possible, and from this point of view the work done by Capcom with Mega Man Maverick Hunter X is certainly appreciable. What is certain is that some bonus internships would not have hurt, seen and considered how - despite considerable difficulties - you get to the final screen in a couple of hours, a bit short by the standards of today's audience. However, there are also the unlockable extras, even if not exciting: once the game is completed you can face the adventure again in the role of Vile, X's historical nemesis (armed to the teeth), and an interesting anime of 24 minutes that illustrates some background aspects of the story. Comment Mega Man Maverick Hunter X is a well done remake, which faithfully reproduces the spirit of the original title released on SNES making sure to accompany everything with an audiovisual department that complies with PSP standards. That said, the Capcom product shows itself to be rather poised in its relationship with the public, given that the variations on the playful level are practically non-existent and that in any case its gameplay remains anchored to perhaps slightly obsolete criteria for younger users. However, Mega Man Maverick Hunter X remains an absolutely advisable title for those looking for some healthy two-dimensional action. Pros Great graphics Solid gameplay One of thefew exponents of the genre on PSP Cons Game structure unchanged from the original Longevity rather reduced Perhaps too old school for some The concept of remake has always been at the center of various controversies between those who see it as a useful tool for rediscovering things otherwise exposed to the risk of being forgotten and those who consider it a mere commercial operation resulting from a chronic lack of ideas. However you look at it, in the videogame field the remaking processes are not at all rare, on the contrary they probably currently know their period of maximum ~splendor~: this is demonstrated by Capcom itself, which with the Mega Man franchise alone has churned out in the space of a very short time two remakes for PSP, or Powered Up and the present here Maverick Hunter X ...", "date": "2006-06-02", "grade": null}
