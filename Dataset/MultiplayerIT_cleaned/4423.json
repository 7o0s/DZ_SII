A successful experiment? We reveal it to you in the review of Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds. Story: between aliens and portals Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds, Dani knocked out after the explosion Dani Rojas sits quietly drinking a beer on Yara beach, when at one point he observes the crash of what appears to be a meteorite. The impact occurred very close, but as the man (or woman, depending on what you chose) approaches the crater, a luminous globe emerges which, suspended in mid-air, begins to throw lightning strikes everything around him. Taken aback, Dani pulls out her gun and shoots him, causing an explosion that knocks him out. When he recovers, a sort of talking spark named Fai explains to him that he has screwed up, practically destroying his ship and forcing both of them to remain imprisoned in a parallel dimension until space rescue arrives ... in a few million years. The only way to speed up the process is to access a series of portals and recover the five crystals needed to repair the vehicle, thus allowing not only Fai to leave for her world, but also Dani to return to Yara . There's just one problem: the fifteen scenarios that make up this alternate reality are populated by hostile creatures, armed to the teeth and determined to eliminate any invader. The story of Lost Between Worlds is consumed in the dialogues between the protagonist and the alien entity , and there is no shortage of entertaining interludes, such as when the latter takes on animal forms after receiving the crystals, narrated through interlude sequences that boast the same excellent quality as those of Far Cry 6. Structure: roguelike or roguelite? Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds, the initial stage that we will have to go through during each attempt There is no doubt that the developers of Far Cry 6 have a weakness for the roguelike approach, which characterizes not only the three DLCs dedicated to the villains of the series but also Lost Between Worlds. In this case, however, perhaps there was no need: the structure had enough body to stand even in the presence of a normal progression, and so the fact of having to start all over again at game over is an extra we would have gladly done without. Luckily, even in this case there are elements that actually transform the experience into a less ruthless roguelite: if we have collected enough sparks, in the event of death we will be able to decide to spend a part of it to start over from the beginning of the stage that we have reached and therefore not return to the starting point. Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds, one of the most visually striking maps in the pack In the same way, the recovery of crystals and the skills that will be given to us by Fai in such contexts will not go to zero and on the contrary will contribute to diversifying our subsequent expeditions, allowing us, for example, to access alternative routes. On the other hand, we will not keep the equipment, entrusted to chance from time to time, but which summarizes the instrumentation seen in the main campaign between pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles and special objects. As mentioned, Lost Between Worlds puts a total of fifteen scenarios accessible via portals are available (a bit like in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, although here the loading of the stages takes a few seconds), each with a different theme, tougher enemies, any modifiers to take into consideration and several good ideas on the visual front. All things considered, the duration of around four hours (but variable according to your performance) is adequate for the selling price of the package. Gameplay: Far Cry 6 with a pinch of Ikaruga Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds, the portals through which we can reach new areas In the Far Cry 6 review we explained why the gunplay of this latest episode of the Ubisoft series didn't excite us, full of hitbox hits and a general lack offinishing that make it simply not up to its undoubted potential. Unfortunately, the system has remained unchanged in view of the expansion, although some variations on the theme have been introduced. Remember the classic Ikaruga? Here, in Lost Between World we will be able to change the color of our weapon from red to blue instantly, by pressing the d-pad (but placing this command elsewhere would have helped to make the action more fluid: too bad), for being able to hurt enemies of the same tone: a further element of challenge, which is felt in particular during the most agitated sequences, such as for example in the excellent boss fight that closes the adventure. Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds, one of the crystal enemies we will have to face Beyond this mechanism, the scenarios also present very different situations: in some cases we will find ourselves solving small environmental puzzles and platform sections in order to continue, in other cases we will have to move underwater for most of the time, or even find the right path inside a labyrinth or watch for lightning falling from the sky while we explore the map. The inevitable repetitiveness resulting from the obligation to replay the same stages in the event of a game over is therefore compensated, at least in part, by the variety of action and alternate paths unlockable as crystals are recovered. Of course, as mentioned, the shooting is what it is, the novelty of the colors leaves some time and after having dedicated a few dozen hours to the main campaign this system could have tired you by now: it's up to you to decide if you still want to Far Cry 6 or lower. Technical realization: limited trials Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds, a scenario with an urban flavor We have mentioned that the scenarios of Lost Between Worlds are able to give truly suggestive glimpses, which mix some places of Yara with new constructions, crystals that come out from everywhere and objects suspended in the void, similar to the Mirror Dimension of the films of Doctor Strange, but without clearly reaching those levels. The final result is pleasant, too bad the design of the enemies is so trivial. Little to say about the sound: the expansion has practically no music, the effects are functional to the action and the English dialogues are well interpreted, but listening to them has reopened a wound : you will undoubtedly remember that Far Cry 6 is the first chapter of the series not to have a dub in Italian and we really hope it is an isolated case for Ubisoft, because it is clear that a complete localization would have contributed to the success of this product also in Italy. Final considerations Lost Between Worlds surprisingly adds a further expansion to the post-launch content of Far Cry 6, characterized so far by experimentation on the structural front and by some undoubtedly captivating ideas, although not always rendered at their best. Again we are faced with a roguelike-style adventure, with enough substance to entertain for a few hours and a good variety of situations within scenarios that are often visually striking. However, the limitations of the base game's gunplay are still present and you may have had enough: it's up to you whether or not to accept this latest Twilight Challenge.", "date": "2022-12-11", "grade": null}
