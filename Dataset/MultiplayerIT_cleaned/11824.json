{"name": "Tony Hawk's Proving Ground - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-proving-ground-recensione.html", "text": "We Italians are made like this: while loving traditions infinitely, we often let ourselves be hypnotized by the fashions of the moment. In recent years, many overseas products have captured the attention of a more or less vast audience: just think of reality shows, Wrestling or the more recent World Poker Tour. Try questioning a child: it's easier to capable of displaying full houses and royal flushes that fail to answer the most obvious of cultural questions. Similarly, eight years ago, Neversoft was developing a game that would soon have half the world passionate about a sport, skateboarding, until then totally ignored outside the States. Our memory is short, but it is probable that the previews of the time relegated the Activision game to a miserable article at the bottom of the page. We are the homeland of football, how could we be interested in deranged people who risk their own safety just to go down a staircase? Well, the first chapter, dated 1999, achieved incredible success in sales and criticism, and became the progenitor of a genre, that of extreme sports, today tremendously abused. And if until a month ago the Tony Hawk series represented the ne plus ultra of the category, today this leadership is undoubted by the latest effort by EA, that Skate which, thanks to a marked propensity for realism, is establishing itself as the new yardstick. Activision has obviously not been watching, and has tried to regain the scepter with this new chapter. And you, which skateboarder are you? The new watchword, at Activision, is customization. After having carefully created your alter ego, which can be configured thanks to a convenient and exhaustive editor, it is in fact possible to choose the career that best suits your skate-are style. The new single-player mode is thus divided into three macro-subsections, called Hardcore Skater, Rigger and Pro Skater. Depending on the choices, certain characteristics are acquired: for example, the hardcore skater will soon be master of unusual techniques such as the Aggro kick, very useful for reaching high speeds, while the professional one will increasingly perfect the cleanliness of his tricks. The ~growth~ that you want to give to your alter ego is in the hands of the player: by embarking on a career, in fact, you do not preclude the possibility of learning the techniques of others, and it will therefore be possible, as well as profitable, to progress in parallel to ensure that your skater has as many moves as possible. The depth of the title lies precisely in the different approach of the various styles: Hardcore are skaters who, regardless of danger, go in search of the most unusual places to show their ~art~; their natural habitats therefore become the roofs of buildings, electricity pylons and subway rails. On the contrary, the Pros are the Tony Hawks of the situation, capable of filling the squares and constantly looking for the god of money, be it in the form of a prize from a competition or a sponsor. Last, but not least, the Riggers: commonly called ~innovators~, they don't limit themselves to skating in extreme conditions, but prefer to build the ~amusement park~ of their dreams with their own hands. Everything is quick and functional, thanks to a full-bodied editor that allows you to customize the playing area with handrails, half pipes, ramps and the like. If all this were not enough, you can also place a digital camera in the most congenial areas: in this way, your most spectacular shots could soon be featured on the covers of specialized magazines. GT...H? As in the last chapters, Proving Ground has also maintained its background nature of free-roaming. And if in GTA the exploration of the city is essential for the growth of one's underworld position, in Tony Hawk it will be necessary for the sole purpose of progressing towards the Olympus of Skateboarding. The non-player characters therefore play a fundamental role: scattered along the streets of the unprecedented location (the result of the union of the most characteristic districts of Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia), they provide explanations and advice, subjecting you to ~missions~ useful for increasing your ability. From the point of view of playability, as per tradition, the laws of physics must be forgotten: the arcade nature that has always accompanied the series in fact offers the discipline of skate in a grotesque and improbable key, but no less spectacular for this. You will therefore witness infinite leaps and illogically prodigious tricks; however this will certainly not discourage lovers of the saga. The novelty is represented by the introduction of the Nail the Grab and the Nail the Manual, which are added to the Nail the Trick already implemented in the last episode. In essence, it is a question of ~nailing~ the classic tricks in a spectacular full motion sequence using only the analog keys, now used for the arms, now for the legs. Imagine finding yourself in front of a ramp: your instinct tells you to point it at full speed to ensure that your alter ego takes flight and reaches an unthinkable height; once in mid-air, just press the two analog buttons to have total control of the situation, thanks to the two sticks which, in this case, will each be designated to one leg of the skater. To make combos to the limit of the imaginable, precision and timing are required, as well as a good dose of training. However, a couple of intense sessions could be enough to be able to almost totally master the various evolutions. Precisely the ease of execution of even the most advanced techniques represents perhaps the most demeaning limit of the game, and prematurely narcotizes the degree of satisfaction necessary to keep Proving Ground on your Playstation 3. It's good to play together While never representing its fulcrum, online has always been an important component of the series. Tony Hawk 3 was in fact the first game playable online on Playstation 2, and the brand actually lends itself to intriguing multiplayer modes. With Proving Ground the guys from Neversoft wanted to do more, promoting the creation of real skater communities thanks to very welcome innovations. In this way you will be able to share both the most spectacular videos of your evolutions and the play areas you have created with other users. On the other hand, the proposed methods are disappointing; a game with such an arcade nature could have counted on much more intriguing challenges than the classic ~Reach 100,000 points to win~, or ~Make the longest combo~; lack of time, or inventiveness? In both cases, a ~minus~ on the register O-O-O Hawkeye Technically speaking, the game defends itself very well: the polygonal models of the main characters are very accurate, and enjoy truly superlative animations. The details scattered throughout the city, such as cars or bins, are obviously not as detailed, but their spartan nature is the right price to pay to enjoy a frame-rate nailed to 30 frames per second, and a very vast playing area , now also including a large number of interiors. The audio sector, on the other hand, is as always one of the flagships of the series, and features the usual, highly inspired soundtrack that ranges from punk-rock to metal, passing through rap, and satisfying, in fact, the most diverse tastes . Comment Tony Hawk's Proving Ground is yet another good chapter of a brand which, 8 years after its birth, is starting to get very stale. The innovations introduced, while representing an indisputable step forward, do not distort a gameplay that requires a sharp turn towards greater depth. Which doesn't translate into a mere imitation of Skate; the simulation style proposed by EA is not the only way forward to give the saga more bite, and probably not even the healthiest, given the long line of fans conquered over the years by dint of superman bazli, and impossible tricks. On the contrary, it would perhaps be desirable to further strain one's arcade nature, so as not to put oneself in direct competition with a competition that, after years of pursuits, has overtaken. Pros A large number of ~missions~, to choose according to your tastes Very vast setting It's Tony Hawk... Cons After 8 years you expect something more Multiplayer mode too obvious Wii lose Unfortunately, not all donuts come out with holes. In this case the black sheep is represented by the Wii version, which offers extremely frustrating gameplay. The control system is in fact entrusted exclusively to the Nunchuck-Remote combination, and proves to be too inaccurate, putting the success or failure of any evolution, even the most elementary, up to chance.", "date": "2007-11-16", "grade": null}
