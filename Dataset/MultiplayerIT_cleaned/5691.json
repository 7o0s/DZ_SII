In the Ubisoft Montreal offices, the idea of this alternative vision must have flashed since the design of Far Cry 3, where the sumptuous work carried out on the Rook Island ecosystem managed to give a real turning point for the series. It is no coincidence, in fact, that in Far Cry 4's Kyrat the naturalistic elements have taken on a much greater specific weight, significantly influencing both the character and the playful depth of the fascinating settings. The next step, for a total fusion of the gameplay with nature and its wonderful biodiversity, could not be done with a step forward, but only through a decisive leap back in time, in an era in which there were no technologies and the he human being was anything but at the top of the food chain. Far Cry Primal, paraphrasing the executive producer of the work Dan Hay, ~reduces Far Cry to its essence~, projecting the player in full Mesolithic in the heart of the so-called Stone Age, twelve thousand years after the adventures of Jason Brody and Ajay Ghale . We immersed ourselves in this raw, unforgiving prehistoric world imagined by Ubisoft for dozens of hours, and this is the account of our incredible journey. The prehistory of Far Cry Primal entertains and convinces, although the playful scaffolding is too conservative Evolution of the species The limited weight of the data package (about 13 GB on PlayStation 4) and the absence of a number that embeds the title in the timeline of the saga, must not mislead: Far Cry Primal is in fact not a simple expansion with a primitive theme of Far Cry 4, but a solid spin-off with the same production values of the main series and a substantial amount of content. The story revolves around the protagonist Takkar and his Wenja tribe, a community of hunters/gatherers who after generations of nomadism decide to settle in the fertile Land of Oros. In practice, the Ubisoft title traces the budding of civilization, which was triggered precisely in the Mesolithic by the first settled communities and by the subsequent development of agriculture and breeding. At the time, probably, there were also the first tribal wars for the possession of the best resources, the first real ~frontier~ which in Far Cry Primal is disputed by the aforementioned Wenja, by the rude cannibals Udam, clearly inspired by the Man of Neanderthals (although it became extinct in the Paelolitico), and by the Izila slavers, whose Mesopotamian origins give it superior ~technological~ knowledge. The incipit tells how the Wenja people were almost exterminated by the systematic attacks of rivals, who forced the last survivors to live in small isolated groups and under constant threat. Takkar is part of one of these, and after surviving an ill-fated mammoth hunt, told in the prologue, he finds himself catapulted into the role of the main architect of the Wenja rebirth. After the fortuitous encounter with Sayla, one of the most successful characters in the title, the protagonist is in fact driven to search for the other survivors and to found a new village, which will continue to grow for the duration of the adventure. Among the most interesting aspects of the production is the care placed in the characterization of the three primitive communities, made credible thanks to the involvement of anthropologists, linguists and historians from the University of Kentucky and McGill University in Montreal, recruited for the occasion by the producer Vincent Pontbriand . The work carried out on the dialects of the tribes was particularly effective, extrapolated from the Proto-Indo-European of which a real vocabulary with annexed grammar was recreated. The meticulous study of the development team emerges forcefully in the cutscenes, where the rudimentary language, facilitated by peculiar subtitles, is accompanied by movements decontaminated by modern gestures and influences. The acting of the actors involved is also absolutely credible and passionate, managing to project the player into a genuine and gloomy primordial atmosphere. Honorable mention for the performance of the interpreter of the shaman Tensay, characterized in a simply superb way. The plot, as was to be expected, is reduced to the bone and is closely linked to the survival needs of the various members of the community, not getting lost in philosophical ruminations or sentimentality as in the previous chapters; in short, the bad guys with their needs (and beliefs) are indeed present, but they appear moreThis is rarely seen and you can therefore forget the praises of Vaas's madness or the exasperated egocentrism of Pagan Min. At the time, moreover, the human being was fighting for his own survival and animal instincts dominated his conduct; Takkar, despite everything, during the adventure will still be able to demonstrate his good heart and deserve the role of leader. Master of Beasts Despite the peculiar prehistoric context, Far Cry Primal is a full-fledged Far Cry, and if you enjoyed the previous chapters you will find yourself perfectly at ease in the role of the new protagonist. Even too much. The playful infrastructure, in fact, is shaped in the image and likeness of that of the latest iterations, and you will find many of the dynamics that characterize Ubisoft's triple A practically unchanged. The map of Oros, of considerable size, unfolds slowly by exploring its settings, divided into areas that must be ~reclaimed~ by lighting the so-called pyres, the prehistoric alternative to antennas and monuments of other French productions. In this case they must be reached on more or less impervious heights (but never too demanding) and cleaned of the enemies who occupy them, exactly like the camps and the two fortresses, which in Primal are linked to the liberation of relevant characters. As regards the secondary missions, they range from the escort of small groups to the liberation of prisoners, passing through the killing of ~commanders~ up to the hunting of specific animals; all tasks already known to those who have played the previous Far Cry and beyond. The primary ones do not deviate much from this basic recipe, adding ingredients such as collecting objects, escaping, grueling boss battles (really tough) and some pleasant cameos. There is no shortage of collectibles to recover and dynamic random events, such as couriers to be killed (called bearers) and allies to be untied before they are eliminated by rivals, as well as ~mystical~ missions after drinking the concoctions of the shaman Tensay. The stealth approach is certainly the most recommended for tackling the extremely insidious Land of Oros, but nothing prevents you from breaking in with clubs deployed or on the back of some mighty beast. Takkar is known among the Wenja as the ~Master of beasts~ and his ability to train and govern animals is one of the main characteristics of the gameplay, partly translated from the sections in the Shangri-La of Far Cry 4. Particularly important is the use of the owl, which basically replaces the reconnaissance phases with camera and telescopic sights of the modern chapters. In fact, the nocturnal bird of prey, with its advantageous view from above, can mark enemies for Takkar, and also has some interesting attack functions to be enhanced in the appropriate skill menu. As for terrestrial predators, our hero can tame bears, canids and various types of felines that possess specific qualities in speed, strength and stealth. The best animals are unlocked through missions called ~Master Hunt~, which engage our hero in long tailing sequences until the inevitable final showdown. In this and other types of missions there is a strong resemblance to the investigations of the Witcher in The Witcher 3: to follow the tracks and easily view objects, materials and enemies in the setting, in fact, by pressing R3 Takkar can count on the so-called ~View of the hunter~, a sort of Eagle Eye that illuminates the elements of interest in yellow or red. Although this is a very useful function, it dampens the immersion in the prehistoric setting a little and facilitates the recovery of the resources necessary for crafting all too much. The latter works exactly like in the other Far Cry and is useful for improving one's equipment and above all the huts of the Wenja village, in particular those of the seven specialists, who with a larger and more welcoming house can provide new missions and abilities to our hero . Playstation 4 trophies Far Cry Primal offers a total of 51 trophies, a dozen of which are secret and related to the events of the story. In total, there is one in platinum, dedicated to unlocking all the others, 2 in gold, 10 in silver and the rest in bronze: they range from killing a tot number of enemies in particular ways up to training beasts, passing for village improvements, capture of forts and collection of collectibles. Skin and bones The variety of Takkar's prehistoric arsenal is understandably limited, however there is no shortage of interesting weapons, to be upgraded several times throughout the game thanks to more robust and rare materials, such as megalocero antlers and stones called ~Blood of Oros~. Beyond clave and mdifferent types of axes, including the two-handed one, our hero can wield spears, splintered stones, a slingshot, bows and even rudimentary bombs composed of sacks of angry bees and poison. Too bad that the physicality of the impacts sometimes (not always) leaves something to be desired, making us regret the ~malice~ of the shots appreciated in The Last of Us or in the more recent Dying Light. The fundamental support of animals must be added to the arsenal, which often manages to make the difference in the outcome of the clashes. Thanks to some of them, such as the ~blood-toothed tiger~ smilodon to be unlocked in a special mission, with the help of the owl it is possible to free entire enemy settlements without ever intervening directly in battle. This creates a pinch of imbalance in the gameplay balance, also considering the fact that by being accompanied by one of these ~special~ beasts you are practically no longer annoyed by the other predators, rather oppressive in the early stages of the game when it is necessary to keep them at bay with fire, especially at night. As for the enemies, divided into the usual traditional classes, including the highly resistant brute and the sentry ready to call for reinforcements with a horn, they do not have particularly advanced artificial intelligence, and their modus operandi is entirely in line with that already seen in other Ubisoft productions. Although survival has been talked about for a long time, in Far Cry Primal the survival elements are rather simple and limited: except for the need to wear warm clothes to travel the frozen taiga and to take an antidote for specific poisoned paths, there are no other precautions to take, if not to defend themselves from the teeming threats of Oros. However, Takkar can collect plants of various colors which, combined with the meat, provide effects similar to those of the previous Far Cry syringes, such as an increase in resistance to fire or drowning. We will deepen the discussion on the skills of the protagonist and the specialists related to them in a special special. Lost world Among the strengths of Far Cry Primal there is undoubtedly the sumptuous technical sector, enhanced by the Dunia Engine brought to life for the occasion. The overall result, at 1080p and thirty frames per second on the Sony flagship, does not differ too much from what was already appreciated in Far Cry 4, however Oros is much more fascinating than Kyrat due to its alternation of lush uncontaminated biomes and abundant fauna who inhabits them. From this point of view, however, we would have expected more ~courage~ from Ubisoft, given that many of the animals present - there are about sixty species in all - have been translated from the fourth chapter of the saga, including the very resistant and hated installment . If you expected to be surrounded by mainly ~exotic~ fauna you will be disappointed for a good part of the time, although of course there are iconic animals of the period such as mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, the aforementioned megalocera and saber-toothed tigers. However, the many introduced species offer a good variety and on the whole they are all well animated, modeled and fun to hunt, with the most powerful ones requiring a rather shrewd tactical approach to be brought down. Returning to the technical sector, the lighting effects are excellent, with a delightful day-night cycle and perfect reproduction of fire; fundamental elements also in terms of gameplay. Polygonal mass and textures are generally valid, but there are some rougher elements (such as some rocks) and poorly defined surfaces, especially visible when using the claw-grappling hook for climbing. The work conducted on the audio was excellent, characterized by incisive and three-dimensional sampling to be enjoyed with a good home theater system: in some cases it really seems to be immersed in a primeval boreal forest. We remind you that the game does not offer multiplayer modes but only the adventure, which will take you many hours to complete 100%.", "date": "2016-02-22", "grade": "8.2"}
