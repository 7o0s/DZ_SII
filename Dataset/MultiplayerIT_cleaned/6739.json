{"name": "Squali vs Sub", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/140971-depth-squali-vs-sub.html", "text": "The idea behind Depth isn't bad at all: marine treasure hunters dive into waters inhabited by terrible white sharks and have to fight for their survival, while accumulating gold and resources. In game terms this translates into a team of four heavily armed divers who have to contend with a team of two great white sharks armed only with their teeth. Each of the two teams offers a great level of customization of the equipment, with the divers who can buy more and more powerful weapons as the game progresses and the sharks who get points to spend on special abilities. The gameplay is inspired by that of Left 4 Dead, with the sharks who have to try to isolate the divers and the divers who have to work as a team without forgetting to collect treasures and defend their drone S.T.E.V.E., an indispensable tool for digging in the depths of the sea. The drone cannot be completely destroyed by sharks, but it can be temporarily disabled, slowing down its work. The dynamics of a cat against mice ensue, initially not bad at all, with each team having to be careful not to run out of lives at its disposal, in order not to give victory to the opponents. Obviously there are no safe areas for divers, who are always at the mercy of the gigantic lords of the sea, identifiable only when very close to the group or when they are devouring a partner (who can always defend himself with a knife, even if the effectiveness of the counter-move is limited). The levels themselves are built as lethal mazes, in which sharks can attack from any direction, perhaps breaking through some more fragile surfaces to create other passages. Their only weapon is their powerful teeth, which they use to lacerate the divers (once a human has been grabbed, you have to shake the mouse to simulate the quartering). The divers instead, in addition to rifles, harpoons and machine guns, also have mines, flares and other useful objects for defense. Depth takes us to the bottom of the sea for a not too epic duel between divers and sharks Same beach, same sea The biggest problem of Depth, apart from the difficulty of accessing the game servers for us Europeans, which we will discuss in the next paragraph, is the lack of variety that emerges overwhelmingly after a few hours. Of course, the first games run smooth as oil thanks to the novelty of the scenario and some well-made mechanics, especially those related to sharks. Even playing the role of divers and going in search of treasures with the risk of being attacked at any moment creates excellent tension and offers good moments that are pleasant to relive from game to game. Just as the level growth system, which serves to gradually unlock new equipment, is a good reason to continue diving. Too bad, however, that the only game mode offered does not hold up in the long run, above all due to the few maps offered. In short, it almost seems that the development team has concentrated all the resources to create sharks and divers, without caring too much about the rest. This impression is consolidated by the high number of bugs and glitches present, with continuous interpenetrations, clipping and so on and so forth. Nothing to make Depth unplayable, to be honest, but seeing a diver's legs poking out from behind a wall isn't a pretty sight. Just as the game graphics in general are not a good show. Not that technical marvels were expected from such a small production, and to be honest the sharks and divers, each with their own wetsuit, are well made, but in general everything smells old and withered, confirming that much more has been spent on the mechanics of growth and customization of the characters, which to try to give a little more variety to the title. Line problems One of Depth's most unnerving problems, at least for us Europeans, is the difficulty of connecting to game servers and finding a decent game. The situation has improved compared to the early days, but waiting times are often very long, with moments in which if you don't have time and patience it's easy to completely stop trying to play and dedicate yourself to something else. Sure, there's always the option to play against bots, but the single player mode is obviously meant as a form of training and once you understand the basics of the game it no longer offers any appeal. Unfortunately this is not a trivial problem, given that not everyone can afford the luxury of spending whole minutes waiting for matchmaking to find some accessible games. We hope that the situation will stabilize in the future, but we have been asking for clear improvements on this side since the beta, as you can verify by looking at the Sala Games that accompanies the article, so we don't have high hopes, also because after the initial excitement many players are migrating to other titles.", "date": "2014-11-20", "grade": "5.8"}
