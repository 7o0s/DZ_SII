Having to describe it briefly, we would speak of a somewhat rough and badly translated Muramasa, but full of interesting characteristics that in the long run make it better than it might seem at first impressions. In short, one of those titles that cannot be defined as perfect but which can be appreciated by playing with it. If we want, the confirmation of our statement comes from the reaction of many players, who are appreciating and praising it everywhere, despite having been a little mistreated by certain perfect-looking and somewhat hasty critics. Bosses aren't just ugly, they're also bad In fact, the developers, the Chinese and unknown S-Game, do their best to make it go wrong immediately. Let's see how. The plot is narrated in the third person by a grandfather to his granddaughter, through cutscenes, as if it were an ancient fairy tale. It tells of a legendary skyship and an emissary of the secret Cabal group who disappeared during a mission involving it. The aim of the player, who will take on the role of two assassins belonging to Cabal, Soul and Shang, will be to find the flying ship and find out what happened to Jade, the missing agent. The plot is very simple and quite pleasant in its general lines. Unfortunately the English subtitles, which accompany the speech only in Chinese, are translated, how to say, poorly ... no, the truth is that they are really worthless, to the point that even we who are not native speakers have noticed their poor quality English. Although they are clear enough, in some cases they border on the ridiculous, especially in the more tense moments when much of the atmosphere is nullified by disconnected and meaningless sentences. In the same way, the paucity of narrative can annoy, i.e. the series of holes that open up here and there in the plot due to an indiscriminate management of characters and situations, holes that lead to an unfinished ending that will probably serve to introduce a sequel but which can leave with a bad taste in the mouth. Will we be able to defeat the demon army and the bad translation in RainBlood Chronicles? Furious action Fortunately, the gameplay takes care of rehabilitating the work of S-Game. RainBlood Chronicles: Mirage is a two-dimensional action game in which you control two characters with different characteristics and abilities, the aforementioned Soul and Shang. Soul is a wild and determined type, specialized in fast and brutal combat, Shang is more thoughtful and refined and uses more reasoned but equally lethal fighting techniques. Both come with combos and special moves, some of which need to be unlocked in the in-game shop (don't worry, no micro-transactions), which make the fights really interesting. The truth is that while we can say that on an offensive level the differences between the two are less relevant for the game economy, it is when talking about the passive skills that the peculiarities of both emerge. Moment of maximum exaltation Assuming that there is no parry, we discover that Soul defends himself by dodging blows, while Shang can use swords made of pure energy placed in a defensive position. The two techniques substantially modify the fights: with Soul there is a tendency to be more dynamic, dodging the blows of the enemies and stacking combos between weak attacks and powerful attacks as needed, while Shang allows more lateral, i.e. more strategic, actions, because one must learn to handle swords to be able to truly exploit it. Both, however, offer great room for improvement to the player, who learns to make the most of them as the levels progress. In reality, to fully master their techniques you have to finish the game several times, facing it at different levels of difficulty, which is also the only way to acquire all the numerous skills, some of which are capable of further modifying the way you play. approach the fights. The enemies, for their part, do everything to make life difficult for the murderous couple. At first they seem like little things, that is, fragile demons to be sliced like butter, but soon you will find yourself facing bigger and more resistant opponents, often very fast and capable of dodging and parrying our blows, or equipped with ranged attacks. There is no shortage of bosses of different sizes, all quite strong and with individual strategies that require different responses from normal enemies. The bosses offer a good challenge even on the lower difficulty levels and are one of the best-crafted features of the entire title. Character growth and extras Chaotic image, but trust me: everything is under control What would all this be without an elaborate system of ccharacter resurgence? Also from this point of view RainBlood Chronicles: Mirage is well supplied. Between one level and another Soul and Shang will find themselves visiting a refreshment area (let's call it that) where they will be able to perform various actions, as well as summarize their objectives. Meanwhile they will be able to see the objects collected in the levels (resurrection stones, bells, statuettes and so on), then they will be able to spend the points collected by killing monsters in special skills and objects. As we said, the skills are personal, while the objects will be selectable by both evil boys without distinction. Overcoming the missions will also unlock Zhang's shop, which will allow you to exchange goods for other goods so that you can acquire the resources you need faster. Playing you will immediately notice that the prices of the shops are really high and that you have to face the levels several times to be able to buy something (especially the upgrades have incredibly high prices). Don't worry though, because the fast gameplay and the unlocking of some additional modes will make it a pleasure to replay the levels, especially if you like the combat system. And if you have a friend to try the game in local co-op mode (or in challenge mode, for good reason), returning to the game several times will be a pleasant practice. Big and hard... too many double meanings in a single caption So, it's easy to say that RainBlood Chronicles: Mirage lasts a long time, especially for the price it costs: let's say we are about five hours to complete the first round on a normal level, and at least another twelve for the next two difficulty levels. If we want to add to the bill also the time necessary to unlock all the bonuses and to perfect each level, obtaining positive evaluations, you will understand that the S-Game title fully repays the ten euros it costs. From a stylistic point of view RainBlood Chronicles: Mirage is a good title for its price range. Of course, it has some elements that are a little rough, especially in the scenarios, and we are definitely under a masterpiece like Muramasa, but the different production level must certainly be considered and, if you like, the fact that the beautiful Vanillaware title has never been released on PC . Let's say, in conclusion, that we are not dealing with a second-class alternative, but with a fairly fresh product that could make many happy.", "date": "2013-11-28", "grade": "7.0"}
