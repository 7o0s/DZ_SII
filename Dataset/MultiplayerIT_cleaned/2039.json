The latter, in fact, although it uses a graphics engine lower in quality than that of UT, has reached such a level of perfection in gameplay that it literally leaves its opponent at stake on several fronts. First of all, the characters of Tac Ops, although sufficiently skinned, appear far too rigid and artificial, above all given their posture similar to that of the Upim mannequins! This obviously goes to the detriment of the overall appearance of the graphics, which still contain some nice maps, with alternative routes and some small graphic gems, evolved from the previous mod beta version. Furthermore, some weapons appear in too ~cartoonish~ colors, making them look too much like ridiculous ~toy~ plastic versions. On the other hand a cure for the animations of some cartridge loading have been well implemented, but they are still a ~poor~ version of what is visible in CS. CS VS TacOps:Aot To make matters worse, the intelligence of the bots is mediocre to say the least, making them look more often than not like blind walkers and sometimes all too stupid, incapable as they are of taking initiatives. Considering that they follow ~pre-established~ paths, some paths have not been optimized properly, consequently it is not uncommon to observe our ~artificial~ team or the opposing one stubborn in one point of the map, making silly and useless ~roundabouts~ (they seem like many patients with autism a la ~rain man~, who always bang towards the same point). Another punch in the stomach the sound. Some ~shot~ effects, in fact, differ completely from the ~real~ ones and always calling into question the aforementioned CS, we can say that a comparison is not even conceivable, indeed it is quite another story. Some effects, however, have been well digitized but are inexorably drowned by the exclamations in doublets of some ~colleagues~ bots, who ask for help or support in who knows which precise area of the map. Yes, even this point is to the detriment of the entire game, but the whole thing still has the appearance of something left half done. The musical accompaniments, on the other hand, are alternate. Some really accompany the action, while others loosen it up, with a pace that is far too bland and not very suited to the type of game. Arms for sale ... to the best taxpayer! The screen for buying and selling weapons, on the other hand, once you have passed the apprenticeship phase, is fast and direct, and in this respect it is better than that of CS (miracle! But it's not that much was needed ...), showing in real time the money left, the price of the selected weapons or those highlighted, automatically calculating whether we are rich enough to be able to buy them or not. Furthermore, an intelligent budget system ~unlocks~ the weapons that we can buy starting from a certain amount, hiding those that are initially too expensive. Furthermore, those collected from the ground and belonging to the opposing team are ~added~ to the arsenal of their own. In fact terrorists and anti-terrorists have a completely different weaponry, but in the end we always tend to choose the same weapons, giving an eye to the M16/203 or the more expensive sniper rifles. The supplied accessories are the Kevlar protection, divided into three fundamental parts: head, body and legs. In addition, it is possible to buy a night vision goggle, but the maps where it is possible to use it can be counted on the fingers of a crippled hand! Furthermore, its effect is not well simulated, given that a real night vision device flattens the colors and is limited in its range (similar to that of Sof2, to be clear), but that of Tac Ops is completely false, since it manages to magically display objects as distant as two hundred meters ... when you say science fiction! In conclusion If you have UT and a fast ADSL connection, download the mod (of two hundred and more mega) and try it. If you like Counter-Strike though, steer clear of it completely! This title (to which I would also add Team Factor, Global Operations and many others), is mediocre from almost all points of view, and this further elevates the qualities of ~grandfather~ Counter-Strike. If you really want a nice mod, still free, similar to Cs for UT then bet on Strike Force and you won't regret it. In fact, although the latter still suffers from poor optimization (in some situations it slows down on any computer, even ultra-powerful ones!) it is still superior to Tac Ops by several points. Indeed, if I were Infogrames I would have chosen Strike-Force for the retail version, but it's not the users who decide,just as it will certainly not be Tac Ops that will make Infogrames richer. From free mod to ~retail~ version. Is it always worth it? Tactical Operations was born as a simple mod for Unreal Tournament several months ago, to give the DE game a clone worthy of Counter-Strike, which has had so much success in recent years. After a long beta test phase, in which there were consequent and appropriate improvements, the Tac Ops programmers managed to fulfill their dream of making their creation ~retail~, from which they could finally obtain a fair profit, which they still deserved for the great work done. Unfortunately this Tactical Operations: Assault on Terror Retail version differs little from the ~mod~ version for UT, indeed the differences or improvements, if you prefer, are so minimal overall, as to leave us genuinely disappointed on several fronts.", "date": "2002-07-30", "grade": null}
