{"name": "NBA Live 08 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-live-08-recensione.html", "text": "In the autumn, as usual, it is reasonable to expect the new episodes of the Electronic Arts sports series, this October 2007 is no less bringing us to the parquet floors of the most famous sports halls in America (and not only!) with NBA Live 08. EA strong in licenses official and the always excellent graphic cosmetics try to peck into the hearts of the many fans with this new chapter of NBA Live, follow us in our article to find out if real basketball is played here this year. After the disappointing episode released exactly a year ago, the developers of the American software house are called for redemption, having no excuses of any kind, having had the necessary time to concentrate on the game modes and by now knowing the new generation consoles in depth. In fact, if last year the greatest efforts were focused on doing justice to the next generation consoles, bringing only the functions of the old chapters in a graphic design worthy of the new hardware, this justification does not apply to this year's version. From a technical point of view, by now the knowledge of the new hardware is taken for granted and therefore in addition to the graphic cosmetics, which was already very respectable in NBA Live 07, the major innovations must be expected from the point of view of playability, the true heart of the game. The main novelty is undoubtedly the presence of the FIBA world championship with the possibility of choosing the strongest national teams in the world in one of the emerging competitions of recent years. It will therefore be possible to play with Ginobili's Argentina, with Gasol's Spain or with our Italy led by the legendary Recalcati. NBA Live 07 was focused on the Dynasty Mode and the great champions were distinguished by Super Star skills, while the first was confirmed and reached very high levels of satisfaction (always being a team manager), the second is been deleted. Now the NBA champions are characterized by some special moves that are their trademark, the classic gap between a good player and a champion, what makes them irresistible. The go-to move is one of these examples, many players skilled in shots from the perimeter thanks to this combination can dodge the opponent to bag, perhaps with a fade-away, an exceptional basket from distance. the major innovations must be expected from the point of view of playability The gameplay has been focused above all on ball management, with the possibility of executing frenetic dribbling and frenetic hand changes via the oscillation of the right analog stick, in order to obtain an exceptional sensation not only of fluidity but also, and above all, ball control. Let's say that if the intent was good, the realization is a little less so, given that these animations do not always lead to the desired effect and the management of the game appears a bit confused. From this point of view the 2k series is still a cut above. The ~post-low~ has been particularly improved and now receiving the ball with Shaq back to the basket, feigning the shot on one side and turning and dunking on the other gives a lot of satisfaction. The realization of these physical clashes under the basket can only be praised, as well as the perfect correspondence of the power of the various champions, from the old Shaq to the gigantic Yao Ming. A further introduction, which we greatly appreciated and which we would like to underline, is that relating to the use of the left back bumper of the Xbox 360 controller. By pressing this button we will see colored areas appear on the parquet, red, orange and blue, which identify the ~hot spots~, the areas characterized by the different shooting percentages of our player. Making a basket from our basketball player's preferred position will certainly be easier than doing it from far away. The areas correspond to the real favorite ~points~ of the champions and the percentages rise dramatically in the areas with higher percentages. This function would have been perfect if accompanied by a correct implementation of the shot management, unfortunately here relegated to a mere pressing of the button, without any relevance of the timing or contact of an opponent. The rebounds and the defensive phase, on the other hand, have not undergone significant improvements, the first ones above all appear to be almost always random and too often the timing of our men is completely wrong. The defensive phase has been developed a bit by inserting a special man marking complete with a lock-on that can be activated via the dorsal trigger, certainly not a novelty, it still works quite well. Instead, we would have preferred to have more control in the defensive phase since now it is not possible to choose independentlynte of passing from one player to another to follow the ball, it's all managed, with the pros and cons of the case, by the i.a. of the game. Dynasty Mode is certainly the heart of the game Dynasty Mode is certainly the heart of the game and has made its reappearance after appearing in the 2007 version. In reality, not much has changed, we will have full and complete management of everything that revolves around an NBA franchise, from choice of young promises to field a team capable of reaching the playoffs. Draft management turns out to be excellent and therefore the possibility of buying and selling the emerging stars of American basketball. For enthusiasts there are many hours of fun, however the possibility of selecting the speed of progress of time also helps us, in order to minimize dead moments. As already mentioned before, the FIBA championship was introduced for the first time and therefore the race for the world championship, a tournament with eight teams in which we will have to face the strongest nations on the planet, the good news is that we are here too (not us from Multiplayer.it, Italy). The last two modes are Quick Pick Play and Scenario Play, in the first we will be able to choose 10 players taken from any team for a single quick game, while in the second we will be able to set different conditions of the match, from the time to the number of quarters. Let's not forget the dunk contest and the three-pointers, two excellent diversions. XBox 360 - Goals The 1000 points available have been divided by the developers into 26 objectives. To get them you will have to sweat, NBA Live is a game that requires application but you will be rewarded, for example if you finish one of your players in double, triple or quadruple double figures, making more than 31 assists in the game, blocking the opponent 18 times , correctly answering the pre-race quizzes bread for your teeth. Technically From a technical point of view, we certainly cannot complain about the EA product, the animations flow smoothly and closely follow the movements of real athletes. The samples have been modeled with exceptional attention to detail and have lost the excessively ~plastic~ aspect of the previous episode, as well as having undergone a marked increase in polygons. The parquet that reflects the action is a real beauty and leaves you amazed by the care with which it was made. The two versions, the one for Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, are practically identical, the one for the Microsoft console appears slightly more refined with a total absence of aliasing and any clipping problem, defects that instead afflict NBA Live 08 on Japanese hardware . The public and in general the settings in which the races take place are very well done, with a cheering polygonal crowd that characterizes each race as if it were a sports festival. The real technical problem of the EA product is the artificial intelligence, too superficial and irritating on more than one occasion. It is certainly better to challenge virtual friends online perhaps by organizing a real league on Xbox Live. Comment The new episode of the NBA Live saga has left us perplexed, given that, if on the one hand the improvements compared to the previous chapter are evident, on the other hand the efforts of the developers on the actual gameplay and on the basketball ~simulation~ are certainly insufficient. Too often matches end up in spectacular dunk contests and we all know that basketball is something else entirely. Certainly the many modes and the introduction of the FIBA world championship can offer a certain appeal, but this NBA Live 08 is not the episode of the turning point, the one able to offer the complexity and depth of other titles of the genre. A small step forward. Pros Technically sound Improved gameplay Cons but not enough A.I. insufficient It does not mark the ~turning point~", "date": "2007-10-26", "grade": null}
