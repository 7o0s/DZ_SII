{"name": "Soldier Of Fortune Gold Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soldier-of-fortune-gold-edition.html", "text": "In fact, the plot follows the idea of being part of the international peace forces in the role of the mercenary (but an organization called The Shop also has something to do with it), having to thwart the plans of the usual megalomaniac villain on duty, determined to conquer the world with the threat of nuclear warheads. In fact, starting from a simple attack by a neighborhood gang on a subway, our supersoldier will find himself entangled, accompanied by his faithful companion Hawk, in a series of sabotages and sophisticated plans, starting with the discovery of a first missile stolen from a military base and transported on a train in Uganda to a Siberian bunker, sightseeing through a gang war in New York, a heavily guarded city in Iraq and a technology office owned by the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia made up of ninjas and heavily armed assassins. You then cross 5 continents divided into 26 game levels, including, as previously specified, Kosovo, Baghdad, Siberia, Tokyo and New York. This new version called ~Gold~ also adds the ability to play new multiplayer maps by dividing the screen up into four parts. Returning to the realization, I cannot fail to mention the first impact: terrible! Graphically speaking, the textures are barely acceptable and the color palette is truly inadequate, with dark and blurry tones. For those who have already tried the game on PC it will be a real drama to get used to such sloppiness. It will be difficult to learn how to command the character with the pad and extricate yourself from the commands almost like a contortionist, but even going forward it will be almost prohibitive to try to accurately aim and try to disarm your opponents, just as it will be difficult to correctly perform some simple moves such as go down the stairs located throughout the levels. The main feature of the title should be the presence of the GHOUL Rendering System, a new animation system adopted by Raven which makes the animations of the characters extremely realistic through the use of 26 ~Gore Zones~ positioned in the various points of the body of all the characters present in the game. This system therefore introduces new game opportunities and tactics. In fact, you can shoot at any part of your opponents' body and see the effects that the shot produces. A close shot to an arm for example will cause its amputation, the same goes for the legs and head while a longer distance shot will only cause the injury of your victim and you will see him wriggling on the ground in pain. But the thing that impresses me the most is when you try to shoot the weapon held by any of the enemy soldiers: it falls to the ground and the victim, as soon as he finds himself unarmed, begins to beg to be spared. All this as long as you can aim where you want. Let's now review the SoF paraphernalia; the basic weapon is a dagger, indeed to be exact there are 6 daggers that you can also throw, a well-aimed blow can get you out of the way if you are out of ammunition. Then there are 2 pistols, one 9 mm and another of a larger caliber, the first very effective for more distant targets, the second lethal in close combat. The shotgun, the classic shotgun, has proved to be one of the weapons that give the most satisfaction in close combat, it has a deadly effect on your opponents by literally tearing them to pieces at close range, it proves to be ineffective at long range. Another weapon that proves to be irreplaceable in the game is the sniper rifle, it has a very powerful zoom that allows you to hit targets at very long distances with millimeter precision. Then there are 3 types of machine guns, one of medium power, another with a silencer (very useful for not being discovered) and the third extremely powerful capable of mowing down a group of soldiers in a few seconds. Rounding out the conventional weapons featured in the game are the classic rocket launcher and flamethrower. Then there are 2 unconventional weapons, one is a kind of rifle capable of firing projectiles at very high speed, and the other is a microwave rifle capable of literally cooking your opponent and, in secondary fire mode, you will literally see it explode. In terms of sound, however, there is nothing to complain about, with well-made screams and music that is very suitable for such a game. We took advantage of the PAL system to improve the appearance of the textures. Thanks to the presence of more lines in the imageon PAL televisions we were able to render the textures with greater detail, even up close says Richard Darling, Codemasters creative director, We have also improved the graphics rendering system to raise the general aesthetic level of the games; the edges are defined more clearly, the colors more lively and luminous.~ This is what was stated by one of the ~heads~ responsible for the creation of SoF-Gold for Ps2. You have already read my evaluation.....trying is believing! Pros: GHOUL Rendering System Excellent sound rendering Violence to the max Cons: Rough graphics Poor control system Old title Followed, indeed, an almost faithful copy of the title of the same name for PC, SoF Gold edition comes to life just when the real sequel, or SoF 2, appears on the shelves of the shops. As is well known, console users benefit from the transpositions from personal computers far beyond what is due, coming to play with obsolete and outdated products; in fact, this is what this version of SoF is: an outdated and above all poorly converted work. I understand that our beloved black box is unable to better manage certain types of games, it's not asked to run Metroid Prime, God forbid, but after seeing the excellent Medal of Honor, which by the way is a game almost different than the one for PC, one can not help but wonder why such poor achievements. But let's move on to the story told in the game. The title, Soldier of Fortune, is taken directly from a famous American magazine (also available in Italy, in some specialized newsstands) which deals with soldiers of fortune, mercenaries and the various guerrilla events that take place in various parts of the world, so this is already a good clue to understand what the game is about. An important role in the development of the game was played by John Mullins, currently a military ~consultant~ and with a past of military missions like ~Rambo~, so much so that he was chosen as the protagonist of the game.", "date": "2002-10-29", "grade": null}
