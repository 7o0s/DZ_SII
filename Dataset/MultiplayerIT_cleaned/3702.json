{"name": "Konami Arcade Classics Anniversary", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/konami-arcade-classics-anniversary-collection-recensione.html", "text": "The recovery and adaptation of old classics is a peculiarity of the video game market, deriving from their being systemic products and therefore subject to irrevocable obsolescence. For this reason, initiatives such as Konami's Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection, the protagonist of this review, cannot immediately be labeled as easy commercial operations that focus on nostalgic re-enactment, but also have a real historical value. Unless an unlikely agreement is found with publishers and console manufacturers for a standard regulation of the emulation, in fact, one must rely on collections of this type to be able to play historical titles on modern platforms. Given the fiftieth anniversary, Konami has decided to celebrate by focusing on its boundless historical archive and this Arcade Classics is only the first of the various collections planned for this period, with Castlevania Anniversary Collection and Contra Anniversary Collection arriving shortly. Sadly, this is a largely missed opportunity, as we shall see. The titles present are hardly questionable, being the pillars of the history of the video game. The critical elements start from the selection of titles included in the collection, rather small in quantitative terms and above all too focused on the same genre (the shooter) and arrive at the adaptation and the accompanying contents. It is clear that games have an indisputable value, not only for their being invaluable milestones in the history of this medium, but also because some of these - contrary to what happens in many similar cases - are still fully enjoyable today, from a distance three or four decades. Evaluating titles of this caliber would make little sense nowadays, so the judgment is based above all on the quality of the re-proposition and the frame in which they are framed, aspects that certainly lend themselves to some criticism. The Golden Years Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection contains 8 games, very few compared to what has been seen in other similar operations and moreover almost all of the same genre, or rather the shooter: Scramble (1981), TwinBee (1985), Nemesis (or Gradius, 1985) Life Force ( aka Salamander, 1986), Vulcan Venture (Gradius 2, 1986), Typhoon (1987), Thunder Cross (1988) and Hunted Castle (1988). It's true that the shooter has iconic value for 1980s gaming, and it's definitely the genre Konami was most committed to in the arcade at the time, but a selection of titles that should be symbolic of an entire historical era is not can be based on a single genre for seven out of eight titles present, also considering the large catalog of the publisher. It should be noted, however, that the only non-shooter game is Hunted Castle, i.e. a Castlevania spin-off, a typology quite well covered by the other upcoming collection dedicated to the series, therefore even the only slot belonging to a different genre seems rather ~wasted~. It is strange that games such as Frogger, Pooyan, Yie Ar Kung-Fu, Green Beret, Track & Field or others have not been taken into consideration and this imbalance in the chosen titles maliciously suggests a convenience solution by Konami, considering that most of the games in this collection have already been released previously in the excellent remakes of the Arcade Archives series by Hamster Corporation. In any case, these are great games, about which there is obviously very little to say: perhaps only Scramble has characteristics that can be too archaic, as often happens to the games in these collections, but all the others are titles that are enjoyable even nowadays, with the two Gradiuses in particular still able to exert considerable appeal even beyond nostalgic appeal, being two of the best scrolling shooters ever. Considering their age, Typhoon, Thunder Cross and Hunted Castle also amaze for the technological level they continue to demonstrate, proof of the skill with which Konami used to operate at the time, while TwinBee gives a slightly original touch to everything, with the his comic style. As far as the quality of the emulation is concerned, there are no problems, with the games flowing at constant fluidity and without particular uncertainties, therefore on the purely playful front, the original experience of the eight titles in question is properly preserved. The contour The problems of Arcade Classics emerge on the organizational and conceptual front of the collection, with reflections in the technical field. One can pass over a decidedly meager presentation as regards the access menu to the various games, but it is difficult not to give weight to shortcomings which, although marginal, can makethe difference in operations of this type. In recent times we have seen several very positive examples of classic collections, first of all the SNK 40th Anniversary Collection which we can take as an example of how operations of this type should be packaged. Beyond the quantitative variations (8 titles compared to the 24 of the SNK 40th) which can also be justified by the relatively low price at which the Konami title is offered (19.99 euros), or the absence of a physical version, there are no some subtleties that make the difference for such a box set. The games are offered only in the western arcade version, thus without giving the opportunity to see the (often important) differences that characterized the various regional editions or console conversions, as carried out instead in the similar collection of SNK. The addition of online multiplayer could have actually been too much of a departure from the spirit of the original titles, but at least the presence of online leaderboards would have been desirable, but even these were not included in the package. The display options allow you to apply only two simple levels of scanline, while the alternative modes in 4:3 and 16:9 are almost unusable, which limit themselves to stretching the image up to fill the screen with almost comical results as regards especially games with portrait view. Furthermore, since the latter are about half of the titles present, the possibility of setting the full-screen view with the display held vertically on Nintendo Switch would have been appreciated, but the option has not been included. The element of greatest interest in this collection, in the end, could be the illustrated ebook that tells part of Konami's history, focusing in particular on the eight games in the selection. It is nothing more than a PDF that can be consulted by scrolling through the pages and zooming in, but it is constructed with a care that contrasts with the general haste with which the rest of the collection was composed. In addition to the interesting textual information, which tells the story of the company and of the various games released in the period under consideration, among the pages it is possible to see sketches, design documents, preparatory drawings, artwork, concepts and many other really interesting materials.", "date": "2019-04-23", "grade": "6.0"}
