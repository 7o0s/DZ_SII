It is a name that may be unknown to the youngest, but this new adventure from Konami is based on an old IP from 1986, published on the Famicom. Originally a side-scrolling action-adventure (think early Castlevania), Konami has reimagined this game in a more modern format, banking on the roguelite genre. Was the transition successful? Find out in our GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon review. Roguelite A beautiful panorama of GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon The plot is simple. After a thousand years, Ryukotsuki has awakened and unleashed all hell upon the world. Now, a new hero must rise and descend to the underworld to defeat hordes of monsters. As is typical for the genre, the focus of GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon is not to tell us a story, but to give us a reason to go down into dungeons and tear apart as many enemies as possible. What matters in this case is the structure of the roguelite. To immediately understand what kind of game we are dealing with, just think of Dead Cells. The comparison is easy. You start in front of a wall that displays all of the upgrades you've unlocked. At the end of each level we can access different dungeons, but only after having found the right ~key~ to open the portals to the new regions. The path to get to the end is therefore partially customizable. The comparison continues with the combat system, based on two main weapons and some reloading secondary items. We will be able to use katanas, clubs, whips and so on: each main weapon has its own set of moves and its own speed of action, as well as a secondary ability (such as the parry / parry of the katana, or the charged impact attack of the club). Secondary weapons will include bows, arquebuses, bombs, kunai and so on. For each category, it is then possible to unlock new versions that perhaps focus more on damage, or more on altered effects. Exploration and combat GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon's mansion, safe place However, let's talk in more detail about the maps, which offer multiple types of settings: we start from a set of simple caves, we pass through islands floating above a stormy sea and we also arrive at a labyrinthine demonic city which is actually two maps in one, as you have to go from streets into buildings - via a series of doors - to find your way to the boss. Each environment has its own peculiarity, both as an exploratory structure of the maps and as additional interaction possibilities (for example, in one map you have to destroy objects to improve visibility, another has levers to pull to open passages). On a visual level this translates into very beautiful play areas, with a ukiyo-e style of high stylistic quality. Unfortunately the ukiyo-e - in movement - causes a certain chaos and in some situations it becomes difficult to understand exactly what is happening around the character, especially if you decide to play on the small screen of Switch. This roguelite works much better when docked - a shame, as an area can be completed in 10-20 minutes (and it is possible to suspend the session and switch off the console without losing progress), making it perfect for quick matches on the go . The first boss of GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon The real problem with GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon's maps is that, regardless of their visual or exploratory peculiarity, they don't change the approach to fighting. Stripped of the trappings, the maps are just a set of horizontal platforms above which there are one or more enemies, who charge us or attack us from a distance. There are no small platforms to exploit to get us out of trouble and reposition ourselves, there are no closed doors to break through to get an initial advantage, there is also a lack of tools useful for obtaining situational advantages, such as freezing or traps to block enemies. We specify, there is no lack of a freezing effect and other alterations, but it is only a secondary consequence of some weapons, whose main function is always and only to do damage. GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon doesn't ask us to reason on the basis of our possibilities (tools, enemy position, map conformation...), but only to be aware of our parametric power. Can we take out that common enemy before they even manage to make a single attack? If not, we just need to roll through him and position ourselves behind him to finish off a second combo and, in 99% of cases, win. If we really want to avoid risks, we can usesecondary weapons from a distance to strike from safety. Furthermore, our protagonist is not very agile, so it will never be worth playing up to trying to do dodges like hell or strategic jumps. Bosses improve the situation slightly. They have various moves and are capable of doing a lot of damage, so it tends to be best to avoid their attacks, taking advantage of the unique layout of the arenas. Sometimes though, with enough healing and a slightly stronger weapon than usual, we can win by sheer brute force even against them. Upgrades The protagonist of GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon and the temple girl who acts as a guide To win by brute force one must become strong and to do that one must first of all farm. GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon offers a sufficiently stratified system in this sense. There are a series of power-ups that are unlocked permanently, for all runs, and a series of power-ups that only last for the current game. Let's start with the fixed ones. There are boosts to the character's stats (more life, more attack...), additional skills (the weapons found in the levels are of a higher grade, or, you start immediately with a certain amount of money to spend in the level shops. ..). These skills are tied to our character and when we unlock the second controllable PG (faster but weaker), we will have to re-unlock them for her as well. They are enhanced by finding specific items, to be accumulated in large quantities. But there are also weapons. In the dungeons we can find blueprints for new weapons and, by accumulating ~fragments~ of weapons, we can unlock the new variant. Furthermore, each weapon has a series of skills that must be ~opened~ with materials that are obtained by defeating enemies and opening chests. Once ~opened~, skills remain available for subsequent runs, but are not automatically active. In each game, for each single weapon that we are going to collect and use, we will have to activate the ~open~ skills, spending ~soul memories~. These are obtained by exploring, killing enemies, opening chests and destroying weapons that we don't want to use. Through the shop, which is always found in each level, we can spend soul memories to activate the open skills in the current run and only on that specific weapon. Additionally, memories can be used to rank up weapons, thus enhancing the damage they deal. It is a complex system to explain and understand in written format, but controller in hand becomes easy to exploit. An advanced area of GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon To all this are added the ~souls~ (they are different from the ~memories of souls~), which are obtained in dungeons and, for the current game, allow you to boost one of the character's statistics (~main weapons~, ~ secondary weapons~, ~life~) or get an additional heal. All this elaborate speech we need to say one thing. Half of GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon's experience is based on material research. You need to play again and again, first of all with the aim of obtaining dozens of different materials, to unlock new skills, weapons, stat boosts and more. This is not a trivial matter, because in the event of death you lose everything and, therefore, you are encouraged to end your game after defeating a boss to return to the Getsu villa, which acts as a safe area starting. Returning home, you lose all advances and intra-dungeon upgrades, but you secure all materials. There are skills that allow you to save a certain percentage of materials (starting from 30%) in case of death, but it's never the best choice to put yourself at risk. In the later stages you'll be strong and good enough to tackle several areas in a row before retreating, so a game session will feel complete and enjoyable. In the early hours, however, most players will have to complete the first area and then return to the villa, in a continuous loop. Fortunately, the first level lasts no more than ten minutes (but even 6 minutes if you become fast) and therefore it is possible to farm the materials necessary to have that little more life and health needed to survive the advanced areas, but in any case you have to expect to start immediately with various farming sections before being able to really play GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon. GetsuFumaDen: the original In the special edition of GetsuFumaDen Undying Moon there is also a port of the original GetsuFumaDen. As mentioned, it is an old horizontal scrolling action game, which will only appeal to the most hardcore nostalgics of those years. Gamers accustomed to modern video games are not athey will have no interest in playing it. The real problem is that the game is only in Japanese: Konami has added menus in English, but the actual game has no translation, so you don't even understand what you're doing. It is probably possible to complete the game even without understanding the texts, but it is clear that it loses some of its charm. Considering that this extra costs 10, we recommend opting for the standard version.", "date": "2022-02-15", "grade": "7.0"}
