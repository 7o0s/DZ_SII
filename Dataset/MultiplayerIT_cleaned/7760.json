The arrival at the Champs-lyses, scheduled for next July 21st, will in fact represent the 100th time that a cyclist on two wheels will cross the prestigious finish line in the incredible Parisian setting, after covering the 3,360 kilometers that make up the 21 stages of the tournament. The Cyanide team, French like the Tour, creator of the Pro Cycling Manager series, has been linked to this historic competition for some years now. Born in 2001 and enriched with the Pro prefix, as we know it today, only in 2006, the series arrived on the market on time as always this year too, anticipating the first stage of the tour by a few days. As per tradition, this new incarnation of the game has also promised the usual series of improvements, for what despite the team's work on Game of Thrones it remains perhaps Cyanide's main workhorse. For every franchise on an annual basis, however, the danger looms, and even Pro Cycling Manager has to deal with the risk of representing little more than a data disk. After doing a few laps under the hot sun on Cyanide's toil, let's see together what the guys based in Paris have been up to. Fast forward Career The game modes of Pro Cycling Manager 2013 remain permanently those that we got to know a year ago, thus giving the possibility to already experienced players to immediately appreciate the work done by Cyanide, aimed in detail at improving some of the critical points previously detected. But let's start from the beginning: the center of everything is once again the Career mode, in which the player is called to lead a real team through the seasons, trying to get to the top of the world. The planning tool introduced in 2012 has been revised and corrected to be more usable, while at the same time giving new possibilities for managing the athletes of one's team even to those who don't chew bread and racing frames. The other important mode, added on the occasion of the last edition of the game, is the so-called Armada, whose design is inherited directly from the FIFA Ultimate Team. Once again, it is possible to buy cards (through real and virtual currency) representing cyclists and various equipment, to show off in online matches, now improved by Cyanide not only in terms of netcode level performance, but also in the management of individual races in which players they are grouped by level, thus giving a more equal dimension to the challenges. Of note, in Armada mode itself, a number of small steps taken after listening to the player community, including the introduction of the long-requested track mode by fans. Pro Cycling Manager 2013 is a niche game, meant to please the ranks of cycling addicts. From the desk to the street In the world of cycling, and not only that, a very important part is covered by sponsors, without whom it would be impossible to move the whole sideshow: aware of this, the developers have included in Pro Cycling Manager 2013 a more detailed management of the money coming from lenders, leaving the player to select the amount of money received. It will therefore be enough to review our runners' expectations of results upwards or downwards, in a game where in reality it is not all rosy. To ensure that the sponsor is happy to come up with the requested money, it will in fact be a good and right thing to achieve the promised objectives, thus giving rise to a fair exchange between the money obtained and the popularity offered to the sponsor linked to our team. Greater attention has also been paid to the riders, in particular to their state of form, which reacts in a more realistic way to the commitments sustained during the course of the season: in order to be able to keep morale high and score some victories, it is necessary not only to sip the energies, carefully evaluating which competitions to participate in, but cyclists must also be given the opportunity to compete in competitions worthy of their skill. Stage day in Pro Cycling Manager 2013 remained, like much of the game, faithful to the 2012 version; However, Cyanide has decided to go back to intervening on the artificial intelligence of cyclists controlled by the CPU, accused in the past edition of being a little too sleepy with respect to the possibilities of attack, even with respect to what is the course of cycling races in reality . The consequence of all this is that the player has to be even more careful when evaluating herewhen to attack and when instead to defend one's position, in order not to risk ending up behind already starting from a certain distance from the finish line. The same goes between one stage and another, where the developers have decided to make recovery from particularly strenuous performances more difficult for our cyclists. More modding for everyone From a technical point of view, the real novelty of Pro Cycling Manager 2013 is represented by the additional support that Cyanide wanted to give to the mods with this edition, also in this case opening up to the pressing requests of the online community. High resolution textures, enhancement of the editor and removal of some hated limitations will certainly allow the most willing players to indulge themselves with their creations. As far as the graphics sector is concerned, however, the French team continues on the line it has been following for some time, putting in place a series of adjustments that do not, however, upset the basis of the tested 3D engine. However, the final work contains a predictable series of steps forward, although it suffers from a certain heaviness inherited from past editions. Some excessive loading should be reported, while it is good not to expect anything particular from the sound. PC or console? This year, the cycling titles made by Cyanide are two. The first is the one we're reviewing today, Pro Cycling Manager 2013, more simulative and for the PC platform. The second is instead entitled Le Tour de France 100th Edition, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 where it arrived with a more arcade style. Take this into account when purchasing!", "date": "2013-07-03", "grade": "7.5"}
