{"name": "Radiata Stories", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/radiata-stories.html", "text": "Tales of Radiata The introduction leaves you breathless: a book opens and shows the fabulous images of an era that was, made up of dragons and knights. The images come alive, and we witness the spectacular and very violent clash between a huge three-headed dragon and a solitary warrior. Holding his huge and magical sword, the hero throws himself against the monster and seems to have the upper hand, but we are not given the opportunity to know the outcome, because the narration moves to the present: it is in fact the daughter of the heroic knight to introduce us to the protagonist of Radiata Stories, or his brother Jack Russel... who punctually shows up in pajamas, barefoot, asking for breakfast. If this already seems strange to you, think that Jack's master-at-arms is his sister, and that our ~hero~ is also quite poor, as a swordsman. Yet it is a great day, because Jack is preparing to reach the castle of Radiata, where the new knights of the Kingdom will qualify for a tournament and Jack, son of one of the most famous leaders of Radiata, obviously wants to join their ranks. Too bad that in the first duel he is ruthlessly defeated, and moreover by a girl. It therefore seems that fearless Jack's adventure is over before it begins, but recognized as the son of a war hero, he is... well... recommended, without his knowledge, and promoted to knight, without having the slightest qualities to be. Jack thus enters the small team of another prodigal son, Ganz Rothschild, commander of the Rose Cochon Brigade, which also includes Ridley, or the cynical and glacial cadet who defeated Jack in a duel. It goes without saying that between the two there is an incandescent rivalry, and the unfortunate Ganz will pay the price. Yet, this wacky group of funny heroes will have to face a threat that threatens to destroy the idyllic world in which they live... Radiata Stories proceeds like this, between one gag and another that recall the light-hearted and bizarre atmosphere of Brave Fencer Musashi (PlayStation One, 1998), with a somewhat flat and linear plot, but very funny, which will not fail to give you some romantic or dark moments. The plot of the pressing war marches slowly, while increasingly absurd and extravagant characters appear on the scene. Radiata Stories deserves a big round of applause for the courage with which this new protagonist, Jack, is presented: clumsy, cheeky, even a little rude, he is far from the standard we have recently been accustomed to, among heroes with a dark past and others full of psychological problems. Halfway between Zidane from Final Fantasy IX and Meis Triumph from Thousand Arms, with a pinch of Laharl (Disgaea), Jack is a three-dimensional character who develops beautifully, surrounded by equally lovable supporting actors, starting with the funny Ganz. Idea soup From Zelda to Suikoden, with a touch of Final Fantasy and a splash of Star Ocean, Radiata Stories seems to have been programmed by taking here and there the most original and captivating ideas of the latest (and not only) RPGs most appreciated by all gamers. Starting from Radiata Castle, the player in the role of Jack explores the world surrounding the castle, passing from rural villages to rugged mountains, with a solution of continuity entrusted to the colors and the splendid visual variety. There is a lot to do, between optional quests and mandatory missions, and often our heroes will have to face more or less monstrous creatures on their way: this is how the battle system enters the scene, a simplified and more intuitive version of the complex and fun one seen in Star Ocean 3; the player has a party of up to four characters, but complete and total control is only over Jack, while his comrades in arms are guided by the console's excellent AI. One button to attack, even in sequence by developing combos, one to parry and counterattack, another to use Volty Attacks: each successful attack fills the Volty Gauge, and by wasting ten points you can use one of the special attacks linked to the weapon you are using. And if you have a hundred points in the Volty Gauge, they can all be spent to unleash the even more devastating and spectacular Volty Blasts. The inability to take control of other party members, unfortunate enough, is balanced by a system that allows you to give them orders relating to the formation to take on the field to attack a certain enemy, and certain combinations of party characters will even activate some special bonuses. It is therefore a more complicated battle system than it appears, but very easy to master and very fun. However, it would be wrong to reduce Radiata Stories to a simple turn-based ~hack'n'slash~ interspersed with various exploration phases, giventhat's more. By aping Suikoden, even in Radiata Stories it is possible to assemble an army consisting of more than 150 characters, and recruiting them will not be easy at all since the quests that involve them, often optional, bring into play a factor of enormous importance: time. As in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, also in Radiata Stories every day has a precise time cycle, and certain Not Playable Characters carry out different activities during their day: shops close, people go around, and who was in one place in the morning, could be in another in the evening. This expedient gives bite to the adventure and complicates things considerably, making each quest a little challenge, considering the small duration of the main storyline. Charming Without a shadow of a doubt, Radiata Stories confirms itself as one of the most technically impressive video games in the entire gaming landscape for PlayStation 2. With a little toon-shading, practically invisible aliasing and an extraordinary care for the color palette, it almost seems play a fairy tale. Some gamers might remember a similar atmosphere in Legend of Mana and SaGa Frontier 2 (both for PSOne), where much of the emotional involvement was due to the technical realization, which literally sucked into those fairy-tale and enchanted worlds. In Radiata Stories, the polygonal models are rich in details (just think of the fact that Jack changes clothes very often during the adventure) and above all they are divinely animated: their facial expressions and movements have been thought out and translated extremely well, and the quality of many narrative sequences, from the most comical to the most dramatic, it is due to the ~acting~ of the protagonists. Even on a vocal level: the English dubbing is of excellent workmanship, the various actors play their parts with a charge and enthusiasm that really bring the various characters to life, especially Jack and Ridley, whose bickering is among the funniest ever seen in a video game. The frame-rate is also remarkable, with a quantity of stuff like this on the screen one would have expected more or less frequent drops, in reality during exploration it remains anchored to 60fps and drops to 30 during fights, with some slowdown too much in the more chaotic situations, but really irrelevant. Note also the very fast loading, both from one area to another and from the environment to the battlefield. A final positive note certainly deserves the soundtrack, which although it doesn't rival the extraordinary soundtracks of XenoSaga, for example, has the merit of being able to constantly follow the action, without smearing tone or atmosphere. Cheerful when there's something to laugh about, serious when it comes to reflecting, pressing when it comes to fighting: she always succeeds in her job and is a pleasure for the ears. Thumbs up. Radiata Stories hits the target, more or less explicitly prefixed: to mix in a single title the most disparate characteristics of many famous RPGs, seasoning everything with a different story than usual, where more space is given to comic sequences than to a dramatic plot principal. Everything, it must be said, works extremely well: it is possible to complete Radiata Stories in scarce twenty hours, but ten abundant hours can be added and even more if you want to unlock everything that is secret, from new members of the party with special weapons, and what is hidden normally in games of this genre. And not only that, Radiata Stories should be played twice: the choice of which faction to support during the war drastically changes a third of the adventure. Technically impeccable both from a graphic and sound point of view, with truly unforgettable characters for their sympathy and eccentricity, and a battle-system that is not particularly original but functional and simple, Radiata Stories is confirmed as one of the most beautiful surprises of the year in the Jrpg field. Pros Graphically wonderful. Gorgeous characters and classy comedy. Varied and full of good ideas. Against Battle-system a bit simple. Not too long main quest. Star Ocean 3 was one of the best RPGs of 2004 and, while not without some flaws, it won the hearts of those who still did not know the magic that Enix or, more properly, the tri-Ace studio is able to create. There was therefore great trepidation for this Radiata Stories, which when it was announced it was not even clear if it would be played via the Internet, like Final Fantasy XI Online. Actually Radiata Stories isn't played online, it's a ~classic~ RPG: turn-based combat, exquisitely Japanese characters, an interesting storyline and a double ending. All already seen, but so well packaged that it is impossible not to recommend this videoludic jewelor to lovers of the genre, and more. Let's find out why.", "date": "2005-12-09", "grade": null}
