{"name": "Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-or-alive-xtreme-beach-volleyball-4.html", "text": "Parapa parapa parapa parapa how crazy are you? How crazy are you? The introductory movie makes us immediately enter the ~beach~ atmosphere of the game, showing us the girls intent on dancing, swimming, skating and above all having fun. Soon after we arrive at Zack Island and our holiday begins here. After having chosen one of the protagonists we will be invited to go around the small atoll, we will be shown how the shops work, the real fulcrum of the game together with the interaction with the other girls, and we will be able to play our first beach volleyball match. Before talking about beach matches, it is right to point out that the island's points of sale will play a fundamental role in the whole game, because to make friends with one of the girls and thus have a permanent teammate, you will have to spoil her and shower her with gifts. By not doing so, we will soon be left alone and our friend will prefer to be paired with another girl. To avoid being alone for a long time, if downloaded, it is therefore better to give gifts to all the protagonists, you must try to keep them on the ropes, convince them that we would like to play together with each of them. Every girl has different tastes: those who like sacher torte, those who love detective stories and those who adore video games. It's up to us to understand the tastes of the players, following the very brief indications that are given to us at the beginning of the game and our instincts. By getting the wrong gifts, we won't be able to make friends with the other girls who, on the contrary, will remain cold towards us and even throw away our gifts. However, the three shops on the island manage to satisfy almost every desire: they are full of accessories, swimsuits and gadgets of different value and quality. Each day spent on the island will be divided into four phases: morning, afternoon, evening and night. At any time, we will be able to perform a single action or go to a place on the island. We can choose to go to the beach or to the pool (where there is an all too simple mini-game), rest, play volleyball, go diving or bring our gifts to the pretty girls. Every action we choose to do will be described by a movie, always well made with the game's graphics engine, which will allow us to discover our relationships with the other girls or simply give us the opportunity to look at the beauty of our attractive virtual counterpart in all its splendour. I almost forgot that during all these videos it is possible to zoom and rotate the camera view to ~admire~ the details that interest us most. At night, before going to sleep, it is possible to bet our money, earned by winning beach volleyball matches, at the Casino. Here we will have a wide choice of mini-games to play: from poker to blackjack, from roulette to slot machines. What is certain is that, after a while, gambling starts to get boring also because the probability of earning a lot of money, to invest in expensive costumes, is decidedly low. Dead or Alive Extreme Holiday Having said this, it is obvious that Doax is not really a beach volleyball game, indeed the beach plays a marginal role. The games are immediate and very simple to play: use the left analog lever to move our virtual counterpart at will, with the A key you hit and attack and with the B key you receive and get up. Obviously, the different pressure of the keys will change the outcome of our attacks and so from a violent dunk we will pass to an intelligent lob. The games are actually quite engaging, perhaps a little too easy, but still interesting. Unfortunately they are undermined by two major flaws born from decidedly questionable choices by the developers. The first flaw is the framing of the playing field, so senseless as to affect the playability of the games. The camera positioned at the lower vertex of the field often fails to frame all four players, on the contrary, it usually only frames three and distorts the perspective making the game problematic to manage. The second problem is that it is not possible to control both players on the team but only one's own character. It is obvious that this does not offer full control of one's team and often the actions are concluded, both positively and negatively, by our partner without anything being able to be done. If at the beginning this makes the task easier for us, after a couple of games it becomes decidedly frustrating. This problem is certainly not solved by the fact that our friend will be able to play better or worse, depending on how motivated she is by our gifts and by the solidity of our ~couple relationship~.Are there more corners here or in MotoGP? Technically DOAX is a feast for the eyes, there is little else to say. As usual, Tecmo's Ninja studio is as skilled as perhaps anyone else at exploiting and whipping the Xbox graphics hardware. The polygonal models of the players are beautiful and incredibly defined, even more than in Doa3, the animations are very well done and only in very rare cases, during the games, do they seem a bit stiff. The scenarios of the various matches offer a considerable depth of vision and the different light that exists at various times of the day, especially at sunset, is recreated very well, so as to impress any gamer. The sand on which our beauties jump and dive deforms in contact with their bodies, truly giving the idea of being on a tropical beach. The graphics engine therefore proves to be really well done, always managing to move everything at the constant fluidity of 60 frames per second. This stunning graphic impact is enhanced by an inspired soundtrack that is well suited to the vacation on Zack Island. There are songs by Cristina Aguilera, the Spice Girls and Bob Marley, but if the pop-carefree genre isn't your thing, you can always customize everything by using your songs saved on the Xbox hard drive, creating your own personal playlist. Even the sound effects are well done and the voices of the protagonists, with subtitled text in Italian, are well suited to their virtual counterparts. Holiday sweet holiday. The commentary on this game is closely influenced by the passion you have for the protagonists of Dead or Alive. If you love them madly, you cannot give up the purchase and the possibility of enjoying a long holiday in their company. However, if you were expecting a nice beach volleyball title, enriched by curvy girls, you should change your goal and wait for another game. In itself, the latest Tecmo effort still offers an important technical achievement and turns out to be quite fun, even if it is essential, to fully enjoy the title, enter the spirit of the game and let yourself be captured by the atmosphere of the holiday and the desire to discover all items to give away. If you don't succeed, Doax can only be a bit boring and repetitive, given that basically it is based on a simple system of exchanges and the only real game time is given by beach volleyball matches, too simplistic and in itself not entirely satisfying. Pros: Technically fantastic The protagonists of Doa3 Takes us on vacation a few months early Soundtrack well done and customizable Cons: Not a beach volleyball game Repetitive Only for true fans of the Dead or Alive girls Lacks a nice multiplayer mode to four players When Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball was announced at E3 last year, it immediately caused a stir. The possibility of being able to admire the beauties of the best Microsoft console fighting game, intent on challenging each other with jokes, dunks and lobs veiled only by microscopic swimsuits was truly intriguing. The first images began to circulate and everyone was struck by those girls (I repeat: by the curves of those girls) so well defined as to seem real. The screenshots spoke for themselves. After the images, the first information on the Tecmo title began to spread on the net and the doubt immediately arose that Doax would not remain a simple beach volleyball game, not a worthy answer to Sega's Beach Spikers for the GameCube, but something more , or less, according to taste. The intention of the developers was precisely to want to increase the interaction between us users and the provocative and shapely protagonists. A new game for a new definition: vacation simulator. And a flimsy plot is enough to be able to spend fifteen days in the company of Hitomi, Lei Fang and all the others.", "date": "2003-03-27", "grade": null}
