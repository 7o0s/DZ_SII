{"name": "Natale in casa Disney", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72942-a-christmas-carol-natale-in-casa-disney.html", "text": "Everyone knows the famous story A Christmas Carol, told in the work of the same name by Charles Dickens and revisited several times in the cinematic world, but no one has ever been able to experience this incredible Christmas adventure firsthand. The title skilfully manages to combine tradition and modernity, presenting a great classic to those who don't know it yet: the player is in fact called to closely follow the path of redemption of the surly Scrooge, whose stories are scrupulously narrated for the entire duration of the game. In this panorama, the task to be performed is to take on the role of the ~hand of destiny~: a peculiarity of the game, in fact, is the absence of a precise identification with one of the many characters in the story, with whom one can interact without distinction in order to achieve the proposed objective. Thus, you will have to manage the various supernatural situations that the miserly protagonist will have to experience: follow him during his meetings with the three Christmas spirits and help him melt his heart of stone. With this method, the story is covered very faithfully, so as to be able to consider the title, ultimately, as a real ~interactive book~, suitable for both nostalgics and children. A timeless classic The structure of A Christmas Carol, not at all complex, immediately makes the main objective jump to the eye: to tell a story. The playful aspect, in fact, is nothing more than a means to get passionate about the vicissitudes narrated and to convey the message of ~preparing for the Christmas spirit~. In the main mode, the player must analyze the proposed scenarios, find even the most recondite clues like in a real puzzle game and help the secondary characters fill the heart of the miser Ebenezer with the joy of Christmas. You will thus have to interact with numerous objects, trying to achieve the mini-goal proposed from time to time: it will be, for example, necessary to find a ploy to light a candle in order to reveal the silhouette of a ghost to the gaze of the incredulous protagonist. ..or simply drop a book on the ground to annoy dry Scrooge. Within the proposed scenes it will then be possible to collect a large number of collectibles, such as hollies or sugar sticks, which can be viewed in the ~Redemption~ section, which summarizes the progress made. Not only objectives within the story, however, since as the story progresses it is possible to relax with themed mini-games with the scene you are analyzing. Here you will have to toss coins, prepare a succulent feast, sing Christmas carols and more! As per ~tradition~, all the unlocked mini-games will be replayable at a later time in the dedicated section. Finally, there is no Christmas spirit without an advent calendar and even here it is no exception: every day, from December 1st to Christmas day, you will have access to a new puzzle in full ~find the differences~ style, by certainly more interesting for the magic of the scenes portrayed, rather than for the proposed challenge. Mixed feelings Going into detail, it is clear how the game is characterized by extremely positive aspects but also by defects that can certainly be improved. The storytelling element is the undisputed winner: perfect dialogues entirely translated into Italian, as well as excellent dubbing, form the leitmotif of a real cartoon that adheres very closely to the great classic, accompanied by absolutely suggestive music and sound effects. The game scenes are presented in two dimensions, like the most classic graphic adventures, and represent the salient passages of the story. Even the mini-games, albeit very simple, are made captivating thanks to the dual use of the stylus and microphone. On the other hand, one must be honest about the main method of the game: it is not too much to say that to be able to quickly overcome each puzzle it is necessary to have the vision of a falcon ... in fact, one must find even the slightest details (sometimes it is even just tiny dots in the background) in order to progress and the actions to be carried out are not always simple and obvious. The proposed objectives are never a challenge to the end but, as emphasized several times, a pretext to involve the player in the Christmas atmosphere and in the story of the elderly protagonist. We must therefore pay attention to the ultimate goal of the title: if you are looking for an alternative and fun way to get to know a good story, then by purchasing this game you will make the right choice, if otherwise you are only interested in the playful aspect, then perhaps it is better to look for better shores.", "date": "2009-12-16", "grade": null}
