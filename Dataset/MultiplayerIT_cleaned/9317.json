For months there has been talk of both the next From Dust and this Outland, finally out, and which confirmed all the good impressions it had made us during the preview. After excellent games such as Stardust HD, Housemarque confirms itself as a purebred developer, capable of exploiting the place of downloadable games like few others, of those that with a few hundred megabytes give a hard time to beasts with several Gigabytes of memory. Yes, because Outland will be a bit chilly and will lack a certain wickedness in game design, as we will see later, but it deserves all possible success because a second title could be born around this concept with great counter bows (live, we would have used another term, a little more vulgar). A story to imagine The premises are quite classic, with a hero deprived of his powers charged with saving a world from oblivion promised him by wicked gods who reign over a planet divided into areas each with its own theme and connected by a central hub from which to travel both on foot than with a series of convenient portals. The events are linked by 2D screens and a narrative voice, with the worlds acting as a real glue. Outland is a 2D action adventure made, very well from a technical point of view, with a mixture of polygons for the characters and beautiful bitmap backdrops that scroll in parallax. Cosmetics is the most fascinating aspect of the game which, along the lines of titles such as Castlevania or the more recent Shadow Complex, lead the player to overcome a series of levels, accumulating ever greater powers thanks to which access to new areas and always defeat bosses more evil. In addition to these abilities that are acquired simply by progressing through the story, by killing monsters you get gold coins that can be spent in front of the statues of two deities and which give the hero additional vital energy and the one needed to use the most powerful spells. devastating. Especially when, towards the end, our avatar becomes a real weapon of destruction. Just the boss fights are one of the flagships of the game, made as they are with a skilful game and level design, which does not limit itself to placing the player in single rooms in which to fight them, but in situations that evolve in a spectacular way, especially since it is still a downloadable game. The main feature of the game is borrowed from a classic from Japan, Ikaruga of the Treasures (or if you really know a lot, Silohuette Mirage), with the levels populated by two-colored enemies - red and blue - which can be hit by dressing the hero of the opposite colour. Making things more interesting are the projectiles fired by plants and other flying creatures through which you pass unscathed, choosing the matching color instead. Outland, therefore, when pushing to scratch, asks the player to quickly switch between the two colors to jump on platforms, overcome barriers of killing blows and at the same time kill the menacing soldiers who make up the armies of the gods. Compared to the titles mentioned and which Housemarque was clearly inspired by, however, Outland in the long run fails to be ~bad~ enough. It's well structured, a lot of fun, but the level design never pushes the limit, stopping to suggest possible situations, but which don't fully materialize. In so much cosmetic luxury, then, the limits of the approximately 500Mb of the executable lead to a lack of landmarks, or situations that stand out in the global, excellent quality, but which strike the player making him want to go on to see yet another fantastic setting . There is a very high average quality, which however would need more physical space on the hard disk to give more diversified locations capable of leaving an indelible mark on the memory. Xbox 360 goals Bad news for Gamerscore hunters. Outland's 200 points are hard-earned, because there aren't any to be conquered as the story progresses, if not a couple, one for the finale, and since they require you to play in the different modes and with a friend. In short, it will take some time, but it is worth it. Network action For 800 Microsoft Points (and the equivalent on PSN), Outland gives in exchange a long-lasting campaign (more than six hours), several secrets to find, areasto explore and a great satisfaction. As if that weren't enough, the whole campaign can be played online together with another friend, with the possibility of having an additional save and without, therefore, compromising the main game. The two players move on the screen completely independently with an arrow that always indicates in which direction their travel companion is. The basic rule is that you don't leave an area without waiting for each other and that if one of you dies, the other has about 30 seconds to go and resurrect him before the game is over. To do this, however, it is necessary to give him part of your vital energy, placing both in a subsequent difficult situation. The accumulated money is spent in common and therefore there is no fight against the wild loot, except for personal satisfaction. In addition to this possibility, there is also an Arcade mode to replay the levels within a certain time limit, accumulating scores and multipliers, and there are also coop challenges, which are unlocked by exploring the different settings and which pit the two players against each other the other in collecting bonuses and accumulating money. In short, Outland does everything to be bought and played and our invitation is to indulge him in the hope that the series can evolve into a more substantial and outlined project.", "date": "2011-04-28", "grade": "8.5"}
