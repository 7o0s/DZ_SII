{"name": "The Witness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/162414-the-witness-impressionismo-videoludico.html", "text": "Historically, titles characterized by too long and troubled development times manage to demotivate even the most passionate of gamers, however there are also some exceptions, where the unshakable trust in the software house (or its key figure) continues to fuel hope, the dream in a result of depth and quality. Just think of the ~religious~ expectation that surrounds the poetic The Last Guardian. Although a parallel with Fumito Ueda's title appears inappropriate, also considering the production values at stake, the story of The Witness has several points of contact with that of the cryptic Japanese project, starting from the year of the first announcement - the distant 2009 - until to the inevitable transition to the current videogame generation, in which the colorful puzzle / adventure should have made its debut at the launch of the new Sony flagship. After the fascinating trailer shown during the PlayStation 4 presentation conference, the game returned to the shadows once again, fleetingly reappearing in some prestigious international fairs where it continued to whet the imagination and interest of critics and the public. After all, this is the second work signed by the young American developer Jonathan Blow, the same one who with the splendid Braid managed to bring prestige to the entire independent videogame movement, conveying its enormous success that is there for all to see today. The launch date of The Witness was finally announced last September and in these days we have been able to get our hands on the definitive code of the PlayStation 4 version, which on January 26th will be accompanied by the PC one and in the following weeks by an iteration for iOS systems. Poetry, mystery and a blaze of colors in The Witness, the puzzle-adventure by Jonathan Blow Loneliness After a long period of quiescence, the first-person puzzle-adventure genre was recently shaken up by Croteam's excellent The Talos Principle, a title that surprised not only for the legacy of the development team, mainly known for the Old-school FPS Serious Sam, but also for the brilliance of the logic puzzles proposed and the seductive and melancholy script, permeated by philosophical and metaphysical themes. The Witness offers an open world structure similar but not superimposable to that of the Croatian masterpiece, moreover there is a substantial difference in the mechanics of the puzzles, given that instead of interacting with sets of objects to be placed appropriately in the scenario, in the work of Jonathan Blow we intervene basically (but not only) on particular panels, in which simple lines are drawn to get to the bottom of two-dimensional labyrinths. That's all? Absolutely not. At the beginning of the adventure the player finds himself projected into a mysterious tunnel, at the bottom of which, after passing a couple of basic introductory puzzles, a ruined building opens up surrounded by lush vegetation: it is the first section of the enigmatic island to familiarize yourself with the basic dynamics. There is no written indication or thundering deity to ~suggest~ us what to do (or rather, not to do) and the game menu is so reduced to the bone that the only options available are brightness adjustment, axis inversion Y and the activation of subtitles, in addition to the fundamental management of the saves. It therefore appears evident that the player will have to fend for himself for the entire duration of the adventure, learning from his mistakes, making attempts but above all deepening his knowledge of the fascinating setting, which has much, much more to tell than what transpires from the very first hours of exploration. After a short study phase, the objective of the preliminary area is immediately perceived: all the monitors present are in fact connected by large bundles of cables which are ~activated~ once the puzzle linked to them is completed, directing the energy towards the gate main access to the island. It is a sort of appetizer of what awaits the player once he has penetrated the abundant (but not colossal) open world map, in which it is imperative to follow and study the wiring of the panels to get to the bottom of the individual sections in which it is subdivided the theater of adventure. Apart from specific areas to be unlocked by solving certain puzzles and enigmas, they are freely accessible from the start, significantly increasing the player's sense of loss, who may come across particularly difficult panels to understand due to inexperience with the rules underlying them. This pushes you to explore, experiment and retrace your steps until you discover itthe missing piece that turns on the fateful light bulb. The mental process triggered by the apparently random distribution of the groups of puzzles is incredibly fascinating, underlining, if it were still needed, the genius and artistic flair of the Californian game designer. About 650 puzzles are distributed on the island, an incredible number which translates into a very high longevity. However, to get to the end credits of The Witness it is not necessary to overcome them all, a feat so difficult that, according to an estimate provided by Blow himself, only 1% of players should succeed. As far as the actual gameplay is concerned, the interaction mechanics with the environment are extremely simplified: beyond the run, which can be activated by holding down L2 and tilting the left analog stick forward, the only DualShock 4 key to use is the X, needed to start puzzle solving mode and draw lines within the mazes. As specified above, the rules that underlie the numerous panels are quite varied and ingenious, making it necessary to study symbols, colors and other elements to understand how to proceed, and there is no shortage of very interesting surprises that we leave the pleasure of discovering to you. Playstation 4 trophies The Witness offers a total of fourteen Trophies, divided into two silver, eleven gold and one platinum. With the exception of the latter, linked to the unlocking of all the others, these are hidden objectives that are revealed to the player only when the action is completed. For this reason we avoid indicating potential and unpleasant spoilers. Art at play Superficially, Jonathan Blow's work could appear as a sumptuous container of labyrinthine puzzles scattered randomly on an exotic map, however, as one delves deeper and deeper into its gears, the fascinating bucolic settings begin to ~speak~ to the player, to tell a secret and mysterious history hidden in the heart of the island. The cryptic audio messages to recover, subtitled in Italian and dubbed by the likes of Phil LaMarr (Pulp Fiction), Matthew Waterson (The Order: 1886), Ashley Johnson (Blindspot, The Last of US) and Terra Deva, while providing information nebulae paint a picture that is up to the player to interpret and complete, with the help of the enigmatic clues that sometimes emerge from the scenario. The fascinating mental process linked to the search and solution of puzzles is accompanied by the sense of mystery and solitude triggered by the uninhabited island, whose harmonious design is enhanced by a warm and enveloping color palette, probably inspired by the French impressionist current. Every square meter of the map of The Witness presents a delightful and at times unsettling artistic refinement, where the touch of the naturalistic architecture experts hired in the development team has translated into a simply sublime level design. Biomes contrasting in colors and geography alternate seamlessly on the island, ranging from birch woods with an autumn flavor to bare deserts, through mangrove forests, bamboo reeds, lakes caressed by Japanese botanical culture, up to imposing mountains rocks and spring orchards in bloom. From the pristine and dominant nature, embraced by the pastel blue of the sky and the ocean, fragments and wrecks of human life emerge, which together with the fauna seem to have hastily abandoned this wonderful garden of Eden. The artificial structures, among which we find a castle with labyrinthine gardens, temples and houses with various types of architecture, are all wrapped in a melancholic atmosphere and built with the same care dedicated to natural environments, concealing particularly ingenious puzzles that feed the curiosity and the desire to discover all the secrets of Jonathan Blow's work. The idea of using a proprietary graphics engine, to be shaped around the needs of the title, proved to be a trump card for the development team, which overcame the transition from the old platforms with enthusiasm, presenting itself on PlayStation 4 with a very solid and stylistically flawless. Although not particularly demanding from the point of view of the polygonal mass, the grandeur and three-dimensionality of some structures of The Witness really leave you speechless, thanks also to the 1080p resolution and the rocky sixty frames per second. The maniacal artistic care dedicated to the graphics is accompanied by an audio sector aimed at underlining the melancholic atmosphere and the sense of solitude, where the soundtrack, practically absent, is replaced by very delicate and refined samplings, like the omnipresent rustling of the wind that caresses the vegetation.", "date": "2016-01-25", "grade": "9.0"}
