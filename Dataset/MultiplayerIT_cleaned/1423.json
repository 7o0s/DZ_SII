{"name": "WRC 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wrc-4.html", "text": "Without counter steering I don't enjoy it Unfortunately, the third chapter of the Evolution Studios series does not turn out to be as brilliant as one would have expected, and indeed in many respects it is not able to even live up to the previous installation; the biggest disappointment undoubtedly comes from the driving model which, perhaps to address a wider catchment area, has been decidedly moved in the direction of a marked arcade center of gravity, abandoning the excellent simulation cues of WRC II Extreme. In fact, with the second chapter, the team of programmers had been able to offer the player an exceptional feeling with the car, which was able through the dual shock to transmit its weight, inertia, adherence to the asphalt; facing a hairpin bend at high speed, it was possible to perceive exactly how much the wheels would have ~held~, or when it was necessary to pull the brakes before a turn. All things, these, very easy to describe and imagine but extremely difficult to successfully insert into a video game; Evolution Studios had drawn the wildcard from the deck, and all it needed to revise was questionable crash management and a too-permissive car-damage algorithm. On the contrary, playing WRC 3 is an experience that leaves very little once the console is turned off, if not bitterness and frustration in those who had loved the previous chapter and expected a step forward from this new episode. The car responds to the commands given with excessive reactivity, eliminating any feeling of ~weight~ of the car; the lightness of the front end is far too marked, to the point of compromising entirely the driving experience which therefore results in a frenetic and unrealistic zig-zag in search of the best trajectory. Even the drifts, the real backbone of any self-respecting rally experience, have in this case been almost completely abandoned due to road holding beyond imagination. The situation improves slightly with experience, which allows you to tackle the tracks present cleanly and with great speed; but the fact remains that the driving model has lost the peculiar characteristics that had made it appreciated in the past to become much more affordable but also much more anonymous. The paucity of the pre-race phase is also surprising, which limits the set-up of the car to 3 basic and all in all not very influential settings. On the contrary, the variety and quantity of routes available is extremely positive, as well as their extension which in some cases even settles around ten kilometers on a single stage; the settings cross all the countries touched by the official competition  of which Sony holds the rights, obviously also for the cars and drivers -, and their reproduction is all in all valid, even if not without defects. Why is my 500 Abarth missing? WRC II Extreme was also able to impress from a technical point of view, thanks to a graphics engine capable of grinding a large amount of polygons with ease and, during replays, to offer sequences worthy of the best television footage with aerial shots capable of embracing several square kilometers of track. In this third episode, the team has decided to increase the number of polygons on the screen, with greater detail on the track and greater care in the reproduction of the cars. Unfortunately this has caused some side effects, above all a marked clipping both in the long distance (settings in the distance) and in the short distance (tufts of grass or stakes on the sides of the track). There are also imperfections that probably denounce a shortage of time granted to Evolution Studios; the appearance of the white connecting lines between the asphalt segments are in fact clear signs of the lack of time available to correct and finish the product. Low-quality textures, especially in close-ups, and the flatness of trees and audience are just some of the aspects that contrast with strengths such as the excellent visual depth, the expert use of colors and the aforementioned modeling of the cars, deformable thanks to a graphically very valid damage system but still too little incisive on the real performance of the vehicle. The aforementioned replay also seems to have taken a step backwards, less inspired in the shots and cuts than that of WRC 2 Extreme, and debased in one of its strengths, the view from the helicopter, now much more restricted. Some perplexity also derives from the difficulty setting: the jump from the first livello - beginner- to the second -professional- appears too marked, with the latter already capable of putting a strain on precisely that occasional user to whom we wanted to address by simplifying the gameplay. Obviously the situation is further taken to extremes with the expert and extreme levels, able to easily overcome the frustration threshold and certainly out of reach for many players. The sound, on the other hand, is of a good standard: the rumbles of the cars appear credible and realistic as do the sound effects and the indications of the co-driver, while the musical accompaniment compensates for an unforgettable quality with a great variety of styles capable of satisfying every taste. Furthermore, the whole ~outline~ of the actual game is extremely valid, which consists of in-depth analyses, audio and video comments and mini-documentaries on pilots and tracks, representing an indisputable added value for fans of the discipline. Still far from impeccable however the structure of the menus, stylistically rather poor as well as poorly functional. Comment WRC 3, sorry to say, but it can only be considered a disappointment for anyone who has played and enjoyed the second, excellent chapter. Instead of correcting and polishing the few imperfections of a truly excellently crafted gameplay, Evolution Studios preferred to turn sharply towards the arcade genre, abandoning most of the simulation aspects that had made the success of the predecessor; to this must be added an appreciable graphic component, but full of imperfections and undermined by a particularly marked bad clipping. WRC 3 ultimately gives the impression of being a stretch, based on the decision to distort the foundations of a series that had so far developed by addressing very different objectives. And, like all forcing, the result is far from exciting. Pros: An arcade like many others, fun for casual players Excellent variety of tracks Good sound system Cons: Game mechanics very far from the excellent WRC 2 Numerous graphic imperfections Poor car set-up possibilities Finding the alchemy to create a successful rally title, but more generally a successful automotive one, is undoubtedly a task with a difficulty coefficient frighteningly close to hitting a dry lottery. After the anything but exciting first World Rally Championship, Evolution Studios was able to pull the splendid WRC II Extreme out of the hat, a real surprise capable not only of impressing all the enthusiasts, but even of humiliating that Colin Mc Rae Rally 3 which made its debut in those days on 128 bit sure to reconfirm itself as king of the genre. Things did not go like this and the Sony production was on the contrary able to steal the scepter from the dangerous rival, thanks to a practically perfect gameplay - with the exception of shock management - and a graphics sector capable of leaving you speechless. But, as we know, resting on our laurels is a risky practice; Codemasters is well aware of this, which after the misstep of the third episode, has packaged a Colin Mc Rae Rally 4 capable of repairing all the errors of its predecessor, catching up abundantly and -according to some- overtaking its rival. The wait was therefore concentrated on WRC 3, and on the answer it would be able to give to the fatigue of British programmers", "date": "2004-01-05", "grade": null}
