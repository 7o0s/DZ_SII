Surely you have thought about it sometimes, fantasizing about the best solutions to adopt in order not to end up being eaten by the undead but, at the same time, trying to save as many friends and relatives as possible. Barricade yourself at home, block doors and windows, praying that supplies will last as long as possible? Or try to escape to a hypothetical safe place, filling the car with people and basic necessities, but with the constant fear that the fuel could run out halfway? This is exactly the situation described in The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct, taken from the television series produced by AMC and therefore not directly from Robert Kirkman's comic, as instead happened for the excellent episodic adventure by Telltale Games. In the game we will not have to deal with the complete cast of the show, but only with Daryl and Merle Dixon, since the events narrated are a real prequel, illustrating what the two brothers were doing when the invasion occurred . Daryl, who is the character we control, was on a hunting trip with his father and some friends in the middle of the woods when the zombies made their appearance. From this point of view, the first sequences are symbolic of what will later prove to be the philosophy behind the title developed by Terminal Reality. In fact, we will play the role of Daryl and Merle's father, armed with a shotgun, but we will quickly be overwhelmed by the undead. Then we will find ourselves checking Daryl, on the run together with the only survivor of the group, with the aim of recovering Merle who in the meantime is locked up in the prisons of a police station a few tens of kilometers away. Will this be the right solution? It doesn't matter: brothers need to help each other. Survival horror The first images of The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct had perhaps made us think of a title oriented towards pure action, an old-fashioned shooter in which to blow hundreds of zombies' heads moving from one location to another, but the reality is quite different. In fact, the game looks like a first-person survival horror, which encourages us to walk silently rather than make noise, to use weapons wisely and sparingly rather than launching an attack. The herds of undead are in fact terribly numerous and facing more than one at a time often proves fatal, so you have to use cunning and some expedient (for example, throwing an empty bottle to make some noise and divert the attention of enemies) even just to move from one area of the scenario to another. Daryl can explore the levels in search of sidearms or firearms, ammunition, supplies and fuel, but the inventory is limited and at some point we will have to unload part of what we have collected in the trunk of the car we are using to move from one city to another, first with the aim of recovering Merle and then to find some safe place with him. These are interesting concepts, such as the use of ~rules of engagement~ oriented towards realism, with zombies that can only be eliminated by smashing their skulls but which many times manage to take us from behind by surprise, rising from what seemed like a passive state and approaching without making a sound. When our character is grabbed, the only chance to survive is to try to frame the head of the undead and press the right trigger to stab it with the hunting knife, but it is a difficult practice, especially when there are many enemies . The yield of the weapons is also interesting, which depending on the entity require more or less blows to remove a living dead man: four blows with the knife, three blows with the pipe, only one with the demolition hammer, but we must consider the timing so as not to go astray and expose yourself to a lethal counterattack. Xbox 360 goals The fifty Objectives of The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct are obtained by completing the various missions but also and above all by performing particular actions: saying goodbye to a passenger, eliminating four zombies in a row during a ~hug~, visiting a certain number of locations not marked on the map, find and use all available vehicles and so on. Good ideas badly implemented We said that the concepts behind The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct are anything but evil. The point, however, is how these elements have been implemented, and unfortunately the answer is very concise: bad. The impression one gets while playing is that the developers limited themselves to putting topics on the table without developingthem in any way, and what derives from it is an extremely limited and repetitive experience, which manages to involve only because of the high degree of difficulty. During his journey, Daryl meets characters who offer to accompany him and to whom we can entrust tasks every time we stop somewhere, for example looking for bullets, food or materials, with variable risk percentages depending on the objective. Let's also say that there is no need to worry too much about their safety: even if they were to die trying to lend us a hand, this would have an almost zero impact, given that in any case the seats in the vehicle on duty are limited and therefore necessarily things we will have to abandon a passenger when we want to welcome another. Moreover, the contribution of the companions is completely ~virtual~, given that we will not see them in-game exploring the scenario and possibly accompanying us, albeit for short stretches. The various levels are ~completed~ simply by collecting objects or interacting in some way with other people, after which we return to the map screen and we are given the opportunity to decide whether we want to proceed to the next destination using highways, normal or state roads. Each choice hides possible drawbacks due to fuel consumption or car breakdowns, but it is truly amazing how the scenarios of a possible emergency stop are always the same and never change. Unfortunately, this is only one of the aspects of the technical sector that we really didn't like: certain portions of the locations are in fact ~photocopied~ with each other, they are completely lacking in interaction and, above all, boast a mediocre realization, especially as regards the textures, some of which are literally unwatchable. The zombies, on which on balance it was necessary to focus more, are divided only into four or five different types and their polygonal models do not in the least compare with what has been seen in some recent productions. On the technical front, let's say that only the sound is saved, which features the original voices of Norman Reedus and Michael Rooker, used to give prestige to a production that we have no difficulty in defining truly disappointing.", "date": "2013-03-26", "grade": "4.5"}
