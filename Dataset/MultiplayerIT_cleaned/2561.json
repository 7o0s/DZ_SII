{"name": "Icewind Dale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/icewind-dale.html", "text": "Far lands The game is set in the Forgotten Realms (unfortunately Interplay does not hold the rights to exploit worlds like that of the Dragonlance saga, which should instead belong to Activision), in an impervious and mountainous region of Faerun as the title lets us imagine. The events narrated chronologically occur long before those of Baldur's Gate, so famous characters such as Drizzt or Elminster will not be present. The story in particular is very dark and features a group of people (up to a maximum of 6) who, due to ups and downs, meet in these places and decide to venture together. It goes without saying that soon the whole group will be entangled in events much bigger than them, but revealing even the smallest detail would mean ruining the pleasure of playing the first parts of the game, so I will avoid talking in detail about the plot, since nothing suggests at the beginning the development of the subsequent parts of the game (since the player is completely left in the dark about the events that are about to happen, it is the only reason that prompted the characters to go to the Valley of the freezing wind is that of fame and glory). Diablo? ~It doesn't look like me at all!~ Icewind Dale is an atypical product. Although from the beginning it has been touted as ~the antagonist of Diablo 2~ and even has often been compared with the latter, it has very little to do with it. Both are heavily combat-oriented games but are aimed at profoundly different audiences. If Diablo 2 offers the player a simple and immediate type of combat, Icewind Dale uses the tested method of the Baldur's Gate combat system in which everything will be managed in real time where you can intervene when you want by pausing the game and entrusting your characters various orders such as attacking enemies, casting spells or moving around the battlefield. So as it is easy to understand in Icewind Dale you will not find the richness of the dialogues of a Planescape Torment as you will not find its existentialist philosophy but you will still find an attention to detail and particulars far greater than that present in Baldur's Gate. Having said that we can examine this Icewind Dale in detail. At a superficial glance it would appear to be a Baldur's Gate with a different ~skin~. To an in-depth analysis too. In fact, the engine has remained substantially the same and has unfortunately kept some defects corrected instead in the version of the Infinity engine used in Torment (for example, a screen will be missing in which you can check which quests have been completed and which have not, in fact you will have to settle for the journal in which your party will record the events in chronological order. For example, if you wanted to know exactly what it was that an NPC asked you to do, you would have to dig through the Journal until you found the right note. Also, the map was automatically annotated in Torment, a feature not present in Icewind Dale), but some of the small improvements present are the same ones that animate the game. In Icewind Dale you won't have to create a single character, but you will be called to create an entire party (you could also do it in Baldur's Gate, playing a multiplayer game and playing it in single player, but in Icewind Dale this opportunity is ~official~) of adventurers by choosing among the various classes of AD&D. Icewind Dale is perhaps the first CRPG (or presumed such, given the strongly hack'n'slash nature of IWD) that re-proposes this feature that was so fashionable at the time of the SSI Gold Box or the Eye of the Beholder. Of course, as expected, the creation of an entire party eliminates the presence of a protagonist, depersonalizing the group which will therefore find itself a group of people who act and behave in the same way (at least in single player). But the mastery of the Black Isle programmers makes its presence felt, unlike Baldur's Gate, in some parts of the game that can change depending on your choices in the dialogues or the characteristics of your character. For example, if your party leader is a Paladin he will be able to detect if the person speaking to him is an ~evil~ individual (when he is trying to pass himself off as ~good~ logically) and some dialogue choices will only be available if the speaker has a certain value in intelligence, just like in Fallout or Torment. The nature of the game is highly linear and practically almost the entire game is involved in the main quest, thus eliminating the possibility of losing interest in the plot. IWD is organized in rigid watertight compartments between which you can (and must) move only when you have completed the previous part. This translates to ~go to that dungeon, slaughter everything and everyone and when you've found the item so-and-so come back here and I'll tell you to go to that place and slaughter some more people~. Almost all of the game takes place in gigantic underground complexes which fortunately have been characterized much better than the poor result obtained in Baldur's Gate. While unfortunately we are not at the level of Durlag's Tower from Tales of the Sword Coast, the dungeons of Icewind Dale are not flat and ~uninhabited~ like those of Baldur's Gate. In the dungeons of IWD you will very often find some NPCs who will talk to you and although most of these will attack you a few moments later, this will certainly serve to increase the involvement. Since combat is the focus of this game, one cannot complain too much as playing it it becomes evident that the Black Isle programmers have tried to put something of ~their~ into a title with a decidedly different setting from the very reflective one of their previous one torment. Even if these ~touches~ are present in alternating stretches, given that very often the too much ~laziness~ of the programmers in implementing some features appears. Leaving aside the fact that most of the sprites in the game are the same used in Baldur's Gate, in the game there is (for example) one of the famous ~Bag of Holding~, a ~bag~ which should allow you to keep inside a large number of objects (which will instead be located in a sort of parallel dimension suitable for use). Of course, implementing this would have meant introducing substantial changes to the engine and therefore to avoid this ~effort~, the authors have seen fit to ~come out~ with the fact that that particular Bag of Holding ~doesn't work~ (in fact it will serve other purposes). Or to some monsters that should ~technically~ suck your levels and experience but this doesn't happen, whether out of ~pity~ towards the player or ~laziness~ of the programmers we don't know... However given the nature of the game, in Icewind Dale your party will start from the first level and will arrive around the 14-15th level (the experience cap is set at 1.8 million xp per character) in the game there will be numerous ~unpublished~ monsters and some will need special treatments in order to be defeated. This thing that does nothing but highlight the ~strategic~ feature of the game in question: going into disarray like in Diablo 2 you will soon be eliminated, but with correct and effective planning of actions you will be able to obtain much better results. For example, Trolls can only be killed permanently if their fatal blow is delivered with weapons, objects or spells that produce damage related to fire or acid, otherwise the Troll will get up and regenerate in a short time. The objects that will therefore accompany you will naturally be calibrated as the adventure progresses, but they will be present in a much more numerous way (and some will also be random: on some occasions you may find objects, while replaying you may obtain another object, but these will still be both ~unique~ and uncreated items like in Diablo). However, all this definitely raises the difficulty of the fights which will often be real challenges given that wherever you are you will never have the tranquility to face a situation, aware that very few could have worried you as often happened in Baldur's Gate. But this difficulty derives from the fact that very often you will have to deal with many enemies at the same time and we are not talking about 20-30 goblins but 20-30 Cold Wights (for example) when they pose a serious threat to your party. Which often leads to trying to ~lure~ them individually instead of breaking in by engaging all the enemies present in combat, which is only possible due to the poor AI (the other non-~activated~ monsters stay behind, in Baldur's Gate 2 they do not as soon as a monster has sighted you, it will automatically ~warn~ all its merry companions..). ~Do you speak Italian?~ A separate comment ~deserves~ the translation, or rather the dubbing performed. The translation was carried out by 25th Edition (the same person responsible for translating the material relating to AD&D) but the latter, as one of the same persons responsible has repeatedly clarified on the it.comp.giochi.rpg newsgroup (on which he occasionally intervenes), the Interplay didn't allow them to check the success of the translation, so on some occasions some sentenceswill be ~wrong~ or will not match their spoken equivalent (if any). Furthermore, some parts have been translated very badly (if not even with some automatic translator), such as the descriptions of the menus or spells (not translated from the 25th Edition). For example the ~clear~ key to cancel, will have been translated with ~clear~, while the translation of the actual dialogues shows a very good quality. Dubbing, on the other hand, is a real mess... Unfortunately, not professional dubbers were used, but the usual cartoon dubbers, the same ones who dub almost all of the games in Italian. This leads to excessively stereotyped intonations, with little ~serious~ voices and above all out of context. There are few voices that can be saved, for the others, most likely in the character creation phase when you have to choose which voice to match the characters, you will be ashamed to listen to such ridiculous voices. Furthermore, some of the translations made border on ignorance, in fact they had the courage to translate the English idiomatic expression ~sounds good~ (which in Italian means something like ~seems promising~) with .... ~suona bene~ (its literal translation). And this is just one of the countless blunders present in the Italian version of IWD. We Italians therefore find in our hands a decidedly inferior product of the American version. Someone in other spheres should understand that given the nature of the game, there is a need for professional voice actors and not those who dub cartoons (without detracting from the latter, but there will be a reason why those who voice the characters cartoon never dubs movies). Fortunately, the voices of the NPCs you will encounter remain of good quality. At that time? Take or leave? In essence, the game is intended above all for those who liked Baldur's Gate, but above all for those who enjoyed his fights. So if you didn't like them, it's better to move on. IWD if played in single can also border on boredom due to the repetitiveness of the actions (fight after fight): if you can, try to play it entirely in multiplayer (since you play the same adventure as the single, in ~co-op~) with your friends, which is finally possible. In fact, due to the presence of human players, the game manages to achieve something that it cannot offer on its own. Played in company IWD will offer the best of itself in fact each player will be able to choose which (and how many) characters to control and of course you won't be able to know the characteristics of the other characters or the objects they use! This will lead to very amusing situations in fact (if you manage to role-play) you will not be able to know what spell your friend is casting (unless you know the words by heart) or you could find yourself in discussions on how to behave with regard to the various NPC.. of course you won't know if the character you are playing as is good or evil etc. etc. Try to equip yourself with a microphone so you can use programs like Roger Wilco that will avoid having to interrupt the action to communicate with your friends. In conclusion, Icewind Dale is unlikely to leave you thinking about ethical or moral issues as Planescape Torment could have done, but if you are looking for an action-crpg to have fun with, you have found it, but remember that the fun you should have in single player it's nothing compared to playing in multi (and Icewind Dale isn't the only thing that playing alone doesn't work like in company...). Premise As you probably already know, the ~Valley of the Chill Wind~ is the name of the latest Action-CRPG produced by the Black Isle through the Infinity Engine, the same engine of the previous Baldur's Gate and Planescape Torment. Icewind Dale was programmed by Black Isle, creators of the previous Fallout 1/2 and Torment, although many of the Fallout programmers now work at Troika Games, dealing with Arcanum and not by Bioware who have licensed the use of their engine. previously used by themselves for Baldur's Gate and its expansion.
