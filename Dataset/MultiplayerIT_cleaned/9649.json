And, of course, many developers have not been asked too much to lend their support. It is therefore not surprising if a good part of the first real games that accompany the peripheral are mainly intended for families, with sports titles, collections of mini-games and pet-games. While it's basically a rail shooter, The Shoot doesn't make too much of a difference either. So forget the missions against terrorists and the deadly firefights seen in Time Crisis, but above all forget the frenetic and incessant sessions, in which an instant of hesitation can cost the outcome of the entire game. The Shoot is a casual shooter, decidedly permissive and which starts with all the good intentions of letting both adults and children play it with pleasure: despite the few pretensions and the casual nature of their game, the developers therefore had the arduous task of making it simple but never boring at the same time. Good first! The Shoot starts from an original and rather amusing premise: the player takes on the role of an action film actor during the filming of a film production, thus passing from the set of a western film to that of a science fiction work, from the scene of a gangster shootout horror film. All of this, under the watchful and severe direction of the chubby director. As in a traditional rail shooter, the aim will be to take out the enemies that appear on the screen before they can attack you or run away: during the filming of the western film, for example, you will be attacked by groups of brigands and outlaws, the which civilians will sometimes use as cover. There are also some nice ideas, such as the clashes in which the Move is asked to be placed on one's side and then extracted and fired before the opponent. Stuff from Clint Eastwood, in short. By eliminating your opponents one after the other, you then fill up three indicators which, once full, allow you to perform a particular special move. These are aids in battle that can be activated by performing particular movements with the controller, but the idea that the weakest technique, and therefore the one obtained most frequently, forces the player to perform a pirouette on himself turns up his nose. In addition to being uncomfortable, turning around for an instant means taking your eyes off the action, with the risk of finding a bullet right between the eyes. After the first and second time you can rest assured that you will easily do without that technique. Control via Move is perfect, fast and precise, and sometimes you have to physically move left or right to avoid incoming shots. Although this last detail adds a little spice to the action, the game remains rather simple: the only way to lose a game is in fact to infuriate the director, taking too many hits or exterminating civilians on the set. An indicator in the upper right clearly shows his mood, while his shrill and annoying voice, constantly scolding or praising the player, becomes really unbearable in the long run. Also, making the director lose his temper doesn't carry a huge penalty, since you have five Takes available before having to restart the level from the beginning. The Shoot is a simple and unpretentious game, but despite everything it manages to be quite fun too. The lack of a plot that acts as a leitmotif does not weigh that much, and moving from one film set to another in the end is also quite pleasant: before you get tired of the western setting you end up immediately projected into a futuristic world overrun by killer robots. The Move is precise and fun to use, with some original and decidedly successful ideas, although we were puzzled by how to activate some special attacks. The five attempts available, combined with the rather low level of difficulty, allow you to finish the game without ever seeing the Game Over screen, but in reality it doesn't matter, because to have fun with friends or pass the time without necessarily applying yourself, The Shoot it's absolutely perfect.", "date": "2010-11-16", "grade": null}
