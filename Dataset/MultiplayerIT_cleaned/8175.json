It is by no means easy to be at the forefront of the launch of a new Nintendo console, taking responsibility for creating one of the flagship titles in the line-up, even included in a premium bundle. Because usually those who buy a Nintendo console do it for first party games, for Mario, and certainly not for a zombie-based survival horror. Yet never as in this case, with Wii U, has the Kyoto multinational needed to demonstrate that home-grown heroes can and must coexist with those created by valuable partners, so that these are able to find a stimulating and attractive to build on. And so Ubisoft made that pact, signed on stage at E3 2011, and put its Montpellier team to work on a game that could make it clear that the Wii U would not only be the home of plumbers, princesses, elves and little monsters, but also of undead to be killed one after the other. If all this manages to convince users and publishers, if the pieces of the puzzle fit together, it could be the beginning of a new era for Nintendo; and in that case, it will also have been thanks to ZombiU. They come out of the fucking walls Ubisoft was very clear that a launch game for Wii U shouldn't simply be a good product in itself, but also and above all a convincing vehicle of the GamePad's capabilities; in fact, it is with these very first titles that Nintendo will have to make skeptics and undecided people understand that yes, there is life after the Wiimote, and that this passes through a controller with a large touch screen in the middle. And above all, that with the GamePad you can do things that cannot be replicated on other consoles. ZombiU is a survival horror; a genre that has known enormous popularity thanks to that Resident Evil of 1996, but which has experienced a too uncertain evolution that has decreed an inevitable crisis from which it has never really been able to get out. The Ubisoft version maintains the common denominator that has linked most of the productions belonging to this vein, or zombies; what in Capcom's pioneer was Raccoon City in this case is instead London, the scene of an epidemic that has transformed most of its inhabitants into terrible undead. Yet in ZombiU there is no unstoppable ex-cop trying to fix things, in fact there is not even a protagonist to put on the cover. The character controlled by the player has a first and last name, a gender and a profession, but here ends what is known about it. Because the hero of ZombiU is simply one of the few human survivors still alive, and does not bring with it any characterizing or unique element, except for the not too well-groomed aesthetic aspect. There isn't even a particularly developed story, actually it's little more than a sketch that acts as a glue (often insufficient) for the various missions; the synthetic background is in fact limited to showing a London invaded by zombies and introducing the voice of Prepper, a mysterious character who represents a sort of puppeteer of the actions of the survivor on duty. He tells what to do, and the player must perform, willy-nilly. Most of the time it is a question of reaching specific places in the vicinity of the safe haven from which each game begins, perhaps collecting some key objects. In the basic structure therefore, ZombiU is neither an original nor a particularly refined title. But the substantial difference is made by a courageous game design choice, which brings Ubisoft production closer to one of the most recent fetishes of hard and pure hardcore gamers, or Demon's Souls; we are referring to the fact that death, in ZombiU, is not a simple mishap to be resolved with a game over and reloading the previous save, but a permanent element. When a character is dead, they are forever; or rather, he too becomes an undead. Every time you are defeated, you therefore find yourself switching into the shoes of a new survivor by starting from inside the aforementioned refuge; and just returning to the place of the previous crime (perhaps even having to retrace quite a bit of the way, despite the shortcuts) the previous character will be found, now zombies, ready to be killed to recover the precious objects kept in his backpack. This is a fundamental step, because the effort of the Montpellier team is an extraordinarily stingy game of resources; don't think you can go quietly around streets and buildings and spit bullets at everything that moves, because it would be a strategy destined to end very badly. Every magazine collected, every handful of bullets found, every Molotov cocktail or thereaboutsbaria collected becomes a sort of treasure, a contribution destined to increase the slim chances of survival by a small percentage. ~They~ are dozens, hundreds, and the hope of making it is supported only by desperation. To examine the contents of drawers, wardrobes or to rummage through corpses, the programmers have opted for an interesting use of the GamePad; in fact, the found objects are displayed on the controller screen, possibly transferable to your backpack by simply swiping your fingers. A pleasant solution above all because it doesn't pause the game, thus lending the side to a surprise attack if you haven't paid enough attention. In parallel, the GamePad can also be used to examine the environments via a scanner by simply holding down the L key and looking around via the gyroscope; this function allows both to highlight the resources scattered around, and to interact with elements such as electronic doors to unlock, electrical panels to activate or things like that. During the rest of the time however, the secondary monitor offers a very useful map of the play area together with a radar which, as Alien teaches, is often more a source of anguish than real relief and help. Finally, other applications of the GamePad are linked to impromptu interactions with particular elements, which in most cases result in the need to tap on the touch screen (to move a manhole cover, remove the boards blocking a door, extract the pathogen from a corpse and so on, a little more instead to pick the locks with the lock pick). The search for objects from the bodies or in the settings therefore constitutes the backbone of the adventure, which from time to time goes alongside the precise objective of the mission in progress. In this sense ZombiU offers a very linear progression, which leaves no room for any type of choice on the part of the player: the sequence of objectives and areas to visit is pre-established and rigidly determined without the possibility of diversions. The lightheartedness of the undead ZombiU is a distressing and often frustrating experience; a couple of zombies are enough to represent a serious threat to the life of your character and by suffering a well-aimed blow you must say goodbye to a good part of the energy available. Every open door or every turned corner can become the place of death of the survivor in the space of a few moments. In the event that this happens, the price to pay is not only to have to repeat all the way up to that point with a new hero, but also the loss of all the stat improvements obtained previously. A severe treatment, but which constitutes an important piece of the puzzle studied by the French game designers. At this point we would like to continue with an enthusiastic description of Ubisoft production, yet a series of important defects preclude ZombiU from obtaining a more flattering vote. The most serious is certainly linked to the critical points of the combat system, which would have deserved greater attention given its specific weight within the game economy. With the poverty of weapons and ammunition described above, most of the clashes are destined to be faced with the cricket bat which represents the standard starting equipment of every survivor. Precisely the woodiness of these sequences and the repetitiveness of the only type of shot available, however, make the clashes very unfunny, devoid of surprises, as well as not very ~modern~ by the standards expected of a late 2012 video game. limited variety of movements and attack techniques of the zombies, which basically all act in the same way with very rare exceptions, it is evident that the fights represent a phase as frequent as ultimately not very stimulating. If the goal was then to propose a ~realistic~ key (as much as a zombie invasion can be defined as such), it is a pity that the stealth element has only been touched upon; in fact, the cases in which the level design actually forces you to collide with the undead are very frequent, even when circumvention maneuvers would be possible and preferable. The other big weak point of ZombiU is certainly related to the technical component. By now we have very clear what goes into the Wii U hardware, and it is certain that the capabilities of the new Nintendo console are roughly comparable or slightly superior to those of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Although Ubisoft's survival horror can enjoy the extenuating tied to the limitations of the first generation of titles on a new platform, Zombi U suffersand a graphic weakness that is often difficult to digest, with a final result certainly not comparable to that of high-level productions for Sony and Microsoft home consoles. Above all in the textures, effects and polygonal models, evident limits are perceived, and the interpenetration of polygons is the order of the day. The very little interactivity with the environments then takes you back a few years; furniture doesn't get dented, glass or vases don't shatter, curtains don't catch fire even if hit by a Molotov cocktail. Finally, the artistic value, good but certainly not extraordinary, does not help to improve a final result from this point of view that is certainly disappointing. The local multiplayer mode deserves a mention, with times and rhythms of play completely different from the main adventure; in this case the carnage is much more ~ignorant~ and less refined, especially for those who face the arenas wielding wiimotes and nunchucks, while the ~King of the Zombies~ with the GamePad manages and positions the enemies in the level. A pleasant parenthesis but nothing more, which we doubt will be able to divert a lot of time from the more rewarding story mode. Finally, let's mention the adaptation in Italian, very well done both for texts and speech, as per Ubisoft tradition; And yes, the bonus mini-game that allows you to 'zombify' your face via the GamePad camera is there in all its glory, to the delight of those eager to emulate that prankster Reggie Fils-Aime.", "date": "2012-11-19", "grade": "8.0"}
