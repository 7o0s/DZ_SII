Four years later, High Voltage Software has decided to return to the scene of the crime, and with the support of War Drum Studios (already behind the scenes of the excellent iOS conversion of GTA: Vice City) gives new life to its title with a 'exclusive Android version for Tegra 3 devices. Blood from the wall The Conduit HD puts the user in the role of special agent Ford, initially tasked with recovering a high-tech device from the hands of a terrorist organization but who soon finds himself embroiled in a mess of government conspiracies and alien invasions. As it is easy to understand, the shaky plot of the original title has been fully maintained in this new incarnation for Android, as well as the questionable stylistic feature that characterizes its design, with a protagonist that cannot be more anonymous and enemies and weapons that do not reveal not even a shred of personality. In some ways already dated at the time of its release on the Wii, the High Voltage Studios title has certainly not improved with age, even if a good use of the Tegra 3 chip helps to resolve the situation at least from a purely technical point of view . On the Nexus 7 that we used for the test, The Conduit HD runs really well, with an always stable frame rate and a graphics system that is undoubtedly remarkable by mobile gaming standards, despite some too many ugliness in terms of texture quality and presence of aliasing. From this point of view, the War Drum Studios team gives a new confirmation of their skills in managing important graphics engines, and they certainly cannot be blamed for the quality of the starting material. Where instead the developers had their hands free, the results were much clearer, starting with the adaptation of the controls to the touchscreen. In a very smart move, the possibility of jumping has been eliminated altogether, adding ramps in areas where in the original version it was necessary to make a leap. Continuing in a process aimed at removing as many virtual keys as possible from the screen, grenades are launched with a double tap, the weapon reloads automatically when you pass a few seconds of inactivity, and even the act of firing itself it is entrusted by default to the CPU: with this setting, therefore, the software takes care of shooting enemies when they are in the viewfinder, giving an additional hand to less experienced or simply more lazy users. The wide possibilities for customizing the controls still allow you to have a classic button to shoot, to activate or not the aim assist and more: unfortunately, there is no option to change the position of the sticks and virtual keys, an absence that is especially felt as regards the command deputy to activate the viewfinder zoom, inexplicably placed in the farthest corner of the screen compared to the other inputs. Again, the responsiveness of the controls seemed to us far from optimal, an element which fortunately does not affect the gameplay too much since lightning-fast movements are almost never required. Completely emptied of the multiplayer mode (present instead in the original for Wii), The Conduit HD entrusts all the weight of its longevity to the solo campaign, indeed not getting the hoped-for support: the nine missions into which the story is divided don't take much effort to long - also thanks to a really poor artificial intelligence of the enemies - also confirming the dubious stylistic qualities of the product also for what concerns the level design. Substantially devoid of high notes and with several moments more tedious than necessary, The Conduit HD has at least fully guessed the way to offer itself to the public: by downloading the application for free from Google Play, you have the possibility to freely play the first two missions, after of which the software requires payment to unlock the next three levels or to make the complete package available. Also noteworthy is the presence in the main menu of a shop in which to buy (always with real money) a whole series of tricks to make the game even easier than it already is.", "date": "2013-03-26", "grade": "7.2"}
