At first glance it doesn't seem like a good situation, since in the strategic organization of the market it means that the publisher has no intention of investing in the series, because this may present risks or in any case it is not considered profitable enough. However, there may also be a positive reading of the situation, which on the contrary could be dictated simply by the desire to re-found a series and build a valid basis for relaunching a game that otherwise risks deteriorating. After a thorough test, we can safely lean towards the second hypothesis: SSX is back in full form not only as a simple update according to the new technological potential offered by the current platforms of the successful brand that it was up to 7 years ago (without considering the Blur chapter ), but as a substantial evolution of the game from all points of view, from the graphics to the gameplay up to the contents and their organization. It is probable that the turn towards realism and the darker tone shown at the first appearance of the game in 2010, although later retracted and partially returned to the canonical exaggerated representation of snowboarding, eventually served to compensate for the even excessive lightness of the old chapters, completing a structure that is now even more solid. Let's be clear: in most cases it is always a question of stringing together tricks and combos until reaching stratospheric scores at the end of the descent, but by integrating this light soul with speed races, the actual differences in the challenges posed by different environments and conditions weather forecasts and the exciting ~death challenges~ you get a much more complex and varied experience package. SSX extension The story makes little sense, but it is certainly not a fundamental element. In the single player campaign we find ourselves interpreting one after the other the various members of the chosen group SSX (which in this chapter stands for ~Snowboard, Skating and Motocross~, as it is made up of champions of extreme disciplines) within the various locations around the world in pursuit of series veteran, now ~renegade~, Griff Simmons. In short, a pretext to embark on the most extreme challenges within 9 different glacial settings scattered across 5 continents, which include the Himalayas, the Rocky Mountains, Siberia, the Alps, Patagonia and other mountain landscapes, which in turn contain various routes arranged over several mountains and each characterized by specific difficulties that manifest themselves with particular danger within the survival challenges. The types of races can be summarized in three strands: ~Trick It~, or the challenge with tricks and combos, in which whoever manages to score the most points wins, ~Race It~, the race to see who finishes first finish line and ~Survive It~, where the important thing is to arrive alive at the bottom of the slope, trying to survive the obstacles and extreme weather and environmental conditions. Each track allows the player a certain degree of freedom as regards the choice of routes to follow and tricks to perform, the direction is clearly channeled within a mountain sector but in any case the choices are wide and such as to make the same route can be easily followed on several occasions, in any case obtaining different experiences. A particular introduction of this chapter is the assistance of the helicopter, which as happened previously is used as a means of transport from one mountain to another but in addition continues to follow the descent of the snowboarder dispensing advice and signals on the track, illuminating the route in night descents and, in certain areas, offering the possibility of highly spectacular tricks, acting as a flying grip for extreme aerial tricks. Curiosity An element that contributes to fluidizing the game action is the introduction of the possibility of ~rewinding time~, with which we can easily remedy the grossest mistakes by rewinding to the desired point at any time and thus canceling the more disastrous falls. The system is extremely convenient and allows you to avoid excessive fragmentation of matches, but two consequences must be taken into account: rewinding does not stop the clock or the opponents' race, and is available in limited quantities. It's tricky! The soul of SSX is the trick and even this chapter, despite conceding something to other interpretations of snowboarding, is essentially focused on the exexecution of as spectacular numbers as possible, trying to ring a continuous series of combos all along the descent from the mountain, combining aerial moments, grinds on any protruding surface and combining everything with continuous ~ground~ connection maneuvers so as not to block the multiplier . If you manage to obtain a fairly continuous progression, the ~tricky~ mode is activated during which - accompanied by the legendary It's Tricky by Run DMC - we can activate special characteristic maneuvers for each character, capable of greatly increasing the score, possibly without ever stopping the combo. It is a mechanic that is obviously more valid for the ~Trick it~ sessions than in the other two, but which nevertheless proves to be persistent in all game modes, considering that turbo and consequent speed substantially depend on the amount of stunts performed. This obviously determines a general prevalence of the trick and consequent more or less ferocious tinkering on the pad compared to a more technical and reflective attitude, also considering that the game allows a good margin of error to the player in terms of angle and landing position following a jump. In short, those looking for a realistic approach will probably find Stoked's setting more congenial, but there is no doubt that SSX is able to guarantee entertainment for a decidedly wider audience, presenting itself as a video game with a decidedly higher play rate. Even the new command layout, which delegates the main movements and grabs to the analogs, entrusting the other tweak keys and various modifiers, goes on the road to greater intuitiveness of the commands, which, while requiring a few games to be assimilated, still guarantee greater immersion versus relying entirely on long combos on the front keys. An introduction of no less importance is then that of the support accessories, required in particular during Lethal Descents and capable of substantially modifying the snowboarder's performance by increasing their resistance (protections), ability to move on the ice (ice axes), ability to breathe at high heights (cylinders) and more. The funniest and most spectacular is undoubtedly the winged suit, which at the simple push of a button allows you to extract a pair of small retractable wings that allow you to glide following a jump and control the character for a few seconds like a sort of airplane with short nose-ups and dives. Mountains of possibilities The first screen of SSX places us in front of a navigable globe, from which we can access the different geographical areas, each made up of a certain number of mountains which are in turn divided into different tracks. There are three fundamental game modes: the World Tour to be carried out in single, which presents a certain narrative progression between the events leading to discovering the various tracks one after the other and unlocking all the characters until the showdown with Griff. With ~Explore~ we can experiment independently and freely with the various tests, while the ~Global Events~ represent the particular interpretation of multiplayer in SSX. There is no direct, canonical multiplayer here, with matchmaking, lobbies and traditional features, but timed events that can be organized by EA and open to all, with rankings drawn up on a worldwide basis, or created by the users themselves as open or closed games , so you can recreate the classic multiplayer between friends if you want. In any case, there is no direct confrontation within the descent: the battle is carried out based on scores and times at the end of each session, with the possibility of seeing some ~ghosts~ who leave traces of other people's performances. The feeling of challenge typical of classic multiplayer is somewhat missing, but on the other hand we are witnessing in this way a continuous activity in the background that keeps us continuously connected with the world, always having the possibility of entering a game in progress, establishing a time or a score and then see, at the end of the event, the reward for our performance as in a sort of MMO with a persistent online world. The ~globalizing~ sensation is also underlined by the presence of the ~RiderNet~ system, which represents the specific interpretation of the AutoLog principle used by EA in racing, constituting a specific player account which keeps track of current and past actions and results obtained by users, complete with medals and specific objectives to create a real identity of the player in the particular world of SSX. Also note the importance of customization and the evolution of riders: the purchase andselection of the equipment between boards and accessories (with the further possibility of applying special performance modifiers within special slots) through the spending of the credits won in the race must be done carefully based on the type of event in which we participate ( more prone to tricks, speed or resistance), with the need to apply special equipment if required (particularly within survival challenges) and progressive levels of experience of the characters which lead to ever more performing equipment. Xbox 360 goals 50 unlockable achievements for 1000 points make up SSX's rich loot for gamerpoint hunters, with a wide and balanced distribution of achievements among the various game modes around the globe. Integrated into the specific RiderNet awards and medals system, achievements are collected with a certain regularity by advancing in the game and then reaching ever higher performances. The system of objectives and various medals manages to reward the efforts of players who love collecting in this sense. Defy Reality The excellent audio-visual sector completes the positive picture traced by the structural and content evolution of SSX. There is very little to complain about in this respect, however taking into account the particular vision outlined by EA Canada of this sport. The exaggerated interpretation, pushed to the extreme, is also reflected in the representation of the settings and of the riders themselves among bright colours, light trails and panoramas which, although based on the real profiles of the mountains, condense natural and architectural elements which certainly tend more towards spectacularization and the creation of a snowboard-friendly world than the realistic reproduction of mountain scenarios. In short, the spirit is not really that of replicating the experience of a descent on unexplored ridges in a realistic way and this is also reflected - something common to the other chapters of the series - in the scarce differences in ~feeling~ of the different types of snow under the table. We need to think in another way: SSX is a continuous exaltation of speed and tricks, which influence each other. Grinding on the wreckage of crashed planes, fragments of the Great Wall of China, kilometric pipelines and tree trunks positioned ad hoc, running in the absence of oxygen, fleeing an avalanche and climbing over deadly crevasses by opening the winged suit are sensations that can hardly leave even the more serious gamers. Also noteworthy are the particle effects, the lighting and the rendering of the different atmospheric conditions, capable of staging decidedly different situations. From a point of view of this kind, the physics and the performance of the behavior of the board on the different surfaces obviously take a back seat, although it is always important to try to impact the snow with the right timing and an acceptable angle in order not to run into a fall . Also great choices when it comes to the soundtrack, containing 37 tracks that range from electro to hip hop to pop rock, with an eclectic repertoire that associates well with the game action, although it is possible to completely modify the OST inserting songs of your choice.", "date": "2012-02-28", "grade": "9.0"}
