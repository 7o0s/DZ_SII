Indie developer Marten Bruggemann has set his first game for iOS devices in a post-apocalyptic world, where even the smallest corner of the earth has been submerged under water, and the oceans are now populated by dangerous creatures marine. Like the Pixar hero, the game's protagonist is the last robot left on the planet, who found himself living on a surfboard so as not to fall into the water. This, at least, is the result of a tentative attempt to accompany the incredibly simple mechanics of what could be a new and small hit for the iPhone and iPod Touch with a hint of plot. The lonely droid Like the better-known Tiny Wings, Robo Surf is a side-scrolling arcade consisting of a single level in which, technically, you could continue indefinitely. However, another couple of obvious similarities can be seen between the two games, starting with the gameplay, based on the repeated pressure of a finger on the screen and the oscillatory movement of one's alter-ego. The wave you are riding can be enlarged or decreased respectively by touching or releasing the screen, in a continuous up and down that allows you to continuously alter your height. The smartest readers will have already figured out where the game is headed: the aim is in fact to avoid the continuous obstacles that appear in front of you, trying to cover as much road as possible before being thrown from the board. Between plump seagulls and obnoxious bats, continuing along the path will become increasingly difficult, finding yourself quickly tapping on the screen to accurately pass through narrow tunnels of enemies. Robo Surf does not miss even small battles with bosses, who appear on a regular basis and will try in every way to annoy the player: there is, for example, a huge gray shark who performs in very high jumps out of the water; there is a puffer fish, which takes up a good portion of the screen when it swells; or there's an octopus that sprays clouds of ink and then swoops straight at the hapless robot. The fastest way to eliminate them is to use the only attack available to us, consisting of a sudden and prolonged forward dash. To use it you need to collect the oil barrels scattered around, but activating it means, for a limited period of time, increasing your speed, being invulnerable and eliminating all enemies in your way. The lack of variety and the excessive simplicity of the mechanics would give the idea of a trivial and simpleton game, but the numerous missions to be tackled represent an excellent incentive not to give it up after a few minutes. Added to this are options and unlockable characters taken from Blueberry Garden and Iji, two other titles well known to those who follow the indie scene, while the mode called 10 Waves wants to offer a small and more complex alternative. This option works exactly like the main one, with the only substantial difference that the player has ten touches on the screen available. The aim is therefore to use them wisely and try to go as far as possible before they are finished, but it is clear that in this case luck counts more than the skill of the player, since the position of the enemies and the oil barrels , different for each game, inevitably ends up influencing the player's actions. A further parallel with the aforementioned Tiny Wings can be made with regard to the audiovisual realization, given that, like Andreas Illiger's hit, Robo Surf is strengthened by an original and extremely pleasant graphic style, with flat colors and fantastic backdrops, where the 'great chiptune music made by dr. fot, despite being repeated over and over again, will hardly get bored.
