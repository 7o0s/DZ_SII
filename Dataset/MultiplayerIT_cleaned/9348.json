The eccentric creator, Will Wright, together with the EA label, has over the years perfected, improved and deepened the gameplay and cosmetics of his most famous title, up to its latest incarnation that exploits the three-dimensionality of the new release of home Nintendo: the 3DS. Sims, as the word itself suggests, is a life simulator in which you take on the role of a digital alter-ego and guide it through a path in which it grows, experiences, reproduces and maybe even dies. What made the series famous is the multitude of possibilities related to personalizing your Sim (clothing, aesthetics, lifestyles), the possibility of furnishing the house in thousands of different ways and the incisiveness of our decisions and the related consequences in life experiences (work, love, social relationships). An extremely complex game therefore, difficult to play on a portable console like Nintendo 3DS. So can this version live up to its PC counterpart? We doubt it. New ways to interact There would be all the premises for creating the definitive chapter: touch screen, gyroscope, double screen, online streetpass, high-performance portable hardware, the possibility of downloading updates or expansions from the internet. What did Electronic Arts do with all these cards on the table? Half a mess. All the possibilities offered by 3DS have been exploited with the minimum wage required. The gameplay of the series, then represented by the wide range of possibilities offered to the user, has been extremely cut and reduced to meet the memory limitations of the cards: it is possible to create only one Sim per household, thus making us give up the possibility of manage ~extended families~ to which the PC counterpart has accustomed us for years. Many, many things are missing. For example, even the dialable phone numbers have been reduced to those of friends, firemen and police, eliminating everything else. The world itself placed before the eyes of the Sims is extremely small: in our city it can only be visited in the Industrial Center and Union Park, a shopping center and a park, while the exploration of other cities is limited to a few steps in some locations very restricted. The feeling of being confined to a very small world is really very strong, and in doing so the very essence of the ~Sims~ is lost. Cuts have been made in every aspect of the game. The interesting introduction of the ~Karma~ of the character already appreciated in the versions on home consoles is proposed here in a portable format: basically we are granted actions to punish or reward our Sim in all those situations where our intervention is needed ~divine~. A good deed must necessarily be encouraged, while bad ones must be mercilessly punished. The 3DS version, however, gives us only three options to intervene: the earthquake (activated by shaking the console, all thanks to the internal gyroscope), electric shocks (telepathy test style in Ghostbusters) and butterflies (!?! ) which can be cast by blowing on the 3DS's center microphone. One of the nicest elements is the one that allows us to take advantage of the internal camera to create a digital transposition of our face, to then be used in the creation of our Sim. A feature that is already appreciated in many other games for consoles equipped with a webcam. Another interesting feature is the one that allows us to ~import~ other players' Sims found in the air via the Street-Pass, as long as you play with this feature turned on. Although the core of the gameplay has essentially remained untouched by the portable transposition, it is precisely the amount of objects, options, locations, possibilities and relationships that is too limited for a real life ~simulation~ experience. What makes The Sims fascinating has always been the element of unpredictability of the situations we can get ourselves into: a pan that catches fire, a water pipe that breaks, or an alien spacecraft that kidnaps us. Even these random events seem decidedly rarer and more difficult to ~make happen~ in the portable transposition. 3D effect The 3D effect of the Nintendo console is exploited at minimum wage. The game screens have such a limited and close-up background that they renderThe three-dimensional effect was almost useless, as Sims 3 certainly does not enjoy a wide and distant visual horizon. The characters, very small and ~thin~, are also not inclined to stereoscopic visualization, making this interesting feature decidedly superfluous for how the game is structured. In a very limited world One of the qualities of The Sims 3 is that it is extremely enjoyable even for very short game sessions, potentially making it a very interesting title even on a portable console. This sort of human ~Nintendogs~ is well proposed on 3DS because through the portability of the machine we can ~peek~ and check how our digital alter-ego moves or lives. It is precisely for this poorly exploited possibility that the bad taste for Sims 3 for 3DS is even more difficult to swallow: a complete title like the one appreciated on PC, albeit with an infinitely less detailed graphic detail, would simply be a dream. However, the developers have not only cut as much as they can on the contents, but have not even managed to manage hardware like the Nintendo one, capable of much more. The three-dimensionality is almost irrelevant and inserted in a context of absolute poverty of polygons, dull textures and the absence of any sort of special effect. Even the game HUD is much poorer than the original, and the status bars of our Sim's various needs have even been removed, basically the fundamental feature of the game through which we can realize how hungry we are, how angry we are, tired, in love and so on, forcing us to ~understand~ it only once we have reached the tolerance limit indicated by a small pop-up on the screen. This factor makes events and any ability to plan in the long term much less predictable: the game interface structured in this way takes away a lot from the general gaming experience, making the game even quite boring, beyond what it already was due to the already mentioned reduction in content. Ultimately, we are facing a missed opportunity for Electronic Arts and the Sims saga itself.", "date": "2011-04-15", "grade": "4.5"}
