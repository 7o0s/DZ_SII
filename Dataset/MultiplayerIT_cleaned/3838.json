Unfortunately, Alien: Isolation did not achieve the sales success it deserved, which is why a sequel was rather unlikely. That's why the hopes regarding the first rumors about Alien: Blackout gave way to disappointment for many when it was discovered that it would be a mobile title. Although D3 Go! is far from the production values and quality level of SEGA production, it would be wrong not to give it a chance. Gameplay and aliens Alien: Blackout in the first place is a title that has the awareness of its own limits and those of the platform. For this reason, a mechanic similar to the touch control system was chosen, which unquestionably recalls that of Five Nights at Freddy's, a title that has experienced a period of great popularity also thanks to the push of some Youtubers. The protagonist is Amanda Ripley, daughter of the heroine Ellen, and the setting is that of the decadent Weyland-Yutani space station from which she tries to escape with the help of a scarce crew. The problem is that together with the group of humans there is also a xenomorph, who as usual doesn't exactly have peaceful intentions. These premises act as a background for the gameplay formula, which essentially can be traced back to the category of a management puzzle. The player obviously takes on the role of Amanda, hidden among the ventilation ducts of the station from where, with a portable device, she is able to hack the control system. Without any possibility of movement, all the girl can do is manage the opening and closing of the various doors, check the movement sensors placed in the different rooms and give orders to the other members of the group. In fact, each of the 7 levels available offers different objectives, which in all cases result in the need to send a character to a specific room to interact with this or that other object. Being stranded in her shelter, Amanda cannot directly observe the action, instead relying solely on surveillance cameras positioned around the station. Using these few tools, the player must therefore try to complete the missions while preventing the alien from having a snack with one of the poor companions, but also with Amanda herself: in fact, the creature can move rapidly both in the various rooms and corridors and, like someone he knows the movies he knows well, inside the ventilation ducts. This translates into the need to keep your ears taut - and in fact the use of headphones is recommended - because if you were to hear the sound of approaching footsteps, you would immediately need to take your eyes off the control panel to close the door of your shelter . A management therefore that soon becomes quite complex and multifaceted, with the added aggravating circumstance of the limited time available to complete the individual missions and above all of the limited energy available to the space station: this means in practice that you can only have of a certain amount of energy to be distributed on the various systems, which cannot be ~turned on~ all together. It is therefore necessary to decide which doors to close and which motion sensors to keep on, activating and deactivating them continuously in order to redistribute energy. Longevity and technique The progression in Alien: Blackout is therefore revealed in the first few bars to be pleasant, demanding albeit frustrating at times, above all due to the paucity of artificial intelligence of one's companions. Unfortunately, an evident repetitiveness soon manifests itself, since the mechanics never really evolve or develop beyond what is offered in the very early stages. A real shame, because it would have taken little to make everything more interesting. Furthermore, the slowness of the movement of the companions and the impossibility of skipping the dialogues is particularly cloying when you find yourself having to start the level from the beginning in case of death, given the absence of check points. On the other hand, the reduced longevity leads to reaching the conclusion of the seven levels soon, without there being real incentives to repeat the adventure. This cwhat remains is therefore the original atmosphere, well replicated all in all, and an overall pleasant graphic component, except for the really wooden and simplistic animations. Above all, the settings perfectly convey the ~feeling~ of Alien, between claustrophobic corridors and semi-dark rooms. The audio component is very good. Worth noting is the total absence of any advertising or additional in-app purchase in addition to the initial one.", "date": "2019-02-03", "grade": "7.0"}
