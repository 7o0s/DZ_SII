Lovers of rock or, more in general, of beautiful music played, found themselves a little sidelined, if it weren't for the attempt made by Ubisoft with Rocksmith, a very interesting software set up by a team of not even thirty people. which allowed you to pick up a real guitar and bass and try to learn to play or perfect them. After a somewhat problematic debut, especially for the PC edition, this year Rocksmith 2014 Edition arrives which is not a sequel but a re-edition of what was a practical method of techniques for guitar and bass. No revolution, let's say it right away, but a series of so many small and big additions that make it a really good way to start playing an instrument or to refine your technique with a nice set of songs. Rocksmith 2014 Edition is the refinement of a brilliant idea and a good help to start playing Xbox 360 goals Rocksmith 2014 Edition's 1000 points are tailored on the idea of a real method that you will spend dozens of hours with. Ergo, to get consistent loot, time and patience are all you'll need. From the basics Where last year a miserable leaflet suggested connecting your console using analog connections - at least for audio - to avoid excessive delays, this time a screen warns any player, as soon as the software is launched, that that is the best way to use Rocksmith 2014 Edition. Ubisoft has also worked on the delay of digital connections, but it is good to warn that with a TV that is too slow, connected via HDMI, you could find yourself with an audio delay that makes the experience unplayable, precisely for the educational purposes that Rocksmith sets itself. You can't learn an instrument if you can't get in time. We have tried the game on an LG of about four years ago, which has never been a bolt of war, and on a recent low-end Samsung, managing to have no problem with the second, while in the first, also due to than an HDMI switch, the experience was borderline tolerable. Even having a component cable available, you can rest assured that, like last year, Rocksmith will be easily usable on any TV. The game no longer has a sort of career to go through, but all the songs are freely playable and made available there to those who play as a lead, rhythm or bass guitarist. By progressing in the improvement of the execution of the songs, frills for virtual guitars, effects and venues for concerts are unlocked, but in the end and as it should be, the real prize is realizing that you are constantly improving in your techniques. A point to be clarified is that Rocksmith can be considered almost exclusively a method of techniques, given that musical theory is little more than hinted at and that sooner or later one has to try his hand at scores and staves, but a very handy chord manual (tens) which shows in a few clicks the position to hold to play one of them. Great work has also been done for the actual techniques with over 50 lessons accompanied by videos and exercise pieces that can be slowed down, accelerated and for which the same discussion applies as regards the riff repeater, i.e. the selector of difficulty which is another excellent innovation. In short, considering that there are dedicated tutorials up to two-handed tapping, slap and multi-level Jazz chords, it is clear that Rocksmith is finally a great way to start playing or to improve, always bearing in mind that any musical group there outside he reasons for notes and printouts and not for colored dots that scroll on a screen. How do you want me The software behind the game is able to ~perceive~ who is playing and to progressively adapt the difficulty of the piece to the more skilled the musician is, adding notes to the score in real time. However, this led to a series of problems both for beginners and for those who were experts, given that in the previous edition one could do nothing but adapt to what was proposed. This time, each song and pause menu is divided into sections, each of which is adjustable for speed or difficulty of playing. The interesting thing is that the variations in the score to be played are shown in real time every time you change the difficulty and therefore you can choose exactly the level at which you feel you can perform a piece. In addition to this, before and after each piecezo, the game listens to us and, having detected the player's gaps with respect to the techniques necessary for the piece or with respect to the chords that it is necessary to know how to play, it recommends exercises, chords to learn with the handbook or mini-games in which to try your hand at being able to improve your execution . Just the mini-games, there are eleven of them and all of them are very accurate from a graphic point of view, they are one of the best inventions of this edition because they are relegated to the exercises for some very important techniques of each instrument between jumping from one rope to another without look at the neck and play along the notes of every single conceivable scale from the minor pentatonic to the doric. In addition to these there are real musical ~arcade~ challenges that require you to achieve certain scores or percentages of mastery on certain songs with preset difficulty and the online rankings are also based on these challenges to compete with your friends. In short, by following Rocksmith's recommendations and a series of missions that are proposed by the game from time to time (reach a certain percentage of mastery in a song, follow a certain lesson, etc.) you are always stimulated to do something new and discover everything what Rocksmith has to offer. This continuous stimulus is important for those who want to learn to play. Ubisoft, as already explained in the previous previews, has also thought of inserting, in addition to the possibility of playing freely by combining effects, amplifiers and pedals at will, a real virtual band, which can include as many as four musicians choosing between bass, drums , keyboards, guitars, synths, percussion and a couple of niceties. A real four-track sequencer that is able to perceive the intensity and rhythm of the player and to follow the indications in terms of scale to play, according to a series of harmonic progressions decided at the table by the developer. This part, although obviously very basic even if extremely fascinating, is certainly an excellent point for beginners even if nothing can replace a small band in a cellar or rehearsal room. Without forgetting that in this edition the lyrics of the songs pass in the upper left part of the screen and that, by attaching a USB microphone, a singer can also join the band. In addition to the many songs from the base game, all previously purchased DLCs can be used for free. The new songs are already present on the store and the prices are perhaps a little high, given that they are around 2.59 per song.", "date": "2013-10-24", "grade": "9.2"}
