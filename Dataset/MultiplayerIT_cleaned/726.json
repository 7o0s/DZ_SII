{"name": "Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance.html", "text": "Path of Radiance As usual, the dozens of missions that make up the playful experience in Fire Emblem are linked by a common thread that materializes in an excellently crafted plot. A key element of the saga has always been the maniacal and excellent characterization of the characters: it was somewhat lacking in the exceptional The Sacred Stones (where the protagonists were really too perfect to be fully appreciated, unlike the unforgettable Eliwood, Hector and Lynn of the prequel or of the historians Roy and Marth already mentioned), in Path of Radiance it is instead an element of extreme importance, around which the plot itself revolves after all. At the center of the story there is in fact a war: the kingdom of Daein invades and practically razes the kingdom of Crimea to the ground, and in this sudden and unmotivated battle a group of mercenaries is involved, and needless to say one of these - as well as son of their commander - it's our protagonist, Ike. Ike's growth is somewhat at the center of the narrative, as at the beginning of the game our hero is only a rookie, an inexperienced and reckless novice soldier, but in the end we will find ourselves taking the part of a valiant leader destined to fight for the salvation of the world. On the other hand, to make a plot that already in itself does not spare many unexpected twists and turns even more interesting, there is also the presence of a strong moral component, given that the greatest threat hanging over the world of this Fire Emblem is in fact racism, as we will find ourselves dealing with two factions: the Beorc on the one hand, or very normal human beings, and the Laguz on the other, so called because of their lycanthropic ability to transform into beasts. With a conflict between two races dictated more by ignorance and prejudice and a handful of heroes who will have to join forces for the common good trampling on hatred for the different, it is clear that the simple reason for war is nothing more than a piece of a much larger and more compelling narrative mosaic. Tradition and Innovation From 16-bit to 32-bit, and now on the GameCube, not much has changed: Fire Emblem still plays the same way, at least initially. Once again the very simple Triangle System is the master, which in relation to weapons and magic works more or less like a sort of Chinese morra, practically managing the strategic heart of the game. Spears defeat swords, swords destroy axes, axes break spears: just remember this simple rule to master the game. The same goes for spells: elemental magics overcome divine ones, divine magic sweeps away the dark one which, in turn, oppresses the magic of the elements. Obviously, the classic exceptions that confirm the rule apply, as in the case of long-range weapons (such as bows) or those enchanted to be more effective even against weapons that, normally, should be stronger. However, this is the essence of Fire Emblem: a very simple Chinese paper that allows for enormous tactical variety, and which thanks to the excellent design of the various missions demonstrates unexpected depth. Added to this are some innovations which, although they do not innovate in a transcendental way a tested mechanic even if a little trite, increase the strategic possibilities of this Path of Radiance, one above all the ~push~ that it is possible to carry out on allied units or enemies adjacent to their own, moving them one square: this, which at first glance seems very trivial, is actually an addition that takes on crucial contours if used with judgment and attention. This is the essence of Fire Emblem: a very simple Chinese paper that allows for enormous tactical variety, and which thanks to the excellent design of the various missions demonstrates unexpected depth. Tradition and Innovation The ~promotions~ system has also undergone some interesting changes: not only can each class now evolve into various types (as in The Sacred Stones), but now at the twentieth level - i.e. the maximum - all units will be automatically promoted, while in the previous episodes it was necessary to use specific objects. Furthermore, precisely this variety of items necessary for promotion has been supplanted by a single object, which once used on a class from level 10 onwards, will allow its evolution: considering that the starting statistics of the new class are based on those of the unit at the time of promotion, it should be considered when it will be appropriate to proceed. In other words: promote now and get a new unit, or wait and work hard to get even more powerful? Another novelty, in a certain sense decidedly more interesting, regardsa i Laguz: some units in the player's small army are in fact able to transform into animal creatures, increasing their capabilities which, in humanoid form, are somewhat reduced. The transformation is temporary, therefore the Laguz must be used wisely, in order not to leave them harmless at the mercy of fierce enemies. This is because, as in the other Fire Emblems, the characteristic ~cross and delight~ of the saga is also proposed in Path of Radiance: a unit lost in combat is lost forever. There are no resurrection spells or Phoenix Downs whatsoever - if a character dies, they die. And the automatic save that logs each turn is always lurking there: it is therefore not possible to save the game when you want, to reload the file before a crisis. If you lose a unit in a mission, your only alternative is to start over. This system drastically encourages the player's strategic skills, forcing him to plan his moves with a granite tactic, perhaps repeating a mission over and over again; but on the other hand some players might find it a frustrating and daunting feature. Lovers of the series may also be used to it by now, but it must be said that this choice of Intelligent System begins to seem more like a method to lengthen the game than a precise choice of game-design. Fire Emblem Cubed The introduction in computer graphics must not deceive the player: unfortunately, very few similar films are seen during the game. We're talking about a sensational quality movie that starts the adventure, and that lets you regret the way it will be narrated later: as in the old episodes for NES and SNES and as in the case of the three chapters for Game Boy Advance, also in Path of Radiance the story is told mainly through the dialogues between the characters. Completely textual, without any actor reciting the lines of the dozens of characters that make up the cast, the plot of Path of Radiance unfolds in excellent English, at times highly sought after and able to further characterize the various characters. This means that some might find it boring to read text after text, accompanied only by the artwork of the characters they are discussing, but c'est la vie. Among other things, the character design is, as always, beautifully Japanese and refined. As for the actual game, the missions take place in completely three-dimensional maps full of details and well built: the spartan settings of the past give way to these new polygonal locations, in which the player's and opposing units move. Also polygonal, the various characters are made up of a good number of polygons, and enjoy a good variety of animations; however, when two units are about to fight the screen changes, and a quick loading projects us onto the battlefield, where the two characters involved will face each other showing excellent animations and a very high attention to detail. Something has actually been lost in the transition from the splendid two-dimensional graphics to this cold 3D, but its spectacularity does not make us regret it. Even the soundtrack does not disappoint: the series has always been synonymous with guarantee from a musical point of view, and Path of Radiance in turn offers a rich variety of soundtracks that accompany the action perfectly, underlining the emotionality of the various sequences. Apart from the lack of the classic main fanfare of the saga (which can actually be glimpsed here and there, but remixed properly) there is not even a drop in tone in the splendid sound sector, made up not only of beautiful orchestral pieces, but also of very well-kept sound effects. Paradoxically, the return of Fire Emblem to the home console coincides with the period of decline of the Game Cube. Not bad, the ingenuity and ability of the Intelligent Systems stands out more than ever in this latest masterpiece, halfway between a strategic and a J-RPG. An exceptional adventure experienced by beautifully characterized characters is the backdrop to a game system that in its simplicity is a small monument to what can be achieved starting from the simplest of ideas. The innovations introduced in this chapter (the Laguz and the thrust, above all) are perhaps not something striking, but they do justice to this cubic version of Fire Emblem, together with an excellent technical realization which, however, perhaps from the point of view graph, could have given a little more. Regret for the absence of speech and for the return of the notorious automatic save, for the rest there is very little to say: a must in the playrooms of fans of the genre. Pros: Narratively sublime Battle System intuitive and profondo Technically excellent Cons: Autosave... Graphically could have done a little more Not too innovative A good 7 years have passed since the release of the last Fire Emblem for living room consoles: after that Thracia 776 for SNES, in fact, it took half a decade before Nintendo decided to produce a new episode of its most famous fantasy saga, and what's more on the Game Boy Advance handheld. With the popularity obtained thanks to the presence in Super Smash Bros. DX of two well-known protagonists of the saga (Roy and Marth), it was even possible to see the last two episodes for Game Boy Advance translated into excellent English, and so in the last two years also Europe was able to get to know one of the most beautiful video game series ever made. It is therefore almost an honor to be able to play a new Fire Emblem from the living room, this time produced for Game Cube: behind it, always the now consecrated skill of Intelligent System, already creator not only of the various Fire Emblems (including the latest Advance versions, or Fire Emblem and Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones) but also of another excellently crafted strategic mini-saga: Advance Wars.", "date": "2005-11-30", "grade": null}
