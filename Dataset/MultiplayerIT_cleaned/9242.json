Years later the game is still waiting but fans do not lose hope and feed on further announcements, rumors, even a trailer until 2009, when economic difficulties force the company to make heavy cuts in personnel and to disband its own group that had to take care of the realization of the new adventure of Duke Nukem. September 2010: surprisingly, the publisher 2K Games and Gearbox Software reveal that they have acquired the license and the materials related to Duke Nukem Forever, determined to complete it. The news was taken as a bit of a joke, moreover after all those years it now seemed impossible that the matter could be resolved with the actual release of the game. And now here he is: the Duke is back and he is the same as always, the years have not affected his character or his muscles. After saving the world from alien invasion, he's also become a star: people cheer him, women want him, kids want to be like him (~take your pills... um, your vitamins, kid, and you'll make it!~), there is an entire museum dedicated to his exploits while films and musicals are produced about his life. An idyllic situation, which is unfortunately ruined by the return of the aliens that the Duke had bludgeoned years earlier. Having reached the Duke-Cave, the hero is scolded by the president of the United States himself, who orders him not to attack the invaders because he is sure he can reach a peaceful agreement with their leader. Besides, they can't launch a pre-emptive strike just because they believe the enemy has weapons of mass destruction, can they? However, the intentions of the aliens turn out to be anything but peaceful and so Duke, having reactivated the energy system of his ~fortress~, activates the cannons against their mothership and destroys it, after which he goes outdoors and cuts one of the monsters to pieces bigger and angrier that have been seen in an FPS for some years now, ending the match with a loud flurry of punches in the lower parts. These are a few sequences, only the beginning of a campaign consisting of twenty-two chapters (which can be completed in about ten hours, perhaps something more), which however give a perfect idea of what we can expect from Duke Nukem Forever. A revolution for the FPS genre? Certainly not. A colossal they worked on continuously for fourteen years? Neither. The ideal Duke Nukem 3D sequel? Exactly. ~Taste my giant ball!~ According to some rumors, Gearbox Software would have taken over a project approximately 70% complete, so we can reasonably assume that most of the ideas present in the game are 3D Realms bag flour. Not that Duke Nukem's raw style is impossible to imitate, mind you, however the title in its entirety paints a picture perfectly in line with the most nostalgic expectations about the character, who spices up his battles with a repertoire of jokes that are sometimes excellent in their vulgarity, and which have been translated in a more than dignified way into Italian, entrusting the Duke's voice to an expert dubber like Marco Balzarotti. The choices concerning the interaction with the scenario are also undoubtedly daughters of Duke Nukem 3D: not only can we go to the bathroom (let's say so), open lockers, eat donuts, activate switches and so on, but these actions have repercussions in direct way on our ego, or on the bar of our vital energy, increasing its capacity. An incentive to look around and touch a bit of everything, perhaps playing a game with the Duke's nice personal pinball machine, but at the same time a double-edged sword that reveals the technical limits of this production, capable of offering a certain spectacularity but which on more than one occasion shows the side of dated solutions, especially when it comes to representing a complex landscape. The environments in which we move are varied and well differentiated, and this is undoubtedly an advantage: we start from the museum dedicated to Duke Nukem and then continue through the streets devastated by the invasion, we make our way into the slimy alien caves but without forgetting a visit to the Duke Burger, climb aboard radio-controlled toy cars and skid through the rubble or deserted canyons in search of remote villages, besieged by cops. And beyond the technical limits we mentioned earlier, beyond the linearity of the paths and the many closed doors that we will find along the way, the level design always remains on good llevels, placing the connotation of the scenarios at the service of the gameplay. ~Armors are for pussies!~ And speaking of gameplay, also from this point of view Duke Nukem Forever resumes and expands some of the concepts introduced with Duke Nukem 3D. The shooter action is in fact interspersed with a large number of puzzles based on the setting, fortunately ~optimized~ platform sections so as not to be too frustrating and explorations in search of air ducts to cross, objects to jump on to reach a platform placed on top and so on. It's nice that the developers insist on certain concepts, also because they prove to be successful right away: Duke can sometimes run into a sort of alien biological device that reduces him to the size of an action figure, and in this form he has to ingenuity to find ways alternatives, taking advantage of boxes, shelves and so on. During the early stages of the game, the miniaturization sees him as the protagonist of an absurd sequence driving a radio-controlled car, while the clash with the normal-sized invaders must be absolutely avoided in these conditions (even if, at a certain point, it will become inevitable face at least one). The driving phases return later, with an entire chapter in which the Duka moves aboard his powerful bigfoot, defeats his enemies by running over them and jumps from one canyon to another using the boost of the vehicle, and then stops whenever fuel runs out. At that point he has to get out of the car, explore the scenario and activate the mechanisms that lead him to retrieve a petrol can. And then, last but not least, there are the firefights, undoubtedly ~old school~ from the point of view of the approach but equally challenging and highly enjoyable. The Duke first makes his way with his bare hands, then gradually his arsenal takes shape: a semi-automatic pistol, a shotgun, a homing rocket launcher, a sniper rifle, a powerful repeating grenade launcher, a coolant cannon and then still the alien weapons among machine guns, lasers, missile launchers, miniaturizing guns and so on. Added to this are two different types of explosives: a proximity mine that explodes on contact and a grenade that we can detonate by remote control, even on the fly. The command scheme is typical of FPS, especially if we use an Xbox 360 controller, and our inputs are received quickly and accurately, making the controls reliable even during the most frenetic and eventful fights. ~Hail the king!~ The bestiary of enemies that we will face in the single player campaign is quite rich, perhaps not in the name of originality (many characters always come from Duke Nukem 3D, or at least the origin of their design is that) but certainly varied : in addition to the cops and their ~berserk~ versions, we have in fact flying aliens capable of teleporting, armored units sometimes equipped with missile launchers, flying octopuses that can throw any object at us, enormous ~trolls~ with devastating power, insidious ~spiders~ that they spit acid and more. However, it will be within the multiplayer modes that we will really find bread for our teeth, with the implementation of jetpacks (which are missing in the story mode), all the weapons described above and ten maps in which to unleash ourselves against our opponents. Four possibilities: classic deathmatch, team deathmatch, king of the hill and capture the flag, the latter with a pupa to represent the object of the dispute, just to reaffirm the spirit of the game. Definitely conventional solutions, therefore, with a maximum player limit unfortunately limited to just eight people: too little to keep up with current productions in terms of online features. Concluding with the technical sector, as per tradition, we can only reiterate what has already been said: from the point of view of the artistic direction and design, Duke Nukem Forever is able to give us a lot of beautiful moments, however the comparison with the most noble is inevitably merciless. In absolute terms, an extraordinary distance is not perceived between the Gearbox Software product and a Battlefield: Bad Company 2 rather than a Call of Duty: Black Ops, especially playing in 1920 x 1080, but just pay attention to the surrounding elements and many details to realize the differences in terms of polygonal models, drawing distance and detail. At least this situation produces a pleasant side effect: on the test configuration, the game runs in Full HD resolution, with all effects maxed out, at sixty frames per second.", "date": "2011-06-14", "grade": "7.7"}
