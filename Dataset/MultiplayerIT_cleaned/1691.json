{"name": "Diablo 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/diablo-2.html", "text": "Presentation I've been racking my brains for quite some time. I wanted to find a catchphrase to start this review. I realized, after dozens of written and crossed out sentences, that there is no correct way to start. Whatever I write, it would in any case be out of place. This consideration has its origin in the game itself that I decided to review and evaluate. A game that, for better or for worse, marked a milestone in the videogame world and, in particular, in the hack'n'slash genre. It is my intention to clarify right away that what I am about to describe and evaluate is not an RPG, assuming that a clear definition of this genre exists, but a hack'n'slash. The term used, literally ~cut and slice~, places the player to interpret one or more characters with the aim of evolving and improving their skills through a more or less linear path. This goal is achieved through constant, frantic and repeated combat while the dialogue, puzzles, interaction with the world and non-player characters are kept to a minimum. The player's attention is completely focused on the combat. I think I'm not wrong in saying that this genre was invented or, at least, brought to success by ~Diablo~, a game developed by Blizzard way back in 1996. Diablo captured the attention of an exceptional number of people when it was marketed, in large part taking advantage of the growing interest in online gaming which was beginning to take root in those years. So it goes without saying that hundreds of thousands of people eagerly awaited the release of its sequel, Diablo 2. The anxiety of waiting grew enormously in those years, especially due to the constant delays, public beta tests and release date slippages . All this until the fateful end of June 2000 (June 30, if I'm not mistaken), the date of its marketing. Success was immediate. Total. I think Blizzard itself didn't envision sales of two million copies in the first few weeks. Allow me, before starting the actual review, one last clarification. In this review I will talk not only about Diablo 2 but also about its expansion, Lord of Destruction, which came out exactly one year later. LoD is an expansion in all respects but I decided to include it as an integral part of the original game for 2 reasons. The first is that if you haven't bought Diablo 2 yet, the best thing is to get it in the Battlechest package that includes both games. Second reason (but no less important) Diablo 2 without LoD is a half game, its expansion includes a year of experience, advice and a good part of the material that should have been included in the original game but which for various reasons ( in my opinion marketing) was not added. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Installation and technical information Diablo 2 resides on 3CDs while LoD consists of only one CD. The D2 installation provides 3 choices: 650 megabytes for the single game, 950 megabytes for the multiplayer game or 1.4 gigabytes by adding the movies on the hard disk (they can still be skipped). LoD adds about 800 megs so, at most, you'll take up 2.2 gigs for the full game. At the end of the installation, the setup checks our system to offer us the optimal configuration. So I take the opportunity to talk about the graphics engine, in my opinion one of the least quality points of the game. Diablo 2 uses a 45 isometric view in pure 2D (even if processed to look 3D), the hardware acceleration is mainly used to take full advantage of the lighting effects. I can say that a P3 600Mhz (or equivalent AMD), 128 mega ram, accelerated video card with 32mb ram (let's say from Geforce 1 or Radeon 7000 up) is enough to play more than acceptable (indicatively with a frame rate of 20 fps). [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Installation and technical information When the game came out, however, a configuration of this type was close to the top that the market could offer. The game was optimized to take advantage of 3Dfx's Glide acceleration, a system that in 2000 was by then in decline (if not already deceased) but, considering the release delays, unsuspected at the time of the graphics engine's creation (consider that Blizzard in starcraft box lo padvertised for Christmas '98). The resolution was initially 640x480 at 16bit but it was possible to reach 800x600 by installing LoD (always at 16bit). Graphically speaking, the game is still pleasant, the locations are detailed even if the characters and enemies seem to be resting a few centimeters from the ground, creating an effect of little realism, especially when they run. It goes without saying that a year or more after the release of Darkstone many expected a better optimized engine, not necessarily in 3D but at least more fluid and solid. The audio is of medium quality even if I can't imagine a different sound for a hack'n'slash, I can still consider that the music accompanies the game with dignity even if it is nothing special. A little more variety would certainly not have hurt. Localization was also performed for speech and in a more than satisfactory manner (bearing in mind, however, that the amount of material to translate and dub is very small). Interaction with the game takes place partly via the keyboard but, mainly, by imparting each selection from the mouse. Everything happens quickly and simply as a h'n's should be, we click where we want to go or hit and the character executes. I can therefore recommend the use of a mouse with 5 configurable buttons with scroll wheel to make the experience even more immediate. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Installation and technical information In case of back-up the characters can be easily saved by copying the save folder and re-inserting them in the same location after reinstalling. By installing LoD we will be automatically updated to version 1.08 but it is advisable to download the latest patch immediately (we are currently at 1.09) to avoid unpleasant anomalies. If you don't want to download the patch but still update the game, simply take advantage of the connection to Battle.net (Blizzard's multiplayer service) inserted in the game's main menu. The download is fast and within minutes the game updates automatically Singleplayer Starting the program, we immediately see the first movie. And one is forcibly amazed. I think Blizzard is the software house out there that makes the best movies. I can't tell you if they use motion capture by inserting the actors in digitized environments or if they also elaborate the characters with computer graphics, in any case the realization of all 7 movies is masterful. The main menu that we can use is quite sparse but nothing else is needed to play, the D2 settings are limited and in any case modifiable during the game. The game starts chronologically a short time after the end of the first episode of Diablo. We will not play our old character that we left to wander the lands outside of Tristram tormented by the soul stone nor will we be able to import it. We don't know what happened to him, the initial footage lets him imagine but I won't tell you anything else so as not to spoil the surprise. We will be able to choose between 7 different classes: barbarian, necromancer, amazon, paladin, enchantress, druid and assassin (these last two classes were added with LoD). The adventure begins in the ranger camp, the first act. The game is in fact divided into acts, 5 to be precise: 4 of Diablo 2 and 1 of LoD. Each act has a city that we could define as the base camp. In it we will be able to carry out the typical hack'n'slash buying and selling activities: sell, buy, repair and recharge objects, obtain some meager information on the adventure we are undertaking, identify objects, enlist mercenaries (one only per character), obtain some quests. Outside it, maps are randomly generated for each game. Each of them is standard from the point of view of the quests to be undertaken but the location of enemies, objects, passages, etc is totally random. Each city and each external map can be reached in 3 ways: on foot (!!!), through the portals that Diablo 1 players already know or through waypoints (basically fixed portals that can be activated on the first passage through each map). The game is decidedly linear, once you leave the city you scour each map until you find the passage to the next one. Each of them has a waypoint, with the exception of some lands and the dungeons they contain. In them we will complete quests that will bring certain advantages, sometimes objects, other times increases in characteristics or skills, etc... until we reach the main quest of the atto which will allow you to move on to the next one. It is practically impossible to get lost, although the maps are randomly regenerated with each game, the path to follow is always the same (and clearly visible from the summary menu of the quests). Wandering between the various locations has only one common denominator: combat. The objective of each character is in fact to clean up the lands from enemies to obtain experience and all sorts of objects. Moreover, single player games do not allow the classic saving in a specific point. Every time you exit the game all enemies are subject to respawning (basically resurrected). It therefore becomes essential to record the waypoints, in this way we will be able to restart the next game in the last map reached (but we will have to fight again with hordes of enemies). Said like this it may seem frustrating and for many it really can be, it's all about understanding the spirit with which you start playing diablo. If you have the patience to play thoroughly, you will discover how complex and varied the creation of characters can be by combining it with the disproportionate number of objects. I think it is therefore appropriate to focus attention on the part least considered by diablo's detractors and which instead makes this game incredibly varied, namely: [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Character management Each chosen class has a diametrically opposite management from the others. The characters, at each level up, get 5 characteristic points and 1 skill point to distribute. Thanks to these bonuses and their assignment we will generate more or less powerful and varied characters. Characteristic points must be distributed among strength, dexterity, vitality, and energy (magic). Strength affects hand-to-hand combat and allows you to wear increasingly heavier armor and weapons. Dexterity affects ranged combat, the chance to hit and the armor class (the protection index: the higher the number, the more difficult enemies will have to hit with physical damage). Vitality affects the amount of life we will have available before dying and the amount of stamina available. Stamina is a counter that limits our ability to run, once it runs out (especially if we're wearing heavy equipment) we'll have to stop to regenerate it. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Character management Energy determines the amount of mana that we will be able to use for spells even though in diablo 2 spells are expressed in the form of skills and not knowledge induced by the study of books. This value is extremely important because, unlike all the other hack'n'slash, we will not find potions for sale to regenerate mana but we will have to find them in the territories, a decidedly high difficulty index, especially at the beginning. Only enchantresses will be able to regenerate mana at a disproportionate rate but, of course, with the right combination of skills. We then mentioned the unique skill management system, which is a true indication of a player's ability to generate powerful and varied characters. Each character has 3 skill spheres available and in each of them there are about 15 skills that can be increased up to a maximum of 20 levels (limit that can only be overcome with some objects). The skills can be activated based on the level and are tree-structured, for example the X skill to be activated requires at least one level of the Y skill that precedes it in the skill tree. Surely it's easier to see than to explain: [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Character management So I think it is clear to everyone that we won't be able to assign points to all skills but only to some of them, making decisive choices right from the first level. In fact, considering that we will have 98 skill points available for leveling up (the maximum that can be reached is 99 but the first level is already active and without skills) and 12 for the level of difficulty attributed by some quests, in total we will have to assign 110 skills. I assure you that 110 points are very few due to the fact that level 99 is difficult to reach, especially in single player. You have to play a long time before you find the right c", "date": "2003-04-09", "grade": null}
