{"name": "Grandia II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grandia-ii.html", "text": "Every good RPG has a main character who acts as a hero of the situation and in this case it is a Geohound, an adventurer named Ryudo who, in the company of his friend Skye (an animal very similar to a falcon) gets money by completing some dangerous missions. At the beginning of the game, having completed a difficult task, he receives the task of escorting Elena (a priestess skilled in singing) up to a tower where she must perform a ceremony to definitively seal the wings of the God of Darkness, Valmar. The powerful demon is trying to put himself back together after being torn apart in the battle against the God of Light and protector of men, Granas. But, as usual, things don't go well and so it's up to you to fix it. I can't tell you more so as not to reveal important details about the plot. I'm just saying that the story may seem a bit obvious at the beginning but, going forward, things will start to get more interesting and you will no longer be able to detach yourself from the joypad also because you will be captivated by the captivating combat system, a very original variant of the classic turn based system. Speaking of the fights, it must first be said that there are no random encounters and that the enemies are always present on the screen and, possibly, can be avoided. Another interesting feature is the approach you can have with monsters; if you enter their range of action they will change color and will run after you with the risk, if you are reached, of starting the fight at a disadvantage because the enemy will have the possibility to attack first. If, on the other hand, you manage to surprise them from behind, you will have the advantage. The first thing that will catch your eye on the fight screen will be the bar at the bottom right (IP indicator); this shows you the order in which both characters you control and monsters you face take the initiative during a fight. Each character is represented by an icon that scrolls from left to right along the IP indicator. When one of these icons reaches the word COM, it is possible to issue a command to the corresponding character. However, the action is not performed immediately because the character icon must first reach the word ACT. This simple trick leads to some really fun fights and forces you to carefully plan every move because it is possible to block the actions of the enemies (but they can do the same thing to you too) by making their icon on the IP indicator retreat. To do this, simply hit an enemy with a Critical Attack (Combo is the other type of attack available, which inflicts more damage but does not block the opponent's attack) when the icon representing it is between COM and ACT (basically about to perform an attack). With careful planning it is possible to complete an encounter without being touched by the enemy. The differentiation compared to other RPGs does not end here because it is possible to perform very devastating special attacks that consume a special bar (SP indicator) which recharges when you attack or get hit. Naturally, the spells that are associated with ~classic~ elements such as water, wind, earth and air could not be missing, to which less conventional elements such as forest, fire, lightning, storm and eruption are added. In order to cast spells, characters must be equipped with Mana Spheres. Learning spells and special attacks is linked to the use of particular coins (special coins for attacks and magic coins for spells) which can be recovered at the end of the battles together with the traditional experience points and gold coins. In order to learn a certain attack or a particular spell, it is necessary to ~buy~ them using these specific coins. It is also possible to enhance and speed up the execution time of the learned moves by paying additional amounts of money. The same goes for special abilities (Skills) which are learned using the same system (in this case the character must first be equipped with a Skill Book) and which allow you to enhance the characters or fill their weak points. Having said that, let's move on to describing the technical side of the game which, I'll tell you right away, suffers from many lows and few highs. First the game has not been fully localized and in saying this I am not referring to tant to the translation into Italian of the various textual parts which in a somewhat niche game like this can also be forgiven (in any case they greatly affect the sales possibilities in our country), but above all on the lack of optimization of the images on the screen which present black bars and 50 Hz update. And to think that all this didn't happen on the poor Dreamcast The three-dimensional graphics engine that moves the game seems to suffer excessively from the time elapsed since its first appearance on DC and brings to the screen few polygons and textures that ranging from ~pretty~ to ~would look bad even on PSone~. Furthermore, the rotation of the camera in some sequences leads to unpleasant flickering. Fortunately, the light effects in the fights and the animations of the most spectacular spells that are even shown with short animated sequences take care of resolving the situation. Compared to the version for the Sega console, the presence of unedited filmed scenes should also be noted. The sound sector is respectable: the music is nice and, in some moments, they properly enhance the most daring sequences of the game. Added to these are the frequent spoken dialogues (always in English and with a not exactly Oscar-worthy acting) and the sentences spoken by the characters during the execution of the most spectacular moves. At the end of the day, this Grandia II turns out to be a good RPG that mixes well classic elements such as the exploration of dungeons (helped by an effective compass that shows the direction to take) with other more innovative ones such as the effective combat and learning system of skills. Some might turn up their noses at the lack of exploitation of the Sony home console but a true RPG lover doesn't look too much at these things (and also plays the ancient Final Fantasy VI just released for Psone while having fun!) and is able to appreciate the beautiful plot, the absence of the odious (when not supported by a combat system up to par) random encounters and clashes with enemies that are never too simple. I would recommend the game to all those who have been waiting for a RPG for their black console for over a year, sure they will appreciate it and will have fun waiting for the next tenth final fantasy. Pros: Finally a real RPG! Combat system Light effects Cons: All in English (manual excluded) Not optimized for the PAL market Graphics a bit dated Although it has only three episodes to its credit, the Grandia series has had a not a little troubled existence. The first episode saw the light on Sega's Saturn, the last (recently released in Japan and, I hope soon available here too) on PS2; in between the conversion of the first episode for PSOne and the release of the second on the Dreamcast, with its conversion on Sony's 128-bit platform that I am now going to review.", "date": "2002-04-05", "grade": null}
