{"name": "Life of Pixel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155855-life-of-pixel-saltellando-nel-retrogaming.html", "text": "Since independent developers have understood that the graphic style of 8 and 16-bit titles works, we have been invaded by dozens of titles that use this trick to make up for a not exactly excellent game design. On the other hand, let's be honest, in every gamer, even those too young to have experienced the dawn of this sector, there is a little nostalgic hiding who is willing to forgive the worst defects in the face of blocky graphics. Life of Pixel is undoubtedly a title that makes the nostalgia effect its strong point. It's a hard-core platformer that's qualified more by its looks than its mechanics. It tells the story of a nice green pixel who visits a museum dedicated to retrogaming and thanks to this narrative expedient he makes a real journey into the universe of old game systems, through not only their graphic style but also the notions that are bestowed before starting a level. From this point of view we must applaud the developers, because they have not limited themselves to the great classics such as NES, SNES, Atari 2600 or Commodore 64 but have also included lesser known names such as the BBC Micro, Amstrad and Sinclair, adapting the graphics of the game to that of the system, although we must admit that in some cases we would have liked a slightly more ~dirty~ style instead of the visual cleaning typical of modern consoles. Thanks to Life of Pixel we could relive the history of video games, one curse at a time One pixel, many curses Despite being a 2D platformer, Life of Pixel will not only ask us to get to the end without falling victim to enemies or traps scattered along the way, but also to find all the gems scattered throughout the levels, a very easy task initially but which with time will turn into a real nightmare. In fact, the difficulty of the game follows the progression of the consoles, so everything will be quite simple in older systems but already on the Amiga we will have accumulated a number of curses sufficient to make Satan plug his ears. In fact, life will be complicated by a very varied sample of enemies who will do nothing but move along a pre-established path and who will kill us if we touch them twice. If we then fall into a trap, be it full of sharp points or armed with deadly lasers, a single shot will suffice instead. In both cases there are no checkpoints or saves, so you go straight back to the start of the level. To help us, however, there will be some upgrades that will often be essential also to complete certain levels. The bombs, for example, will allow us to destroy any obstacles that block our path, while some bubbles will allow us to flutter and overcome sections with a particularly difficult approach. On paper these ~helpers~ seem like a great thing, a pity that they are so infrequent that when we met one we died of emotion and had to start over. Leap in the dark However, the real problems of Life of Pixel concern its fundamental mechanic: the jump. Platformers normally provide some control in mid-air, some allow you to vary the jump based on the press of the button, others to change direction on the fly. In Life of Pixel instead the jump is that, always that and only that, no matter how much and how you press. Unfortunately, this is a big problem in advanced levels, because it compromises the ability to move in space with greater dexterity and binds the player to a single form of movement. The situation is made even worse by the double jump which, if not executed with almost surgical precision, proves to be almost completely ineffective. In fact, if we don't press the button at the right time, the second jump will be very weak and this nine times out of ten will bring us about to die. Someone could rightly argue that it is a difficult game and as such it is perfectly right that a higher than normal responsiveness is required, but the impression obtained is that the whole thing is simply frustrating for no apparent reason. Unfortunately, the defects are not finished and also concern the level design of the more advanced stages of the game. Apart from the fact that not all levels are well done and some seem unnecessarily long, there is also a major problem with scrolling. At first the levels will be simple and enclosed in the visible portion of the screen, when the situation becomes more complicated the spaces will expand and we will have to move in much larger levels whose scrolling follows the movements of the pixel. The problem is that sometimes this doesn't happen and to see what awaits us ahead we will have to arrivere to the edge of the level. Sometimes this will be the cause of countless stupid deaths, especially when you don't know the level like the back of your hand and do a kind of ~leap of faith~, hoping that there is the ground to welcome you and not a ditch full of spikes. If you add all this to a not exactly crystalline jumping mechanic and to the fact that in case of death you start from scratch, you will understand that Life of Pixel is not a difficult game, it is a punishing game. It's a pity, a real pity, because the idea of retracing the history of video games by reconstructing not only the graphic style, but also the sound, is definitely interesting! And in fact we would be excessively bad if we didn't say that in some moments the game really fascinated and entertained us, but unfortunately these flashes don't hold up to the comparison with those in which it made us angry for defects that could be largely corrected.", "date": "2015-09-10", "grade": "6.5"}
