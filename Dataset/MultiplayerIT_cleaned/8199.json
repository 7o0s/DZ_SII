In some countries the game was banned, in others it was censored (by inserting zombies instead of pawns and coloring the blood green), and the result of all this mess was obviously an extraordinary publicity for the Stainless Games production, generally received in a generally positive way by the critics. Ultraviolence aside, in fact, this ~alternative~ arcade racer offered a different experience than usual, mixing Test Drive-style circuits with ~check point~ mechanics in which people and/or animals had to be run over to get the extra seconds needed to complete the race. competition. Finally, great importance was given to clashes with other vehicles, which allowed us to unlock faster or more resistant cars, which could be upgraded through a classic-style upgrade system. When the original development team announced the return of Carmageddon on mobile devices a few months ago, it was obviously a moment of celebration for the nostalgics, who were also able to take advantage of a free download promotion during the first week of marketing on the App Store (the release on Google Play should take place soon). Once the game is installed, the initial impact is controversial: quite a few years have passed and from a technical point of view the thing is evident, so certainly don't expect a title capable of rivaling the current racers for iOS devices . In structural terms, however, the experience has aged very well and still offers a flood of content today between races, tracks and vehicles, all elements to be unlocked by taking into account a good dose of commitment and perseverance. Broad the leaf, narrow the path... As just mentioned, Carmageddon can still boast respectable numbers today, thanks to a single player campaign consisting of thirty-six events characterized by multiple objectives, to which are added almost thirty different cars. The latter are obtained by destroying the similar models during the races, a factor that adds a further substrate to the gameplay and inevitably increases the degree of replayability of the product. The fact that the game presents itself in such a hardcore way, without giving us anything (even the credits are only recognized if we actually complete all the laps of a race), would also be fine in itself, but unfortunately it is coupled with a system of control that makes even the most trivial maneuvers complicated, and which together with the original grip characteristics of the cars (which do not hold a single curve) and vision management creates an explosive mixture that translates into one of the most frustrating experiences we have ever had never experienced. It is possible to modify the controls in various ways, using the accelerometer for cornering or replacing the default buttons (Left, Right, Accelerator, Brake and Handbrake) with two virtual analog sticks, but things only get worse and eventually in the end the starting setting turns out to be the least worst. Of course, yet another missed target due to the lack of responsiveness of the commands, perhaps with the countdown of available seconds about to end, you will really want to curse the developers. We have already mentioned the technical sector: the graphics inevitably feel the weight of the years, but nevertheless it is fluid and the design of certain tracks is so absurd that it deserves applause. As for the sound, it's nice that some voices are in Italian and the music ~drags~, but the quality of the effects is poor.", "date": "2012-11-08", "grade": "7.0"}
