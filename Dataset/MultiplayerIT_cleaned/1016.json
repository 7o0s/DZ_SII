{"name": "Affilate gli artigli", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/legend-of-kay.html", "text": "The peaceful island of Yenching, inhabited by the tribes of cats, rabbits, frogs and pandas, is ~militarily~ occupied by troops of mice, gorillas, turtles and crocodiles. The invaders take control of the territory, forcibly repressing any gesture of disapproval. So cats, in particular, are forced into a life that is anything but free. Young Kay realizes it too, when the gorillas close down his martial arts master's school; and so; he rebels: after taking possession of the legendary sword of his ancestors, he sets himself the goal of defeating and driving back the oppressors. To do this, he will have to complete numerous missions, crossing more or less large locations and facing opponents of various stature. The cat goes to the lard anyway... At the beginning of the game, as per tradition, Kay will have to familiarize himself with his own skills and with the ~mission~ structure that distinguishes each level. In the first case it will be his elderly master (an old cat with a drinking habit...) who will teach him fighting techniques and magical arts, to be used via keystrokes that are not always intuitive; in the second case, the resizable map will help him identify the points to reach. Kay's offensive possibilities are many, and the combat system in general is well done, with an excellent collision detection and with the presence of some strategic elements: it is possible not only to parry the blows of the enemies, but also to move with a Dash up behind them while they're on defense, to throw them into the air and knock them out. Combos are added to the normal attacks, i.e. chained moves that have different functions. It is obviously possible to exploit them in clashes, but it is equally important to use them when you need to reach inaccessible areas, or in the presence of switches that can be activated by executing them. The operation of the combo mode is simple: once a first shot has been landed, against an enemy or a particular ~activator~ object, arrows will appear on the screen indicating the next possible target: by quickly pressing the Triangle key, Kay will immediately reach the target indicated by the left analog stick, at which point simply press the attack button again to continue the sequence. The character can also carry various objects with various functions, to be collected on the street or to be purchased at special points of sale: potions of strength or vitality, bombs and so on. Interact with the environment Although the plot of Legend of Kay does not shine for its originality or depth, the developers have done everything to create a certain atmosphere and entice the player to interact with the various characters they meet during the adventure. Through the dialogue, in fact, it is possible to access both the main missions and the ~optional~ ones, with obvious repercussions on longevity. The fact that the game is completely translated into Italian, both in the text and in the dialogues (with ups and downs, unfortunately), only confirms what has been said so far. The exploration of the levels is generally free from constraints: it is possible to simply follow the indications on the map or look around for particular objects or switches, in order to unlock alternative activities. In some cases you will have to cross sections riding animals, in an obstacle course; other times you will have to jump from rope to rope to reach particular areas. The management of the virtual camera isn't terrible, but it isn't brilliant either: the possibilities to adjust the ~vertical~ view are scarce, and this is especially felt when the character's jumps require a certain precision. The missions that you have to face generally revolve around finding objects or reaching certain places. The further you go, the more the game proves generous with extras, in this case new primary weapons (there are three in all: sword, hammer and claws) and armor. Legend of Kay is an excellent action-adventure game, technically sound and quite ~substantial~ Catnip The technical realization of Legend of Kay is excellent, albeit with some reservations. The settings are rich in details, with well-made textures and various interactive elements. The very fast loading times and the size of some locations reveal a certain effort during development, which however is not reflected in the solidity of the graphics engine: on more than one occasion, even when there is no ~traffic~ on the screen, the framerate suffers from annoying drops. On the other hand, the characters are well characterized and have animations that are not varied but generalmind well done. Furthermore, the special effects are adequate for the purpose, adding spectacularity to attack maneuvers and magic formulas. The sound is characterized by the presence of pleasant music and average effects: it does not arouse great emotions, but it does its job honestly.", "date": "2005-03-04", "grade": "7.2"}
