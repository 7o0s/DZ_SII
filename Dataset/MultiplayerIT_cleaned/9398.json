{"name": "Un tuffo nel passato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/86724-the-sims-medieval-un-tuffo-nel-passato.html", "text": "Having abandoned the luxuries of the third millennium, such as the ultra-flat TV or the Hollywood-style swimming pool, the Sims are ready to return in a guise never seen before. Catapulted into the Middle Ages, the characters will thus have to face the needs of an era made up of castles and magic, duels and plagues, myths and legends. Emblem and fulcrum of The Sims Medieval is the presence of real missions. These represent an absolute novelty in the universe of the Sims, who are no longer called simply to relate to each other, but must in all respects act for the good of the Kingdom and try their hand at the most varied tasks: from defeating a fearsome witch to restoring peace and health in the village. The new setting, with attention to the smallest details, makes the new Sim chapter even more sparkling and will certainly be able to capture the attention of both the aficionados and the ~rookies~ of the situation. We start with an empty field on which to build the key buildings of the medieval village and of course, there is no kingdom without a ruler... therefore the first construction will be the castle with its King. A fundamental step is also the choice of the ambition, which will influence the missions but above all the fate of the entire realm. This will be unique during the first game but in subsequent games, several new, possible ambitions will open up. The medieval spirit pervades every single character of the title, starting from the objects with which it is possible to embellish the environments. In this regard, it is necessary to underline the richness of the objects proposed, from knightly banners to precious canopies, not to forget the chamber pot and the tubs for personal ~hygiene~ but also tents, chairs, tables, thrones and a host of other more generic or specific items for each Hero sim. Ten characters looking for missions There are ten Heroes in this adventure, each with a precise role: there is obviously the Sovereign, who with his character will shape the history of the Kingdom, flanked by the faithful Knight and the Machiavellian Spy; the Physician, with his miraculous ointments, and the Magician, with his thousand spells; the Jacobian Priest and the Peterian one, two religious figures at the antipodes: one unscrupulous and enriched, the other devoted to humility and poverty; finally, there is the Merchant, with his exotic goods, the busy Blacksmith and the festive Bard, who with his lute manages to really make the whole village dance. Characters with many facets, each with its own peculiarities and abilities, but all customizable to your liking. The formula is the one already tested for some time with the classic The Sims. In fact, it is possible to define every single trait of each one, down to the smallest detail: name, physical characteristics (from the shape of the nose to the tone of the voice), clothing absolutely in line with medieval fashion and personality, with the choice of two virtues and a defect ~ lethal~ but equally witty, so decisive that it can influence the mood of the character himself. As in The Sims 3, you can indulge yourself with colors, having the entire palette at your disposal to customize your Hero Sim to the maximum. You can even change the color of the clothes, often in the most insignificant finishes, such as the seams. Once the classic ~Create-a-Sim~ stage is completed, the adventure begins. The regulars of the saga will immediately notice the different setting of the title, no longer focused on the single Sim, but on the community of the village. In fact, the usual bars of needs are missing, with the exception of hunger and physical energy and therefore one will not have to worry too much about hygiene nor much less about the bladder. The personal sphere leaves room for the ~professional~ development of the Hero Sim, who is called upon to develop his own talents and improve his own skill level thanks also to the system of responsibilities: specific actions for the use of the character and closely related to it. For example, it will be the task of the Spy to pickpocket the merchants with skill and skill, while instead it will be up to the Doctor to collect leeches to literally bleed his patients. Perhaps these very typical responsibilities for the Hero risk becoming somewhat repetitive in the long run and their daily performance inevitably ends up turning into a dutiful but not very stimulating action. In any case, in the general framework of the game this represents a minor flaw and one cannot say that one has entered the heart except when a mission is undertaken. This can be selected from a large list, which differs according to the ambition chosen for one's realm, and can be played according to different approaches, depending on the chosen Hero. A feature that all quests have in common is undoubtedly the originality and sympathy: you will thus find yourself having to defend the village from the attack of fearsome chinchillas or hunt down a very pedantic talking frog... to make a very tasty soup. The missions are made up of different steps, the execution of which overlaps with that of the responsibilities mentioned above, significantly increasing the pace of the game. The steps in question are the most varied, ranging from investigating deeds and misdeeds by asking the villagers for information to building or searching for objects: once all the steps have been completed, all that remains is to complete the mission and obtain important points both for the career of the protagonist himself and for the expansion of the Kingdom, which can be enriched with new buildings and therefore Heroes. So the same, so different The Sims Medieval is striking for being both similar and different from its direct predecessor, The Sims 3. Similar because those who already know this universe can only feel a little at home, being able to move with a certain familiarity in the various menus and in game actions. At the same time, the change is truly impressive. The introduction of the missions manages to completely overturn what in the previous chapters was the ultimate goal of the game, that is to create a character down to the smallest detail and cultivate his interests and friendships, loves and career. This time, as never before, the social aspect is put into the background: although it is possible to relate to all the villagers and all the other Sim Heroes - among other things with a remarkable variety of interactive possibilities , both standardized for each Sim and specific to each single profession - the purpose remains fundamentally the mission. Establishing relationships with others therefore becomes the framework for the quest which, once completed, closes the game by returning to the overview screen of the Kingdom. Thus leaving any liaisons pending that it will be possible to resume them in subsequent adventures, although the lack of a certain continuity is felt. Despite this, the presence of the missions is so engaging and the issues addressed are so witty and fun that this neo weighs almost nothing. One of the few, considering that other big, possible reasons to advise against the title reside in the eventual, little proximity to the concept or the disappointment for the not incredible depth of certain aspects, such as the one mentioned above or the diplomatic relations with the neighboring kingdoms, barely sketched . The game therefore confirms the impressions of the experiences of the past months and weeks, establishing itself as an innovative and hilarious passage, never identical to itself, of the saga created by Will Wright.", "date": "2011-03-24", "grade": "8.5"}
