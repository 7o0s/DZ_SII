What for Jan Willem Nijman and Rami Ismail was supposed to be a refined and enriched version of their Radical Fishing (2010) instead turned into a hot potato when in the summer of 2011 the Californian Gamenauts released a clone called Ninja Fishing. Beaten by time, the independent duo carried on with development knowing that, paradoxically, they would have risked passing for the 'script' of the moment; today a look at some unsuspecting reviews on the App Store shows that fear was actually justified. Yet after two years of stress Vlambeer was finally able to drop his hook, relax and hope that the ocean was still packed. Just like Billy, the fisherman protagonist of the game. Fishing or clay pigeon shooting? Even if the original idea was born for a small Flash prototype, the simple, fast and rewarding mechanics make Ridiculous Fishing a perfect mobile game capable of filling a few moments or tens of minutes. Each match is divided into three different phases, joined together in a completely transparent way: in the first the hook is cast and the line is moved to the right or left by tilting the device; in this case the aim is to avoid any marine creature, since the first fish that bites the line stops its descent and begins to return to the surface. At this point the rules are reversed and ask the player to do the exact opposite, trying to catch as many fish as the hook goes up quickly. However, it is in the third and final phase that Ridiculous Fishing proves to be truly ridiculous: once the line has been pulled on the surface, all the fish that have taken the bite are thrown into the air, leaving the player with the task of hitting them on the fly with one of the numerous fishing weapons fire available. Only fish killed in this way allow you to earn money and points, which vary according to the rarity of the prey. Precisely for this reason, during the fishing phase, the player tends to give priority to the rarest fish, instead dodging the annoying jellyfish which, when killed, give a more or less substantial penalty. As in the original Radical Fishing, the prey ~caught~ are recorded in the Fish-o-Pedia, a register that gives information for each fish such as the name, the value, the number of kills or a funny description. Once all the races present in a particular area have been drawn, it is possible to move to the next one, where to find new creatures or deeper seas. We continue like this until we reach a short and touching interlude scene which, although it seems to close a sketchy narrative parenthesis, actually marks the beginning of the real game, unlocking a new area in which it is possible to descend infinitely , and then get busy to mark depth records or accumulated money. Byrdr From the wooden iPad that serves as the main menu, it is also possible to keep an eye on the real time and the autonomy of your device. One of the apps is Byrdr, a sort of fictitious social network in which game characters exchange short tweet-like messages. Most of these messages are ironic jokes (which unfortunately are never really hilarious) and the occasional reference to the story behind the game. An ocean of surprises Go down, go up, shoot. Go down, go up, shoot. That of Ridiculous Fishing is a repetitive routine, but which, as often happens, manages not to bore the player thanks to a long series of unlockable contents, most of which are taken from scratch from the original chapter: this is the case of the lamp, with which illuminate the darkest depths, or of the toaster, which electrocutes the first fish that bites and gives a second chance. Obviously there is no shortage of longer lines or engines that speed up the descent, but great space has been given to the choice of weapons. The Uzis and shotguns already present in Radical Fishing have been joined by new firearms, including a Magnum pistol, a bazooka and a devastating Orbital Beam. It is curious to see how each of these weapons requires different approaches: for example, the two Uzis allow you to shoot by holding two fingers on the screen, and the Orbital Beam needs to be loaded for a few moments. This means that you are free to choose your own style of play, and that the preferred weapon is not necessarily the most powerful one. Vlambeer has also done a great job of balancing and differentiating fish in the ocean in the way they move and react, such as the piranha, which snaps at the hook if it gets too close, or a faannoying jellyfish which, if hit by mistake, begins to multiply. There's also room for a few cameos, and so characters from other indie games, such as Bit.Trip, Super Crate Box and Incredipede, pop up between a puffer fish and a manta ray. And it is precisely in the attention to detail, in the passion of its authors and in the desire to surprise those who play that Ridiculous Fishing stands out heavily from its clone. From this point of view, the collaboration with other independent developers has done nothing but embellish the game even more. Unlike what he did with Spelunky, this time Eirik Suhrke has created a soundtrack that fits beautifully with the atmosphere of the game, highlighting the relaxed and relaxed tones of fishing, but also the mysterious and almost sinister side hidden by the sea depths. Similarly, the graphic style chosen by US artist Greg Wohlwend is elegant and lively, and makes the game look like a colorful and coherent collage in which there are no curves, only 45 angles.", "date": "2013-03-18", "grade": "8.8"}
