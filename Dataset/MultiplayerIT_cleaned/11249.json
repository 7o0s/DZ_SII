It goes without saying that in many cases these operations turn out to be a failure, faced with the forcing of offering outdated or worse still distorted mechanics in a regrettable way. Fortunately, exceptions exist, and this is precisely the case with Space Invaders Extreme. Winning team updates We find it rather pointless to describe what Space Invaders was and what it meant in its original 1978 incarnation, a milestone in the world of video games that appeared in one way or another on practically every existing console. We therefore prefer to tell you about the innovations introduced by this Extreme edition, and the reasons why it deserves to be taken into consideration by every Nintendo DS owner. The game mechanics, let's say it right away, fortunately it hasn't been distorted: the goal remains the destruction of waves of aliens using a ship, which can simply be fired and moved left and right on the lower part of the screen. The winning idea is to be found instead in the creation of an authentic ~second level~ of the gameplay, a way to add an enviable depth without distorting the original concept at all. In fact Space Invaders Extreme, if desired, can be played in an absolutely faithful way to the precursor, worrying only about putting an end to the alien invasion. Or you can delve into the scoring system studied by Taito's programmers. The basic rules are simple: by eliminating 4 enemies of the same color, you get a power-up for your ship's weapon. So going to kill 4 others of a different color will determine the appearance of a UFO which, if eliminated, will lead directly to a very short bonus level in which to complete simple objectives. The success therefore guarantees the ~Fever Time~, a period in which you can count on a further increase in offensive potential as well as a large bonus in the overall score. There are also multipliers for multiple kills and other aspects to take care of to add points to your total score. Hence, Space Invaders Extreme thus becomes a spectacular, stimulating, complex but not complicated chase for score with a continuous drive to improve that does not abandon the player even after dozens of games and related game overs. I train the alien From an artistic point of view, the influence of Tetsuya Mitzuguchi's titles such as Rez and Lumines is clear; in fact, the high bpm music accompanies an excellent mix of original ~old school~ sprites and modern, colorful and psychedelic effects. A design choice therefore perhaps not very original, but which has its effect and above all goes very well with the gameplay. The multiplayer component is also decidedly interesting, which above all on DS is achieved with a series of rather intriguing options; in fact, in addition to being able to challenge a friend even with a single copy of the game shared in game sharing, it is possible to send one's scores to a global ranking and even to be able to face other users online. On PSP bizarrely the latter option is not present, and local multiplayer requires 2 umd of the game making it much less accessible. On the other hand, it is sad to note that for Europe the sales policy at a budget price has not been maintained as was done in the USA, where both versions cost only 19.99 dollars; in doing so, a title whose purchase would have been advisable with your eyes closed instead becomes less attractive for those looking for less arcade and immediate gaming experiences. Comment Space Invaders Extreme is an excellent way to celebrate 30 years of a title that revolutionized the world of video games. The historic and stainless game mechanics have in fact been strengthened with a truly perfectly conceived scoring system, capable of constantly stimulating and offering a second and more in-depth interpretation that is accompanied by a more than positive audiovisual remix. A promotion with full marks is therefore compromised only because of the questionable price policy adopted by Square Enix for Europe, which is detached from the budget one that, on the contrary, accompanied the sale in the United States. Pros A new interpretation of a great classic Exhilarating and engaging scoring system Excellent audiovisual remix Against IThe US budget price is a reminder PSP version inferior to DS in content", "date": "2008-08-13", "grade": null}
