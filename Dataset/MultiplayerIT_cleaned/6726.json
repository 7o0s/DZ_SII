{"name": "Wrestlemania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/141151-wwe-2k15-wrestlemania.html", "text": "Punctual as always, WWE returns again this year in its videogame incarnation par excellence, thanks to the renewed commitment of two veteran teams in sports development and obviously wrestling such as Visual Concepts and Yuke's. The sport-spectacle par excellence, in an electronic key has now been able to take on from season to season the traits of any sports simulation that arrives at the annual appointment with enthusiasts bringing with it a wealth of improvements, new names and extras. Even if in this edition, we say it right away, things appear a little different: as we will see in detail later on, in fact, WWE 2K15 takes further steps forward in terms of aesthetics and gameplay, with the latter more oriented towards total simulation; but also some partial step back in what has always been an important component of the franchise, namely the methods and customization. But let's proceed in order and let's analyze all the most interesting elements of the production. WWE 2K15 focuses on more simulation gameplay this year and the new Career mode Become a star At a purely content level, WWE 2K15 offers the usual large number of modes in the series (but there are some important defection, such as the four-man Hell in a Cell, or the Ladders and Handicap matches), starting with the traditional Exhibition, at the inside which you can then choose from a myriad of further options (many of which can be customized): fight in one-on-one matches, in 4-Man or 6-Man matches, in a Triple Threat, in the Royal Rumble, or play tournaments such as the King of the Ring or reserved for Tag Teams. And again, it is possible to choose to try your hand at fights valid for various titles, many of which are also from the past linked for example to ECW or WCW, and so on. If, on the other hand, the user wants to try his hand at structurally more articulated modes and better immerse himself in the WWE universe, then he must look to 2K Showcase, the new Career mode and Universe. The first allows fans to relive the rivalries between John Cena and CM Punk between 2011 and 2013, and between Shawn Michaels and Triple H between 2002 and 2004. The section is in fact divided into two portions, each of which features the main events concerning the feuds mentioned above, which are ~told~ through a series of films in the classic ~emotional~ style from the WWE repertoire, and enriched by the comments of the superstars. There are obviously the real matches, for a total of thirty-three matches, where players are called to complete a series of historical objectives, obtaining bonuses in exchange that allow them to unlock new game elements, including titles and ring attire. In this way, matches such as the 2012 SummerSlam Triple threat match, which saw the Straight-Edge Savior CM Punk committed to defending the WWE Championship against Big Show and John Cena, or the Unsanctioned Street Fight match of the 2002 between the King of Kings and the Boy Who Breaks Hearts. Through the Season Pass there is then the possibility of enriching 2K Showcase by purchasing three DLCs containing new scenarios dedicated to Randy Orton and Christian, Mark Henry and the great Ultimate Warrior. Returning instead to talk about what is contained within the disc, we have the new My Career mode, an exclusive next-gen that draws inspiration from the namesake present in the titles of the NBA 2K series. In other words, the gamer takes on the role of a superstar created out of nothing, then following his career in the WWE from the beginning up to the Olympus of the show. It starts from the Orlando Performance Center with a series of workouts and goals to be achieved under the guidance of former wrestling star Bill DeMott, to then begin the real climb from NXT, the development territory of the Stamford federation for future talents, up to the main roster, where you have to deal with the most popular stars. To climb to the top, however, you have to work hard, on the one hand by increasing your physical attributes, acquiring new technical skills, competencies and moves through targeted training sessions and meetings where you can collect special points and virtual currency. On the other hand, go down when needed to deal with the Devil, namely the General Manager Vickie Guerrero, create alliances or unleash rivalries, change attitude from face to heel or vice versa, and so on. All while obviously also fighting in the rings of the main WWE arenas, from the weekly shows linked to Raw and SmackDown, to the most important pay-per-views such as SummerSlam or WrestleMania. With the internet connection always active it is even posIt is possible to allow or not the invasion of up to a maximum of five friends in one's career with their virtual alter egos, and to do the same, for original crossings and challenges within the game world. Curiosity WWE 2K15 offers a roster made up of about forty wrestlers. The athletes, many of which to unlock, are divided between Superstars, Divas and Legends, and include among others the World Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar, the Intercontinental champion Luke Harper and the various Roman Reigns, Triple H, Kane, The Undertaker, Randy Orton , Daniel Bryan, Rusev, Bray Wyatt, John Cena and the unforgotten Ultimate Warrior. There are also some of the greats of American wrestling history such as ~Stone Cold~ Steve Austin, Sting, Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels. To these fighters are added those that will be made available in the coming weeks via DLC, and those that can be recreated with the internal editor. The WWE universe My Career is quite interesting, but in the long run it can be a bit repetitive between the (too many) dark matches, the ~dialogues~ that take place almost exclusively through pop-up windows, the lack of side elements in the backstage that immerse the user more in the game, and a certain difficulty in growing one's wrestler. To do this, in fact, you need to play many matches before being able to earn the necessary points to improve it, and if you lose too many matches it is easy to get stuck fighting with the same group of fighters for a long time, without the possibility of participating in the main events. And it is therefore easy to understand how the risk of boredom, if you don't have much passion and patience, is just around the corner. In any case, to complete the offer from the point of view of content, there are then the Universe and Online modes. The first is once again the managerial soul of the production, given that the gamer is called to experience a practically infinite season where the only limit can be linked to his own imagination. In fact, the user can build his shows as he sees fit, programming the stories of the athletes in the various shows, deciding the weekly structure of the events, the roster, the rivalries and their duration, the pay-per-views, and so on . As for the online sector of WWE 2K15, the options available are largely the same as always, apart from a couple of cuts here too. Unfortunately due to the persistence of some problems on the game servers it was not possible for us to test it properly, which is why we do not feel like expressing an opinion in one sense or another. However, it is always possible to share your creations made with the game's internal editor via the Internet. Unfortunately, these has several fewer functions than in the past, but try to partially balance the defections with some novelties. For example, you can no longer edit the arenas, the entrance music of the stars, the finishers, or create original stories and female characters, but on the other hand you can model up to twenty-five new ultra-detailed male fighters, and partially modify the Superstars existing. In addition, a new feature has been implemented that allows you to import custom logos from the community. Playstation 4 trophies WWE 2K15 offers 41 Trophies divided as follows: 30 Bronze, 6 Silver, 4 Gold and 1 Platinum. To obtain them you must, among other things, win a Money in the Bank match with a customized Superstar, successfully execute a finishing move on the fly, triumph in at least 50 matches on Hard difficulty or higher in Universe or Exhibition (Single), up to the most such as winning 50 ranked matches or completing all objectives in 2K Showcase. An astonishing start But it is once in the ring that, as always, the fan can finally give vent to his passion for this sport, and discover the most important news that obviously concern the gameplay. From this point of view, the impact with the game is decidedly different than in the past, and overall the title registers a noticeable change in the pace of the meetings, which are now decidedly slower and more reasoned in favor of greater credibility. In fact, WWE 2K15 pushes the accelerator on realism and simulation, and even if at the beginning it can be unsettling for those accustomed to the old titles in the series, after a handful of matches and a little practice it is easy to get used to the new ones dynamics that regulate what happens in the ring. In this sense, pad in hand, the changes to the completely rewritten grappling system are immediately perceived, which now prevents the wrestlers from immediately starting to make spectacular moves and complicated figures, but ~forces~ almost, as in reality, to sfdefeat the opponent with simple attacks. And when you attempt a clinch, a small minigame is triggered in which you have to press three of the joypad's front buttons, following the on-screen indications in the form of an icon that indicate a side headlock, a wrist lock or a waist lock. The style of these phases is very reminiscent of that of the Chinese paper, and once an action has been performed correctly, a series of linked moves are performed with the help of the right stick to try to subdue the opponent. In practice, within a circular blue bar you have to move a point of the same color with the analog stick. When it turns red it means that a weak point has been identified in the grip of the opposing wrestler. By pressing the same stick like a key, the circle must therefore be filled (before the opponent does the same with his) to maintain control of a grip and the acquired advantage, or to free himself and execute a counter-move, in a call and response which depends a lot on the skill of the gamer and his reflexes. Among other things, the developers have also partially redesigned the system that manages the physics inherent in the contacts. Consequently, the game better records the blows delivered or suffered, and takes even more account of the differences in weight, both to inhibit the use of certain moves or holds when the distance between the two wrestlers is excessive, and to ensure that it is the most powerful athlete, often, to exploit his mass to knock out a less physically gifted opponent faster. In any case, the strategy becomes decisive and one must be very careful in what one decides to do, given that hitting at random is of little use except to tire uselessly and risk suffering a rapid counterattack, just as senseless running around the ring makes precipitating the stamina value downwards, with the result of weakening the athlete and making him vulnerable to the counter-moves of the opponents, as well as weakening him in his offensive actions. In fact, the stamina of an athlete also affects the success of a reverse, a chokeslam or a finisher, just to name a few, risking making them ineffective. It is not uncommon to see matches where a very tired athlete tries to go and close the match with the last strength he has left, chasing an opponent who in his turn exhausted tries to crawl towards the ropes, and paradoxically sees him pinned in an instant thanks to a desperate as effective sudden action by the latter. In short, the new strategic additions and the unprecedented visualization of the athlete's physical state totally change the gameplay experience. Which of course is not all rosy. The question of physical tiredness and unexpected victory/defeat can sometimes make sense (how many times in reality has a ~dying~ Shawn Michaels managed to pull a sweet chin music out of his hat and win?), at others it seemed a little forced, a sign It is clear that some dynamics linked to the relationship between speed and resistance should perhaps be better balanced in the future. We have also noticed that with the R2 backbone, i.e. the one used for countermoves, there is often a certain latency between the command given and the execution of the move, which is actually very annoying given the importance of this form of advance in the economy of a match. Not to mention that, but this is if anything a subjective ~defect~, the slower pace makes the games more difficult to play and at more advanced difficulty levels it takes a certain effort to win them. In any case, the title was conceived in its mechanics with the intention of encouraging you to play with all the trappings of the case, so much so that artificial intelligence is also added to make everything more complicated, which really gives a lot hard time for the gamer. Thanks to it, the behavior of the opponents is more aggressive and attentive to what happens in the ring, with all the complications involved. Like on TV The long examination of WWE 2K15 can only be concluded by taking a look at the technical sector. As for the graphics, we are witnessing a significant improvement compared to the previous title. Thanks to the new Eco Motion engine that debuted with NBA 2K14 and which guarantees the maximum possible realism on facial and body scans, most of the athletes have been reproduced perfectly in every detail, from faces to physiques, from moles to imperfections skin, tattoos, sweat. Admittedly, a few ~Divas~ in particular and a couple of the older wrestlers aren't very defined when compared to their male or more recent counterparts (2002 Shawn Michaels looks like a botulism rejection victim", "date": "2014-11-26", "grade": "7.5"}
