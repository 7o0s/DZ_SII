Beamdog's intent is clear: to capitalize on the Baldur's Gate series, monetizing with a quick and easy-to-grab product for those who loved the original series. After all, between the first Baldur's Gate and the second there really was a hole, so why not fill it for the nostalgics to use and consume? When such operations are carried out, it should always be kept in mind that a narrative hole is not necessarily negative and, on the contrary, helps a lot in identification. The time passed between the events narrated in Baldur's Gate and the sequel made us suppose a relatively calm period for the son of Bhaal, a period which, nestled between the field events narrated in the two games, made them more natural and, in a certain sense, plausible assuming a life off the screen that was not to be told. Siege of Dragonspear actually goes to create an even bigger hole than it claims to fill, because if it is true that we now know what happened between Baldur's Gate, we also know that the facts narrated in the new game have no reflection in Baldur's Gate 2, where instead the references to the first chapter are very many. It will seem like a small matter to you, but it is not. In short, the feeling for the entire campaign against the Shining Lady Caelar Argent is more that of being in a parallel universe than in a new Baldur's Gate, despite the fact that the game system is identical to that of the original (more properly than the Enhanched Edition) and although in the long run it is not an unpleasant adventure to live. We have reviewed Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear. Find out how it is, controversies aside The starting point The game begins in the dungeons of the city of Baldur's Gate, right after the battle with Sarevok. If you want, you can import your character from a save from the first episode, or you can start with a well-equipped seventh level party (starting everyone from scratch would have been absurd). There are still some matters to close with the servants of the now deceased boss, before we can consider the matter closed. However, after exploring a large dungeon and slicing some people, our heroes can finally get back to their routine... or so they think, because there is soon a new enemy that threatens the peace and existence same as the Sword Coast: the aforementioned Shining Lady Caelar Argent and her crusade. Will we be able to stop it, together with a large army, reaching the castle of Dragonspear? No rest for brave Boo. Reformed the party must leave immediately. Assuming that if you are reading about Siege of Dragonspear you know Baldur's Gate (also because if you don't have the Enhanced Edition of the first one you can't play it), let's try to understand what this expansion really offers and why we consider it successful, but not until in conclusion. Mizhena's sexuality We received the Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear review code a few days after the long controversy that arose on the internet due to the presence of content deemed controversial by a certain political group. The question is complex - we cannot overlook it - and is focused in particular on three elements (actually on two, with the third arriving later as a side dish): the presence of the transgender Mizhena. A joke from Minsc about the #GamerGate, which will be removed in the next update; and the stories of two female characters, enriched by the writers of Beamdog, to give them greater depth. Now, it is not the purpose of the review to discuss these details too much, also because they anticipate some content that you may want to discover for yourself. The only element we want to add to the controversy is that of the approximately twenty-five hours that this expansion lasts, the contents that created all this chaos occupy a few seconds. In short, even if they were the worst lines of dialogue in the world, put into the mouths of the worst characterized characters in human cultural history, they would have only a minimal impact on the overall experience. Mizhena in particular is met only once and, if desired, one can also avoid talking to her. Having said that, for the record it must be said that his dialogue is very forced and his ~revelation~ is presented very badly. But we reiterate that it is the classic drop in the bucket, one of the many role-playing dialogues that are forgotten ten seconds after reading them. It would be like misjudging The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for an understated chat in one of the many inns (and there are). However, if we want the subject to be treated more fully, we will perhaps do so in a dedicated special, so as to understand ifthe real problem is a bad character or more properly his sexuality. Exploration and role play The biggest difference between Siege of Dragonspear and the main chapters is the structure of the missions. If you recall, Baldur's Gate allowed you to freely explore a number of locations and Baldur's Gate 2 had refined the system to better suit the narrative. Siege of Dragonspear is much more linear from this point of view, i.e. it does not allow you to move as you want, but provides a much clearer progression so that once you arrive in certain places, after some narrative turns, it is no longer possible to go back. Typically, two areas can be explored at a time, then move on to the next as you advance with your army. Each area is full of fights and characters to talk to. There is no shortage of explorable areas and assorted twists and turns, which make the progression pleasant. In short, there is no great freedom, but it is amply compensated for by something else. It must also be said that it is precisely the type of story that would have ill adapted to a more open world. Speaking of the campaign itself, it is easy to say that it is focused on combat, even if there are characters to talk to, situations that can be overcome without violence and some small puzzles that never hurt. In general, the maps are full of things to do and there are several interesting dialogues to read. Above all, the Shining Lady Caelar Argent is a well-defined character and not easily interpreted. But there are also other interesting situations, such as characters who initially refuse to join the group, only to give in in the later stages, or still others who reveal an unexpected humanity. However, not all screenplay work is of a good standard. For example, the generic sentences of the side characters often end up being ridiculous, breaking the atmosphere a bit, while some secondary characters speak according to a logic of their own. Fortunately, the worst is expressed in sequences of little importance for the narrative, but there is no doubt that we pay attention. Still speaking of texts, in this case spoken, fans of the saga will be happy to hear the voices of the original voice actors again, provided they played the English version at the time. Unfortunately, Italian is not supported, neither in writing nor in speech. Technical Problems One of the most critical aspects of Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear is the technical side. No, we are not referring to the dated graphics, which do exactly what they are supposed to: be in line with those of Baldur's Gate of the past. Updating it would have produced more problems than advantages, given that the minimum of stylistic coherence necessary in such cases would have completely disappeared. Sure, the blurry effect of the sprites isn't great, but we were prepared that nothing would change and it did. Unfortunately Beamdog hasn't done a good job of stability and bugs abound. Some in particular have proved to be particularly annoying and the game crashes with returns to the desktop are not lacking. They have not been as frequent as some claim, but have occurred on several occasions. Honestly, even the interface would have benefited from some tweaks, perhaps taking an example from Obsidian's Pillars of Eternity (an evolution of that of the titles that ran with the Infinity Engine). Above all, party selection and inventory management could have been revised for the better, but these are details that fans of the original Baldur's Gate will pay little attention to. After all, Siege of Dragonspear is aimed at them.", "date": "2016-04-15", "grade": "7.0"}
