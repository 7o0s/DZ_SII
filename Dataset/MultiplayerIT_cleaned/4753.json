Someone, more daring, may have organized a tournament in Puyo Puyo Tetris among the school desks. After all, the appeal of Nintendo hardware lies not only in being an ingenious hybrid between portable and home console, but above all in the emphasis that the small Joy-Cons place on the multiplayer experience. This is why, upon seeing the features and potential of the console, the developers of the English team Ghost Town Games did not think twice before making a port of their acclaimed Overcooked. Winner of multiple awards and voted one of the best party games of last year, Overcooked is light-hearted, colourful, requires you to collaborate and inspires friends to talk to each other all the time. Now, on Switch, he may have found the perfect recipe. The dish is served The idea behind Overcooked couldn't be simpler: take the classic Diner Dash and bring it back to multiplayer. In increasingly improbable kitchens, the goal is in fact to collaborate with other friends to prepare the dishes that are gradually requested by the customers, following a linear procedure: keep an eye on the orders, collect the right ingredients, chop them , cook them, plate them and deliver them. Dirty dishes must obviously be washed, after which the round starts again. Each level adds new recipes and new mechanics to take into account, not to mention distractions and unpredictable changes to the scenario: in one kitchen there are little mice who steal ingredients left unattended, in another you have to interact by passing dishes through a conveyor belt, while shifting tables, earthquakes and pools of lava push you to adapt and quickly change your strategy. Regardless of whether you are playing in two, three or four, the developers have been smart enough to make sure that each participant has to take on more tasks, dividing the jobs and trying to optimize times. Whether you play with your partner or with your roommates makes no difference. There's no time for ~please~, and the imperative is the only verb allowed. ~You wash the dishes and prepare the meat, I put it in the pan and serve~; ~Cut the tomatoes and then make the burgers~; ~Quick with that onion!~. In a short time the living room has turned into an episode of Hell's Kitchen, the tones warm up and friendships shatter into a thousand pieces. It is also possible to play single-player, switching between chefs, but alone Overcooked is much more difficult and infinitely more boring. This is why the Special Edition published on Nintendo Switch had all the credentials to be the best version: in addition to containing all the levels, characters and additional recipes published with The Lost Morsel and The Festive Seasoning DLCs, the for Switch fully supports console portability. Two friends can play simply by using the two Joy-Con attached to the console, but just have an additional pair of controllers to extend the experience up to four people on the same screen. HD Rumble support allows you to have different types of vibration depending on what's going on in the game, and while it's not a revolutionary addition, it lets you know right away if your partner is currently busy chopping ingredients or if there's something it's burning on the stove. Unfortunately, in terms of performance, Overcooked on Switch falls short of the versions published on the other platforms: where the game maintains 60 frames per second on PC and 30 on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, this Special Edition is clearly less fluid. Most of the time the fact that you struggle to hold up 30 frames doesn't create big problems, mind you, but the experience certainly becomes less pleasant in the more flashy levels, such as the tutorial, the world of lava and the already very difficult final stage , where every second counts and every wrong action due to delayed commands can lead to game over.", "date": "2017-07-29", "grade": "7.8"}
