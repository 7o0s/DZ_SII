Downwell is a masterpiece that every gamer must try Cracking gameplay Downwell narrates the fall of a boy down a well in which he meets various enemies eager to put a spoke in his wheels and prevent him from reaching the bottom; the special boots he wears come to his aid, equipped with every possible armament. The premise, thus presented, does not seem to be entirely attractive but five minutes of play are enough to understand the true potential and after no more than half an hour you can already glimpse how cleverly this little pearl has been designed. The only way to make your way through the hordes of monsters is to use gravity to your advantage, whether you decide to tackle a level without shooting but simply jumping on the heads of unsuspecting victims, or causing carnage with shotguns or lethal lasers. To ensure the necessary precision, the controls must be absolutely reactive, given that a good dose of reflexes are needed to be able to successfully complete each stage and in this the title is superlative: two buttons are dedicated to left and right movement while only one allows you to jump and then open fire while suspended in the air. It takes very little time to learn how to command the protagonist efficiently, but this is not enough to be able to survive: at the beginning the boots are equipped with a low-powered weapon with a short range, but as you continue to descend they can find caves where different power-ups are hidden. They range from the classic shotgun with a large pattern to a whole series of intermediate cannons with drastically different characteristics, to then discover the very powerful laser that causes huge damage but is difficult to use. At the completed level you can choose a permanent modifier that alters the method by which you have to approach the following worlds: for example it is possible to deploy a support drone, enable a function that launches a projectile from destroyed blocks or be accompanied by a balloon. These are just examples of what is possible to select, but what really matters is how these modifiers can be reconciled with the available arsenal, being careful not to find yourself in unpleasant situations without the right combination; the action is always very frenetic but a certain amount of attention and strategy is still required from the user, who must constantly consider whether or not it is advantageous to equip himself with a certain power-up based on the enemies present, dive down until to the finish line or face the monsters one by one. Never as in this case must the head and muscles be perfectly synchronized and complementary, given that facing a level in a disorganized manner most of the time leads to death, due to the limited lives that can only be recovered by purchasing them in the shop present in each stage or by running a particularly difficult combo. Furthermore, all weapons have a limited number of bullets in the magazine and the only way to receive new ones is to touch the ground, but to perform an aforementioned combo it is necessary to jump from one enemy to another without ever touching the ground, so you understand that the gameplay mechanics have been studied in a very meticulous way precisely to push the player to constantly have to make choices that radically transform the style of play. Simplicity pays off Graphically, the title looks very good, with a clear reference to the good old days of the NES, thanks to the intelligent use of colors that serve to distinguish the passive elements from the active and potentially dangerous ones. However, if the default palette is not to your liking, very little is needed to drastically change the look: by collecting a certain number of gems, which appear when an NPC is killed, new graphic designs are gradually unlocked which can be selected to satisfy the tastes of each of you. Similarly, proceeding in the adventure it is possible to enable new fighting styles that substantially change the approachor necessary to successfully complete a stage: for example one allows you to start with six life points but completely eliminates the shops, while another reduces gravity by decreasing the speed of falling and so on. The sound part, meanwhile, helps to create an atmosphere that is both dark and dynamic thanks to the exceptional soundtrack and the minimal but expertly used effects. The review has only scraped the surface of a product that is in no uncertain terms a true masterpiece and unequivocally a future classic of the action genre, but the beauty of this title lies precisely in the discovery of its intricate game mechanics and incredibly satisfying gameplay to be almost a drug. Add to all this the fact that the levels are generated randomly but never in such a way as to be frustrating, indeed there is always a precise logic that can be found in every world, ensuring a very high replay value, and the price of only 2.99  that defining shredded would be an understatement. The only flaw? Perhaps the difficulty that does not allow mistakes, but in any case it is never so high as to be frustrating and such as to ruin a game that is otherwise a masterpiece. Furthermore, it is recommended to play it on PC with a controller, given that on the display of an iPhone it becomes more difficult to successfully govern the protagonist and a greater adaptation phase is required, but it is not in the least an insurmountable obstacle.", "date": "2015-10-23", "grade": "9.0"}
