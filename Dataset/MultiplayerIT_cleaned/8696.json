I Am Alive showed a Chicago destroyed by a terrible earthquake of unknown origins, crossed by the young Adam, who survived in search of the girl. The trailer also showed flashbacks to the moments before the cataclysm, the last remnants of serenity before the advent of lethal, suffocating, funereal dust. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since then, but not a single shadow of images or more detailed information. It was therefore rather obvious that there was more than one fear about the health of the project, entrusted to the Darkworks of Alone In The Dark. With a real twist, however, Ubisoft announced the shift of work to the Shanghai division, declaring that they would start practically from scratch, and the release exclusively relegated to the digital market. A gestation that to define as troubled is an understatement, perhaps crushed by its own, disproportionate ambitions, but what matters is that the title is finally in our greedy hands... excluding the optical medium. You are strong dad But something has actually changed. The whole game is now a giant flashback, made from footage found in Adam Collins's video camera. The man is in search of his wife and daughter, both missing after the cataclysm that reduced the city of Haventon to a grotesque pile of stones and metal. The skyscrapers draw sinister diagonal lines in the sky, visibility is at a minimum and the lower part of the urban agglomeration is totally invaded by dust. In this scenario of pure catastrophic vein we find ourselves living the adventures of Adam and the survivors. The arrival in the city is marked by total solitude, with our hero committed not to succumb to the rubble and their inhospitable inhabitants. One of the first and most relevant characteristics of the game immediately catches the eye, its brutal realism. As widely anticipated, the developers have omitted any supernatural cue, so there are no indestructible mutants or otherworldly evocations. The new monsters are the result of the collapse of social conventions, which have given way to animalistic degradation, selfishness and madness. The streets offer unpleasant encounters with homeless people, refugees, crazed military men and ruthless looters. The attitudes vary from the exaggerated protection of the presumed possessions, up to the actual hostility. The game puts very little restraint in recreating a totally degenerate atmosphere, with episodes of violence, rape, cannibalism, insults and beatings. Any form of dialogue is useless in these situations, the player is left with only the choice whether to flee or fight, and the second eventuality in the Ubisoft Shanghai production proves to be very painful. However we are not completely alone on this journey, since later in the game we find ourselves escorting a lively little girl, the fierce mother and a mysterious ~guardian angel~ who follows our events in a wheelchair ... Higher and higher I Am Alive reaffirms in no uncertain terms that it belongs to the survival horror genre, titles where the player is placed in a situation of perennial disadvantage and precariousness, with ammunition and provisions reduced to the bone. The developers evidently know the exponents of the genre very well, especially the Silent Hill saga by Konami, taken up almost obsessively starting from the sounds of the menus, the map display and the exploitation of the poor visual field, which becomes so horror metaphysical. The desire to bring the title closer to the world of platformers has brought other illustrious colleagues into the cauldron of ingredients, from Sony's Uncharted to Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed, even if the differences are perceptible and make I Am Alive a title that thrives on a own dimension. As already described in our preview, the climbing system involves the consumption of a special stamina bar, which once depleted leads to a condition of physical effort. In this desperate situation, the player is forced to frantically press the right trigger to avoid falling into the void, a gimmick that creates a tension never seen before in a platform game. As if that weren't enough, the bar can only be restored by consuming food such as food and bottles of water, present in limited quantities on the map and necessary to save the survivors we will meet on our journey. In the case of fights, however, the shot switches to first person view, proposing a decidedly original system. Also in this case the title adopts a realistic solutiona, with clashes that end in seconds and leave us with considerable decision-making power. We can induce opponents to surrender by threatening them with a pistol, surprise them from behind or strike them silently with the aid of a lethal bow. Or we can simply escape trying to disperse the pursuers and then face them individually. Late in the game, opponents wearing special bulletproof suits take over, and who need to be hit on the head, or more simply avoided. Whatever happens, know that the bullets are present in extremely limited quantities and a special weapon, the shotgun, is even a unique and non-reloadable specimen. Xbox 360 goals I Am Alive offers the canonical 200 player points, divided along 12 objectives, or the classic Live Arcade standards. Don't take this lightly though, getting half the points involves the conclusion of the entire adventure and the rescue of at least half of the twenty survivors to be recovered. To get them all you will need to complete the game twice, and in Survivor mode, a special difficulty level that eliminates instant checkpoints and reduces both supplies and ammo: only for the really tough ones. Not a city for asthmatics Another feature is the suffocating presence of dust in the lower parts of the city, which we find ourselves traveling to get to the various locations. These traits inexorably consume the energy bar, leading to instant death in the event of its depletion. The only way to get some air, in every sense, is to use inhalers and drinks (obviously limited), or go back temporarily to the upper floors. It is therefore necessary to plan the journeys with some caution, since the eventuality of getting lost risks being paid dearly. I Am Alive is essentially a title based on times, where the player is warmly urged to understand in advance an already established but not always easy to read path, when pleasantly confused by alternative or supplementary roads. We are not essentially faced with free roaming as some would have hoped, but a linear adventure with a fair margin of exploration. To make the experience less traumatic, the programmers have inserted instant checkpoints, represented by the camera batteries, which can also be collected in the game. A very original idea, although those who want to finish the game in Survivor mode will have to give up this convenience. For our part, we finished the adventure taking a total time of eight hours. Compared to the preview code, which presented a very excited first part, a second one is added that is more inclined to recycling and backtracking, with areas to be retraced several times and only partially justified by the use of a grappling hook. The last part clearly suffers from a decline in ideas, relying a little too much on derivative fights and locations, even if the one set in a skyscraper remains intact, absolutely among the most successful. Unfortunately, a certain general rigidity remains, not facilitated by the slight delay in the controls, nothing that could affect playability, but we would have liked more dynamism and greater interaction with the surrounding environment, completely imperturbable if we exclude the pre-calculated events. As far as the technical profile is concerned, we are dealing with an engine that testifies to the downsizing of production, as well as the transition to digital format, on the other hand, the size of the game - less than 2 GB - is already very significant. Different textures lack in definition, as well as the polygonal load, focused more on the protagonist, but rather lacking in the surrounding elements. Everything is slightly mitigated by an exasperated video dirt (almost nothing is in focus), an effective gimmick and all in all consistent with the situation, provided you don't dwell too much on the details. Despite what has been said, we must applaud Ubisoft Shanghai for the artistic direction, with a poetic use of colors, which become warmer in moments of relaxation, and an atmosphere always full of pathos.
