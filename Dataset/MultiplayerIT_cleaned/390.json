{"name": "Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viewtiful-joe-red-hot-rumble.html", "text": "The slaughter Red Hot Rumble is the PSP incarnation of the beat'em up a la Smash Bros. released on Gamecube at the beginning of the year and protagonist of a decent flop especially at a critical level. Leaving aside the questionable decision by Capcom to carry out a transposition, it seems appropriate to immediately underline how Red Hot Rumble on PSP retains (almost) all the strengths and weaknesses of the previous version, revealing itself substantially incapable of reviving the fate of an objectively unsuccessful product. The premises of the product are therefore completely similar: by playing the role of one of over 20 characters available (some taken from the series, others extras such as Dante from Devil May Cry), the user is called to face a whole series of stages disguised as action sequences of improbable film productions, fighting against one, two or three opponents to achieve objectives. Red Hot Rumble on PSP retains (almost) all the strengths and weaknesses of the Gamecube version The slaughter These vary from collecting the greatest number of bonuses to killing as many enemies as possible and so on, in a constant race for supremacy within dynamic scenarios but still limited by barriers. Each level (or rather, script) is also made up of several distinct sections and to be tackled progressively, with the last one always dedicated to a fight with a boss. It seems quite clear that the ideas behind Red Hot Rumble are not bad, especially from a multiplayer perspective: but it doesn't take much to notice how the Capcom production misses the target in many fundamental aspects. Starting with the characters, extremely unbalanced to the point that some are practically unusable. But the real cross of the title lies in the excessive confusion developed by the on-screen action, such as to make it even impossible in various situations to simply identify one's character: coins, diamonds, enemies, explosions and so on invade in a completely absurd way and disproportionate the playing area, making Red Hot Rumble a beat'em up whose fruition is largely entrusted to instinct and randomness... Try again, Joe The total anarchy of the events displayed on the screen overwhelms substantially every playful aspect of the Capcom production, largely nullifying the potential of the title. Therefore, the discreet repertoire of moves available to each character (which can be carried out using the combinations of the two attack keys - normal and super - and the analog stick) finds a very limited application in a situation of chaos such as the one described so far. Again, the typical VFX Powers of the series, present here in the form of ~disposable~ orbs in four versions (slow, mach speed, sound effects and zoom), in addition to not being particularly effective, contribute to further increase the confusion on the screen. As soon as the opponents go up to two or three, the situation becomes really dramatic Try again, Joe All in all, however, Red Hot Rumble is still playable in one-on-one challenges: but as soon as the opponents go up to two or three, the situation becomes truly dramatic. This negatively affects not only the more advanced stages of the single player, but above all the ad hoc multiplayer for four players, which immediately goes from a theoretically most interesting aspect of the entire package to an option to be forgotten as soon as possible. More reasonable, if not exciting, the game-sharing mode for two users, if only because it allows you to play with only one UMD. However full of extras to unlock, Red Hot Rumble is therefore a title that is hardly capable of entertaining for long, which is a pity even in the light of an excellent technical realization: special effects, colors and changes of plane and shot are wasted , with well-delineated characters who move in a fluid and convincing way. A small feast for the eyes, which however suffers a bit from the combination of a small screen and the enormous chaos that develops on it. Comment Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble is simply a good conversion of a title of only sufficient quality. The Capcom product also suffers on PSP from the same problems as the Gamecube incarnation, translated into a weak play structure, an unsatisfactory multiplayer and an intense and perpetual confusion in the game action, here even greater due to the small screen size. Although graphically excellent and bearer of some surplus compared to the previous version, Red Hot Rumble remains the most disappointing exploit of the Clover Studios superhero even on PSP. Pros Great graphics Large amount of levels and characters Cons On-screen action too confusing Game structureincomplete Mutliplayer unmanageable As Spiderman teaches, with great power comes great responsibility. But evidently, the tamarrissimo Viewtiful Joe must never have given too much weight to such words, considering how after the -deserved- success of the first chapter of the series he used his powers for not exactly noble purposes. In fact, our Joe did not hesitate to quickly transform himself into a super parsley, coming up with a conventional sequel just one year later and launching himself into not entirely successful projects such as the Double Trouble on DS and the Red Hot Rumble on Gamecube. And it is precisely of this last title that we find ourselves talking now, on the occasion of its conversion to PSP.", "date": "2006-08-07", "grade": null}
