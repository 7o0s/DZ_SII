The same game scheme has now been applied to all titles of this type in the mobile field for some years now, so we are essentially faced with the same game experience seen from Motorsport Manager onwards, with some variations that derive above all from the free-to-play essence (and you already know that this can only lead to unpleasant elements in terms of balance) and partly from the new updated licenses. In practice, we are faced with the harmful effects of the most standard serialization that there can be, or the novelty effect derived almost exclusively from the inclusion of new names and brands updated to the last season of Formula One and very little else. F1 Clash follows the known pattern between race and driver management For the rest, the positive aspects remain, but also the less appreciable drifts of a game set on a monetization that focuses on micro-transactions, an effect further increased by being based on the PvP multiplayer challenge. The result is an overall assessment that does not change much from the one that already characterized F1 Manager, i.e. practically the same game by the same authors released a couple of years ago, before the particular name change decided in recent months for this new chapter. Or rather, a variation can be detected in line with the choice of the new title: the ~clash~ instead of ~manager~ underlines the competitive essence of this mobile title, which is increasingly based on the direct confrontation between two players and less on the strategic planning of the team. Probably, the choice to entrust the original name to the new project in the hands of Frontier Development highlights even more the desire to differentiate this mobile title, set on fast and dynamic free-to-play challenges, from the real managerial one with all the trappings of the case that is being prepared in the British studios of David Braben and associates, or so we hope for PC and console users. Racing head to head The structure of the game has remained substantially the same as F1 Manager, this being practically a rebranding or so, with a few marginal variations: it is about managing the Formula One team from the preparation stages, with the adjustment of the car and the engagement and training of pilots, to the behavior to be adopted in the race. Drivers and mechanical parts of the cars mainly depend on the conquest of cards, which can be obtained by winning races, waiting for the unlocking of free chests or obviously through micro-transactions, with the obvious differences in drop rates depending on the rarity and value of these . There are no great arguments to be made about it: the rarest cards are the most powerful and the mechanism is extremely linear, simply requiring you to possibly hire the most capable pilots, upgrade them when possible by spending in-game currency and apply the cards relating to the various components of the car as new and more powerful ones appear. F1 Clash allows you to control various basic aspects from car handling to racing The more active and reasoned gameplay appears only in the heart of the race, with the direct management of the two racing drivers. Also in this case we don't have control of the vehicles, but we can set the direction of the race by choosing the attitude of the drivers based on the three speed levels to be sustained, deciding when to make the pit stop and which type of tires to use. Obviously, excessive stress on the engine given by an overly aggressive and fast attitude leads to greater consumption of tires and petrol, therefore it is necessary to know how to best measure the behavior of the drivers and decide at the right time when and how to change tires and refuel . This is it: in these decisions practically all the gameplay of F1 Clash is resolved, taking up on the other hand the now canonical structure of this genre, consolidated above all by the excellent Motorsport Manager. The main problem of this version by Hutch is the fact that the free-to-play mechanism and the randomness of the cards, all within a competitive multiplayer context inevitably leads to pay to win. For the rest, F1 Clash can count on the official license of the Formula One Championship and it is no small thing, considering the appeal that the original names can exercise on users. Nonetheless, the gameit carries with it practically the same defects of the previous chapter, being to all intents and purposes the same game with minimal adjustments, without particular progressions visible even in the technical field.", "date": "2021-05-21", "grade": "6.3"}
