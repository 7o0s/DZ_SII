On July 4, 1947, a UFO crashed near the town of Roswell. The US Air Force committed an immense amount of economic and human means to hide from the world the fall of the object and the discovery of several bodies. All the people who witnessed the scene were discredited, setting up sometimes ridiculous covers, so much so that tricks were often devised to cover the ~covers~. After 50 years, we know that the UFO in question never existed: it was a simulation recreated by man, and that the bodies were poor corpses disguised as aliens. Who is behind this incredible staging, and above all why make people believe the fall of a UFO, and then discredit it? In complete confidence, I can tell you about the Global Alliance. What I am about to tell you is my spiritual testament: once these data are revealed, my life will be in danger and I will have to flee. The hoax organized in New Mexico was intended to divert attention from the aliens. Thinking only of them as defenseless little green beings at the mercy of ruthless American scientists, people could not notice the bloodthirsty ones already free to roam among us. These evil aliens have been living among us for a long time: they take our form and kill us as they please; no one knows where they are and how many they actually are: we just know that they are there! Fantasies? Paranoid? What is the truth: that governments from all over the world are plotting against us so as not to let us see reality, or that aliens are really small green beings who, during the exploration of the NASA probe on Mars, hid behind stones so as not to be seen? Do you want to know who these bloodthirsty aliens are then? My friends, it's not hard to understand: think of all the stories told as ~legends~ that speak of evil spirits, vampires, werewolves. Why do these ~legends~ recur in every culture, even in the most primitive and remote? Simple, because we have always never accepted the idea that we humans are not at the top of the evolutionary chain, and we have hidden the reality from our eyes, namely that there are superior ~beings~ free to circulate among us. What will the Mona Lisa have to laugh about? Well: the other night I was just drinking with the head of the Alliance: after a few glasses too many the guy melted by telling me what follows: the Aliens, they are only now at the beginning of their invasion; their planet is very distant and the reports sent by these first ~emissaries~ have now reached their base. The Alliance doesn't have a plan: they only know that there is a family of people in the world who have the ability to reveal the presence of aliens: after the death of his grandfather and father, only Nick Logan remains alive. In his battle to save the world, I know he can only count on an ex-alien, converted to the cause of humans: Sh'Lainn Blaze. The mission is desperate: the world must not know that these aliens live among us: disorder, chaos, looting; civilian life as we know it would end. Even after knowing these things, I risk going crazy: I no longer trust anyone, not even you. GOODBYE! A tight weave!! This is the plot of the game, at least the one narrated in the first 4 pages of the manual. Beyond the psychotropic grips that some substances have on my mind, and which have only marginally changed the plot, Red Storm must be acknowledged for having thought of an excellent story, difficult to find in other games. A tight weave!! Imagine the good mood that had pervaded me after the discovery of such a beautiful story, and of a manual all in Italian, moreover translated well. I was a happy reviewer: I thought about the hours of wholesome fun, and why not I was a little worried about how many batteries I would consume with this Roswell Conspiracies! Problems are like dysentery, they all come together (popular saying) In fact, I had to have the first signs that something was wrong: there was no save stack (in its place a password system), and Italian was missing from the selectable languages at the start of the game. English, French, German: as usual the developers have put us in Serie B, with Uganda, Puerto Rico and Tasmania (with respect for our foreign friends) The game in all non-interactive parts, looks like a comic strip, i.e. with the drawing of a character and the cloud where the texts scroll (in my case in English). The options allow you to set difficulty, and disable music and effects. Don't ask why one would turn off music and effects:rather ask yourself, why would a player leave them on! The technical realization of these interlude scenes denounces a certain care, the images are really beautiful, just as all in all the graphics are pleasant. The city maps (both on foot and by car) are large and quite varied: it is possible to enter some buildings and collect power ups, useful for catching aliens faster. Generally the game consists of one or more search and capture sections, a couple of driving sections, and an end-of-level boss. The idea isn't a bad one, even if terribly monotonous: getting to face mission 1 in Paris with a smile on your lips means being ready for an iron-clad rule proposed by law 180. What really hurts, however, are the controls: let's start with the pitiful list of flaws: the poor character can move in eight directions, therefore also diagonally: is there anyone who can explain to me why the speed of the walk (exceptionally slow and cumbersome) increases for no reason if you move diagonally? Or is there one of the creators who can tell me why large maps have been created without thinking of putting a button for running? Shooting is also very difficult, especially from an angle. I wrote too much, I better finish. We evaluate this game: the plot is the best there is around, and it gets a good 10 and praise! The technical implementation is more than satisfactory, with large and well-detailed cities: 9. The animations compared to other GameBoy Color games are more than acceptable: 7. The controls and the longevity, undermined by a repetitiveness of the schemes, are instead not all height of the rest. I wrote too much, I better finish. The sound, on the other hand, I think is more the result of chance than of any design! I honestly can't advise against this game, just as I can't recommend it to everyone. The discriminating factor for purchasing is the ~resistance to fatigue~ of each player: if you are a true enthusiast who never gets tired of playing, you have found an overall good title, equipped with sublime ideas: however, if you are like me (i.e. get tired of little varied gameplay soon) I highly recommend the rental Bertocci ~RED~ Daniele Paris is worth 5 codes (modern version) I searched the net for passwords but couldn't find them. This is how I leave you the codes to pass the London level.

I tell you, just to show you that I'm not an idiot, even if I write reviews, like this one and only for GameBoy Color. Okay???", "date": "2001-07-18", "grade": null}
