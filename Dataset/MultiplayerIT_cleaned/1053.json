{"name": "Metal Slug Advance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-slug-advance.html", "text": "Leftover metal From the first moments of the game, it is evident that Metal Slug Advance has little or nothing to envy to their respective Neo Geo matrix counterparts. For those who have never dealt with the SNK series, it is enough to know that it is rightfully among the most famous two-dimensional platform/shooter in history, with a concept as simple as it is effective: in fact, you need to guide your character through a series of scenarios by shooting to everything that moves using an arsenal made up of firearms and grenades, without sparing sections aboard armored vehicles. On the other hand, those who are familiar with the series will certainly immediately notice the graphic aspect of Metal Slug Advance, completely similar to that of their ~older brothers~. Sprites, colors and backgrounds reproduce in an optimal way the typical style of the saga, with the only differences found in the loss (more than understandable) of some animation frames and in the total absence of blood in the game, a choice obviously more of a moral nature than exquisitely technical. In any case, the Metal Slug Advance cosmetics can only make fans of the series and non-fans happy, thanks to the fidelity to the original titles that makes the visual sector of the SNK product absolutely noteworthy. Loyalty can certainly also be talked about with regard to the play structure of Metal Slug Advance, although there are still some exclusive features of this Game Boy Advance version. However, the basic architecture of the game has remained unchanged, with the usual hordes of soldiers and tanks to be annihilated, possibly using the power ups obtainable by destroying some elements of the scenario or as a gift following the release of the prisoners. In short, old-school shoot'em up action that still continues to be extremely fun and exciting, and which is perfectly at ease inside a handheld. Old & new The first novelty in the gameplay of Metal Slug Advance is instead represented by the presence of an energy bar (which, moreover, can be filled through special bonuses), where in the previous chapters a single hit was sufficient to decree the loss of a life. As is to be expected, this feature makes the game much easier than the others, which, combined with the presence of only five stages and an autofire option, certainly does not work in favor of the longevity of the SNK title. In fact, completing the adventure normally does not require more than an afternoon, but fortunately the developers have overcome such a gap in a rather ingenious way. In fact, within the various scenarios there are cards to collect: some are useful only for informational purposes (such as those relating to the descriptions of weapons and objects), while others give the user the possibility of gaining extra offensive skills and tools. The fact is that these cards, in addition to being quite challenging to recover in their entirety, are definitively delivered to the player only if he completes the relative stage without losing a single life. In the face of an innate structural brevity, therefore, Metal Slug Advance offers this pleasant expedient, embellished by a Hard mode with obvious implications. It must be said that the all too diligent respawn of enemies can make the backtracking necessary for the recovery of certain cards annoying, but the basic concept remains a valid constituent of replay value. In short, however short, the playful experience of Metal Slug Advance certainly proves to be fun and for this reason it stimulates to be faced more than once. Comment Metal Slug Advance successfully manages to bring the series to the Nintendo handheld, effectively re-proposing the gameplay that made it enter the history of video games. The short duration of the adventure (compensated in any case by the card collection system) and the lowering of the general difficulty level could make purists turn up their noses, but the quality of the graphics and the solidity of the well-tested game structure make Metal Slug Advance a title definitely to be recommended to fans. Pros: Fun gameplay Great graphics Good replay value Cons: Only five stages Can get repetitive After having already experimented with the portable dimension with two excellent titles for the underrated Neo Geo Pocket, the Metal Slug series plunges back into the handheld market, this time with the more famous Game Boy Advance. Strengthened by a playful platform with technical specifications far superior to the SNK pocket console, this new Metal Slug Advance can finally offer the vast majority ofcharacteristics that have made the series a classic of two-dimensional shooters.
