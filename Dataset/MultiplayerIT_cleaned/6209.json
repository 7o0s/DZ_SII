For example, there are those who have thought of replacing human beings with rocket-powered machines, as in the case of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, one of those titles that went unnoticed upon release only to be rediscovered at a later time. Psyonix's previous work was a real gem, especially for the level of fun offered by its crazy dynamics: in fact, the game featured small cars as protagonists, engaged in playing a football match. Since then, it took six years before seeing the San Diego-based team try again with Rocket League, long desired by all those who have had the opportunity to appreciate the first experiment dated 2009: for the occasion, the development team has wisely decided to use a simpler name, without however altering the substance of the game known on PlayStation 3. Rocket League arrived a few days ago in its final version both on PC and on PlayStation 4, where Sony has included it among the free titles intended for PlayStation Plus subscribers, which is why Psyonix's effort represents a tempting prey especially for console owners. We didn't let it get away, playing a good number of games both online and offline: let's see together how it went. Rocket League is as fun as it gets this summer on PC and PlayStation 4! Fun for everyone As already mentioned, Rocket League changes little compared to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars: its mechanics blend football and engines together, uniting them in a mix of explosive fun. In detail, the players control small cars, more or less the size of a radio-controlled car, engaged in a match in which whoever scores the most goals naturally wins, with recourse to the golden goal in the event of a tie after the five minutes of regulation time. As in football, the teams are engaged on a pitch with two goals, where there are no side lines: the field also develops in height, with high barriers on the sides where you can bounce the ball or run with your car. The matches available are of various types: in fact, they range from the single combat challenge in 1 against 1 up to the chaos of 4 against 4, passing through all the intermediate solutions. The player can choose which type to prefer, also deciding whether to play online or offline: an added value not to be overlooked, considering that the competitive nature of Rocket League would suggest a strictly multiplayer game. The season mode is also added to the classic friendly match, where the player can join a team by facing an entire championship against teams controlled by artificial intelligence, as well as their teammates. Remaining offline, we can also switch from training mode, refining our technique with a free session or with one dedicated to a particular role: goalkeeper training will, for example, put us in front of some ball shooters to teach us how to block, while in attack we will have to hit balls at various heights to improve your volleying skills. By going online, you can choose whether to play a match just for glory or take part in a ranked match, through which you can accumulate points to enter the Rocket League leaderboard. Each game played allows the player to unlock an aesthetic element for his car, which can be customized in all its aspects: from shape to color, through wheels and various frills with which to make the look of the car unique. However, it should be noted that this is a purely aesthetic series of changes, given that to guarantee the fairness of the race it is not possible to obtain any element that makes a car different from the others: a clear choice by Psyonix to aim for the world of eSports. Servers and overheating The harsh law of online launches has affected Rocket League, whose servers have exploded in a bad way after the release. The situation is returning to normal and things are already much better, but in some hours of the day it could happen to find too many disruptions. A problem that we have encountered directly also concerns the overheating of the PlayStation 4 within the game menus: Psyonix is already aware and a fix should arrive soon, in the meantime the advice is to close Rocket League before leaving the console for a while. possible break. Playstation 4 trophies Rocket League has a total of 36trophies, of which 1 platinum, 5 gold, 10 silver and 20 bronze. Most of them are about player performance during the match, with epic elements like 6 goals scored in a single match. The other trophies are tied to completing game modes and unlocking customization items. Start rocket The Rocket League control system is designed to be as essential as it is effective, easy to understand but to master only in the long run, arriving after a certain number of games to make spectacular moves with the ball. The basic controls are what you would expect from an arcade racing game, accompanied by two other elements that give the game its high level of spectacularity. In fact, we find a button to jump, to be used to perform scissors and other stunts, flanked by a turbo to be collected on the field: in this case, Rocket League also becomes a bit Destruction Derby, given that after reaching a certain speed it becomes possible to explode the opposing cars by coming into contact with them, thus making them unavailable for a few seconds. Few keys therefore, which however require a good dose of timing to impact the ball at the right time if you want to be useful to the team. Every action carried out successfully offers an absolute level of satisfaction, be it a save or a winning shot on goal after perhaps starting on the counterattack from the area in front of your own goal. In multiplayer Rocket League certainly gives its best, also thanks to the split screen which can be used for home sessions, but it must still be said that the artificial intelligence of the offline mode offers a good way to pass the time. It's impossible to match the unpredictability offered by the presence of other humans in the match, but the CPU-controlled teammates do a good job both offensively and defensively, as well as the opposing team offering a degree of challenge well proportioned to the three different difficulty levels selectable from the options. Everything described so far would be worth little if Rocket League couldn't also boast excellent physics, which makes the playability of this title free from technical problems. Graphically, the game has a good level of detail, with separately visible parts of the grass and a good variety of customization elements that we have already talked about. For the playing fields, perhaps a little more could have been done in terms of diversity, while the 60 frames per second rarely drop only in games in which the rain also appears. The audio sector is excellent, divided between the special effects that perfectly mix the noise of the engines with the classic ones of the stadiums, and a soundtrack in the menus composed by sound designer Mike Ault.", "date": "2015-07-10", "grade": "9.0"}
