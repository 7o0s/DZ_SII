Among these, we can say that the one linked to the Roman Empire has been the favorite of most fans of the brand, to the point of now representing an institution for the genre. A success that became a double-edged sword in 2013, the year of the release of Rome II which took place almost a decade after the arrival on the market of its direct predecessor. A title whose high ambition led the Horsham-based team to make some production errors, forcing them to correct the shot with a series of improvement patches and additional content, with which the Emperor Edition came to life which readjusted the things. Precisely because of the troubled genesis of Rome II, at the announcement of Total War: Attila there are those who turned up their noses, considering less than a year and a half interval between the two episodes of the series too little to ensure that Creative Assembly didn't run into the same mistakes as the old game, especially with an Alien: Isolation in between. Archived the latter, the developers were able to refine Total War: Attila which will officially arrive on our monitors on February 17th: inside it a lot of irons in the fire, with a Roman Empire in the last stages and numerous innovations that the developers have decided to d 'introduce for the occasion, reserving special attention to Attila and his Huns. To live the last years of Rome or to become the Scourge of God? Anything is possible in Total War: Attila! From East to West The Total War: Attila campaign begins in 395 AD, in the years in which the light of Rome is definitively going out on the territories controlled by the Empire. The latter is in fact divided between East and West, respectively under the control of Constantinople and the old capital. With the Roman forces weakened, many peoples began to peep out from the borders, pushing themselves with increasing audacity in looting and direct attacks on both sides, carried out thanks to warriors used to enduring all kinds of sacrifices, not having a fixed abode and to life in constant motion. Apart from the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, the playable factions in Total War: Attila are eight others: they range from populations such as the Visigoths and Vandals up to the aforementioned Huns, accompanied by the Sassanids, the last to dominate Persia before the advent of the Dark Ages. Even with some differences, we can say that the level of challenge and the peculiarities of the gameplay vary a lot depending on the choice, also thanks to the gameplay innovations that Creative Assembly has introduced, bringing a hitherto unedited concept into the Total War series. In the past, we have in fact got to know civilizations in the midst of their expansion, Rome included, but here the perspective is reversed: we are in fact in a Europe where turmoil is the order of the day and the sensation experienced in leading one's forces it is that of an imminent decline at the gates of the Middle Ages, dictated by the presence of various conflicts, but also by particularly adverse weather conditions and by plagues such as the plague which claimed numerous lives. Rewriting history is obviously possible, for example by launching a campaign in which to survive the Eastern Roman Empire, we assure you a difficult undertaking. Or by becoming ourselves the cause of its end by setting fire to the territories in the role of the Huns, a choice which among other things puts the players in a position to see the game in a completely different perspective, making us appreciate the choice of Creative Assembly which he initially had no intention of giving us control of Attila and his fearsome horsemen. But the novelties of this new chapter, as we are about to see, do not stop there. Where I pass, the grass no longer grows The most interesting gameplay dynamic of Total War: Attila is in our opinion precisely the one linked to the barbarian and nomadic populations, called by Creative Assembly ~Horde Mode~ and inherited in its own way from the one already seen in the appreciated Barbarian Invasion expansion of the very first Rome : Total War. Instead of being tied to city centers like other factions, the Hordes have no fixed abode, and can move across the map wherever they see fit. The most striking example is precisely that of the Huns, for whom the absence of control of urban agglomerations is replaced by some mechanics specifically designed to ensure that the faction ensures the supply of food and money. I'm not bornWe say we were particularly curious to ~experience~ this novelty directly, which is why we played our first campaign with the Huns: not having a fixed point of reference made us find ourselves more displaced than we thought, also due to a map that is now really huge. The playing area of Total War: Attila goes from the British borders of the Empire to Persia, from the territories of Russia to those of North Africa, allowing the player to better control his domain through the presence of provinces and governors , able to issue edicts on the area they administer. Returning to our Horde, the camp mode allows units to build ~buildings~ and recruit new troops, through a construction method similar to that of the classic factions: in case of movement, however, you end up losing the various bonuses, forcing the player to plan their actions well to avoid running dry. Moving on to something else, all the factions of the game have a new set of dynamics in common, which continue to bring the Total War series closer to the Crusader Kings grand strategy: each dynasty has its own family tree, to be managed in the best possible way to combine a marriage with which to cement alliances, or prevent our blood relatives from ending up establishing our own domain. The latter situation can also be caused by other more famous exponents of one's own faction: fortunately our defense foresees various possibilities, going from an extreme case such as assassination, to other lighter measures such as cutting available funds. Furthermore, each character develops its own traits alongside skills, which the player can assign through the appropriate game menu. Total war The double strategic nature of the Total War series is obviously also preserved within Attila, thanks to the presence of the inevitable real-time battles. Also from this point of view, Creative Assembly has added some new features, some of which can be found in the short term, while others can be appreciated with a few more hours of play behind. Among the former, a different management of the fatigue of the units can be seen, which now end up getting tired sooner: an encouragement to plan one's moves properly without throwing soldiers around the map, even if fortunately the new system requires them to recover their energies faster. In terms of artificial intelligence, Creative Assembly seems to have made some steps forward both in direct confrontation and in the turn-based phase, making CPU-controlled factions behave less consequentially than our actions, planning their own more. Also noteworthy is a different philosophy behind the automatic resolution of clashes, which has become more uncertain than in the past: it is clear that in this way the developers want to make sure that the players themselves lead their forces in battle, to fully appreciate Total War. The sieges and the way in which they affect both of the main mechanics of the game also deserve a separate discussion: the damage done to the structures in the turn-based phase will also have repercussions in the real-time ones, as well as the destructions carried out in the latter have repercussions on the turn-based phase map. The end of the world Among the various aspects in which Rome II discovered the side of the criticisms there was that concerning the uploads, a historical problem for the Total War series that accentuated with the increase in the units and territories at stake in the various chapters. After already fixing things with the Emperor Edition, Creative Assembly demonstrates that they have taken this matter further to heart also within Total War: Attila, although the waiting periods have not completely disappeared from the game, sometimes forcing some additional second break. To weigh down the workload between one shift and another are above all the two sides of the Roman Empire, grappling with the management of larger territories than those of the other factions. According to what the developers have indicated to us, the average performance of the game should be further optimized very soon. As for the part that remains in the technical sector, the work done by Creative Assembly in Rome II continues here too: we certainly haven't seen unjustified drops below 15 frames per second, as reported for the predecessor, with blows eye more than discreet in the phases in which we are directly engaged in battle. To fully enjoy all the available detail you need to have a rather powerful PC, butthis is also nothing new. Last notes for the multiplayer mode, inherited from the penultimate chapter: the cooperative campaign is accompanied by the online battle, played up to a maximum of 4 vs 4 players, for a substantial reduction compared to Total War: Shogun II, probably in favor of Total War : arena.", "date": "2015-02-12", "grade": "9.0"}
