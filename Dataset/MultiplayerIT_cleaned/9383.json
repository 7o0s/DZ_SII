And when we talk about laptops, generally equal, in terms of computational power, to the home consoles of a generation before, spending little time on projects means going to fish out some titles from one's history and re-proposing them with some modifications. It is not an attitude necessarily to be condemned; it allows programmers to begin to become familiar with the machine by moving on territories already explored, and the public to relive (or experience for the first time) important experiences from the past. What is certain is that Ubi cannot be reproached for having badly chosen the games to be reworked: if for the platform genre it has turned to the immortal Rayman 2, for the stealth/action it has fished out what remains for many Sam Fisher's best adventure: Chaos Theory. Avoid World War III once again Chaos Theory, released in 2005, is the third installment in the series, and while there is debate among fans about its superiority over the HD console installments, the consensus is almost unanimous when referring to the three dedicated to the Xbox/PS2 triad /GameCube. The reason lies in the gameplay mechanics, in the level design and in the now decidedly refined and tested artificial intelligence, as well as in the multiplayer component which also boasted a very exciting online cooperative mode; while as regards the main story very little has changed in this 3DS version, the multiplayer has been completely eliminated, which constitutes, as we will see shortly, a big boulder on the overall evaluation. But let's go in order: the story is, as usual, a political fiction plot, but disturbingly realistic, inspired by the plots of Tom Clancy, and sees dear Fisher still fully operational in Third Echelon. You begin your mission on the trail of a seemingly small-time Peruvian terrorist, as cutscenes detail an ongoing crisis between North Korea and Japan that grows increasingly dangerous. Soon the two strands will intertwine, bringing the world's most phosphorescent secret agent to the most varied locations, to infiltrate, collect valuable data and information, and eliminate, lethally or otherwise, all the bad guys who threaten peace. As in any self-respecting Splinter Cell, the story, however elaborate and pleasant - here more than in other cases - to follow, seems a bit an end in itself, it doesn't want to send messages of who knows what range as happens instead in the other heavyweight of the genre, Metal Gear Solid, but only to provide a canvas on which the action can take place; even the way it is told, through well-made but never pretentious movies and the dialogues during the actual game, responds to this philosophy. The action takes place in the third person, with a camera that can be controlled at will. The success of infiltration revolves around the concept of light / shadow: being in the light is bad, moving in the shadows is good. However, some of the light sources cannot be eliminated, which reduces the player's possibilities by increasing the difficulty; the weapons available to Fisher are basically three, knife, pistol and assault rifle, but the large quantity of various modules and gadgets, including the legendary phosphorescent visor to move in absolute darkness, allow a great variety of ways, both they definitive or not, to get rid of the enemies. This broadly speaking is the game concept, which if it doesn't change one iota compared to the other episodes, is here emphasized by a very good level design, often very guided but full of small alternatives to the most obvious solution, which together with the many choices in terms of equipment they perfectly give the illusion of being able to move with great freedom. The picture is completed by the puzzles that are triggered whenever you have to force a closed door or a protected computer: in the first case we are presented with the lockpick minigame already seen previously, while in the second the 3D capabilities of the 3DS come into play, as we will see in the appropriate box. The 3D effect On balance it is the main weapon of the title: used extensively also for the HUD components, it gives a surprising visual depth to the levels and helps to hide graphic elements that are not up to par, making everything extremely ~alive~ as can be verified eliminating it for somemoment. It also slightly affects gameplay - maps use it to make the distinction between floors clearer, and there's even a minigame based on its use. Nothing that can't be done with minimal tricks even on a traditional screen, but it's nice to see programmers approach the possibilities of using this effect to create new game dynamics. Old Vs. New To make a comparison, which is mandatory when it comes to remakes, we don't only have the original Xbox version available, but also the DS version released a few months later, which suffered from a considerable graphic downgrade as well as a decidedly uncomfortable control system. These are problems that fortunately afflict this new re-proposition only minimally: the control system benefits enormously from the 3DS analog disc which demonstrates all its sensitivity and convenience; moreover, as on the DS, several commands especially related to the inventory are delegated to the touch screen, but the greater sensitivity of the latter compared to that of the previous console allows you to move easily even using your thumbs without having to resort to the stylus, which it makes the action much less cumbersome than it was on the DS. Let's be clear: Splinter Cell, if not conveniently adapted, remains a concept much more suitable for a home console than for a handheld, and some difficulties relating to control remain with regard to the camera, entrusted to the A/B/X/Y keys, and movements like crouching, jumping and so on here delegated to the d-pad, but the situation has improved considerably. As for graphics, then, even here we are halfway between DS and Xbox: the previous portable edition had to give up practically everything that made SC a great sight, on 3DS instead we have a decent number of polygons with not excellent textures but very clean, a wide visual horizon in the few cases where the level design provides for it, and a frame rate that, if not very fluid, remains stable in all situations. However, the reference versions look like the PS2/GameCube ones, which means that there won't be those lighting effects seen on Xbox that still make a certain impression today: it's a shame because, as seen in other launch titles, we are convinced that the 3DS can do much more. All this without considering the importance of 3D, which gives a great visual depth to the game, which if it has no particular effects on the gameplay helps to smooth out the graphic defects and in general to make everything much more pleasant and ~realistic~. For the rest, the game hasn't changed one iota or almost, the eight levels are practically intact as well as the AI, which clearly does not aim for realism and which begins to give some problems only at the highest difficulty level among the three available . The presence of secondary objectives brings the overall duration to about fifteen hours, on average for the genre; however, if even on DS after completing the story you could dabble in various multiplayer modes, here there is no trace not only of cooperative and competitive, but also of any StreetPass feature, which instead other launch games proudly show off. In this field Ubi could have done much more, so instead it has deprived this new portable edition of Chaos Theory of a considerable part of its attractiveness compared not only to the competition, but also compared to previous versions.", "date": "2011-03-30", "grade": "6.3"}
