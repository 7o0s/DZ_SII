These are the hours we have accumulated on Destiny at the dawn of the ninth year of the Bungie project. Sixty-five full days in game (number of hours does not count time spent in orbit or time spent in the social hub). A life, the real one, which inevitably binds hand in glove with the one at stake. We never thought, looking back, that we'd find ourselves here almost nine years later to tell you why The Eclipse is perhaps the biggest white lie Bungie has made to its users and at the same time the most playfully balanced expansion since Destiny 2 went on the market. Whether you are passionate or not, whether you are a mere spectator of a long and troubled epic or part of this journey, know that the final straight has just been undertaken for the Saga of Light and Darkness and that like it or not there will be a before and after all this. We are therefore ready to tell you our opinion in the review of The Eclipse, the new expansion of Destiny 2. Destiny 2: The Eclipse deeds and misdeeds Destiny 2 The Eclipse: The Witness We thought over and over about how to start this review and each time I always found something that didn't work as it should. Reflecting well on the importance of this article, we then found the crux of the matter. What was supposed to be the beginning of the end, the point of no return, the overtaking of evil by good, has actually been a slip-up. The stumbling block of a story that tells a situation that in sport they describe as fear of winning. Nikephobia is something concrete, but if analyzed in detail it is a precise mirror of the history of Destiny in recent years. When Bungie has set large decisive steps towards a path made of right choices, something wrong has slowed down or even stopped this growth, bringing the situation back to the starting tapes again. A year ago we praised the narrative power of The Queen of Whispers. Yet today, The Eclipse is narratively a step behind the Queen of Whispers and the reasons for this weakness have a ~name and a surname~. We are not talking about a culprit in the flesh, but about a specific moment which, revised in the light of the facts proposed in the last expansion, acquires a new value and a perspective that was impossible to observe at the time. Let's take a step back: it was June 9, 2020 when Bungie announced the final sprint of the Light and Darkness saga. In 2020 we would have had Beyond the Light, in 2021 The Queen of Whispers and in 2022 The Eclipse. Although the title of the project was tentative, the key art of the expansion was very clear. The idea then of the triptych of expansions focused on darkness and the possibility of introducing a subclass into each one that would close the circle, in a symmetrical way as Bungie likes, of the possibilities offered to the player seemed clear. But in the era of postponements everything is known, it is very precarious and unstable and so we found ourselves a year later seeing the postponement of this project and the lengthening of the times of The Queen of Whispers and consequently also of Lighfall which in the meantime had changed its essence as the last chapter, leaving room for the newly announced The Final Shape for 2024. Destiny 2 The Eclipse: The Tormentors But let's get back to us, in the light of the facts and what Bungie has proposed, we have two details to take into consideration: the first concerns the movement of the main graphics originally proposed for The Eclipse on The Final Shape (the pyramid inside the traveller) and the second, which concerns the start and end kinematics of L'Eclissi. Without too many spoilers, what is proposed in the kinematics appears as a single sequence interspersed with a series of missions designed to lengthen the broth (not even that much given that it is 8 missions). What has been done, narratively speaking, is to cut the beginning of what was originally supposed to be the final expansion and make it a prologue, diluted and with little bite. The Witness is the only truly great narrative power on the screen. A magnetic antagonist, with a powerful and threatening design that pierces the screen every time he appears but which unfortunately is limited by the fact that he narratively appears too few times. The only ones where it does (beginning kinematics, dialogue with Calus and final kinematics) we see all the unexpressed potential of what could have been, but was not. Calus, again proposed as an opponent, is relegated to speck, never able to instill fear or bring a real credible threat to the stage. Even one of the most dramatic moments related to Rohan is flat and almost humorous, when instead it should have created suffering in the player for an empathy that is difficult to understandcomes out to enter the game. Darkweave and Neomuna Destiny 2 The Eclipse: the Darkweave Therefore, if narratively the game has no consistency and indeed offers an embarrassing experience in terms of content and longevity, the paradox is consumed in the playful proposal. In fact, everything that Bungie has proposed to improve the game in terms of quality of life, streamlined content and immediacy of the approach is perhaps the best version since the first Destiny. During our preview we told you about how the idea for The Eclipse was to focus on streamlining a whole series of complex mechanics that made the gaming experience cumbersome and not very intuitive.Building is divided into two branches: creation of presets and mod management is really well done and speeds up the game flow a lot. In fact, you can create presets dedicated to various activities that save and equip the pieces of equipment with the relative mods that you have dedicated to that activity and/or build with a click. Just the management of the mods is now much more intuitive with several changes that are linked to the nature of the damage (stasis, void, telascura, arc and fire) and above all to the seasonal artifact which now makes the unlocked mods permanently active. In short, greater depth for those who want to explore the role-playing side more and more intuitiveness for those who approach it in a more casual way. Destiny 2 The Eclipse: Neomuna Different speech for Neomuna and the Telascura. From the narrative point of view we find the same problems mentioned above: Neomuna and Telascura seem a body foreign to the narrative, it is not clear how and why they were thrown into the cauldron without further investigation. The city is empty, bare, destroyed and offers little to those who finally expected a city alive with the desperation of the inhabitants invaded by a mysterious alien force. In terms of art design, Neomuna's character is very pleasant although out of tune with the darker and fantasy-mixed themes that Destiny and its sci-fi has so far proposed. The Darkweave, on the other hand, is as fun to use as it is little contextualized (the Karate Kid training is really one of the worst things about the expansion). Due to its long cooldowns it is certainly a step behind the Stasi, but the fact remains that Bungie's courage in revising the movement system with the introduction of the grappling hook is to be appreciated. Activities and equipment Destiny 2 The Eclipse: vaporwave vibes As usual, we leave at the end a whole series of issues that are more closely linked to the personal taste of the player. The proposed activities are in fact a large cauldron of already seen and of novelties which in the end result in a pleasant mix of missions. Seasonal raids and activities remain enjoyable to play and tackle, as do the exotic missions. Identical speech for the new weapons and new armor. In general, L'Eclissi offers a very cyberpunk, vaporwave style which, between a few peaks of creativity and a few slips, settles on an all in all acceptable value even if nothing to do with what was done, for example, with weapons and armor from the Dreaming City. The Tormentors are to be commended, the only truly noteworthy flicker among the ranks of the enemies. Difficult to beat full of novelty in terms of movements and fascinating. Similar speech for the Nightmare Roots Raid. The main activity of the end-game was beautiful in terms of setting and artistic style of weapons and armor but not very stimulating from the point of view of longevity and mechanics. The raid turned out to be the most completed ever in the first 48 hours of Destiny's existence, with even active contested mode. Let's fly over the design of the final boss instead.", "date": "2023-03-13", "grade": "6.5"}
