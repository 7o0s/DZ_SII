{"name": "Thymesia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/thymesia-recensione.html", "text": "A dark world on the verge of collapse, a blood-related plague and a hero who must put his opponents to the edge while letting himself be guided by a mysterious female figure. No, we are not talking about Bloodborne, but about the new game from OverBorder Studio: Thymesia. It is always a souls-like adventure, perhaps more Sekirian than Bloodbornian (if you allow us the neologisms), but not without some original ideas. The most important thing, however, is to understand that Thymesia is nothing more than an indie, unfortunately with less high dimensions and aspirations than one might think at first glance. We had already had the opportunity to test this action game a few months ago, through a small demo that had hinted at the strengths and weaknesses of the game. In the last few weeks, however, we have finally thoroughly tested the full version, which has been postponed for a few days to allow the developers to insert some improvements and certain changes. Let's see all the details in our review of Thymesia, which we played in the PC version. The game will also be available for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and on Switch (in Cloud version). Corvus Corvus, protagonist of Thymesia We are Corvus, a warrior with no memory who finds himself in the realm of Hermes, a place where alchemy has long been a source of salvation and wealth, but which now seems to have brought the whole society down. Corvus travels to what remains of the kingdom, with the aim of recovering a series of ~cores~, useful for creating an alchemical solution that can put an end to the plague. Guiding us is the Princess of Hermes, a much wiser and more mysterious girl than her age might suggest. The plot doesn't actually go much further, on a superficial level, as the whole ~lore~ is told through a series of textual notes, which describe what happened previously for each place we explored. Without stopping to read each writing (which is saved in the menu, in any case) we find ourselves only passing from one scenario to another without having any idea of what is happening or who is the boss on duty. The lore is pleasantly structured with many details scattered here and there, which slowly trace the events of each place: don't expect anything overly exciting, but if you want to spend some time, you can at least contextualize the game world. However, it is not very clear who is wrong and who is trying to do good and, for this reason, once we get to the finale it is difficult to understand which one we are about to activate. Overall, it's not for story that Thymesia should be played. Saber and Claw v.2 Corvus in an early game setting of Thymesia Thymesia is a kind of souls-like and what matters most is the feeling that you experience controller in hand. From this point of view, we must immediately state that the work of OverBorder Studio is quite ~rigid~. You don't have to imagine a Dark Souls-like game where you can create your own character, going from a melee warrior to a wizard depending on your taste. Corvus has his own fighting style and you can't change his nature much. The fulcrum is the use of the saber and the claw: the first inflicts some definitive damage and a good amount of ~pestilential~ damage, or a sort of wound to the enemy. The wound heals automatically shortly thereafter unless you transform it into permanent damage with the claw. Finally, when the opponent's life is at zero, a finishing blow must be performed. The second setting of Thymesia The point of this system is to force the player to focus on one opponent at a time in the case of group fights or to act aggressively and carefully against stronger enemies. Similar to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, if you land just a few hits and then get out of rhythm, going too defensive, you lose any progress you've made. You have to press the opponent and not give him breath, creating small choreographies of attacks, dodges and claw strokes, without ever stopping for too long. The problem is that Thymesia is not as refined and varied as FromSoftware's game, not that one can expect the same level of AAA from an indie. Thymesia offers a fairly small number of enemies that are repeated in a few areas: this means that the strategies to be adopted are more or less always the same. More important is the fact that OverBorder Studio's work fails to reproduce the fluidity staged by Miyazaki with Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. A note for those who played the demo: compared to this version, Thymesia is now much more fluid (not as much as Sekiro, we repeat). I have beeni shortened reaction times and dodges are more effective. Enemies are less aggressive and less resistant. Access to skills is also a very important factor in the performance of fights. The demo is therefore no longer a useful point of comparison for judging the gameplay. Let's be clear, the final result knows how to entertain, especially after the team has made available a pre-launch patch that has rebalanced the game. We 100% completed Thymesia for the first time with a clearly outdated version and overall the difficulty was quite high. Luckily the developers knew they had gone too far and changed a few things, especially in regards to bosses and mini-bosses. In fact, we feel that they have lowered the difficulty a bit too much in the early stages of the game, especially regarding the aggressiveness of some enemies, but the end result is still better than the ~zero~ version. Don't expect a particularly complex work, but at the same time you don't have to fear getting stuck for hours and hours against the first boss or having to level up like hell. Furthermore, farming is not at all encouraged by the developers. The level up becomes exponentially slower from level to level: to make you understand, know that in the first area you can go up by ten levels, while in the second by a couple and in the third by one, completing an entire exploration. Level ups and upgrades Corvus using the claw in Thymesia Reinforcing yourself is very important in Thymesia not so much to increase your stats (practically enhancing saber, life and claw), but because you get a point to spend in the multiple skill trees. There's a maximum number of points you can get after which you stop accumulating them, but it's a sensible limit that makes it impossible to abuse these abilities. We are talking about very useful passive bonuses, such as an increase in the damage of the saber, or active skills that soon become fundamental, such as a healing effect for each kill or the addition of dodges or obtaining parry (basically there is only the parry). Skill points can be repositioned from each lantern (the bonfire of Thymesia where you level up and make enemies reappear) without limits, thus allowing us to do all the tests we want and to take advantage of the right skills depending on the clash. It is one of Thymesia's best game systems, added to a second mechanic: pestilential weapons, or rather very powerful special attacks. Pestilential weapons can be stolen from enemies: in this case the energy cost is zero, but the number of uses is only one. However, a pestilential weapon can also be permanently unlocked by obtaining a sufficient number of ~fragments~ from the opponents. Equipped pestilential weapons cost energy, which is recovered in various ways by fighting. The weapons are varied, very useful and the only real element that will make your Corvus different from other players. It pays to spend some time in each area to get loot from enemies to unlock and upgrade various types of weapons. Environments and missions Corvus using a pestilential weapon in Thymesia However, there are plenty of loot opportunities throughout Thymesia's adventure if you take your time. The game consists of three main missions, necessary to unlock the final boss, to which are added a good number of side missions, some of which also have their own unique bosses. In terms of the number of hours, rushing towards the finale and avoiding everything that is not mandatory, we believe that the most skilled can do it in about three hours, but completing all the missions the playing time is certainly between ten hours and fifteen hours , depending on the skill level. Most of the side missions are placed in the locations of the main missions, but the areas are ~remixed~, changing some shortcuts and making them explore in the opposite direction. On average, however, we are talking about fairly linear areas: from time to time there is no shortage of classic shortcuts, but mostly you go from section to section leaving the completed parts behind. In terms of graphical variety, each area has its own distinctive style and is quite different from the previous one, but fails to win the player's eye, mainly due to not very high technical quality. The update has improved the situation, especially when it comes to performance, but there is still some uncertainty.", "date": "2022-08-16", "grade": "7.5"}
