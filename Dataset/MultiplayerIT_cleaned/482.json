{"name": "CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/csi-3-dimensions-of-murder-recensione.html", "text": "But what is CSI? The acronym CSI stands for Crime Scene Investigation, and it is one of the overseas television series that has found the most success with the public, even in our territory. The series tells the story of the night team of the Las Vegas forensics, engaged in solving cases that lead them to confront both their technical / scientific skills and to touch, every time, the sad realities of human misery. The series saw the birth of two spin-offs, thanks to its celebrity, set in parallel in Miami and New York. Ubisoft did not miss this success, and after acquiring the rights it produced a series of video games of which this is now the fourth chapter, the third set in Vegas, and the first entrusted to the hands of the developers of Telltale Games. The real novelty brought to this chapter of the series is the new 3D graphics, to which the game owes its name, while the game dynamics will be immediately familiar to those who have had the previous titles in their hands. Everything revolves, as is logical, around a series of murders, which are illustrated to us by the same voices of the television cast, which makes the gaming experience rather pleasant for fans of the series, even if the dialogues sometimes tend to be really long and in some cases frustrating beyond the limits of patience. Up to the point of skipping parts, which, personally, does not bode well for the enjoyment of a game that is very much linked to the storyline and the psychological profiles of victims and killers. But candidly admitting that this is related to a very personal pace of play, and verifying the possibility of speeding up the development of the dialogues, it is a problem that we believe we cannot consider as such. Otherwise, what I didn't like to verify was perhaps too much linearity of the passages and, in some cases, finding myself having dialogue options that shouldn't have been made unlockable until after revealing certain clues, which I has left a little disconcerted, in the resolution of a couple of cases. The truth is reached through the search for evidence The game interface is extremely simple and intuitive, both for fans of the videogame series and for new users, who will still have a tutorial available that will allow them to familiarize themselves with the game tools. We basically have four sections to navigate through: the evidence collection tools (traces, documents/photographs and objects), the available locations (including the morgue, the laboratory and Brass's office, as well as the crime scene and the locations where to reach suspects and witnesses), case files (victim notes, suspects, videos) and the options menu. The evidence collected, in this episode, will be observable individually, thanks to a rotating camera, in order to discover new previously hidden clues, such as fingerprints and traces of various kinds. During the exploration of the locations we will be able to take advantage of a tool assist system, which will make us accessible the right set of tools necessary for the collection of evidence in that defined situation. This system can be deactivated in the options menu, making it more difficult to play the game, which can only be good considering the linearity of the gameplay. The key to success, as all criminologists teach us, is the accuracy of the exploration: never underestimate the details, even the smallest ones. The analysis down to the last pixel of each location, angle, object and trace is the fundamental methodology for the solution of each case. But we don't live by collecting alone. The collected evidence will then be suitably analyzed in the laboratory, where we will have at our total disposal (oh, yes, we'll have to manage on our own, good old Greg Sanders seems to have taken a vacation) a computer for analyzing the traces, the DNA database, the microscope, a chemical analysis machine and an assembly table. And if we need them in the field, we'll find a mobile analysis unit at the crime scene. Pros and cons in three dimensions Fans of the television series will certainly not be disappointed by this title, which knows how to perfectly maintain the atmosphere experienced in the celluloid episodes. The 3D graphics, although not of an excellent level, are quite accurate, especially in the facial characterizations. The polygonal models of ~our~ colleagues are in fact very similar and the dubbing, entrusted to the protagonists themselves, makes the player's immersion and direct participation very pleasant. The settings are quite detailed, even if we are not allowed to range that much. What thatin any case it would probably be dispersive and which, in fact, one does not miss. The dialogues, which have remained in the original language, are in any case made enjoyable for those who do not speak English thanks to an excellent translation in Italian subtitles, which however inevitably makes those forced to follow them lose all the variations of expression that the characters they will assume in reaction to what they hear. A venial regret, in any case, considering that the possibility of enjoying the original voices of our heroes pays much more than a furrowed eyebrow represented in pixels and textures. The real sin with which this title is stained is actually too much linearity of progress. The plots that unfold during the episodes are extremely simple and logical, albeit interesting. This defect can easily make the continuation of the game tedious, which in any case does not require an excessive amount of time to complete, unless you decide to deactivate all aids to make it a little more challenging. In any case, the events remain far too easy to guess, and the construction of the infamous ~trinity of evidence~ too elementary, to the point of risking making everything a mere mechanism for the purposes of the narrative. Which in turn, alas, remains lacking in bite. In short, an excellent companion for a few hours of immersion in the world of our favorite television series, but nothing more than an obvious and not very innovative sequel (except for the improvements made by the new 3D engine) of the previous titles in the series. Final comment We are dealing with a title that fans of the series will certainly appreciate, thanks to the faithfully reproduced atmospheres and the original dubbing with the voices of the actors of the TV series. However, the plots of the five episodes present are too linear and repetitive in the long run, as are the steps necessary for the solution of the cases, which make us proceed in an even too mechanistic way. The innovation brought about by the new 3D engine is not enough to renew a title that does not differ in any way from its previous episodes, ending up stimulating only newcomers to the series or fans of Grissom & co. Pros Faithful to the atmosphere of the TV series New 3D graphics engine Original dubbing with Italian subtitles Simple and intuitive interface Cons Too linear and predictable development Dialogues sometimes too long Only five new cases 'Concentrate on what cannot lie. The evidence...' -- Gil Grissom There is no doubt that the combination of science and solving criminal cases is a topic of great interest from the audience. Fascinating plots, well-characterized characters and cinematic cut scenes have certainly consecrated the success of the CSI series. Las Vegas and its spin-offs. The charisma of Grissom, played by the actor William L.Peterson, who someone will remember confronting the serial killer ~Red Dragon~, marks the pace of his entire team acting as a point of reference for both his supporting actors and the viewer, who will never be disappointed by his cultured and cryptic quotations, by his passion for entomology and, above all, by the serene determination with which he faces each case, following the trail of the traces with painstaking care, reconstructing the history of his victims with respect and affection, leaving them themselves to narrate the events that cut short their lives. The criminal is a creative artist, the detective is just a critic We are lost, we feel a sense of anxiety, of bewilderment, we are on our first day of work in the Las Vegas crime lab and we have been entrusted with the night shift at the Crime Lab. We would like to settle in a bit, perhaps get to know the other members of the staff, but Vegas is a city on the move, a city where money flows freely, in the shadow of the casinos and all the substrates that go around it, and not always everything runs smoothly as it should. And in fact our evening will not go unearned. A girl was killed, a young woman about to get married, inside the art gallery where she had commissioned a work that immortalized her in all her splendor as a young bride. Her image will be given to eternity, in fact, but the blood that surrounds her face and the decomposition of the corpse taken from the shots we will take to fix the scene of the crime are not exactly the photo shoot that every woman wants for her wedding . It's our first case, we'll have to be thorough in revealing every trace. After the photos we will have to collect blood samples, hidden fingerprints, examine every detail of the crime scene before going to the laboratory in anexamine the finds, in the Morgue for details on the causes of the victim's death, to Captain Brass for interrogations and, of course, to speak with suspects and witnesses, in search of a truth that will unravel only by following the crumbs that an incautious Tom Thumb has sown behind him, creating a narrow and winding road of evidence that will lead us, finally, to the perpetrator of the crime. Luckily we will have veteran Warrick Brown by our side, ready to help us, in case we find ourselves in a dead end in our investigations. Once the first case is solved, there will be little time to rest on the laurels of our success, because Las Vegas continues to be in motion, and four other cases will keep our eyes focused and analytical, under the supervision of senior members of the CSI extension.", "date": "2006-06-01", "grade": null}
