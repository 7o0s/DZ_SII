Angry Birds and the like are fine, but it's nice that even those looking for a gaming experience closer to the traditional one on PC and consoles have valid titles to devote themselves to on tablets and smartphones. Some of the best games specially designed for mobile platforms fall into this category, such as The Room or Monument Valley, not to mention the large number of PC conversions that we can now find on iOS and Android digital deliveries. Returner 77 fits perfectly into the genre in question, and represents a title to be seriously considered if you are looking for a mobile gaming experience that can put your gray matter to the test, even at the expense of a game pace not properly designed for the typical mobile use. Fantastic's game, yes (this is the strange name of the development team), in addition to being an excellent title, also has the advantage of helping to raise the mobile gaming experience to the levels of traditional video games. It certainly owes something to The Room and probably also to The Witness, but the somewhat derivative ideas have been immersed in a game conceived in an excellent way and with very high production values. In its constant succession of puzzles to solve, it sometimes suffers from poor compactness and fails to always maintain a high level of interest in the numerous tests, but these weaknesses are partially covered by an interesting narrative frame and a particular and fascinating setting. The salvation of mankind hangs on a puzzle in Returner 77 A long succession of puzzles The premise is a bit of a science fiction classic: the protagonist awakens from cryogenic sleep and discovers that he is the last (or rather the penultimate) survivor of a fundamental mission for the salvation of mankind against a mysterious alien threat who attacked the Earth. The project envisaged the intervention of 77 ~Returner~ to enter the mysterious crystal-shaped alien base that orbits the Earth, but something went terribly wrong and the only survivors are the protagonist (the ~Returner 77, in fact) and the Colonel Ling who will guide you along the way of the game, through a long series of video notes scattered around the setting, through the narrative device also seen in BioShock.We therefore find ourselves exploring this large and fascinating alien spaceship, full of technological structures involving crystals and unidentified energy and above all full of puzzles to solve. It is not clear exactly why, but any mechanism inside the ship depends on the solution of a puzzle, which usually involves moving objects within labyrinthine paths in particular ways or managing light beams and energy to be channeled in various ways . The structure of Returner 77 is very similar to that of The Witness and The Talos Principle, but the mechanics of many puzzles also recall the excellent The Room series, which are all then derived from puzzle solving masterpieces of the caliber of Myst. In this case the movement is not free but bound to very specific trajectories, ~tracks~ within which we must move to find clues, messages from the Colonel and obviously activate the various mechanisms that present the puzzles to be solved. The latter are the fundamental element of the entire gameplay and do not betray their pivotal role, offering a wide range of even quite demanding challenges, capable of maintaining a high level of attention and commitment. On this front we might have liked a little more variety in the situations and dynamics of the puzzles, but it's hard to complain about the excellent balance found by Fantastic, yes for the game.", "date": "2017-10-27", "grade": "8.5"}
