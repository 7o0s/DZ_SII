The Dynasty Mode is a full-bodied career mode, very focused on the draft, or the choice of the players of our squad, starting from the rookies, the first picks, passing through the owners of the starting five. The managerial aspect is very accurate and goes as far as the selection of an assistant coach, an assistant and a scout to view the young talents of the league. Each of these professionals has a salary that we can negotiate depending on our economic situation, and a particular specialization. There are assistants for defense training, attack training, leg trainers, body trainers, vice-coaches with more or less experience, with the role of administrator or trainer. Everyone has their own age, salary and rank. The managerial aspect is very accurate and goes as far as the selection of an assistant coach, an assistant and a scout to view the young talents of the league Finally Dynasty Mode! To begin with, we can settle for a medium-low staff, only to then make new signings if business and the season go well. The team therefore has a budget to respect for the staff, and one for the purchases of the players. It is possible to choose the length of the tournament, whether or not to simulate injuries and all the various options, including the possibility of being able to receive updates on our team directly via Email on the PC. After the first few days we leave for the training camp, i.e. training sessions and friendly matches. Team harmony is indicated by an energy bar on the left side, and basically indicates the morale of the group. Once the championship has started, it is then necessary to make numerous rotations as using the same player too much will cause fatigue which will affect his performance and physical form. Finally the All Star Weekend! Another mode reintroduced this year is the All Star Weekend, or a series of special events related to the great stars of the USA basketball firmament. It starts with a challenge sponsored by a well-known mobile phone brand, a match between the best rookies of the season, passing through the challenge of dunks, 3-point shots, arriving at the magical ~All Star~ game, i.e. the match of matches between the best on the West Coast and the best on the East Coast. Allen Iverson, Shaq, Kobe Bryant and partners gathered in a stellar challenge. ~Sideline~ options but which make the offer package much more varied, attractive and long-lasting. Longevity that is definitely increased by the online factor as well. Of course, NBA Live 07 is also connected to Xbox Live and benefits from all its advantages. Of course, NBA Live 07 is also connected to Xbox Live and benefits from all its advantages. Every plus, except a stable frame rate Finally the All Star Weekend! Except a stable frame rate during matches. Yes, because by testing the online game from multiple locations some lag problems, more or less serious, have become evident. They range from sporadic slowdowns to situations of real unplayability. The situation improves facing Italian opponents, but we are far from having problems. Very strange, given that a similar product like FIFA 07 seems to be the godsend from this point of view. Title of the same Software House and which shares, it is thought, the same netcode. Live 07 seems to have inherited the same flaws from last year's edition, unfortunately without any improvements. Freestyle Control This year the so-called ~Freestyle control~ was also introduced, i.e. the ability to assign specific skills to each specific player by pressing the right analog. Oddly, these characteristics have dropped from 8 on the PSP and PS2 versions to just 5. Free throw, dunking, two-point shooting, defending and point guard skills can be tied to particular players and executed by pressing the left lat and stick simultaneously. An appreciable novelty, the problem is that all this does not make any particular difference between one player and another, also because perhaps excessive manual skill is required on the joypad which in the end is inconvenient for the speed of the game. For the rest, the gameplay closely follows that of NBA Live 06. The artificial intelligence seems even worse. Trying to make very simple 2-point free throws, it is almost impossible to score Freestyle Control Trying to make very simple 2-point free throws, it is almost impossible to score a basket, or at least the percentage of hits is really low despite being a basic and simple shot, even performed without marking. On the other hand, the opposing defense is too difficult and stubborn, and it will not be uncommon to find ourselves blocked and cwith the steal much more often than in a real game. This imbalance, of our attack on one side, and the opposing defense on the other, makes the title almost frustrating and all too difficult. Added to this is the fact that the enemy AI almost never changes their players for reasons of fatigue, but only does it in extreme cases such as the fourth foul called on someone on the pitch. All of this is unrealistic in modern basketball, especially in the fast-paced NBA. The audio-video sector Now let's talk about the technical realization, in many respects controversial. It is true that on the one hand the players have been improved a lot aesthetically, and by this we mean that the polygons that compose them have increased, the effects such as perspiration and the refraction of lights, etc. On the other hand there are serious shortcomings under the heading ~clipping~ and interpenetrations. It is not uncommon to notice the numerous times in which a player's arms or legs literally slip into the opponent's torso or body, or to witness some dunks that go through the glass of the basket as if by magic. Perhaps in-game this is barely noticeable, but during replays these issues are clearly revealed to the keenest eye. Clipping is due to the disappearance and appearance of polygons in these situations. The animations of the players themselves are very good, a problem, however, arises in the movements that ~bind~ them. The lack of fluidity that unites the movements of the players creates a particular sensation, that of commanding wooden and not very human ~robots~. The lack of fluidity that unites the movements of the players creates a particular sensation, that of commanding wooden and not very human ~robots~ The audio-video sector Furthermore, the general pace of the game seems to have decreased, especially the speed of the players on the field: even with the right trigger pressed (the acceleration one) the run is too slow and resembles a trot rather than a frenetic action from the NBA. The offline frame rate is stable when played on a normal CRT TV, much less from 720p upwards, where it reveals some uncertainty with numerous quite annoying micro-jerks. The public is made very well, it is completely polygonal as EA has accustomed us for a while now. The audio sector is perhaps the most convincing, with an excellent commentary from both the reporter and the assistant who practically never stop. The soundtrack is fairly diverse and travels from funk to hip-hop with artists such as Sergio Mendes & The Black Eyed Peas, Gnarls Barkley, Jurassic 5 featuring Dave Matthews, Rhymefest, Lady Sovereign, and Talib Kweliwhile. The sound effects as usual are great samples that have quite a variety. The ESPN franchise. As known, Electronic Arts can make the most of the well-known American brand of ESPN. With NBA Live 07 this is seamlessly integrated thanks to Xbox Live. We can read the results of the league directly on our TV, taking a look at the statistics, rankings and the best players in the league. The news flows while we're playing, like real ESPN news. Moreover, every 20 minutes we have the opportunity to listen to a short news podcast live from American radio. In short, something very similar to what already happens in FIFA07. All this contributes to completing the package of options but above all to ~breathe~ sport to the player, which EA knows how to do very well. Comment NBA Live 07 would be a great game without the structural flaws we've been talking about so far. The modes that were missing last year have been added, the important Dynasty Mode is now available as well as all the All Star options and special shots that can be performed with the right stick. Sadly, perhaps EA should have focused more on game mechanics than adding more options. The gameplay of Live07 has serious flaws in terms of artificial intelligence and balance. If we add to this the still unsolved problems of the online game and the graphical flaws, despite the undoubtedly impactful engine, we don't feel like recommending it as the NextGen Basket to buy this year. Pros Introduction of Dynasty Mode All Star options Freestyle controls Very good soundtrack Cons Technically has some flaws Artificial intelligence to review Poorly balanced offense and defense Online lag issues Goals NBA Live 07 goals are relatively simple to achieve. Some are quite bizarre, such as being online with 1000 other people at the same time. Most are related to executing special moves via Freestyle control. Toeach special move will be awarded 50 points. Which will also be given to the first ranked match, or by finishing a match with four players, but two per team. In this case, 100 points will be awarded. A good title, therefore, to see your Gamerscore rise. In many ways, past NBA Live for Xbox 360 has been disappointing. Primarily for the lack of a Dynasty Mode that would make the game deeper and more attractive, then for the disappearance of the customized ~super moves~ of the biggest stars in the NBA, and finally for the All Star Weekend mode strangely vacant on the next-gen platform , but present on PlayStation2 and Xbox. Live06 was just a taste of new generation basketball, a small aperitif before a real full title in all respects. EA tries this year, making many additions, reintegrating the missing career mode and improving the graphics sector. Too bad they forgot, once again, a voice called ~playability~, let's find out how and why.", "date": "2006-11-06", "grade": null}
