Junior is not called that, his name is Piccolo, and likewise Tensing's real name is Tenshinhan. Yanko, or whatever they called him, is actually Yamcha, Krillin is Krillin, and the old turtle master's name is Roshi. Maybe you already knew these things, maybe not, but they will come in handy if you intend to buy Dragon Ball Z for Kinect, the first-person action game developed by Spike exclusively for Xbox 360 with Kinect sensor. The reason is obvious: although it is a product obviously designed for a young user, the localization in Italian is rightly faithful to the original work. The DVD also includes a welcome extra, namely ~Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock~, the animated film hitherto unreleased in Italy (only subtitled in our language, unfortunately) which shows us the birth of the Super Saiyan legend by taking up the story from where it was left off in ~Dragon Ball: The origin of the myth~, always with Goku's father as the protagonist, as well as part of the video game roster (for the first time in the Super Saiyan version). We were saying: Dragon Ball Z for Kinect is a title designed for youngsters: although the iconography of the series is very well represented, with more than one hundred moves for a total of over fifty characters, the motion detection combat system is very limited right from the start. Repetitive at best; at worst, simply inadequate. Let it be clear: between one game and another we tried our hand at the sacred art of setting up the room so that the Microsoft peripheral would frame us perfectly. The game itself makes this practice quite simple, given that our silhouette always appears in the upper right part of the screen and we can therefore check that we are in the correct position in front of the sensor. In short, we paid close attention to limiting any inconvenience that could arise from the game environment or from a bad calibration, and the result in terms of movement recognition proved to be discreet but not always reliable. A few examples: during a fight, to charge the spiritual energy you have to put yourself in the typical pose that Goku and his friends assume in this situation, and the detection works practically perfectly. However, the matter relating to some special moves is different: the kamehameha is detected which is a pleasure (and we would like to see: there are people who will buy the game just to be able to perform it), while the kaioken and, in general, the maneuvers that involve a ~deep~ position are not a little difficult and often force us to fall back on the rest of the available repertoire, unfortunately quite meager. So close, so far Dragon Ball Z for Kinect gives us the opportunity to face a story mode consisting of four sagas, each divided into various episodes: the arrival of the Saiyans on Earth and therefore the clash with Raditz, Nappa and Vegeta; the Frieza saga; the advent of cyborgs and Cell; finally, the Majin Buu saga. Each completed episode can be replayed in the ~Score Attack~ mode by selecting any of the available characters. And speaking of characters, the game introduces some paper cards with QR codes which, read by the Kinect sensor, allow us to get extra warriors or various customizations. However, let's go back to the gameplay, which never as in this case constitutes the heart of the experience. The various episodes of the sagas are introduced by more or less long interlude scenes (it is possible to skip them in the usual way, or by raising the right arm) which, fortunately, Dragon Ball fans can also enjoy with the Japanese dubbing. Then we fight, without further preamble. It starts from close range and it is possible to deliver punches and kicks, while trying to parry or dodge the enemy's blows, but we quickly realize that such an approach not only does not allow us to perform the much desired special moves, but it also proves to be ineffective in terms of damage dealt. So we need to move away, distance ourselves, trying to leverage an incredibly permissive artificial intelligence, which loads the blows for a few seconds so that we can prepare to receive them, or leave the opponent still to reflect while we recharge the spiritual energy , a mandatory practice if we want to throw a kamehameha. Of all the movements that the game detects, in the end we are therefore reduced to always performing the same ones: an ifindiscriminate sequence of punches launches a three-stage combo that pushes the enemy away just enough to charge energy and then pour everything we have on him. The operation must be repeated until victory is achieved, clear and simple. Kikohoooooo After a more or less bubbly first impact, depending on your degree of fanaticism towards the characters in the series, Dragon Ball Z for Kinect therefore reveals its cards and reveals itself as a rather limited action game. The problem is not the movement detection itself (although, as mentioned, some positions are recognized with difficulty), but rather the way in which this type of gameplay has been translated into reality. In fact, close combat is really ugly to see, with the opponent not reacting when we land ~standard~ blows, very slow counterattacks and the presence of hints at any moment of the action that make us think of the game as a sequence of quick time events to complete successfully rather than a more complex product. Beyond the combos, in which you simply have to shake your fists, it all comes down to a question of poses, as in dance games for Kinect. From a distance, things improve, but only because we are allowed to perform the most spectacular maneuvers, which in turn start connecting sequences for the events of the plot. In all cases, however, AI and difficulty balancing have gaps that will be really difficult to ignore. On the technical front there is good attention to reproducing certain situations seen in the cartoon, but the polygonal models are certainly not among the best ever seen in a Dragon Ball tie-in and in the same way the scenarios are generally bare and devoid of particular detail, although their progressive devastation has a certain effect. In conclusion, in Dragon Ball Z for Kinect you sweat a lot (especially with the heat of the last few days...) and the little ones will have a lot of fun imitating their heroes, but woe to look for something deeper in this title than a little carefree parenthesis.", "date": "2012-10-04", "grade": null}
