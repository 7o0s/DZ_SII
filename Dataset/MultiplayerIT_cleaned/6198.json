It is easy to say that it was closed and launched too soon compared to the time evidently needed to complete it, probably due to the low sales that made it not convenient to finance the extension of the development. The planes are nice, but the terrains lack characterization Thus a promising clone of Ace Combat and HAWX for PC has turned into an unfinished one unable to express all its potential, albeit evident. If we wish, we can consider it almost an object of study to understand how different the approach one has with an Early Access title is compared to the one one has with a finished title. For example, let's start with the most superficial of aspects, the graphic one, an object of profound hope for those who have played the title since its first bars. Pretty much everyone liked the idea of using cell shading for aircraft. In fact, it is one of those little inventions capable of giving personality to a title that would otherwise risk trudging into anonymity. Unfortunately, the promise of a large fleet of all different aircraft was only partially fulfilled. Sure, there are many, but the truth is that they are all very similar in appearance, with just a few different decorations. A similar argument could be made for scenarios. The promised moddability, not yet introduced (who knows if it will ever be), had turned a blind eye to the barren lands that make up the maps, whose main feature is the lack of any characterization whatsoever. Many simply lack details and reference points and are limited to flattened textures. The hope of many was that their state would improve with the final version and that, above all, they could be retouched by users. Instead here they are still there, in all their overall ugliness, which clashes enormously with airplanes. In short, we are far from the sumptuousness of the scenarios of the last chapters of the Ace Combat series. In reality Vector Thrust from a graphic point of view loses comparison even with much older titles such as Flight Simulator X, which is saying something. Finishes absent Hitting with missiles is a challenge, especially in the beginning From the point of view of the gameplay, a speech could be made similar to that made with the graphics: the promised modes are all there, but all or almost all are in a state that is difficult to consider concluded. Take the campaign with its claim to tell a story. Well, when you bring up the narrative in a video game you should always remember that it requires specific skills, even the narrative of a wallpaper simulator. The developers of Vector Thrust seem to have gone out of their way to make the story they set out to tell hateful. The problem is not the overall uninteresting plot, which we can consider a secondary aspect for such a title (always we are talking about an arcade flight simulator), but the total inadequacy of the writing and the acting of the voice actors, evidently not real own actors. Someone will tell us that it is a justifiable situation because the development team, TimeSymmetry, is made up of very few members. In reality there is little to defend, because it is they who have chosen to include certain characteristics whose absence few would have noticed. If you don't have good voice actors available, at least someone who doesn't make your ears bleed every time he talks, don't dub, because with a half-done job you'll end up causing more annoyance than anything else. Vector Thrust leaves Early Access unfinished yet Drift missiles A few more weeks of development would have done him good For now, moddability is completely absent The flight model, not perfect but overall satisfactory, partially redeems Vector Thrust. Sure, it's meant for joypads more than joysticks, but since it's an arcade we think that's right. There are some problems, but the general sensation transmitted by flying in the skies of the game is convincing, almost as if to make you want to start empty maps just to roam around in total freedom, activating the thrusters to see the chosen aircraft overcome the barrier of the sound. Too bad that often you also have to fight. Let's put it this way: dogfights are mostly resolved using machine guns, while missiles are a kind of option that is good for bigger targets. This is true in single player, but much more so in multiplayerlayer (the rare times you find someone to play with), where they become practically useless. How come? Well, because dodging them is really easy, as they make limited turns to aim their targets. Playing against the artificial intelligence, the problem is less felt, because it follows patterns which, once understood, make it easier to understand when the right moment is to shoot and score (even if you need to practice a lot). Furthermore, the missiles fired by the CPU seem to have cheats and dodging them is much more difficult than those fired by humans. This is not necessarily a bad thing, because it adds a little tension to the fights and forces you to take more radical countermeasures to avoid them. When you play with other human beings, the situation changes: expecting them to fly straight to be shot down is pure utopia. The justification of the developers is that, compared to an Ace Combat, they wanted to give the missiles a more realistic behavior. True, but since we are talking about an arcade, the greater realism also translates into less involvement and a certain amount of frustration, also because it is clear that Vector Thrust is not expressly addressed to those who eat bread and simulation, but above all to those who looking for something more relaxed. Therefore, introducing an element of greater realism into a title that is not realistic has produced the opposite effect to the one sought: greater care is not perceived, but just another problem.", "date": "2015-07-14", "grade": "5.5"}
