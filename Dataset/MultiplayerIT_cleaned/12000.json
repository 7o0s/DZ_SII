{"name": "Hunter's Arena Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hunters-arena-legends-recensione.html", "text": "Presented during the recent State of Play, Hunter's Arena Legends is a game that not everyone knows has already been available in early access on Steam for about a year. The title developed by Mantisco is proposed as a hybrid between a MOBA and a Battle Royale, inserting numerous references to Asian mythology at the roster and artistic characterization level. Moreover, Hunter's Arena Legends made its debut among the August PlayStation Plus games for both PS4 and PS5. What we found ourselves in front of is a rather controversial product which, net of the thriving competition in the Asian-style battle royale genre (Naraka: Bladepoint above all), struggles to develop some interesting ideas in a positive way. The biggest problem of Hunter's Arena Legends is the approximation of some aspects that are almost inserted and then abandoned. But before the judgments, it is right that the examination of the contents accompany you in the review of Hunter's Arena Legends. the gameplay Hunter's Arena Legends: the game hud The game is basically a battle royale in which the player can choose from a roster of characters (currently 17) with unique abilities and weaknesses. In fact, each hero is designed to give the best in short, medium or long range situations through two specific factors: his skills and his weapons. As for the latter, there are characters equipped with swords, daggers, spiked maces, iron claws, etc. Based on the weapon you have, therefore, you will know that your fighting style will have to go in that direction. As regards skills, however, the matter becomes more intricate. The abilities of each of the protagonists is similar to what is seen with MOBA heroes such as Pokemon Unite or League of Legends. In fact, these are five abilities (positioned by default on the numeric keys of the keyboard) that are linked to the character's play style: from shock waves to life regen, from a tongue of fire to similar incendiary grenades, from blows in lunge with area sweeps, each of the characters will have its own pool of skills that will further characterize the style of play. Hunter's Arena Legends: A Clash Game To these special moves must be added the primary strikes with the edged weapon and the martial arts strikes (respectively left mouse button and right mouse button). Combat in Hunter's Arena Legends is based on the Chinese paper concept: guard beats weapon strikes, martial art beats guard, and weapon strikes beat martial art. Too bad that the skills beat everything and the cool down of the same is practically non-existent. Effect Gained: A continuous skill spam where it is impossible to try to follow the guidelines of the combination of rock, paper and scissors, thus wasting an interesting idea. The situation is further aggravated by a bad balance of the heroes which prevents close combatants from being able to use the bonus damage device when hitting an opponent who is about to hit us. At present, ranged characters are able to spam their weapon strikes (and their abilities) to prevent players from getting close, making a counter-offensive action impossible. The further aggravating factor lies in the possibility of doing damage in juggling. As in a fighting game like Mortal Kombat or Tekken, even in Hunter's Arena Legends there are weapons and shots capable of throwing the opponent into the air. Once in mid-air, you can continue to hit the opponent's body preventing him from any type of action until total defeat. There is no way to deal with these situations and we assure you that the frustration will often be great. MOBAs and battle royales Hunter's Arena Legends: the game map Hunter's Arena Legends has some interesting ideas though. Net of the above, the MOBA component is very fascinating. In all modes (single or in a team), the idea of inserting, scattered around the map, AI-controlled minions of varying difficulty that expand the playful offer, gives an edge to the classic base of the battle royale. In practice, the game does not make the most of this opportunity, due to a series of problems that we will now see, but theoretically the possibility of ~hunting~ demons to obtain high-grade loot works. Removing the loot from the binding chains of the chests for the map and expanding the possibilities of obtaining it also thanks to the skill of the players, is in fact something that must be read in a positive way. Unfortunately, however, not everything works in the best way. Hunter's Arena Legends: One of the characters In fact, the main problems must be sought first in thea bad management of the loot that has little effect on the gameplay (despite the rarity increases the stats of the equipment). Again the spam of skills and the compulsive use of attacks that throw the opponent in the air mess all the cards. All the strategic component that finding and equipping scrolls could offer (i.e. the application of special effects to weapons for example) goes totally into the background and is never taken into consideration, to favor a focus on the frantic pressing of the attack keys. Furthermore, the feeling of the shots, the targeting of the enemies and the fluidity of the movements make the clashes very complex. The timing of the parry is often missed due to this lack of stability and fluidity and the complex management of the camera does not help to keep the battlefield under control. In clashes with more than one player or with more than three minions, chaos takes over, preventing optimal situation management. The training mode and the shop complete a rather classic menu that pushes players to jump into the game continuously. Artistic and technical level Hunter's Arena Legends: the artistic design is still appreciable The discourse changes instead with regard to the artistic direction. The style of the game in terms of art and concept is undeniable. The characters are very well characterized, some refer to the classic iconography of the oriental world (for example Wukong is part of the roster) and also the game map, even if to a lesser extent than the heroes and demons controlled by the AI, has however his style with a series of biomes joined together that incorporate elements of the oriental tradition. The technical level is, on the other hand, decidedly subdued. The animations often feel disjointed and funny (such as the running animation of the male characters) and in some cases it feels like the game is ~old~. The combat system is very cumbersome and often lacks fluidity and sinuosity in connecting the animations of different animations or shots one after the other. Then there is a sort of ~perennial mist~ style patina that permeates every game and every biome, nothing impeding but in the long run really not very pleasing to the eye.", "date": "2021-08-05", "grade": "5.0"}
