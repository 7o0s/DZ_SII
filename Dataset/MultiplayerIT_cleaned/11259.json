At the same time it is clear that it would not have been possible to offer a similar solution, since it would have clashed with the very concept of console portability. So here is that the ingenious designers have studied a new accessory specially designed for the need, or a kind of handle with four colored buttons to be inserted in the GBA slot of your DS. A more than intriguing idea, as well as extremely intelligent since it ideally allows not to violate the original concept or the nature of the Nintendo handheld, allowing the gameplay of Guitar Hero to reach its destination almost intact. Unfortunately, in reality, it is clear that greater attention to the purely ergonomic aspect of the device would have been absolutely necessary; in fact, although there is no lack of advice on the screen for a correct grip of the whole, it is evident after a few minutes how it is really difficult to obtain a position that offers both acceptable visibility of the screen and sufficient preservation of the health of one's wrist. On the contrary, soon the latter will necessarily start to hurt, consequently forcing reluctantly to limit the sessions to a few tens of continuous minutes. Also particularly irritating is the imperfect stability of the accessory inside the slot; in fact, an unwanted movement is enough to release it, a real cancellation considering the fact that on this occasion it is not sufficient to remedy the error, but it is mandatory to reset the console. We were talking about the gameplay intact, and in fact in many ways it is; even with only 4 keys, the substance continues to revolve around the need to press them when the relative colored dots reach the bottom of the screen. This first action basically allows you to determine the correct chord, while to actually give life to the sound you need to touch the touch screen with a real plectrum with a tip, also included in the package. Actually at advanced difficulty levels you realize how much better the plastic guitar is, to the point that the Expert level is practically unplayable, but all in all you can't complain too much. The Star Power, on the other hand, is rather questionable, the use of which is subject to a cry (or any sound) in the microphone, thus lending itself to unwanted activations in case you play in particularly noisy places. Fortunately, as an alternative method, even pressing any key is sufficient, and the possibility of changing the sensitivity or completely excluding the microphone solves the problem.

Or not? As for the tracklist, it is clear that a more pop and commercial musical selection has been chosen to meet the different types of audience. And so most likely a shiver will go down the spine of pure hard rockers in front of Tokio Hotel's Monsoon or Smash Mouth's All Star, songs that are really not at ease next to those of Kiss, Nirvana or Red Hot Chili Peppers. A somewhat strange choice, therefore, which tries to please everyone at the risk of not really satisfying neither the kids who love modern pop nor those who grew up on bread and Rock'n'Roll. In any case, the 26 tracks are a more than fair number, destined to engage for a good period especially those who want to improve their records or try their hand at higher levels of difficulty. The fact remains that the impossibility of downloading new ones necessarily dthese things considerably limit the overall longevity, which is partially relieved by a robust multiplayer mode in which it is possible to challenge a friend - only on the local network, nothing online - with the addition of small ancillary tests, bonuses and malus with which to try to make life difficult for one's adversary. There are also a series of extra items, such as clothes, guitars and accessories to be purchased with the money collected on stage during the Career mode. Returning instead to the songs, it should be emphasized that the quality of the same is quite good, and that most of them are master tracks and not covers. The speakers of the DS do a decent job, but obviously the best result is obtained by connecting a pair of headphones. On the other hand, the graphic component is very disappointing, which offers a very limited view of the performance of your band both in terms of the reduced number of animations and shots.", "date": "2008-08-08", "grade": "7.3"}
