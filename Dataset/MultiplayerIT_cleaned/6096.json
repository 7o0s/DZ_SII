{"name": "Sei tu un Dio?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/154936-smite-sei-tu-un-dio.html", "text": "SMITE defines itself as a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, in a more concise way simply MOBA, a little word that we are sure you will hear more and more frequently from now on. After the explosive success of League of Legends with more than seventy million players worldwide, this genre has begun to assume importance and growing dignity within the gaming community as well as expanding like wildfire, with new products and on platforms hitherto mistreated, like home consoles. Those approaching this particular free-to-play for the first time will necessarily have to deal with a rich English dictionary, abstruse acronyms and new ways of conceiving a third-person action game. Let's discover together the peculiarities of SMITE and its distinctive features within the universe of MOBAs on consoles. The battle of the gods also rages on Xbox One with SMITE, a new MOBA to be rediscovered! The conversion work SMITE arrives on Xbox One as a very courageous and at the same time already successful and refined game, coming out the winner of all those bets given lost from the start due to prejudices towards console conversion. Where it takes one step back with regard to the control system, it takes two steps forward by introducing substantial innovations both in the raw gameplay and in the very way it is presented, with its complex but manageable, chaotic but understandable, difficult to learn layout but capable of great satisfaction once learned. The in-game and settings screens are very rich in elements on the screen, objects, drop-down menus to be recalled at will and indicators of various types, which make the action only initially confusing, until all the notions on the game interface are learned . The design effort to bring the SMITE interface from PC to Xbox One has been enormous and the depth of the experience has remained intact in all its elements, without any sacrifices. The whole action takes place within specific, mostly symmetrical maps that allow for a clear, understandable division that does not benefit anyone in particular. In turn, there are single-lane maps (single lane), i.e. that go from our base to the opponent's base through a single corridor, or with multiple viable ways to get to the goal. The jungle, on the other hand, is that neutral territory found between one lane and another, and is usually a hunting ground for Junglers, characters who, due to their intrinsic characteristics, act between the lines and move stealthily around the map. Tanks, on the other hand, have a high life points value and the task of throwing themselves into the middle of the battlefield to take the most damage and thus preserve teammates. Mids, short for Midlaner, are generally those characters who live in the main lane, usually Mages, while Solo, a contraction of Sololaner, is a category represented by those with high melee values such as Fighters. In the Healers category we find the Supports that have the function of helping teammates through attacks from a distance but above all by healing the wounded, and are represented by the Guardian gods. Finally, the Hunters are those who generally use psychic powers and objects to procure a high value of damage to the opponent with their basic attacks, despite having above average mobility. We understood, therefore, that all these elements are needed in a match and each of them has equal value and its own importance in the economy of the match. The real secret to winning in SMITE is to create a balanced team in the selection of the gods, i.e. the right mix between the various roles present, and that each of them is equipped with an effective and intelligent build, studied and designed exclusively on the basis of character characteristics. A divine roster We advise all players who approach this genre for the first time to start with the generous tutorials thanks to which it is possible to take all the time necessary to look at the layout of the menus, read the functionality of the items and specializations of each Champion, understand how to create valid and effective builds for our digital alter ego and only then throw yourself into the fray of arenas and maps in a more uninhibited and brazen way. The characters are represented, as we have already mentioned in the previous paragraph, by a large selection of gods (and demigods) taken from the ancient polytheistic religions. The choice is truly rich and includes famous divinities such as the Egyptian ones (Anubis, Osiris, Anhur), passing through China and Ancient Greece (Poseidon, Athena, Medusa), from the Roman ones (Cupido, Mercury, Bacchus) up to the Maya, Nordic (Thor, Odin) and Indian (Kali, Vamana, Ramana) ones. In total it is possible to unlock even 67 characters and the list is constantly growing thanks to the massive support of the American developers Hi-Rez. On PC the game is assiduously updated every two weeks and we expect the same to happen on the Xbox One version. Working continuously on such a complex and multifaceted game is not only advisable, but in our opinion essential if you want to maintain a balance in the gameplay and in the balance between the various Champions. Whenever a god, a new mode or an object is inserted, all the relationships that this introduction modifies with the pre-existing elements in the game code must necessarily be reviewed. One of the greatest advantages of SMITE is certainly that of being a true free-to-play, i.e. a completely free game that allows you to access each mode without having to pay, allowing you to unlock the contents with a double currency system: the classic gold or Favors, which are an alternative way of obtaining characters and items. The latter are obtained simply by playing, completing matches and performing particular actions such as exploring the tutorial or winning the first game of the day in each mode. With a system called Goodwill, the developers give away a higher percentage of Favor if the player follows all the rules of the game and is never signaled by negative actions, such as leaving the game before its natural conclusion. Curiosity And the brawl breaks out on the Internet! The online community (and not) has split over some controversies that arose after the release of the PC version. Although SMITE is a game based on the use of divinities belonging to religions that are no longer represented, it nevertheless retains in its catalog some elements still linked to current religions, such as the Hindu one for example. Specifically, great controversy has aroused the use of the image of the goddess Kali in skimpy costumes that reveal a very prosperous breast. On the other hand, there are those who have clamored to include among the characters even the divinities currently adored such as the Jewish Yahweh, the Christian God and also, possibly and exceptionally, Jesus of Nazareth who someone has pointed out to be a sort of ~demi-god~, on a par with Hercules who actually was included among the 67 playable Champions. Some even ventured to suggest items and abilities: a zero-second respawn (the classic resurrection), summoning angels and a Healer role. We are baptizing a new genre We have to talk about the characteristics of SMITE by deepening its double peculiarity: the innovations brought to the entire MOBA genre and the unique innovations of the Xbox One version. SMITE takes the classic gameplay of the most famous titles but abandons the overused ~bird's eye~ view, in favor of a modern third-person shot behind the player character. To be clear, as happens in World of Warcraft but with a mobility and dynamism closer to an action game. From this point of view, therefore, it is not enough to limit oneself to the mere ~point and click~ to which we have been accustomed, for example, from League of Legends. In SMITE it is necessary to move and directly control your Champion and therefore the motor skill of the hands on the joypad assumes an incredibly great importance and discriminates between a strong and a weak player, regardless of the leveling and the applied build. It is an evolution in the gameplay of this genre, which combines the skill in managing a disproportionate amount of objects and skills, also the practice in managing character, attacks and spells on the battlefield. It's one thing to point and click, quite another to navigate a three-dimensional environment while moving and aiming at the same time. We do not judge this system as better or worse, but we just have to note the difference between the classic use of mouse and keyboard for an almost strategic scheme and that typical of an action product, certainly more suited to the console environment and the joypad. Exactly as has always happened in the debate between control systems, it is also necessary to specify that the classic input methods are more precise and faster, but there has been a great commitment by the developer to make the Xbox One joypad an equally excellent method of check for your own title. From the settings you can calibrate the sensitivity exactly as if it were a mouse and in general the commands respond perfectly on the battlefield, even in the most extreme situations. For all these reasons we can say that we are faced with a rare and perhaps unique case of Action Multiplayer Online Battle Arena: if you want, we could call it AMOBA. Xbox One goals SMITE puts the canonical 1000 points on the plate to be unlocked through 59 objectives. Getting all of them won't be easy because most of them are tied to specific stats that will come naturally after an infinite series of matches or by reaching a certain number of wins, matches and controlled characters. The other part of the objectives, on the other hand, are easily obtained only by starting to play and making the first progress in ranked matches. Spoiled for choice In SMITE there are a large amount of objects and artifacts to bind to your character to increase his characteristics and improve his attack, defense, energy and mana statistics. These items can be bought and resold using gold collected in battle. There are the classic consumables for one-time use such as potions and elixirs, which allow you to quickly recover physical and magical energy when necessary and during battle. Active objects, on the other hand, come into operation only when we perform a particular action to which they are linked. For example, the classic teleportation that allows those who are unable to move to find themselves instantly at the foot of an allied tower. Finally, there are the passive ones, probably the most important, which allow you to enhance certain characteristics of your hero by improving his statistics. SMITE has several game modes that will keep you interested for quite a long time, depending on how much it manages to involve you. Starting from the ubiquitous tutorial, we start with the classic and inevitable Arena, moving on to the Conquest mode which is an evergreen for every MOBA with two opposite bases and three lanes to engage (right, central and left). We continue with Assault with its single lane maps, a frontal clash to be clear and always five against five. Joust is a variation of the Conquest mode, with the difference being played in one against one or three against three, in smaller and shorter environments. In Siege, however, two teams of four fight with the aim of destroying the enemy titan on the opposite side of the map. Lastly, to make the game always varied and unpredictable, by clicking on the ~Match of the Day~ mode you will find yourself in a different game every time, with rules that change every day by drawing from a series of special modes. In its PC counterpart, finding an online match and teaming up generally takes one to two minutes, while console Matchmaking has been vastly improved with an average wait under one minute. There are counter-trend cases, of course, but the experiences of PC gamers on European servers have generally been uninspiring. As far as we've played, on the other hand, we haven't found any problems on the Xbox One servers: fast games, never a drop of lag and no disconnections. Finally, let's spend a few words on the technical realization, of excellent workmanship with scenarios and characters very rich in details and effects, even if some glitches have been spotted sporadically such as the disappearance of background elements or evident polygonal interpenetrations. The maximum effort has certainly been made on the design of all 67 deities, each of them well differentiated both in form and in substance thanks to very heterogeneous physicality and abilities. The audio sector is also worthy of a mention thanks to its well-orchestrated and genre-appropriate music, which knows how to motivate in battle with their epic themes as much as reassure when we find ourselves navigating among the dozens of menus and windows full of statistics. SMITE is an absolutely must-try game, both for fans of the genre who will find in it a new way of conceiving already rooted mechanics, and for all that new slice of the console public who will discover unprecedented fun in MOBAs.", "date": "2015-08-26", "grade": "8.3"}
