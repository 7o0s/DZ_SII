{"name": "Unravel 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unravel-2-two-recensione-201095.html", "text": "Officially announced during the EA Play opening conference and immediately available in digital stores, Unravel 2 aims to repeat the success of the first episode of the series thanks to some interesting news, above all the cooperative nature of the experience. During the introductory sequences we see little Yarny, the little creature made of wool that we had come to know in the debut chapter, end up in the sea, prey to the waves, and then find himself at the foot of a lighthouse. This time, however, he is not alone: a blue-colored similar to him emerges from a suitcase that ended up on the rocks. The initial distrust soon gives way to the comfort of having found a friend, giving life to a bond that the two characters decide to weld, literally, by joining their broken threads and creating a longer and more solid one, to share. A fairly clear metaphor, which holds the ground for all seven levels that make up the new adventure, also in this case accessible ~manually~, following the basic gameplay rules, using the aforementioned lighthouse and its floors as a hub. The Unravel 2 campaign can be completed in five or six hours, but is supported by twenty short challenges, characterized by a single puzzle to solve. The prize? The liberation of another character made of wool and of aesthetic elements useful for modifying the appearance of the protagonists. Gameplay: an endless thread The path that takes Yarny and his new friend (or his better half, as far as we know) to the lighthouse is used by the developers to quickly introduce some of the novelties of the gameplay, which as mentioned is based on collaboration and the use alternating between the two characters in single player, or in local cooperative multiplayer. Whatever way you want to tackle the adventure, you will no longer have to worry about the ~consumption~ of the thread that made the original complicated at times, as explained in the Unravel review, even giving it strategic implications: it is an element that the authors wanted to eliminate it in favor of a more immediate approach, in which the length of the string at our disposal becomes clear when we tie a few knots and stretch the fabric to create traditional trampolines, or to swing quickly and gain the necessary starting point to reach a platform higher than where it is possible to jump. Playing alone, pressing the Triangle button allows you to switch from one character to another at any time, and the cooperative mechanics work exactly as you would expect: where an environmental puzzle requires one of the two little creatures to hold an object still by pulling it with the own wire and allowing the other to ~bounce~ on the walls to climb higher, we just need to perform the action and change the little being for the other to maintain the position. The ~points of interest~ trick is reiterated in this new episode to show us where we can hook the thread, but once again the puzzles seem to be organized ~in series~ and this ends up trivializing the challenge a bit, as once found the system just repeats it to get to the end of the stage. It must be said that some aspects of the gameplay are improved, in the first place the responsiveness to the commands, but the sensation of inconsistent physics remains, which makes some maneuvers a little too slippery and determines undeserved game overs. However, the experience is not meant to be punitive in any way: every time our character dies, the game starts exactly from there. However, one wonders what the possibility of slowing down time is for, given that such a frenetic situation never occurs as to make it necessary to resort to this feature. Playstation 4 trophies There are twenty-nine Trophies in Unravel 2, and obtaining them is often a matter of skill. In fact, in addition to the achievements related to the simple completion of levels and challenges, there are others that can only be obtained by completing certain stages without ever dying, within a time limit or by taking advantage of the cooperative multiplayer mode. Setting: the world of adults The story of Unravel 2 and its two protagonists takes place in different places where it is possible to teleport starting from the aforementioned lighthouse. As you move between the platforms, using the wool thread in imaginative ways and passing from one character to another to hoist each other up, using the concept of a couple to solve the puzzles, the story of two kids who have to face various vicissitudes, in particular due to an adult world that does not seem to understand them. The question is quite nebulous, but the two seem to be huntingThey get into one trouble after another, and the actions of Yarny and his new friend somehow have the power to influence what happens to them, perhaps providing a distraction for their pursuers to escape. Thus this interesting parallel takes place, with the two young ~adventurers~ in the background and the characters we control in the foreground, engaged in similar tests, albeit in their own small way, bouncing off boxes and chairs in order to reach a table top or move from one branch to another in a dense forest, sometimes paying attention to the presence of flames that move through pre-established paths and must be absolutely avoided, on pain of rapid combustion of the little creatures. The variety of environments in Unravel 2 is good, although restricted to a specific context due to the narration that takes place in the background. Once again the Electronic Arts production has something to say on a technical and artistic level, with the peculiar ~diorama~ style approach that completely blurs the objects in the background and gives us beautiful visual solutions, thanks to an effective lighting system, a set of irresistible animations for the protagonists, really tender, and a solid sixty frames per second. The audio effects are still lacking, but the soundtrack of the game has a certain personality and will not fail to draw you into the action.", "date": "2018-06-15", "grade": "7.8"}
