{"name": "Spazio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/129348-out-there-spazio-ultima-frontiera.html", "text": "In recent times there have been several developers who have attempted to conquer science fiction enthusiasts and the most ardent fans of the Enterprise through the charm of interstellar travel. A far from trivial goal, given that one thing is to set a game in space, another is to be able to communicate the feeling of mystery, solitude and discovery that one could experience by exploring new worlds, meeting new civilizations and going ~where no man has never come before~. Between unsuccessful attempts such as Star Command and pearls of the caliber of FTL, that of roguelike and simulation has proved to be a perfect mix to offer engaging space adventures and put the player in the shoes of a skilled Kirk. While sharing many elements with the two titles mentioned, Out There tries to distinguish itself by completely setting aside the fights between ships and instead focusing all the attention on the player's journey and on the narration of a plot which, at least potentially, offers different nuances with each new match. Deep space travel There can be nothing worse for an astronaut than waking up from a long period in cryogenic stasis to find himself in an unknown part of the galaxy; with the few resources at his disposal he must therefore find a way to locate the solar system and return to Earth, trying to get away with the thousand dangerous situations that await him along the way. If for the premise of the game the French of Mi-Clos Studio wanted to follow a path so safe as to seem almost trivial, the choice not to define the background of the protagonist nor to dwell on the details of his journey is a successful design trick to reinforce the aura of mystery and help the player to empathize. Even the astronaut's face is only hinted at, with a few strokes and a single expression. Standing in front of the map of the galaxy, those who have played FTL will certainly have a feeling of deja vu. In fact, the goal is to travel from one system to another, looking for the best route to reach the destination, or to experiment with alternative routes while looking for resources and new areas to explore. The outcome of the entire expedition depends entirely on the three types of resources the player has to keep an eye on: fuel, oxygen, and hull strength. Predictably, the ship consumes fuel when traveling, landing on a planet or using probes and drills, the hull can be damaged by impact with an asteroid or a dangerous atmosphere, while the oxygen decreases steadily from turn to turn. The challenge proposed by Out There is therefore that of being able to balance the collection of resources and ensure a series of supplies during the journey, but keeping in mind that every action has consequences, and the collection of a type of resource often forces to sacrifice the others. Maybe it happens to be on a planet rich in precious minerals, but the low amount of fuel available forces you to continue in search of supplies; or, with a hull in perfect condition, you can take a gamble and navigate an asteroid field knowing that on the other side is a space station or resource-rich world. In addition to any repairs, the extraction and transport of minerals is then aimed at the construction of new technologies, it being understood that each material and each new upgrade for the ship occupies precious slots. Considering that most of the advanced technologies are discovered randomly during a game, the player is gradually stimulated to establish priorities and choose which technologies to build based on the resources collected or the needs of the journey. By installing shields and thermal resonance generators, for example, one could bet everything on the ship's resistance, fearlessly crossing very dangerous atmospheres; or you can optimize your travels, wasting less fuel thanks to solar sails or using black hole generators to travel from one point of the galaxy to another. Out There is a fascinating space journey, but danger is always around the corner A game of infinite improbability What has been said so far could suggest an extremely active participation on the part of the player, but the problem is that any illusion of approaching Out There in a strategic and thoughtful way shatters against the enormous randomness of the events and the excessive importance that the game has. luck element. Just as a journey that began in a disastrous way can be revived by the chance encounter of a station full of supplies, it can happen that a good game is completely compromised by a series of misfortunes.A thermal shock, an explosion of a nearby star and a loss of oxygen can cause all the resources accumulated up to that moment to be lost in a few turns, the ambush of an alien ship can damage fundamental technologies, while a space tunnel thunderstorm can return the player to the beginning of the map when there was one last jump to the finish line. A succession of misfortunes that would make the hour and a half of Gravity seem like a cheerful picnic in the park. There is no way to predict, prevent or remedy these random events, and with each new game starting from scratch it is obvious that at times the experience feels so unfair as to be frustrating. The intentions of the French developer were to create a gloomy and melancholy atmosphere, and this strong element of uncertainty should really make those who play feel lost and helpless in deep space. However, what drives you to start over after each game over is the enormous variety of situations you can come across. For example, during your journey you can come across an abandoned ship and decide whether to limit yourself to collecting the supplies inside it or whether to pilot it for the rest of the game; it can happen to learn alien languages, find mysterious monoliths or receive a signal from a specific point in the galaxy. And again, you can destroy stars, terraform planets and reach hostile systems. The surprises are truly innumerable, and during the expedition various subplots can take shape which, if followed and completed, help to recompose the narrative puzzle on the protagonist and on human civilization.", "date": "2014-03-12", "grade": "8.0"}
