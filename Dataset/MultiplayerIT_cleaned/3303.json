In these games, the difficulty is as much in planning as in the user's logistical skills, called to challenge his own abilities by generating a perfect fit of sections and routes. Transport Fever was one of the last most dignified exponents of these management systems, a small surprise that has become increasingly large and interesting over time and thanks to the mods. A good story considering that the progenitor was developed by a handful of enthusiasts who with this sequel try to raise the bar slightly, without distorting anything. The result is a sequel that takes one step back and three forward, conquering an alchemy that fascinates and keeps you glued to the screen until poverty. Retrace history As in the progenitor, in Transport Fever 2 our task is to build a passenger and freight transport network capable of supporting the development of a region. The game modes are essentially two: the campaign, consisting of three chapters divided into six levels each, and the classic sandbox, enriched here by an excellent and powerful map editor. The campaign unfolds chronologically over time, hopping between one region and another of the hemisphere and in different eras: it starts in North America in the early 1800s, continues by building the Trans-Siberian on the other side of the world, and continues level after level until using the most iconic Japanese Shinkansen. Not only tracks and trains, fear not, in Transport Fever 2 there is also room for many boats and as many land vehicles, starting from the first horse-drawn carriages. During the campaign, one is naturally guided by the missions that will follow one another on our agenda, on paths which, however, will not always be obligatory, otherwise there would not be much of a challenge. Each level also offers secondary missions that are initially very entertaining, but which will have very little to offer as you progress through the game. The campaign is interesting, rather fun, but above all educational, teaching the user the logic and mechanics behind the gameplay of Transport Fever 2. The only major flaw found in the campaign, apart from the secondary missions, is communication: often the game it cannot explain clearly what the user has to do, or it confuses them by using different names for the same structure. Smudges like this, in a product like this, can lead to distressing frustration, but fortunately it doesn't take long to solve this type of problem, if of course there is the will to do so. From here to there Having arrived in the middle of the campaign, but also a little earlier, you are finally able to take a look and understand the sandbox mode, which is the heart of this Transport Fever 2. Once you have decided the size and the morphological and natural characteristics of the map on which to go and play, but you can also create them with a more complex editor and exchange them with the other players, you start to get serious, that is, you try to decide where and how to start. Each time it is necessary to develop new strategies because the distribution of cities, industries and raw materials on the map is totally random. Every city has two primary needs which, if satisfied, accelerate its growth, but it is said that around a city that asks, for example, for wooden planks, there is everything necessary, i.e. those who collect the wood (a natural resource) and who then cuts it (an industry: the sawmill). Considering the size of the cities at the start of the game and the cost to build a railway, thinking about public transport is a bit premature, even if a few carriages inside the largest village could lead to a timid first profit. Having figured out where it is more convenient to get your hands, perhaps you start with the simplest land transport: carriages pulled by horses on dirt tracks. Going forward, if the choices have paid off, it will be possible, for example, to start repaying the debt of five million dollars with which we are starting, to straighten the old roads into shorter and consequently more profitable paths, and to start exploiting the means that are slowly , advancing in time, will be unlocked. You will find yourself adding some to the ~fleet~ when the first ones purchased start to fall into poor condition, even if to take advantage of the most modern and fastest means it will also be necessary to improve theand arterial roads with the first decent asphalts, the first forms of signage. Perfect course By this point, the cities you've gotten your hands on will have started to expand, and as a result you'll see more and more inhabitants moving between one and another. So via ferrata, puffing locomotive and carriages, how many passengers do you plan to convince? And in our case, the demand is there, the satisfaction too, together with a good income at each station stop. Finally free to reinvest, we find that the sawmill has leveled up, and now looks much more professional and cleaner, and can produce a considerable number of goods if replenished with wood faster. The right opportunity for a first profitable freight train, an introduction that will naturally eliminate the previously set up road transport. In the meantime we will have set up routes on the waterways, lengthened if not doubled the railways for commuters trying not to jam the trains using the signals, and reached the most distant resources with preforming cargo planes. Then it happens that you scroll the mouse wheel backwards and the glance leaves you amazed: the modified arteries that explode from the cities in a radial pattern, the ever higher bridges on which two 200 km/h trains cross as they slip between the skyscrapers of a commercial area, the trams that climb the busy streets. Everything is so natural, realistic, because it is dictated by the same needs as those that have generated our roads. Two or more neighboring cities, expanding, can even merge into a single metropolis, and when this happens, the satisfaction is unique because it is clearly thanks to us. Lateral and forward steps Transport Fever 2, with its good graphics, also has a hypnotic aspect, like when you stare to observe and play the most realistic scale model. Is a title like this also played for the same reasons that once upon a time or still today electric trains are collected, shall we call it modeling? Here our creations have no matter, we cannot touch them with our hands, but they can dynamically react to our creativity and our equally fundamental logical skills. As anticipated, despite its undoubted qualities, Transport Fever 2 is still a product with a rather limited budget and the victim of some annoying naivety. It doesn't have any big problems, but it lacks a day and night cycle for example, there is that problem in the unclear texts linked to the countryside, and the tools for drawing the roads are much less precise and realistic than those that allow us to build the railways; moreover, it is true that one could go deeper with the simulation, for example by inserting specializations for cities, linked to extraordinary events that require specifically designed strategies. A step forward also in the economic simulation would not hurt, like the addition of a competition managed by one or more AIs. The skeleton of the game, although it is quite similar to the first game, has been rethought quite well, streamlining and adding gameplay details, and giving the whole a very effective realistic-looking graphics. With the addition of Asia, players also have access to a new biome and new vehicles, which they will be able to travel on an almost infinite number of maps thanks to the included editors.", "date": "2020-01-08", "grade": "8.0"}
