The community is growing well, despite the fierce competition (above all Hearthstone), and the guys at Dire Wolf Digital have decided to step on the accelerator just over three months after the release of the game and two after the release of the adventure ( which already introduced some new cards), adding further content. In the world of collectible card games, it is well known that in order not to let the metagame stagnate and, consequently, to diminish the interest in the game, it is necessary to introduce new cards and with them new mechanics, at the risk of creating combinations that are too strong and having to make subsequent changes. In this article we will highlight the best cards for each attribute (to remind you of the rules of the basic game and the colors of the cards, please refer to our review) and we will explain both the main innovations introduced in terms of mechanics and the new types of cards which, speaking of Skyrim, they can't miss: you got it right, we're talking about dragons! The destructive scream Anyone who has played The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim perfectly remembers the satisfaction it had when learning and using a new shout (remember the one obtained after climbing the ~7000 steps~ of High Hrothgar?) and, in The Elder Scrolls: Legends Heroes of Skyrim, this feature was introduced in the gameplay with the creation of a new type of card: the Shout. It is an action (therefore the equivalent of a spell in Hearthstone) which has three levels and, after each use, increases the level of all the screams left in the deck. The cost of all shouts is 3 magicka (the mana of The Elder Scrolls: Legends), except that of Resistance (purple) which costs 2 and that of Agility (green) which costs 1. Now let's examine them in detail . You will have already understood that there is one for each color and that therefore you will have a maximum of 6 in the deck, since decks cannot be made by combining more than two attributes. Inexorable Force is the shout of the Force (red) and, at base level, counter-summons (returns to hand) an enemy creature with power 3 or less, at 2nd level counter-summons an enemy creature regardless of characteristics and to the third all the enemy creatures of an area. Intelligence (blue) has been assigned the Breath of Fire which inflicts, in the three levels, respectively 2, 4 and 10 damage to an enemy creature; for Agility the scream is called Drain Vitality and costs only 1 magicka assigning, by default, -1/-1 to an enemy creature: its subsequent levels increase the malus to -2/-2 for the second and to -2 /-2 for the third and most powerful level. We deliberately left the screams of Willpower and Endurance for last because, in our opinion and judging by how much play they're finding in arena and competitive decks, they're the best in the set. The Shout of Valor is the Shout of Will (yellow) and, if at level 1 it summons a creature 3/3 (3 mana 3/3 is already a basic card ), at level 2 and 3 it summons two minions respectively 3 /3 and fill up a row of 3/3 minions (which for 3 mana is really a super deal). Torn Soul is the Scream of Resistance and at base level it returns a creature of your choice from your graveyard to your hand, second and third level, in addition to retaining this characteristic, boost the chosen creature by +2/+2 and +5/5 . Also considering that one of purple's new legendaries is the Skeletal Dragon, which for 8 mana is 5/5 with Guard (Hearthstone's taunt), when summoned it gives +2/+2 to all creatures in your graveyard and when dies puts a random one in your hand, we let you imagine how many decks have already been built around this combo. Dragons and Werewolves Each color has been given a creature which, if there are at least two others of the same color in play, allows you to draw a card when it enters the field (in a card game we know how important it is to draw) but the other New to The Elder Scrolls: Legends Heroes of Skyrim is a new creature type with the red and purple-only Beast Shape characteristic that transforms into a werewolf. To activate the metamorphosis it is necessary to destroy an enemy rune while the creature with Beast Form is on the field; for example, the Initiate of the Circle is a 2/2 to 2 magicka with Prophecy and Beast Shape: +2/ +1 and who, therefore, gets this bonus after transforming into a Werewolf. Skyrim means dragons and the expansion has introduced many, there are 17 in total, 3 of each color and two neutral and all havedifferent rarities. As it was legitimate to expect, many new decks with dragons were born, also because there are also more than 10 cards that interact with them, but before showing you some significant dragons, we want to talk to you about what is causing the most discussion, the Echo of Akatosh: it costs 6 magicka and is a 5/5 dragon for Intelligence that, when it enters the battlefield, grants a random ability to all creatures still in the deck. This random component that heavily enhances the C factor (or, if you're English-speaking, the RNG) immediately sparked the ire of those who have always underlined the distance between The Elder Scrolls: Legends and Hearthstone in terms of randomness that suddenly shifts the match towards victory or defeat (an element as hated as it is fun in the Blizzard card game). We are not yet able to tell you if this dragon will generate a case and if Bethesda will turn around by changing its characteristics but, for sure, it represents a step that we can define at least imprudent (not to call it false). Going back to dragons, in our opinion the best have been reserved for Intelligence which, in addition to the dragon under discussion, takes the Mystic Dragon which for 4 Magicka is 4/4 with Prophecy (for those who don't remember the cards with this characteristic can be played for free if drawn following the destruction of one of your runes), and to the Resistance which, in addition to the aforementioned Skeletal Dragon, can deploy in its ranks Fortitude of Ancient Blood which for 6 mana is a 6/6 that increases magicka maximum of 1 when it enters the battlefield (great for ~ramp~ decks). In any case, there are also other very respectable dragons in other colors, such as Quickwing Dragon for Red (8 magicka 5/5 with charge) or Dovah of the Voice (7 Magicka 6/4) who when he dies puts a Shout in your hand random; however, above all stands the neutral Alduin which costs 20 Magicka, is 12/12 and reduces the casting cost by two for each dragon in the graveyard, moreover, at the beginning of the turn it brings a random dragon from the graveyard back into play. Multicolored cards and deals for all budgets Probably the cards of The Elder Scrolls: Legends Heroes of Skyrim are on average less impactful than those introduced with the adventure The fall of the Dark Brotherhood but, certainly, they offer new combinations and give a breath of fresh air to the metagame and to that of the arena , a mode considered so important by the Dire Wolf Digital guys that some new cards in the set are really strong in the arena but of little importance in the game mode in which the decks are built. For purple, for example, cards like Cave Bear, a simple 5 Magicka 5/6, and Teacher of Regeneration, which is 3/4 to 4 magicka and fully heals a creature when it comes into play, are great in arena that will never or almost never be used in competitive decks. Among the 10 multicolored cards we highlight the yellow/red Crusader Assault which is very useful for aggressive decks, in fact it is an action that costs 3 mana and provides +2/+0, Breakthrough, Kill and ~Theft: draw a card~ to a creature, and, above all, the purple/blue Sorcerer's Denial, a 2 magicka action that silences an enemy creature and then deals it two damage (this order of effects is very useful since it denies the Last Breaths). Even neutral cards have gotten some good stuff like the Lute, a 1-cost piece of equipment that gives +1/+2 but makes the equipped creature immune to silence, and the A Night to Remember action, which allows your creature to disappear into thin air and appear imprisoned in the other battle zone: in particular this card is very useful in combo decks, given that the creature that reappears activates the Summon ability again if it has it. A new daily mission becomes available with the expansion and gives us three envelopes by attacking the opponent 30 times: certainly a good way to get new cards. Furthermore, in the shop there are 4 thematic decks dedicated to the new expansion which cost 500 coins (the equivalent of 5 game packs) and which guarantee you a deck ready to play with a unique legendary, some epic and many rare; for  6.99 you can buy the introductory package of Skyrim which gives you 10 envelopes of the expansion, a unique title and a random legendary (always from the new expansion) while, as usual, you can buy a single envelope for 100 coins or spend real money in the various offers available at the shop which tend to save you money in proportion to the number of envelopes purchased. As far as the visual aspect is concerned, no relevant changes have been made to the game interface or to the menus and in fact The Elder Scrolls: Legends Heroes of Skyrim maintains the quality of theillustrations of the cards already encountered previously; particularly successful is the animation of the Shouts with the on-screen display of the typical Skyrim runes that players are very familiar with. Only the playing field has been embellished and now it is no longer a single color but in the background, with each game, a different Skyrim-themed illustration appears. To top it all off there is new music when you start the game and navigate the menus that recalls The Song of Dragonborn, the splendid theme of the famous Bethesda game.", "date": "2017-07-05", "grade": "8.0"}
