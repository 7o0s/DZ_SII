Instead of drawing from mythological imagery, the story catapults us into a medieval Nordic universe of extreme crudeness, where we follow the adventures of the protagonist Crom, a rude warrior with his face permanently hidden by an ox skull, engaged in a vile story of revenge. His family was in fact exterminated by monstrous creatures who persist in calling him ~The Destroyer~. With the help of the little reassuring witch Morrigan we find ourselves facing countless fights, both with edged weapons and a series of magical techniques that can be accumulated throughout the game. These are gradually unlocked by absorbing enemy blood through a special glove, and range from voracious snakes to devastating electric shocks. In addition to this, Crom can take advantage of a special status called Berserk, which can be activated by pressing the back keys, which allows you to launch even more powerful attacks and even fatalities in pure Mortal Kombat style. The complete set of moves occupies practically all the keys on the pad, offering a fair number of offensive variants, as well as obviously the inevitable combos to be ringed by experimenting them on enemies. Why so much hate? Unfortunately there isn't much else to do, Bloodforge completely renounces sections of platforms, puzzles or anything else that could break the action component, thus resulting in an elaborate scrolling fighting game with a slight vein of exploration by virtue of the large areas proposals. Don't expect anything particularly complex, since there are more roads to go through and without a map altogether, the player must learn to orient himself by following visual references such as blood trails. Blood that flows copiously from start to finish and gives a definite personality to the product. Bloodforge actually runs the risk of being the most gory title of recent times, at least in the context of Live Arcade productions, with an unusual violence and an amount of gore that makes you shiver. Dismemberments and beheadings are the order of the second, as well as hemoglobin poured practically everywhere, managing to create a perverse contrast with the candid snow of the setting. The splendid artistic direction undoubtedly contributes to this, despite a not always satisfactory texture quality, the title makes up for with a masterful use of chiaroscuro and a chromatic desaturation reminiscent of Frank Miller's comics. All of the enemies wear macabre fetish attire that lends a dreamlike, almost horror-like atmosphere. Xbox 360 goals Bloodforge is one of the first Live Arcades to support Microsoft's new scoring policy, doubling player points to a total of 400. The 30 achievements require completing the main story, fully upgrading skills and completing blood duels against friends on your list. Happy slaughter! Murderous spree After a series of fights we are transported to a special area, a sort of hub that connects us to all the subsequent worlds, each culminating with a final boss that serves as a pretext for a highly spectacular battle. A very interesting detail of this area is the fact that it is synchronized with the Live infrastructure for updating the statistics. Inside it, all the players' records are then displayed and we have the possibility of comparing ourselves with our friends on the list, through a bar called bloodline which compares the performance in the game. The problem of Bloodforge is its derivative nature as little inclined to qualitative flashes, if we exclude the aesthetic impact there is nothing that has not already been seen elsewhere, from the aforementioned God Of War to Ninja Gaiden, everything drags on wearily and the combat system hides its rough nature with stacking. In a nutshell, slicing enemies turns out to be not only a little fun, but even frustrating due to the camera, among the worst ever seen in recent years and which forces you to constantly adjust your view to understand where to direct the shots. The defense consists solely of an evasive move without the possibility of parrying, along the lines of Bayonetta, but it is very easy to get hit by opponents anyway due to questionable collision detection, jerky animations and a generally low framerate, which has further drops in situations crowded. The almost absolute lack of a level design capable of giving variety to situations makes it imbathe comparison with the saga that Climax seems to continually recall is also racial, obviously that of Kratos.", "date": "2012-04-27", "grade": "5.5"}
