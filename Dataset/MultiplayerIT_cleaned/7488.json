When Dever announced the creation of a tie-in based on his work, many fans ran naked into the street for enthusiasm, except for self-flagellation when the writer specified that it would be a mobile game for iOS devices and android. In reality - we can say it with full knowledge of the facts - never as in this case the ~weight~ of the platform, or at least the general knowledge with respect to mobile productions, does not affect in any way the value of the project, which from the very first moments proves to be inspired and very solid. The idea of the Italian developers of Forge Reply was to mix a real gamebook, to be browsed on your smartphone or tablet in portrait mode (an effect impossible to obtain on your home TV, by the way), with a series of quick times events and Final Fantasy-style RPG mechanics, all distributed along four ~acts~ that can be purchased individually on the App Store and Google Play or all together, through the proven season pass system. The subject of this review is precisely the first part of the adventure, Joe Dever's Lone Wolf - Neve Rosso Sangue, which puts us in the role of the warrior Kai as he rushes to the rescue of the inhabitants of the village of Rockstarn, attacked by an army of Giaks, pathetic and violent creatures, very similar to ogres. Choose your destiny The game often and willingly asks you to make choices, starting with those concerning the creation of our character. Is it a strong and instinctive fighter or a skilled strategist? Does he wield an axe, mace or sword? What are the special skills that make up his repertoire? Once the profile is set, the story (written naturally by Dever himself) begins to flow while the ink appears on the pages of the book, to be browsed exactly like an ebook, until a situation arises that requires our intervention. Will we use a cautious approach at the cost of squandering an opportunity? Or will we charge headlong into the action? Or will we still resort to the sixth sense to understand what is the best way to behave? The choice made may possibly be followed by a quick time event (the rapid pressing of a key on the screen or the drawing of lines) which will determine its success or otherwise, therefore the plot will proceed accordingly, taking one of the possible ~crossroads~ that we will have just created. A map of the village will sometimes allow us to choose the next destination rather than following the course of events, and in passing from one place to another we will be able to dedicate some time to meditation to recover the energies used in battle. There are three indicators that interest us at this juncture: the first, red, counts the available hit points; the second, celestial, mystical energy; the third, green, physical vigour. When we encounter a group of Giaks, all three bars play a central role in the combat economy and allow us to win where our strategic choices are effective. Joe Dever's Lone Wolf - Blood Red Snow is an excellent product, a one of a kind experience The pact of the wolves As mentioned above, the one adopted by Joe Dever's Lone Wolf - Neve Rosso Sangue is a traditional turn-based combat system, in which timing is also important. By touching the weapon we will be able to attack the selected opponent by delivering a quick, medium or slow blow, with the last two requiring additional actions in the form of QTE; or we will be able to use the shield to prepare for the enemy phase. If, on the other hand, we touch the sheath of the knives, we will be able to throw one or three towards a single target or by distributing them among all the Giaks present. Again: by touching our character's head we will be able to use the Solar Sword, again with a quick time event (rapid pressing of a button) to determine the success of the maneuver, a very powerful fire shot that damages the opponent also for the following turns due to the flames. Finally, by touching Lone Wolf's legs we will be able to access the menu relating to the mystical arts and select one of those that appearano in our profile: psionic strike, call of the wolf, reading moves, telekinesis, healing and so on. The degree of challenge of the game depends on various factors, but it is by no means trivial and the more advanced clashes will be able to put you in serious difficulty, perhaps forcing you to start them again after the defeat and to better manage objects such as the inevitable healing potions. In balancing, the type of character created matters a lot: in our specific case, we completed the adventure (or rather, this first part) twice making diametrically opposite choices, but opting for heavier weapons and war rather than strategic capabilities proved to be essential to easily overcome even the fearsome Drakkar warriors. Short but intense So we come to sum up this experience which, let's be clear, is certainly one of the most interesting releases in 2013 on the App Store and Google Play. Joe Dever's Lone Wolf - Neve Rosso Sangue is a very ambitious title and the first act is nothing but a mere taste of a structure that takes shape before our eyes and which boasts enormous potential. The production value is very high, with a large use of very well done cinematics (but without Italian subtitles, which is inexplicable considering that all the texts have been translated), an atmospheric soundtrack and excellent in-game graphics for style, fluidity and detail. The polygonal models are perhaps a little sacrificed in the name of backwards compatibility, but the quality is still very high, the scenarios fairly varied and the animations convincing. The product is very simple on paper, but it is done damn well and at the end of the first act there is a great desire to continue the adventure, which brings us to the only real problem with this opening chapter: it is a bit too short . On the first lap, with all the inexperience of the case and a character devoted to strategy rather than effectiveness, it took about three hours to complete everything, while in the second lap we did a sort of speed run with a Lone Wolf beating like a blacksmith, closing the speech in just two hours but without dwelling on the passages already read. The point is that lengthening the stock a bit would not have affected the goodness of the experience in our opinion, in fact it would have been enough to introduce a couple more locations and perhaps induce us to visit others again to get an extra hour of gameplay. We hope that the planning of the next acts will also take this aspect into consideration.", "date": "2013-11-14", "grade": "8.8"}
