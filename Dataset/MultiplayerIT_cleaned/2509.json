{"name": "Excalibug", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/excalibug.html", "text": "Technically speaking Dinamic Multimedia once again presents a good level audio-visual creation which becomes even tastier if one takes into account the market policy adopted by the Iberian software house, by now well known thanks to titles such as the PC football franchise: all titles are sold, mainly at newsstands, for 39,900 lire. The minimum requirements to be able to play Excalibug settle on a P200, 64 mb of ram, 8 mb accelerated video card and 560 mb of hard disk; the recommended requirements speak of a P 233, 128 mb of ram, accelerated video card with 16 mb of ram and 720 mb of hard disk sacrificed for the cause; the undersigned recommends, to play optimally in 1024x768, a P2 400, 128 mb of ram and video card with 32 mb of onboard ram. Graphically speaking, the sprites can be considered just passable (few polygons and number of textures reduced to the minimum necessary) while the backdrops have, all in all, a good quality, textures much better than those of the characters and some touch of class such as the movement of the water well implemented or the spot on (how much fluid) animations of the carnivorous plants. On the other hand, it is disappointing to hear music bordering on the redundant (although at first glance it may also be whistled), sound effects in the most absolute standard (when it's good) while the speech is of a good standard, obviously entirely localized in Italian, with the participation of voices now famous in the world of Italian (and non-Italian) dubbing such as Roberta Gallina and Claudio Moneta, whose voices are linked to dozens of famous Anime characters such as the OVAs of Devilman, Fatal Fury, Kojiro, Yoma and the wonderful Ninja Scroll feature film in arrival on DVD. Post scriptum: the computer graphics sequences are decidedly well done, both in terms of technical realization and direction!!! Are you having fun? Mhhhhhh.. Someone says that there are two categories of video games: immediate games and more cerebral titles and, usually, the first immediately give a lot of satisfaction but at the same time are more subject to the ad libitum reclosing syndrome in the package, with consequent dust on the shelf ; the latter, who let themselves be ~trained~ little by little (despite some initial bad words ^_^), let themselves be played longer. The undersigned adds a middle ground to the two types just described: video games that become difficult even if against their own will, due to a game interface that is strange to say the least, if not completely to be reviewed. And if we are dealing with a hybrid between a ~light~ role-playing game (therefore comparable to those generally found on consoles or Diablo, more devoted to action) and a pale emulator of Commandos or Metal Gear Solid, you will agree with me in asserting that a disappointing interface can crucially affect the gaming experience. Luckily for Dinamic Multimedia (and for those who have already bought the game), after a few hours of playing you will be used to moving the view by placing the mouse cursor on the sides of the screen or zooming in on the playing area with the ~page up~ keys  and page down.certainly no one expected anything comparable to the interface of Lionhead's Black And White but certainly it could have been done better from this point of view. Appreciable good A.I. enemies who will detect your presence if you get too close to them or who will look away if you throw a pebble on the opposite side to divert their attention, to divert their attention. Your heroes have different characteristics from each other and if the thief is quick to flee and capable of distracting the enemies, the warrior can practically count on her brute strength alone while it should be noted that the NPCs are around forty. In addition to all that has been said so far, it is also good to mention the cooperative multiplayer mode where a handful of users join forces against evil in the fifteen scenarios included in the videogame package. Definitely Excalibug is the classic game that leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, thinking that with a better game interface and a better distribution of puzzles and fights it would have been a great game, to be consumed both alone and with friends. Taking into account its negligible price, the new creature of Dynamic Multimedia is aimed at those who want to play something different from the usual first person shooter, without spending the usual hundred; on the other hand the veterans of Rpg and arcade adventure (intoxicated by the beauty of the cornerstones dgenre, which have also been available on PC for some time) would do well to choose titles of much higher value such as Diablo 2 or Evil Islands in order not to be too disappointed. At this point we can only hope for a sequel, revised from the most important point of view for a video game, playability. Little big heroes In everyday life there are certain words that inevitably are inserted in a single context; the Holy Grail, for example, is an object (biblical, if we want to give certain legends about it) which belongs, with some exceptions, to the stories dating back to the eleventh century written by French authors in the language of Oil; we are obviously talking about the Breton cycle (novelistic-erotic-adventure-like), attributed to the poet Chretien De Troyes, which had as protagonists now famous characters such as Lancelot, Tristan but above all King Arthur and, going back a few lines further up, to the Holy Grail. In the development of the present Excalibug (contained in 2 cd-roms), Enigma Software must have drawn liberally from this cultural heritage but, at the same time, must have been influenced by computer graphics feature films such as ~A Bug's Life~ and Z La Formica, to name a few illustrious examples. The universe in which the adventure takes place is parallel to ours, with ants, bees and many other types of insects that for the occasion play the role of warriors, thieves, traders, soldiers and so on.", "date": "2001-05-12", "grade": null}
