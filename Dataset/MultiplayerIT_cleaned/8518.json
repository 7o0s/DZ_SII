There are Keiichiro Toyama and Naoko Sato, to begin with, respectively director and writer of the game but above all creators of the first, legendary Silent Hill and the less famous Siren series; then there is, unexpectedly, Crackdown, the third-person shooter from Realtime Worlds which seems to have considerably influenced some gameplay mechanics; and there is also Mbius, a great French cartoonist, who recently passed away, whose works were the first source of inspiration in the creation of Hekseville. And there are also many comics and cartoons that have given an approach and a tone to the adventure, helping to create a universe full of personalities that manages not to fall into stereotypes, especially visual ones. But above all, there is an idea, an apparently very simple idea integrated in a truly ingenious and original way. Ladies and gentlemen, we present Kat... The friendly neighborhood cat Gravity Rush is an adventure that develops around a plot that is anything but obvious or trivial, although the incipit is certainly not the most original, narrated in the third person by the protagonist herself, who wakes up at the beginning of the game completely without of memories, accompanied by a strange kitten who gives her the power to alter gravity. Renamed Kat, our blonde heroine will discover that the people of Hekseville, the strange city in which she is located, call those like her ~shifters~, individuals with strange special powers. And with great power comes great responsibility, we all know this a little, and therefore Kat, who has a heart of gold, decides to put them at the service of Hekseville, in an attempt to rebuild the city, devastated by mysterious gravitational vortexes and bizarre gelatinous creatures called Nevi, capable of even possessing people. And as if that weren't enough, Kat also has to contend with Raven, a beautiful ~shifter~ like her who however seems to have less noble purposes, and a series of mysterious individuals with shady objectives. The story, divided into episodes, is told through a mixture of cutscenes, texts and real comics that can be scrolled by touching the touch-screen; a combination that makes Gravity Rush even more like a kind of interactive anime and that respects all the canons of the superhero genre: the attractive heroine first misunderstood and then adored, the sentimental interest, the rival, the mysterious enemies in the shadows. On the other hand, the choice of dubbing is curious, deliberately incomprehensible: Kat speaks in a non-existent language that vaguely resembles French (another reference to the late Mbius?) but there is no need to despair given that all the texts of the game are translated into a excellent Italian. In short, the story of Gravity Rush is a fundamental component of the game, intriguing enough to keep the player glued to find out what will happen next, thanks also to the characterization of the adorable protagonist and his funny enemies and supporting actors, but above all because of a sparkling and original narration, accompanied by a spot-on soundtrack, exhilarating in the most compelling moments and a perfect accompaniment during our wanderings around Hekseville. PSVita trophies There are 40 Trophies to unlock in Gravity Rush: to be precise 25 Bronze, 10 Silver, 4 Gold and the inevitable Platinum. Most are easy to obtain, just complete the various chapters of the story, but others will require a little more patience: you will have to defeat all kinds of enemies, fully upgrade Kat's abilities, complete all challenges and more. Power to gravity Gravity Rush is a third-person adventure that recalls several more recent franchises such as inFamous and Prototype, with which it shares not only the concept of the hero with superpowers, but also the vaguely free-roaming setting: Kat can in fact explore Hekseville its neighborhoods, as they are unlocked by progressing through the story, interacting with some inhabitants and facing some optional challenges between one chapter and another. In truth, there isn't all that much to do when you haven't embarked on a mission, and the world of Gravity Rush seems to exist solely for the pleasure of exploration; the convenient map of the city, moreover, signals us through colored icons where we must go to start a new chapter in the story or a challenge, therefore the player is never left to himself. But on the other hand, it's impossible not to take advantage of Kat's superpowers to explore such well-kept and rich settingsof details: the steampunk atmosphere of Hekseville goes perfectly with the cel-shaded cosmetics and the carefully chosen colors from neighborhood to neighborhood; the result is a feast for the eyes, undermined only by a little aliasing which is taken ignored in the face of the quality of the animations and the complex architectures. The desire to press the R key to alter gravity is therefore a lot at all times, simply because it's fun: at that point Kat remains suspended in mid-air and it is possible to move the camera with the right analog stick or, even better, move the console directly to point a sort of viewfinder towards the direction in which we want to move the force of gravity. As a result, Kat will be drawn to the new surface, on which she can walk a bit like Spiderman, flipping up and down at will. The new gravitational attraction can also be manipulated in other ways, for example by allowing us to move at high speed from one point to another, a bit 'as if we were flying, in a spectacular yet functional display of our superpowers. You must always keep an eye on the appropriate indicator, however, because Kat can only alter gravity for a handful of seconds, then everything will go back to the way it was before, and woe to you if you don't have a roof (or a floor!) over your head . Luckily, it is possible to collect special blue gems around the world that immediately recharge the indicator or other purple gems, even better, which allow us to enhance our skills, for example increasing the duration of our powers, the speed of displacement, physical stamina, attack power, and more. Hence the influence of Crackdown, in a sort of extremely simple and intuitive Role Playing Game mechanics: Kat will in fact have to use her powers to fight enemies, especially the Nevi, and will be able to do so in various ways. The inevitable kick combo is just one of these, inelegant but effective, or it can lift surrounding objects in a gravitational field to hurl them against the Nevi's weak point, the only vulnerable part of their body, often even hidden by armor protective. Even more powerful is the gravitational kick which exploits the speed of attraction and which can be used in chains, a bit like Sonic the hedgehog's rotating attack. The circle is closed by a series of super attacks that can be used periodically and which perform the function of real area smart-bombs. The control system allows you to perform all these actions with great simplicity and sometimes also involves the touch-screen, especially if you want to dodge, just swiping it to the right or left, or making a spectacular slide by pressing the lower corners of the screen and using the gyroscope of PlayStation Vita to direct Kat. The numerous applications of Kat's superpower are at the center of the various optional challenges that it is possible to complete to obtain even more gems with which to enhance skills, gradually more and more difficult and complex: however numerous and fun they are, they are perhaps the offer a little more repetitive than the package, fortunately negligible if you just want to advance in the story, although it is still advisable to take advantage of it to enhance our heroine, especially in view of the gigantic bosses at the end of the chapter that we will often have to face, which often require more use original of the powers and an ever greater power and precision of the attacks.", "date": "2012-05-24", "grade": "9.3"}
