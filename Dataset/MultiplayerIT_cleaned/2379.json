{"name": "Commander Keen", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/commander-keen-2.html", "text": "A helmet and a gun to fight evil! The game is very similar to the version of 8 years ago and once again the bold Billy Blaze with his inevitable space helmet will have to deal with the evil Vorticon. Following the same tradition of titles such as Duke Nukem and Jazz Jackrabbit, Commander Keen usually presents itself as a side-scrolling action game in which the fulfillment of certain movements such as jumping for the continuation of the adventure is very important. The other operation that will be required of you is to immobilize the enemies with your gun in order to avoid being devitalized by their attacks. The enemies, for their part, will pop out from all sides: you can find them along the pitch path or between one platform and another, ready to throw you into the cliff if you haven't immobilized them in time. If you are looking for an action game that is difficult and therefore worthy of practice Commander Keen is the one for you. In fact, at the beginning it will not be as easy to move and above all to make the jumps which, as I had already said, are essential both to continue the adventure and to access the elevated locations. The difficulty of making a jump is one of the most significant defects that I have been able to find: in fact, you will find it frustrating to often fall off the cliffs due to the excessive difficulty of the jumps, which cannot be controlled precisely. Once you start the game you will be asked to choose between three different difficulty levels: easy, normal and hard. In my opinion it will be better for you to start from the easy level where the difficulty of control will already make life difficult for you. An ~improved~ graphics! The only aspect in which this version for GBA differs from the PC counterpart is the graphics sector. It has undergone a significant restyling appearing much more colorful and attractive. Even the level of detail of the scenarios is unchanged, while the characters continue to be formed by 2-3 sprites giving a retro feel to the game. The graphics are in pure 2D and in some levels you will move through the use of a strange ball from which you will shoot at the various enemies thanks to your trusty gun. As you can deduce from these debuts, it is a classic platformer that adds nothing to the genre, but I assure you that the gameplay is at good levels, making the continuation of the adventure very fun. Your task will not only be to shoot, but you will also have to recover many card keys and unlock doors that will allow you to access new locations. YYYY Savior of humanity wanted! Surely given the impossibility of using the fantastic platform cartridges for Game Boy Advance like that of Super Mario Advance on Game Boy Color, Commander Keen deserves a pass vote because it sets an example of how you can create a good platform even if you don't have the superlative features of a machine like the Advance. However, there are some defects that could be eliminated and which greatly affect the game such as for example the lack of control in the jump which makes the title very short-lived especially for those who do not like to waste time practicing and prefer a simpler and more less challenging. Commander Keen calls for a savior of humanity from planet Earth! Do any of you feel like answering the call? 8 Pros: Well done 2D graphics Many game levels 38 different enemies to neutralize Cons: Difficulty of control especially in jumps If you give up practicing the movements you will surely abandon it in a drawer as long as you haven't thrown it out of the window first out of frustration Little sound engaging The return of the boy who punishes aliens... Surely the older ones of you have already heard of this game, released in the early 90s on PC with the title of Commander Keen Episode I: Marooned on Mars. Now the members of the team called David A. Palmer Productions have decided to bring the sympathetic protagonist back to the Game Boy Color screen, hoping to find followers among the new generation of console gaming ready to experience a new adventure in space.", "date": "2001-10-26", "grade": null}
