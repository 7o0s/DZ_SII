It tells the story of a TV show in which teams of prisoners are forced to fight each other to the death, controlled ~remotely~ by some expert gamers, as if they were characters in a video game. In Bullet Run, more or less the same thing happens, but without remote control: the participants in the transmission fight to the death in different arenas, but thanks to the Synth technology they can transfer their consciousness into a new body when they are killed. The goal is simple: eliminate as many opponents as possible and earn fame and fortune. Developed by ACONY and produced by Sony Online Entertainment, the game adopts the free-to-play model and can therefore be downloaded for free, providing us with two possibilities of use: on the one hand, remaining free users and earning points solely with experience, however resigning ourselves to a very tough ~mess~ because we will immediately be faced with ~premium~ users with the most varied advantages; on the other hand, signing up for a monthly subscription for around 15 dollars or limiting ourselves to purchasing certain performance packages in order to be able to compete at high levels in a short time. One of the undoubted advantages of F2P is that it allows you to test games extensively and put your wallet in hand only when we are convinced that it is worth it, and that therefore we will spend quite a few hours on those servers. On the other hand, the hard initial confrontation with the opponents, not only ~skilled~ but also equipped with extra upgrades, can only prove frustrating and perhaps obscure some aspects of the product that instead deserve more attention. Does Bullet Run fit that description? Let's find out together. Free to pay The initial setup is very intuitive, although there are many elements of the ACENY title that refer to the most famous FPS: you create a character using the available assets (others will be unlocked later), you select a server from the list or you start a random match and away we are in the fray. Bullet Run currently offers only two modes: the classic Team Deathmatch and Dominion, in which you must respectively eliminate as many opponents as possible within a time limit and defend (or attack) positions on the map by collecting points, always within a time limit. Free users have no limitations in terms of game creation, which can be set up by selecting a round length of ten, fifteen or twenty minutes, with or without friendly fire, bringing the total participants to six, ten, sixteen or twenty players and filtering them by area (USA East, USA West and Europe). This last factor is very important, because it substantially affects the enjoyment of the experience: American users have much faster connections than ours, and in a product that is already unbalanced due to the free-to-play dynamics, it is not it is precisely the case to also introduce the lag factor. The first games we played, selecting servers randomly, were in fact the latency fair, with opponents who eliminated us with a glance while an entire clip was not enough to bring them down. Finally we come to the maps, currently six: Cactus, Drain, Oilrig, Shanty, Studio and Warehouse. These are quite different scenarios from each other, fairly extensive but not so much as to force us to turn them far and wide in search of a member of the opposing team. Obviously, there is no shortage of raised positions, where the ~camperoni~ love to lurk, or corners hidden from view, or walls to shelter from enemy fire. Pay-to-win Let's say right away to those who prefer to play FPS with the pad that unfortunately Bullet Run doesn't support the Xbox 360 controller well, so mouse and keyboard are a must. The configuration of the controls is of the traditional type, with the left click of the mouse to open fire, the right click for the iron sight and the scroll wheel to change the equipped weapon between primary, secondary, grenade and knife. The spacebar allows us to jump, the SHIFT to run, while the R key activates the reload as usual. In this regard, the developers wanted to be inspired by Gears of War and introduce the concept of ~active reload~ here too, or a double press of the button within an indicator to obtain a faster reload or see the weapon ignobly jam. When an opponent dies it is possible to pick up their weapon and thus experience the joys of premium equipment, however briefly. Similarly, our character can be enhanced with a series of ~perks~ that allow himor to recover health, enter berserk mode, place turrets, launch explosive drones, and so on. In terms of pure gameplay, the action is frenetic and is very close to the atmosphere of Call of Duty, while the strategic element is completely absent, as could be expected. By completing matches (hopefully victorious) and earning credits, you can buy new weapons and items, then customize up to four ~loadouts~ to select both before and during a match, with different equipment depending on the situation. Also in this case the free user finds himself at a disadvantage, because several hours of play are needed to be able to collect the credits necessary to buy the most effective weapons. Technically speaking The graphics engine used for Bullet Run is fairly scalable and allowed us to test the game on a notebook with ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5650 video card, even if we had to compromise in terms of resolution (opting for 1280 x 720 in native location 1600 x 900 pixels) and detail (set to medium). It doesn't seem like an exceptional result if we think about the performance of the Source on the same configuration, with Left 4 Dead 2 running smoothly with effects maxed out, at full resolution, maintaining 30-40 fps even in the busiest situations. It doesn't seem exceptional to us also and above all because the graphics of the ACONY title are at least anonymous both in the characters and in the scenarios, it does not have a recognizable design or a level of detail up to the hardware requirements, and also suffers from a lot of glitches in the rendering of the polygons, with interpenetrations on the agenda and the total absence of interaction with the environment. In short, with the next updates we expect not only an enrichment on the content front, perhaps with a new mode and a new map, but also and above all an optimization work that leads to an improvement in performance on less powerful configurations and perhaps to a limitation of the defects.", "date": "2012-08-23", "grade": "6.5"}
