{"name": "Nowhere", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nowhere_a.html", "text": "We will play as John or Lucas, in reality we cannot tell you more about the protagonist in order not to spoil the excellent plot of this decidedly creepy adventure, which also revolves around two other women, Sophia or Catherine and the mysterious Emily. The atmosphere you breathe is the right compromise between the two progenitors of the genre, Resident Evil and Silent Hill. We will move through a small town and through the forests trying to solve the mystery hidden in Emily's room. We will not be able to fight the horrible creatures that we will suddenly find ourselves in front of, and if we do it will almost always be pain, we will have to run away and hide in the shadows. In addition to avoiding enemies while remaining in the shadows we will have to put together all the pieces of the intricate puzzle to get to the bottom of the story, during the adventure we will also have to solve puzzles before we can advance along our path. We will get to know the many characters who populate the game created by In-fusio and we will be able to dialogue with all of them, recovering valuable information as well as indispensable objects, such as weapons or keys to open certain locks. During the adventure we will come into contact with strange plants with the effigy of the hero sprouting from the ground, we will absolutely have to destroy them to increase our life. John or Lucas, if you prefer, will be able to use all the objects he finds by simply collecting them in his equipment and then using them automatically at the right time. From a technical point of view we are in the presence of a little gem, the scenarios in which our character moves are very detailed and cared for down to the smallest detail. The gloomy and oppressive atmosphere has been perfectly recreated as well as the look of the monsters and more generally of all the protagonists of the story. The control system works perfectly and thanks to the cross composed of the 6,4,8,2 keys or the d-pad of the mobile phone we will be able to move our character with precision and speed. We also remind you that Nowhere was nominated for the ~Best Scenario 2007 Award~ by the AFJV (Agence Franaise pour le Jeu Vido), certainly a guarantee of quality. We really liked the possibility of playing a survival horror on our mobile even if we are aware that it certainly isn't the most suitable genre to be exploited, perhaps quickly, on a mobile phone screen. PRO Great atmosphere Technically beautiful Good texture AGAINST Not for a quick game", "date": "2008-01-15", "grade": "S.V."}
