Of course, the Nintendo dual-screen laptop could not be missing. So here we are grappling with this new chapter in a series that is continuing to live despite the increasingly advanced age. From dragonfly... to dragon! However, a well-chosen and ingenious main underlying idea is not enough to raise the level of the game which turns out to be rather mediocre. If the control system is innovative and fun, unfortunately it all expires due to a decidedly too poor variety of situations to deal with. The different types of enemies are far too few and gradually the sequences that are proposed in their appearances - because they literally appear out of nowhere - after a while they all seem the same. Not even the division of weapons into four different categories - fire, earth, ice and wind - which obviously see enemies more or less sensitive to their effects depending on the color of the lock indicator fails to give a little variety. Finally, the possibility of carrying out combos or direct attacks prove to be completely useless, leaving almost exclusively an effective utility only to long and medium-range attacks. The monotony of the gameplay, despite being the biggest, however, is not the only flaw. The stylistic choices are absolutely inconclusive and not linked to each other both for the design of the characters and for that of the backdrops, reaching the peak of the lack of coherence in the choice of enemies at the end of the level. In a world of mushrooms and dragonflies, one wonders, for example, what will ever hit an animated locomotive, or a stone monster? Technically then we are faced with a game with incredible ups and downs. On the one hand we witness a very flat main mode where even sometimes the two-dimensional backdrop snaps, on the other we find excellent polygonal graphics -although moving on rails- and we conclude by running into the splendid videos... It almost seems that three different teams -which is very possible among other things- have assembled various pieces without cohesion between them. Finally, the music is very few since the action is accompanied only with sound effects, on the one hand it is to be said fortunately since the ones that exist do not go beyond the sufficiency. A reflective minigame The present minigame turns out to be decidedly intriguing even if it tastes like it has already been seen and is sometimes too easy. Thanks to the use of a finite series of mirrors, prisms and splitters, certain crystals must be illuminated with a beam. The ray is emitted by some fixed gems and sent, white or colored, in a straight line. With the various reflections you have to hit the crystals of the right color with the correct light beam. It's a real shame to see such a good idea exploited so badly. The ~thumb~ lock on, in addition to embarrassingly smearing the sensitive screen, also exploits the DS in a truly apt way. A greater variety and stylistic coherence would certainly have benefited a decidedly below average title and which is remembered for very little. Also because ~little~ turns out to be the game itself, with only six levels and very few spurs to continue. Valuable even if all too easy the mini-game -as told in the box-. A title that turns out to be a real wasted opportunity Pros: Excellent use of the touch screen Spectacular videos Good graphics of the 3D environments Cons: Too monotonous and flat Just mediocre technical realization in the main part Too incoherent and poorly cared for style Pink flakes everywhere! The plot -rather silly- sees Spyro intent on playing with his little dragonfly brother. Yes, because, after being abandoned by his real parents, he is adopted by a couple of these nice insects, and he ~obviously~ thinks he is... But, the arrival of the minions of an evil dark dragon and the knowledge of a wise dragon will lead him to true awareness of his nature, but also to the dangerous search for three mysterious kidnapped sages. Although inconclusive and ugly, the plot is told through splendid full motion video: rarely on DS can films of such technical quality be observed. But what game are we talking about? The clichs of the series that saw the previous episodes framed in the platform genre are decidedly abandoned. Here we are faced - as has already happened in the versions for home consoles - in front of an action fighting game / shooter. The view is, in fact, isometric and sees the combination of a two-dimensional backdrop with a series of enemies and polygonal characters. In what is somewhat reminiscent of Koei titles, where an intrepid lone hero must takemauling huge masses of enemies, Spyro moves with a brilliant and quite innovative idea. The touch screen is in fact used for an unprecedented lock-on system with finger! The various attacks both at a distance and close up are in fact carried out by pressing the corresponding keys a, b, x and y, but only towards the enemies that are first selected with the due and precise pressure of the touch screen. The movement is instead delegated to the cross. What at first seems like an unfortunate system turns out to be extremely rewarding, fun and confusing with a minimum of practice! In fact, it becomes necessary to quickly use both thumbs to indicate the many enemies, learning the various techniques and weapons necessary to shoot them down, which is definitely fun. It is also sometimes required to use the stylus - as if that were not enough - to perform rare actions that require more precision or to complete the nice mini-game present. The offer is completed by the sections of the fight against the enemies at the end of the level. Here everything changes by introducing a nice polygonal graphics that sees us engaged in a shooter of the most classic tracks, but to be played by indicating with the stylus the various sensitive points on the enemies that we chase from time to time.", "date": "2007-01-09", "grade": null}
