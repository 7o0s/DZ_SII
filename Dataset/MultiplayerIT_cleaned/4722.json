However, the franchise still has a future and a possible brand promotion work also passes through mobile devices: this is why, in collaboration with Nexon, Titanfall: Assault was created, a multiplayer-based strategy game for iOS and Android that incorporates the mechanics of the blockbuster Clash Royale and applies them precisely to the universe created by the former Infinity Ward, with spectacular battles fought by two teams of Pilots and the inevitable wait for the release of the Titans. Structurally, the two titles are practically identical: from the main screen it is possible to manage the team by selecting the best cards and enhancing those we own in multiple copies, obtainable through well-tested daily reward systems, to then start matchmaking and quickly find an opponent to tackle within the map. Once in the field, however, some differences begin to be noticed: in the first place, the map is viewed from above in three-quarter view, although it is possible to rotate and zoom it at will; secondly, the graphics do not adopt a cartoon style, but rather faithfully reproduce the style of the mother series for Piloti and Titan, accompanied by cinematic music. Titan my friend Even on the gameplay front Titanfall: Assault is not identical to Clash Royale. In fact, the matches combine territorial control mechanisms, with three positions to be conquered and defended to score the hundred points necessary for victory, with the need to destroy the enemy base. Two distinct possibilities, therefore, which open up to as many strategic approaches: will we try to maintain control of the bases or will we aim at the enemy stronghold? Whatever our choices, we will have to deal with an energy system very similar to that of the Supercell title, with cells that increase as the seconds pass and allow us to project Pilots, Burn Cards or Titans onto the map. The characters will move on their own, attacking enemies within range and defending any conquered positions, but we will be able to act directly, for example by drawing missiles from the Burn Cards or by placing defense turrets near sensitive points. As for the Titans, as in the mother series it is possible to recall them only after a while and their placement in the scenario cannot be free, but will be linked to the control points. In any case, it goes without saying that having a more powerful deck makes a big difference in the economy of the games, but it is in this sense that matchmaking capable of balancing the users' skills well so as not to create situations of obvious advantage is useful or disadvantage. The formula works very well and is fun, although the dispersion of some dynamics inevitably makes the mobile game produced by Nexon less brilliant than the blockbuster that inspired it.", "date": "2017-08-16", "grade": "8.0"}
