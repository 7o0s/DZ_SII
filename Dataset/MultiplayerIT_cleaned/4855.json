On the one hand, the legendary Japanese house is today perhaps the one that most supports its competitive scene, cultivating the best players in the world with well-organized tournaments, substantial prize money and worthy support for its flagship title in the genre. However, the other face of the house has darkened after a series of not very clever commercial policies, an unpleasant tendency to speculate on its historical brands, despite the fact that it has objectively done a good job with Resident Evil 7, and an exploitation of its main names for ~ raise cash~ which, although sensible in times of lean, is sometimes quite degrading. Love it or hate it, however, Capcom remains synonymous with fighting games, as the house that practically created the genre. And the game from which it all started was perhaps the one that has seen the most re-editions in the house library, so much so that it has not disappeared even in this generation of consoles. However, the latest ~Street Fighter II~ to hit the market isn't widespread on every possible and imaginable platform: it's called Ultra Street Fighter II, it's currently a Nintendo Switch exclusive and was presented by the good Yoshinori Ono as ~the definitive of the game~. We, who are obviously cynics at heart, thought it best to put his words to the test by throwing ourselves into the title for a few days, and today we will tell you if it is actually the case for lovers of this classic to switch to the Nintendo hybrid console or less. Is Ultra Street Fighter II really the definitive version of the progenitor of fighting games? Martial controversy Let's start from the first controversies related to this ~port~, given that Ultra Street Fighter II is nothing more than the transposition of Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, a remake dating back to 2009, known for being redesigned by Udon Entertainment. This choice has already sparked some criticism, because, in addition to being a rather old work, HD Remix has always been criticized for the fluctuating quality of its graphics, pleasant in fixed screens but anything but a moving bomb. Not only that, many enthusiasts consider the truly definitive version of the game the Super Turbo - not really easy to find - and therefore expected to see a remake of that after so long; Capcom was therefore attacked for sitting on its laurels and simply doing an old-fashioned copy and paste. The truth, however, is quite different: it is true that nothing has been done from a graphic point of view, but Ultra Street Fighter II is not HD Remix in all respects, on the contrary, it contains some sensitive changes to the system, which make it a different title from its predecessor. We're not talking about content, but about mechanics: Street Fighter II for Switch allows you to escape from grips, something absent from the original titles that completely changes the balance of the game, eliminating various offensive options from many characters. As if this were not enough, the title also contains significant changes to the balance of some fighters, which reduce the excessive power of some and improve others. In short, Capcom has actually got its hands on this product, avoiding the dry port and actually trying to revise the combat system; the clashes are, for example, slower than those of HD Remix (and the very fast Super Turbo), and the execution of the moves is slightly simplified. It's pretty much relaunched modern Street Fighter, if only marginally. The old coinage The first criticism of the game therefore dies in the bud, because the remake is modified to the point of changing part of the internal balance of the system. However, the problems remain, and they are quite different. To understand the first, we really need to go back to the balancing act, which is so difficult to evaluate at the moment, but presents quite impressive oversights: Akuma - a character banned from most tournaments - has remained almost unchanged and is always absolutely devastating; many warriors weakened by grappling changes have not received improvements capable of putting them back on the level of others; finally, the new characters introduced do not seem to have improved the variety of the roster much. In particular these two, Evil Ryu and Violent Ken, are simple variants of the ~classic shoto~ (and Evil Ryu is dangerously close to Akuma in terms of effectiveness), therefore not redesigned characters, but pure reskin with marginal modifications of the usual Ryu and Ken . A typical example of maximum results with minimum effort, without even having to call Udon to draw someone else. Of course, it must be said ch the changes to the balance will be completely ignored by the majority of the public, very little interested in the balance of the game, but for less expert users there is another flaw that cannot be ignored: the price. Ultra Street Fighter II costs forty euros, a blow for a title of this age, and completely unjustified if you count the extras contained in this edition. The ability to recolor characters? Pretty, but really cheap stuff. The artwork gallery? Insignificant. The ability to play co-op against the CPU? This too is negligible. Even the many difficulties included in the classic arcade mode are worth little, because we are talking about basic artificial intelligence programming: the opponent at the highest level of challenge does not react as a human would do, he limits himself to automatically responding to certain inputs, and is therefore beatable as soon as you understand which action corresponds to a reaction. To put it bluntly... they made the least effort here too. The way of hado is a shortcut The only real novelty is therefore represented by the Way of the Hado mode, which however is truly a rare sadness. No, you can't go around it, because it's a sop that takes advantage of the Switch's motion controls in a sort of arcade minigame in which - in the role of Ryu - agents of Shadaloo are eliminated by dint of Hadoken, Shoryuken and Tatsumaki Senpukyaku (you can even yell ~attackensplugen~, we understand you); only that as long as these moves are performed in the tutorial everything works fine, as soon as they are applied together in the real game everything mixes badly, and it is very difficult to start the desired move. For the record, only Ultra Street Fighter is to blame, given that the Joy-Con Switches are more than accurate: just test ARMS for about thirty seconds to notice. The only thing we couldn't test properly, sadly, is online, which is still inactive at the time of our review (it will be activated at launch with a patch). Now, it will certainly be a classic mode with ranked and unranked matches, and it's really hard to expect a disaster at launch, given the age of the game involved and the far from enormous amount of data to take into consideration during the matches, so for the evaluation we decided to start from the assumption that everything works properly. In case of problems, the situation would be very serious, since having examined the contents just described, the game practically lives only on online and pure nostalgia. And let's be clear, Street Fighter II is still a timeless classic. It will be simple compared to today's fighting games, it will be limited, it will be old and visually raw, but it still has an incredible charm, and the ability to reactivate original sounds and graphics are an easy way to rekindle that flame that burned in the good old days of the cabinets. But it's basically just the quality of the game this remake relies on that underpins the whole package; the rest, objectively speaking, convinced us little.", "date": "2017-05-24", "grade": "7.0"}
