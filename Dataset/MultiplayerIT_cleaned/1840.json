{"name": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-ghost-recon.html", "text": "[***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] The enemy is around the corner The graphics of Ghost Recon are detailed as regards the 3d models of the soldiers, even if to a more demanding eye it might appear a bit flat and blocky. The environments are well done, and even if on Playstation 2 we have been accustomed to technical levels of a very different caliber, all the graphic apparatus performs its intended task well. In our opinion, the sound is a very engaging element of TCGR: the purely environmental background in the quieter game phases quickly transforms from the first shot into a perfect film soundtrack, which involves the player. The sound effects of the weapons are also beautiful, a pity only for the speech, well done as regards the briefing, a bit repetitive and flat instead for the comments of your companions (especially when compared with the wonderful English-language dubbing). Playability is also at high levels: although initially the difficulty of the game could be frustrating, the satisfaction resulting from the completion of a mission, especially without losses in one's ranks, combined with the possibility of being able to increase and customize the characteristics of one's troops and to obtain new and more powerful specialists, give a huge impetus to continue in the game. Also very useful is the basic tutorial to familiarize yourself with the game controls, and the tactical exercises that will give you a taste of the missions you will have to face later in the game. Longevity remains standard thanks to the multiplayer mode, which will allow you to challenge your friends in the scenarios unlocked in the single player campaign.

The introduction of evolutionary elements such as the aforementioned possibility of enhancing one's soldiers has proved to be a very interesting element in the latest Red Storm effort, effectively increasing the playability and enjoyment of titles of the genre. In fact, this feature allows you to shape your own (or your own in this case) videogame alter ego to your own fighting style. The missions and maps are then excellently done, and will keep you glued to the screen hoping to snatch a minimal clue that reveals the positions of your enemies to hit them once identified. Ultimately Ghost Recon is a good game, a pity about the graphics that are perhaps a little too essential and sometimes (especially in the interiors of the buildings) a little ~flat~, but the gameplay will soon make you forget the graphic defects. A good option for everyone, an excellent title for lovers of the genre. Pros: Very interesting and varied missions Possibility to upgrade your soldiers Atmospheric sound Cons: Graphically essential You have to get used to it Year 2008, the world is on the brink of war: a group of ultra-radicals has seized power in Russia, and, trying to rebuild the former Soviet Union, has invaded and burned down nations such as Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania . However, the spearhead of the American army is arriving from the United States to Georgia: Company D, the first line of defense against imminent danger. These soldiers strike fast, silently and invisibly, so much so that they have earned the title of ~Ghost~ (ghosts). As Company D, your task will be to restore peace, or in the extreme case to preserve the rest of the world from the expansionist aims of Russian radicals. In command of six men, divided into two teams (Alpha and Bravo), you will be assigned multiple military objectives, ranging from the recovery of pilots to the elimination of menacing armored vehicles, all while always trying to maintain the highest degree of secrecy. The first thing to do will therefore be to choose your team, for which four different types of soldier will initially be made available to you: Rifleman, armed with a machine gun equipped with an integrated grenade launcher and which represents the most versatile unit; Demolisher, equipped, as the term itself suggests, with everything necessary to eliminate tanks and the like; Support, the typical soldier armed with a heavy machine gun to be used for covering fire; Sniper, equipped with a sniper rifle to hit enemies at very long distances. Once the selection of your team has been completed and the ~lucky~ six have been chosen, you will immediately be thrown without precautions into the fray armed with your trusty equipment.happiness and trust in your companions. At this point the player will have to complete the mission assigned to him by controlling both teams made up of three men each, guiding one in person and managing the other via remote commands. Naturally during the game it is possible to switch control both from one squad to another and from soldier to soldier. At the end of a successfully completed mission your soldiers will be awarded medals for their work and points for increasing their characteristics (weapon control, stealth, endurance and leadership). A further reward for the success of a mission will be to be able to access the so-called ~specialists~, soldiers trained and specialized in a certain aspect and equipped with very high characteristics.", "date": "2003-01-03", "grade": null}
