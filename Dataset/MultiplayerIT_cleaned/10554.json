Then it happens that a small software house, with only one game active before now - the only discreet Urban Chaos - comes up with one of the most pleasant surprises of this 2009 and with one of the best action games ever released in this generation of hardware. What's even more pleasing is that Batman, one of DC Comics' most charismatic characters, who had never had too much luck in dozens of interactive digital transpositions, benefited from this happy combination. This time, things definitely went for the best. The Joker is crazy! Everything is going great in Arkham Asylum/Penitentiary. The Joker has been captured and is being transported, all too meekly, to the cell that will host him for years to come. The night outside is, as expected, dark and stormy and Batman does not trust. And he's right. The trap is sprung, the Joker frees himself and becomes the master of the asylum for a dark plan that unfolds through a series of beautiful twists and the appearance, never forced, of the most hated characters in the series, starting with Poison Ivy to arrive to the Scarecrow. Just the way in which the various protagonists are treated, and the inclusion of some of the key points of the anti-hero ~Batman~ are the most valuable elements of the game packaged by Rocksteady, who also take the luxury of bringing up the birth of Batman himself, in a scene that will thrill those who love the hero born from the pen of Bob Kane. The style is adult, with still the echo of the Dark Knight who achieved stratospheric box office collections, and the reconstruction of the settings is full of details, without repeated areas and with dozens of small touches of class. The structure is that of an action game that revolves around the courtyard of the asylum, crossing which you reach the six main areas in which our hero will have to investigate to solve the obscure points of a very well thought out plot. To do this there is a special viewer that highlights the elements interactive seabed and the interesting parts to explore, as well as the points in which to use the thousands of gadgets that are purchased by progressing in the game, and which allow you to gradually access new areas, previously unreachable. Gadgets that serve above all to give the gameplay a considerable depth (and a great freedom of choice for the player), given that any situation can be faced openly, or in an absolutely silent way, hiding in the shadows or descending on enemies by leaning out of the gargoyles adorning several of the asylum's interiors. Of course, there's also to be beaten, with blows, parries, counter-moves and dozens of combos, which end with the camera clutching the bat man and the unfortunate ones on duty crashing in slow motion against the walls of the asylum, freeing a sense of remarkable power, as well as favoring the player's identification. With each fight, depending on the combinations made and the variety of techniques used, experience points accumulate to be spent to increase Batman's attack and defense skills, as well as to upgrade some gadgets, until he becomes a war machine unstoppable. Also because the opponents who stand before him are not exactly geniuses, with the artificial intelligence routines showing the side, going to constitute one of the few weak points of the global system, also given the numerous stealth turns of the game, which would have deserved much more reactivity from the enemies. Sharpen your eyesight Batman: Arkham Asylum is a game full of things to do. In addition to the elements that already in themselves constitute the supporting structure, those who wish to spend more than the approximately 10 hours necessary to reach the end with our hero will have enough to retrace their steps with the additional difficulty levels and above all with the secret items scattered everywhere. The most intriguing ones are the audio recordings of the asylum patients' interviews with psychiatrists, well written and acted, or the inscriptions that tell of the birth of the asylum, which give a lot of depth to the whole setting; the funniest ones are the Riddler puzzles, which require you to explore the depths millimeter by millimeter in search of clues and particularities to unlock the cards of the different characters, with the salient characteristics, the psychological profile and the year of appearance in the series. Of course, for those only interested in the main storyline, the experience will end with the titlesqueue and with a couple of bosses, which are not quite up to the overall picture. The challenges that are unlocked by collecting clues and which consist of fighting within a certain time limit, ringing combos, ranks of opponents in some of the game's settings, or in achieving a series of very specific objectives still remain. Above all, comparing yourself to friends' online scores, this part of the game can be fun, but the substance of the game is clearly anchored in the experience given by the main story. Xbox 360 goals Batman: Arkham Asylum is a rather generous game in terms of objectives, given that finishing it on the normal difficulty level, and solving a few puzzles, or looking for some of the hidden elements, naturally leads to about 600 of the 1000 points available. For the rest, challenges are needed, collecting all the hidden objects and finishing the game on the highest difficulty level, but it's not a prohibitive undertaking. Surely it will be pleasant for fans of the bat man. What a cool Batman Batman Arkham Asylum was built around the Unreal Engine 3, and while this is evident after the first few steps, this is certainly one of the times that the engine has been put to better use outside of Epic's offices. Among other things, while maintaining the detail and quality that are now widely recognized in the engine, here the breadth of the maps that often develop vertically, giving a breath to the images that is sometimes lacking, benefits the overall scenographic rendering in similar games. The study of the lights and the good level design do the rest, for a game that doesn't miss anything in any respect, if it weren't for some somewhat stiff animations, especially that of the bat man's run, which could have been more harmonious. Even the audio sector is confirmed at the level of the rest of the production, with inspired and always in tune music.", "date": "2009-09-03", "grade": "9.0"}
