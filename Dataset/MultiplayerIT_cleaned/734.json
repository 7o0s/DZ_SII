{"name": "Project Gotham Racing 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-gotham-racing-3-recensione.html", "text": "No revolutions for a widely tested game mechanic, based on the Kudos and highly spectacular driving sections, but, despite this, the innovations introduced in Project Gotham Racing 3 are certainly not few. Let's start, as always, from the career mode, structured in a different, precisely no longer with a division into classes of the various races, but with a series of mini-tournaments with missions and opponents, which will adapt to each car chosen to compete in them. In practice we will find a series of events with an ever-changing number of races, from two upwards, with different types of objectives, and with opponents equipped with cars of the same class as the one we will choose from our garage, without limitations of classes or models of 'car. With the money available, any car is immediately available. Needless to deny it, among the titles of the initial line up it was one of the most awaited, one of those whose task is to bring users who are still having fun with Xbox and PlayStation 2 to the first next generation console All this as long as you select the medium level of play, at lower or higher levels we could find opponents with cars of different classes, but above all with very different driving characteristics. Speaking of the difficulty levels, which are always five, it is easy to see how the values of the opponents have been adjusted based on their skill. Now the medium-level challenge has been made more complicated than in the past, but this gap widens more as the difficulty increases, to reach the maximum level where only the real PGR experts will have a say. As for the career mode itself, it must be said that it is shorter than that of PGR2, but on the other hand the challenges have become more engaging. There are also new racing modes, a particularly apt one is called Time against Kudos, in which we will have a time limit to complete the track, but the possibility of blocking the passage of seconds through sporty driving evolutions. Compared to PGR 2, among other things, a difference has been introduced between the online and offline career. The first, in fact, takes into account the ranking of the opponents faced and allows you to earn more or less points depending on the skill of the opponents defeated in the race. This trick, for sure, will serve to make the online experience much more balanced and engaging. Obviously, in addition to the career mode there are also the numerous single race options, sections to improve one's ghosts, modes in which the last car on the track is progressively eliminated at each lap or ad hoc races to conquer the greatest number of kudos. Among the changes introduced, the first that is noticeable during the race is the renewed management of the driving model. In addition to making the difference in controlling cars of different types, and especially the different classes, more evident, there is now a more marked influence of the weight of the vehicle, which is felt above all during braking at the limit, and a implementation of improved physics, a factor that comes to light when setting up and exiting corners. The new driving model is a little more complicated to master and in the first few races it will be really useful to start with the more tameable car models. PGR3 always remains oriented towards arcade driving, so the damage that will appear on the bodywork will only be aesthetic and will not affect performance, but thanks to the new engine, you will find yourself repeatedly rotating the camera to admire them in every detail. Back to the Kudos, as mentioned, points to be earned during the races, through a sporty driving full of drifts, passages on two wheels, oversteers, overtaking and so on and so forth. Among the innovations on the circuits, the Tracks editor is worthy of note. In practice, we will be able to create personalized combinations by choosing, via an intuitive graphical interface, the route to be taken within all the streets faithfully mapped by the Bizarre Creations, for each city included in the game. In this regard, we recall that there are five basic cities and circuits: Las Vegas, Tokyo, London, the Nurburgring, New York and a private test track. In the future, new content downloads for different cities will certainly be possible, just as happened in PGR 2. We also remind you that downloading content is also accessible to users with an Xbox Live Silver subscription, obviously only for those that will be free updates. Garage If life begins at 170 miles per hour, as the PGR 3 tagline goes, the vehicles just had to adjust. In fact, in Project Gotham Racing 3 we will only find supercars, to be chosen from over 70 models available from the start. Goodbye to sfide with minis, or races dedicated to SUVs, only extremely sporty cars that can reach and exceed 270 km/h. If now a Viper can be considered an entry level model, and cars that in PGR 2 were considered Top cars to be unlocked such as the Tvr Cerbera 12 Speed, belong to the mid-range, you can have an idea of which racing cars are found during the game. As already mentioned, in career mode we will be able to decide at will what type of vehicle to use from our garage, and it is precisely in particular sections like this that the care in the development of the third PGR can be seen. Our garage can be visited in a virtual mode, perfectly recreated in 3D with the use of the original graphics engine. We will therefore see super detailed models, reflections in real time, dynamic lighting and even the introduction of HDR even during the visit of the garage, as it is possible to notice simply by looking at the windows from where the sunlight filters, and then moving shot in darker areas, with the consequent effect of ~adaptation~ of the pupil to the different light conditions. The care taken in the reconstruction of all the car models and the power of the graphics engine come out in what is one of the new features introduced, the internal view from the passenger compartment. To all this is added the movement of the camera which moves according to the stresses undergone by the vehicle, lowering or rising slightly during violent braking or acceleration, moving in curves and so on. Garage This addition not only represents a step to improve the rendering of the graphics on the screen, but above all the sensation of realism experienced while driving, thanks to the particular graphic effects or reflections that are modified with respect to the external views by the presence of the windshield, which gets dirty progressively spectacular. To all this is added the movement of the camera, placed practically above the driver's head, which moves according to the stresses undergone by the vehicle, lowering or rising slightly during violent braking or acceleration, moving in curves and so on. Final touch of class, the rendering of the noises of our engine as well as of all the other effects of the game which is also modified based on the acoustic insulation of the driven vehicle. Photo Mode In Project Gotham Racing 3 the Photomode enters, or the possibility of improvising professional photographers, and saving images from different angles, including the free cam, during replays. An interesting feature is the vastness of camera-style options available for post-processing effects on images. You can change the lens aperture, zoom, shutter speed, add special filters and so on. The photos that can only be viewed within the game for now, according to interviews carried out by the Bizarre team, should also be able to be managed outside of PGR 3 and exported to your PC. View Next Generation Honorable mention to all Bizarre programmers for the creation of the new graphics engine. Project Gotham Racing 3, played in high resolution on an HDTV screen, immediately shows what a next-gen console is capable of. The whole engine was written from scratch and from the first contact with the game you notice a different setting than in the past, in order to increase the graphic realism. The result is excellent, PGR3 is undoubtedly one of the launch titles that most emphasize the graphic leap between this and the previous generation of consoles. Starting from the vehicle models, more detailed than ever, to arrive at the inclusion of strictly 3D, animated and diversified audiences that surround the edge of the track within each circuit. In between these two extremes there are upgrades and improvements compared to the past in all sectors, among which the rendering of high-resolution textures and lighting effects created with HDR or High Dynamic Range stand out, to better reproduce the variations and the intensity of illumination within the various circuits. Needless to specify the care put into the meticulous reproduction of the tracks, highlighted in particular for the reproduction of Las Vegas or the Shinjuku district in Tokyo. The frame rate during the game is always above 30 frames per second, and the sensation of speed has been improved compared to PGR 2, also thanks to the inclusion of particular motion blur effects during quick changes of shot and in other certain situations . The construction of the night tracks has also been improved, which finally have adequate lighting for the city tracks. Some of the glimpses of the tracks, such as the passage on the Brooklyn Bridge in the city of New York, here are the following onesdefinitely the beginning of a new graphic detail in digital racing games. PGR3 is undoubtedly one of the launch titles that most emphasize the graphic leap between this and the previous generation of consoles View Next Generation Next Generation SoundOne of the most marked differences from the past lies in the creation of audio and sound effects in the game. In PGR 3 there is a clear leap in the quality of the sound effects, the implementation of Dolby Digital 5.1 for the realization of the environmental effects, but in particular you can listen to reproductions of the engines that truly live up to the potential of the Xbox 360. Almost obvious describe the enormous quantity and variety of audio tracks available in the soundtrack, not to mention the possibility of always using your own customized soundtracks via Hard Disk or direct streaming from USB peripherals or PC via ethernet. Final comment Project Gotham Racing 3 is one of the titles developed at the launch of the Xbox 360 to push a player to the generational change, and the final result is undoubtedly of great impact. Above all through the use of an HDTV TV set, the Bizarre Creations title manages to give life to an unprecedented visual experience for a racing title. The only real comment that can be moved to the development team essentially concerns the duration of the career mode, shorter than in the past, a factor also due to the number of cities available and the amount of detail with which they have been recreated. In all other respects, Project Gotham Racing 3 offers improvements in all possible areas: from the driving model, to the artificial intelligence of the opponents, to Xbox Live support, to the addition of new features such as Gotham TV or Photomode, arriving to the technical aspects for graphics and sound that are totally on another level compared to the chapters released on Xbox. Good first for the new Gotham and excellent conditions for the future of the series, which marks the birth of Xbox 360 with a paw. Pros Excellent technical realization Tested and further improved gameplay Gotham TV Well-kept sound compartment Cons The length of the career mode About 70 car models Online and Gotham TV If Project Gotham Racing 2 had been taken as a model for the evolution of Microsoft's online services and the first step towards the completeness of Halo 2, this chapter is certainly no less. Maximum support for online modes also in PGR 3, matchmaking services, leaderboard with the addition of a real novelty for the genre, Gotham TV. Through this mode it is possible to have access to a series of virtual television channels, in which it is possible to observe the progress of other users' online races from different cameras. There is the channel dedicated to our friends, where the sessions held at that particular moment by all the Gamertags present in the friends list will be listed, or the channel dedicated to the Aces, i.e. the Top Players of the PGR 3 rankings with events reported live with real-time messages and alerts. At the time of writing this article, the service had just started, with practically only journalists and their debug units present on the channels. The potential of this which is the true heart of the Next Gen of the Bizarre title are still only guessable, therefore, but it is clear that this chapter also marks a step in the evolution of the Microsoft project, which will lead to the creation of real official championships , complete with prizes and titles up for grabs, with the possibility of watching the professionals compete in the last corner in unmissable races. Bizarre Creations makes the trio and, after having accompanied the debut of Xbox with the first Gotham, this December will also be present with the new chapter of the saga at the launch of the second Microsoft-branded console, Xbox 360. Needless to deny it, among the titles in the line up initial was one of the most awaited, one of those who have the task of bringing to the first next generation console users who are still having fun with Xbox and PlayStation 2. An arduous task, tackled with an unprecedented graphics sector and with the umpteenth step forward in the Xbox Live project, the Gotham TV.", "date": "2005-11-26", "grade": null}
