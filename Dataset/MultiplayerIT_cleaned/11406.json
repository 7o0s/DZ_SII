{"name": "Death Jr.: Root of Evil - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/death-jr-root-of-evil-recensione.html", "text": "Debuting with a platformer on a Nintendo console has never been an easy task, given the cumbersome presence of a certain Mr. Mario; however, Backbone Entertainment didn't let itself be discouraged, and decided to bring the second chapter of the Death Jr. saga born on the PSP to the Wii. Now let's see if improved graphics and an up to date control system will be able to make the title make the leap in quality. Little deaths grow As in the PSP original, Death. Jr.: Root of Evil tells the story of the homonymous protagonist and his friend Pandora, committed to stopping the evil Furi, guilty of the kidnapping of Death himself and the consequent turmoil caused in the world of humans. On this front nothing has changed, not even - alas - the qualitatively questionable introductory sequence in CG, which has remained anchored to at least a couple of years old technical values. And unfortunately it cannot be said that the Backbone product makes up for it with in-game graphics, which are also quite far from today's quality standards: Death. Jr.: Root of Evil moves a not very exciting number of polygons, without compensating for this figure with a particularly captivating style or with noteworthy effects. From a cosmetic point of view, we are therefore faced with a situation of complete mediocrity, the evident daughter of the handheld origins of the title and of the not exactly commendable commitment on the part of the developers. Technical disquisitions aside, Death. Jr.: Root of Evil also in this Wii version a classic platformer is reconfirmed, with strictly linear levels full of bonuses to collect and enemies to eliminate. Death Jr. is a port without major pretensions Little deaths grow To do this, the two protagonists can count on melee attacks with a white weapon or on the use of a variety of different weapons, both of which can be upgraded during the adventure. At this juncture, Death. Jr.: Root of Evil discreetly exploits the motion sensor of the Wii Remote, allowing the user to point enemies directly on the screen and avoiding what was one of the main defects of the PSP version, i.e. an awkward control system. However, it must be said that, beyond this aspect, very little has been done to translate the player's movements into a playful form: most of the actions that our heroes perform are dictated by classic analog and digital inputs, making it clear for the umpteenth time the origins of the product. In short, Death. Jr.: Root of Evil does nothing to hide the fact that it's an unassuming port, and it doesn't take long for any user to realize that. Back to the roots Though distinctly low in terms of personality, Death. Jr.: Root of Evil is still a more than acceptable quality platformer, which should be able to be digested without too much difficulty even by those used to bread and Super Mario. Far from being a serious contender to Super Mario Galaxy, Death. Jr.: Root of Evil flows away without infamy and without praise, a condition that seems to invest the entire playful sector of Eidos production. The design of the stages is therefore anonymous but globally satisfactory, the level of difficulty is discreet but decidedly not insurmountable and the presence of bonuses and extras of various types guarantees a certain depth, in any case far lower than much more substantial productions. Death. Jr.: Root of Evil flows without infamy and without praise Not to mention that, from a strictly playful point of view, Death. Jr.: Root of Evil brings with it every single defect of the original PSP incarnation: above all, an odious, constant and useless respawn of enemies and the evident imbalance of some hooks which totally frustrates the use of the complete arsenal. Also in this case it is annoying to note how Backbone has done nothing to remedy its ~sins of youth~, but it must also be said that similar flaws do not spoil the gaming experience that much. However, the annoying sensation of being faced with a product made with a certain sufficiency remains constant, for which a few small tricks would have been enough to reach qualitatively higher peaks: an indication in this sense is also given by the exclusive cooperative mode for two players , an interesting idea on paper but which on balance translates into a decidedly confusing and unsatisfying split-screen action. Comment Death. Jr.: Root of Evil is a port from PSP. This sentence embodies the entire value of the Eidos product, which does not try, except in an extremely timid way, to go beyond the canons of its status: graphically below the standards and unable to properly exploit the opportunities offered by the new platform, the platform Backbone non is still a title to throw away, but it could have been done much better. Pros Enjoyable gameplay Improved control system Cons Technically mediocre Same flaws as PSP version Makes little use of Wii features", "date": "2008-05-22", "grade": null}
