{"name": "Doom - Recensione Live Arcade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/doom-recensione-live-arcade.html", "text": "IDKFA Doom is a bit like a black and white photograph of the Hollywood divas of the 50s, they were less flamboyant than they are now, more genuine in a certain way, but with their own specific charm. On those photos the new generations can dream imagining the myth and the cinema of the past, while those who have experienced those moments on their own skin, looking at them, will be able to go back in memory to recover their memories. In other words, Doom still manages to entertain those who played it twenty years ago and those who have never played it. Of course, some shortcomings appear evident and limiting, such as the absence of free aim on the vertical axis, but once you have entered (or re-entered) the spirit of the game, you can spend several happy hours exterminating hordes of more extravagant (up to the fearsome pink pigs!). The fun of Doom comes from hitting everything that moves on the screen, like the hordes of enemies that will treacherously appear behind you after you flip a switch. You take the pad in hand, turn off your brain and move through the labyrinthine levels in search of the way out, shooting whenever the opportunity arises. Finally moving our marine with a stick is a great relief, the controls work very well and you can only move a few notes when changing weapons which takes place sequentially by pressing the appropriate keys, and the weapons are another of the strengths of the game, so much so that some have become historic such as the mighty BFG9000 and the infamous chainsaw. IDDQD Technically the game is a perfect conversion of the original title (from memory we would say too accelerated), even if the expression in this case does not necessarily have a positive value. Those who know Doom will certainly not have problems in front of its ancient graphics, but for the younger ones it could be an obstacle having to deal with opponents made of grainy and animated bitmaps with only a few frames. The levels are also quite elementary and show low-resolution textures that repeat almost infinitely for each stage. If, despite everything, the graphics manage to have a certain retro charm, the same cannot be said of the midi soundtrack, which with its bass and electronic sounds could get boring after a short time. The game is divided into 4 episodes for a total of 36 maps that can be tackled in 5 different difficulty levels, the last of which is truly extreme. If we talked about turning off the brain before, this will have to be reconnected when you want to discover the countless secret areas that each map effectively hides. To achieve your goal you will have to keep your eyes and ears open and you will have to deal with passages that open automatically after reaching certain areas, or by examining every inch that you deem suspicious. The search for these secret passages, in addition to offering you advanced weapons before you would normally get them, is one of the elements that manages to dramatically lengthen Doom's longevity, which otherwise, despite the large number of levels, could be completed in haste and fury especially at the standard level. Online in the 90s. On the occasion of the publication of Doom on the Live Arcade the developers have included in the original game a cooperative multiplayer and deathmatch both in split and online up to a maximum of four players. Surprisingly the online game works and integrates quite well into the rest of the experience despite being an addition many years after the release of the original game. The arenas obtained from the single player levels are full of bonuses and weapons that will allow you to start battles up to the last unit of health. Unfortunately, and predictably, it is difficult to find players who are always available for a game, and this factor becomes the main obstacle to enjoying Doom on Xbox Live. Comment There are few games that stand the test of time and Doom is one of them. Sure, it's impossible to move the camera to target enemies on a different plane than ours (they're hit automatically), the levels made up of corridors and rooms repeat one after the other leaving little room for variety, and the enemy AI it only allows him to shoot at us, but despite everything moving our character on those desolate blue floors is still a fully satisfying experience, and fragging the enemies moving in droves towards us is even more so. As you may have understood Doom is undoubtedly a very elementary game compared to today's games, but often the simplest things are also the most beautiful. Ah for those wondering about the meaning of the titparagraph oils: try doing a simple google search. Pros Pad controls are perfect Many levels full of secrets All the original Doom, plus multiplayer Online Cons Technically outdated Not many people online Goals 360 Conquering the 200 points offered by the game is pretty easy. Many are obtained in single player for example by finishing the episodes also based on the level of difficulty. The others are obtained after a certain number of kills in online deathmatches. Wanting to retrace the evolution of video games in stages, there wouldn't be so many games to absolutely mention, but Doom would be part of this selective and hypothetical list. It would be part of it because it launched a genre that exploded immediately after its publication. It would be part of it because, thanks to those levels that can be explored in three dimensions, it made us lose our minds and sleep more than ten years ago. It would be part of it because we players, then little more than teenagers, moved our heads to understand what was beyond the window. Now FPS are part of a very widespread and loved genre, they have become so elaborate as to require further cataloging within the same genre, and this is how tactical FPS or those most devoted to adventure for example are born. Lately the genre is even merging with third-person games, managing to capture the best sides of each structure. So what can a simple game like Doom, available for download on Live Arcade, offer within this panorama?", "date": "2007-02-22", "grade": null}
