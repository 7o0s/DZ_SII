Made by Slovenian developer Dawn of Play, Monkey Labor is not the first game for iPhone and iPad that attempts to revive the incredible era of LCD consoles, such as Nintendo's Game & Watch or Tiger Technologies' numerous products: Great Leaping Lambrettinis is for example a fantastic title that combines the feeling and style of an old G&W with the touchscreen interface of the iPhone, while some time ago Team Meat launched a version of Super Meat Boy on iOS devices in the style of the Tiger console games, deliberately ugly and unplayable. Unlike the two applications mentioned, Monkey Labor aims instead to show the pleasure (and not the frustration) that one felt playing the old LCD consoles, exactly recreating a small Game & Watch inside the iPhone screen. My boss is a gorilla Due to the technical limitations of the consoles that preceded the advent of the Game Boy in the 80s, the game mechanics in Monkey Labor are necessarily very simple. In the role of a small robot, the player must move sideways within a factory, collecting pieces of wood and throwing them into the baker located on the other side of the room. However, everything is made much more interesting by the mischievous manager of the structure, an obnoxious gorilla who has nothing better to do than throw logs at the head of his only employee. Thus you have to move left and right avoiding the rain of obstacles, while by feeding more and more the forge it is possible to give life to a flame capable of burning the annoying monkey and increasing your score. The more points you earn, the more difficult the game becomes, with the boss moving more and more unpredictably and increasing the speed with which he throws logs. In short, an extremely simple idea and in line with some Game & Watch historians such as Fire and Manhole, but which strangely does not seem at all out of place on a device which, although avant-garde, is known for offering above all small hit and run experiences . However, where the Dawn of Play game conquers the most mature player is in the maniacal care with which the developer wanted to recreate all the small features and imperfections of the LCD consoles: the device shows the signs of old age, with a little scratched paint near the keys and a slightly peeled sticker. With a key it is possible to activate or deactivate the monotonous sounds of the game, while many will smile to realize that, by tilting the device, all the ~off~ sprites are highlighted, which light up as the player, the objects and the gorilla they move around the level. Still, you can open the battery door on the back of the console, access an old and abused instruction leaflet or even make a halo of pixels appear by tapping a finger on the LCD screen. At this point the only thing really missing is the ability to access two different game modes (Game A and Game B), a classic feature of both Tigers and Game & Watch. It is clear that the developers have focused on a single type of gameplay, but one more mode would have not only made the game more consistent with the products it is inspired by, but also more varied than it is now. In Monkey Labor the repetitiveness of game actions shouldn't be seen as a defect not foreseen by the development team, but it is always part of the clear attempt to want to replicate the experience of 80s laptops in all respects. Despite this, the lack of variety is a factor that must necessarily be taken into consideration, also because some users could probably not allow the game more than a few short games. From this point of view, that of inserting unlockable achievements through Game Center, perhaps the only element of modernization in the entire product, has proved to be an almost obligatory idea to stimulate the player to move forward, improve and find some little secrets . The same goes for the online rankings, although the absence of a local leaderboard accessible without being connected to the Internet, as well as the possibility of checking your record without necessarily returning to the main menu, is a small mole that we hope can be corrected already with the next updates of the application.
