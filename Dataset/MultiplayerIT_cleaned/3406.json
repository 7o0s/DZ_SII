A city on its knees since the terrible epidemic of Spanish flu, which has produced many victims and has been accompanied by a sudden invasion of demonic creatures who seem to wallow in this climate of pain and death. Gameplay and structure Determined to find who turned him into a vampire, the protagonist of Vampyr quickly learns to control his new abilities, which include superhuman strength, the ability to transform into mist to cover certain distances in an instant, a supernatural charm that can exert on people before sinking his teeth into their necks and great physical resistance. A repertoire that will be enriched with new maneuvers and powers as you progress through the campaign, gaining experience and unlocking a wide range of upgrades, which also include devastating special moves. The setting that the French team has given to their project is that of an action RPG with a fairly consistent degree of challenge, although at the beginning of the adventure it is possible to choose between three different levels of difficulty to enjoy a more or less challenging. Exploring the map of London, divided into independent districts in terms of delicate social balance, involves facing increasingly intense fights against monster hunters but also pathetic Skals, vampires and creatures of the night, as well as powerful and dangerous bosses. To defeat them we will have to dose the movements always keeping an eye on the stamina indicator so as not to remain defenseless, use the swerve to avoid the blows and take advantage of any stun of the opponent to bite him and thus reload the blood bar, which regulates the execution of special skills. However, there is much more besides the solidity of the fighting, in this case a role-playing substrate made up of dialogues and interactions with each of the various characters that we will find on our way, with the possibility of discovering clues that open the doors to side quests and make choices which will influence the course of the story, possibly making certain neighborhoods unstable (which will substantially increase the presence of enemies on the streets) and leading us towards one of the four possible endings for the game. This system often uses narrative devices that leave a bit dumbfounded, effectively preventing us from making a decision based on all the elements and placing us in front of an unhappy outcome even if our intentions were different, but it helps in any case to enhance replayability if you decide to try an alternative route . The very fact of balancing the challenge on the basis of the people we will decide to bite, making things easier for us if we accept to follow our basest instincts and thus become yet another threat to the city rather than a possible savior, shuffles the cards of a experience that always keeps the interest alive, involving us in the ups and downs of the protagonist and in his search for the truth. The progression system, in particular, allows you to enhance the character in various ways and to get hold of tools that go alongside the Vampire abilities, whether with edged weapons or firearms, all improveable thanks to a simple crafting system based on materials collected around. The Nintendo Switch version We have seen several sensational conversions on Nintendo Switch, however united by an inevitable constant: to bring a game designed for PC, PS4 and Xbox One to the Japanese hybrid console you have to accept a series of more or less relevant compromises. The aspects that usually end up being penalized are the resolution and the frame rate, closely followed by the quality of the textures and effects. In this case, were the developers of Saber Interactive, in charge of carrying out the porting, able to limit the damage? Let's say that the Vampyr campaign starts well and there is no doubt that the excellent atmospheres of thegame have been preserved, thanks above all to a particularly inspired soundtrack and very well interpreted English dialogues (subtitled in Italian). The problems arise as soon as the complex game structure shows its own peculiarities, identifying a possible target in each NPC and providing us with precise information also on enemies thanks to the ~blood~ vision that the protagonist can activate. By moving the view in the presence of points of interest, one realizes the effort that the graphics engine makes to keep the frame rate stable, often without success. Quite similar episodes occur during the fights, with clear jolts in the fluidity which fortunately do not compromise the enjoyment of the clashes. The big problems lie in the excessive impact of dynamic resolution on the quality of the assets, with faces that become almost unrecognizable compared to other versions of the game and evident problems in texture streaming, which we tried to remedy by substantially lowering the quality objects and animations that are at a certain distance from the character; but above all in sudden loads that block the game for a few seconds without caring what is happening at that moment, perhaps because you are moving from one area of the map to another in the middle of a fight. Surprisingly, in the portable version the situation improves clearly: the small size of the screen masks any exaggerations of the scaler, but it is more the greater stability of the frame rate that is striking, giving us a globally better experience although also characterized in this case by the plague of unexpected loading.", "date": "2019-10-28", "grade": "7.5"}
