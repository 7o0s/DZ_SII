The ~quotationism~ and the restoration of forms belonging to the past are so widespread as to have made remake, reboot and remaster operations normal, but also the same graphic style adopted by completely new productions, in the video game field is often a reference to the Arcadian eras of 8 and 16-bit. There is no doubt that this partially conceals a certain crisis of ideas, but from a stylistic point of view solutions of this type can also open the way to completely new artistic expressions, therefore easy generalizations should not be made. A product like Evoland 2, which we have already reviewed in the PC version and are now examining it on mobile platforms, is instead based entirely on quotations and references to the common past of videogame popular culture. He obviously does so with an ironic tone and the starting idea itself has the connotations of a great joke, even if its size, the care taken in the realization and the quantity of contents that characterize it make it clear that it is a project to be taken seriously serious. Compared to the first chapter, Evoland 2 expands the original concept in every direction, expanding the adventure both from the point of view of the graphic styles adopted and as regards the game mechanics themselves, now made up of references to many genres, even very disparate ones. As a starting point and building block there is an adventure in the style of Zelda, which sees the usual forgetful and nameless hero mysteriously wake up in an unfamiliar village and from there start a great epic to save the world in the company of adventurers to be found along the way, but from there start digressions in several different directions. A video game about video games The crazy idea behind Evoland 2 is to bring together genres that have very little in common, simply uniting them with the general idea of retracing some of the historical stages of videogame evolution. The story confronts us with temporal and dimensional leaps, in such a way as to use different graphic styles to demonstrate the different chronological location of events: ranging from simple and stylized black and white figures of the old Game Boy to an advanced three-dimensional construction in more advanced historical periods, but not only. Each section of Kuro's adventure (which also appears quite long, close to 15-20 hours) offers digressions into various videogame genres, making Evoland 2 seem essentially a sort of videogame about videogames or a general homage to their history. We therefore find ourselves moving from the Japanese-style action RPG, which remains the connective tissue of the whole game, to various mini-experiences in various areas such as shooters, puzzles, Bomberman, endless runners, 2D fighting games and even rhythm games in one a hodgepodge of suggestions which is obviously full of winks to other famous titles and to videogame culture in general. It is obvious that none of the individual diversified game experiences can enjoy great depth, since they are all just mentioned, but the certain degree of organicity with which such different mechanics have been implemented is still remarkable, for example by keeping intact the characterization of the different characters and their specific abilities within different genres. From an aesthetic point of view, the work done by Shiro Games is impressive, ranging from excellent pixel art graphics to a convincing 3D representation and still maintaining a cohesive and visible style beneath the obvious derivative influences that the team wanted make manifest in his continuous references to the classic titles. Furthermore, the 2D animated cutscenes that tell the salient phases of the story are very pleasant. The biggest problem with this version of Evoland 2 is that typical of games on mobile platforms: the controls are improved compared to the first chapter but remain far from perfect, with the virtual commands on the touch screen remaining an unsatisfactory solution and making it almost obligatory the use of alternate controllers to deal with the many hours of gameplay required to reach the conclusion.", "date": "2018-03-12", "grade": "7.5"}
