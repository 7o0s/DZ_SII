{"name": "Gwent", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gwent-recensione.html", "text": "If you've played The Witcher III: Wild Hunt properly, and you haven't limited yourself to the main quest, you should know that one of the funniest pastimes was Gwent, a card game to challenge all the main characters in the plot. Conceived by the author Andrzej Sapkowski and translated into bits by CD Project, Gwent has known such popularity as to deserve a real title that has just come out of beta and has therefore become available, free of charge, for PC users, while couch gamers will have to wait a couple more months. We remind you that the very recent Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales (at this address Pierpaolo's review) is the paid single-player campaign of the present Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, which instead is free and provides only online mode. How to play Gwent? As often happens, explaining a card game is easier said than done. After creating your own alter-ego you have to choose a faction among the five available: Northern Kingdoms, Monsters, Scoia'Tael, Skellige and Nilfgaard. Each race has unique cards and a series of heroes with unique characteristics that can be used in a very limited way during the match. The deck must be made up of a minimum of 25 cards, paying particular attention to the fact that each one has a maintenance cost and the available ~basket~ cannot be exceeded. At the beginning of the game only ten are drawn, with the possibility of exchanging some unwanted ones with the others left in the deck. Extremely simplified, we could conceptually divide the cards into two macro-categories: monsters and magic. The former (which in most cases have special abilities or effects) have an attack value; the latter serve to modify it. The goal is to complete the round with this value, obtained by adding that of the individual cards, higher than that of the opponent. During each round, only one card can be placed: those that are left in hand are then kept for the following rounds, while those used are sent to the graveyard. In fact, Gwent is played to the best of three sets: at the end of the first and second each player supplies himself with only three cards at a time. It is a far from trivial mechanism because one could be led to voluntarily lose a round to have more cards than the opponent in the following ones, and consequently more chances for victory. On one's side of the table, troops can be placed in two lines (originally there were three): a choice that is not obvious because some skills can only be activated in a certain area. The prices Before starting, we need to complete a short tutorial that briefly explains the dynamics of the matches, after which we are ready to descend into the world of competitive multiplayer, where we find two modes: the standard one, where you can take part in training or classified duels, and the Arena, which differs because players have to create a deck starting from random decks which, however, can contain cards from all five factions. We have to admit that our first ranked matches were extremely frustrating, because Gwent's matchmaking, which was supposed to take experience level into account, made some big blunders, so that the first few (level 2) beatings were inflicted by opponents level 9 or even 11, with the very simple consequence that at the end of the third round we had already hoisted the white flag. However, it was an anomalous behavior that was not repeated except on a couple of other occasions. However, as it should be, a good dose of patience is needed to level up, or it can be solved with a credit card, because cash can speed up the process of acquiring rare and powerful cards. Alternatively, gems can be conquered, which can then be spent on the purchase of barrels which are the equivalent of Duel Links or Magic card packs, by completing the missions that the game offers, which involve winning a certain number of duels with a certain faction, or to use a specific card. Each barrel contains 5 cards, the last of which, rarer, can be chosen directly by the player from a selection of three. In addition to the coins, the winner of the game can also be rewarded with ~pieces~ of cards to be assembled or the so-called meteorite powder which allows the existing cards to be transformed into ~premium~ versions, adding special animations or graphic effects. Obviously one of the most important stimuli that drives us to continue is the acquisition of ever more powerful cards that allows usThey try to take the challengers in the face and consequently to climb the online rankings. Unlike other titles, in Gwent the level reached by victories is not downgraded, at least up to a certain level, beyond which it is no longer possible to go down. The rankings are monthly and special events can be added to these as already happens in other similar games. Excellent technical realization Technically Gwent is really excellent: not only are the cards ~alive~, with spectacular movements that evoke moments of battle, but also the game table is full of refinements, such as the animations of the heroes who seem to lead their men to assault ; all ~details~ (it is simplistic to call them that) that place it at a level decidedly out of reach of the most titled competitors, above all Hearthstone or The Elder Scrolls: Legends. Obviously, as almost always happens in this genre of games, in the long run the graphic marvels take a back seat and the player's attention is catalyzed exclusively by the strategic part; however these cosmetic expedients also serve to arouse curiosity about the effects, not only numerical, of the new cards. Gwent is currently only available on the GOG platform (owned by the developer), while the PS4 and Xbox One versions will be released in December: there will be the possibility of cross-play between PC and the two consoles, while sofa players will not be able to give place at the console war.", "date": "2018-10-28", "grade": "7.8"}
