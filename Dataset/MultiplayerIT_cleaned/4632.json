The Dark Lord is gathering a huge army and soon his strength will be unstoppable: how can we fight him? Creating an army too, thanks to the persuasive power of the New Ring forged by our elven half, and conquering the fortresses to defend the various regions that make up the enormous map of Shadow of War, in what looks like the most exciting and innovative element of this sequel. Not the only one, of course: the work done by Monolith Production for the new chapter in the series, based on the solid foundations of the debut title, takes the whole experience towards new levels of involvement, richness and even variety, further emphasizing the more convincing than the game and substantially improving its cosmetics, which this time does not have to submit to the limits of cross-gen planning and can therefore give free rein to one's ambitions. Fast start Middle-earth: Shadow of War does not get lost in too much talk during the early stages, also because there are so many things to do, listed in a special menu that divides the missions according to the ~client~. If you haven't played with the first episode, however, never mind: the mechanics once again draw heavily on Batman: Arkham (and Assassin's Creed, albeit to a lesser extent), sharing most of the controls and philosophy with the Rocksteady productions Basic. Without wanting to reveal too much of the broad narrative sector accompanying the experience, once again enhanced by an excellent dubbing in Italian that does not skimp on names of a certain caliber, we can say that during the initial phase of the adventure we will find ourselves defending the doors of Minas Ithil, besieged by orcs at the behest of Sauron, determined to take possession of the mighty Palantir. Once that part is completed, the structure of Middle-earth: Shadow of War will literally open before our eyes, allowing us to travel between various regions (including Cirith Ungol, Gorgoroth, Seregost, Nurnen) to complete missions related to mysterious entities like Shalob and Carnan, the latter dealing with the awakening of a very powerful Balrog, as well as the lethal assassin Eltariel, constantly looking for a way to eliminate the Nazgul. To this will be added many parallel missions, some of which are able to show in an almost perfect way the evolution of the Nemesis system and its many, even unexpected facets, as well as an enormous amount of secondary objectives between challenges to the captains (all, as al usually, characterized in a unique way and introduced by a few seconds of dialogue, to rattle off even in the middle of a furious battle), online feuds, revenge missions (did an ogre kill our friend? Can we make him pay) and, above all, the part dedicated to sieges. The world is mmm As mentioned, in Middle-earth: Shadow of War our goal is to create an army to oppose that of Sauron. How? To bring the strongest orcs to our side we will have to defeat them in a duel and dominate them thanks to the power of Celebrimbor's New Ring: at that point we will be able to ask them to fight alongside us, send them to rest (or drive them away, if we don't like them...) , assign him a specific task when attacking fortresses or extra tasks that can go from eliminating a target to infiltrating, things that Shadow of Mordor players surely remember well. Arrived to the point, we will launch a prodigious attack on the enemy bases, which are also characterized in a unique way both in terms of the architectural aspect and the internal organization and the general ecosystem, determined randomly according to the tribes and the implications of the Nemesis system between betrayals, promotions and sudden reversals in the face. To conquer the forts we will have to scale the walls, paying attention to the numerous defenses placed on the towers, and then free a series of areas from the presence of groups of captains, until the final confrontation with the regent. It will happen more or less at 40% of the complete completion of the game, after dozens of hours and a completely gutted skill tree, to come across fortresses that are too powerful to be conquered, which will inevitably imply a grinding path not so much for Talion and his specific abilities, as for the roster of his followers, which will have to be nurtured and of a good standard in order to ensure the necessary support for the invasion. A conquered forthowever, it will not last forever: we will have to manage its commanders and defenses because there will be siege attempts by other users, from the perspective of a prospect that certainly appears exciting. A varied adventure? When, during the first hours of the game, the scenario map in which we were literally filled with missions and objectives, we naturally asked ourselves the question of variety, which has always been the Achilles' heel of Assassin's Creed-style sandbox experiences. Well, there is no doubt that many of the quests are completed for the pure pleasure of doing it, in an almost mechanical way, given that they offer an extremely similar structure and dynamics, mostly based on direct confrontation with the orcs; however there are variations on the theme, especially in terms of narrative-based missions: we will find ourselves carrying out silent infiltrations, facing the very dangerous Nazgul, fighting a Balrog on the back of a gigantic wooden creature, riding a dragon (sorry, a drake) and, in general, to subjugate beasts of various orders and sizes (mainly caragor and graug) to take us around the scenario, making our offensive more effective and diversified. Also as regards the secondary objectives, those more similar to each other, there will be the possibility of using different approaches to change the cards on the table: poisoning the barrels from which the orcs drink, subjecting archers to attack our command, hit the targets from a distance and maybe blow them up together with the flammable barrels, in a fiery hell that is as spectacular as it is devastating for those who fall victim to it. Progressing through the campaign, the development of Talion and her elven half's abilities, together with the RPG element that characterizes inventory management, with common, rare, legendary or epic weapons and armor (as well as packs that can be purchased with real money for those who wish to have more in less time, an aspect now constant in triple A productions), will also lead to an increase in gameplay variety: silent kills can be more cruel and violent, prompting enemies in the area to flee in terror, while shots from a distance will add to the traditional arrows the possibility of projecting the figure of Celebrimbor directly close to the target. Playstation 4 trophies Middle-earth: Shadow of War includes a total of fifty-three Trophies, many of which are obtained by exploring the many facets of the experience: finding all Gondorian artifacts, unlocking all character abilities, purifying all haedir in various maps, rescuing a captured follower, and so on. Only some Trophies are tied to the completion of narrative-based missions. Nice to see In short, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a huge, multifaceted game with many noteworthy structural innovations (including the possibility of importing your nemeses and your followers from the campaign of the first chapter, provided you have played it on same platform) and once again a solid and engaging narrative, capable of making the most of the rich ~lore~ created by J.R.R. Tolkien, its fascinating settings and the time space between the events of The Hobbit and those of The Lord of the Rings. Have the same steps forward been made on the technical front? Yes, absolutely. As mentioned, the new Monolith Productions project has been designed specifically for current gaming platforms, therefore without having to sacrifice anything on the altar of a cross-platform setting, and this is clear not only from the substantial increase in the maps that can be visited, all particularly cared for and endowed with their own personality, especially in the central areas, but also by the quality of the assets. The polygonal complexity of the characters and buildings has undergone a rather evident boost, we have tried to limit the flatness of the surfaces as much as possible by working on the lights and effects, as well as making the most of what the most recent revisions of PlayStation 4 (and invariably Xbox One) have to offer, with two display modes that favor resolution or general quality. As far as the animations are concerned, Talion's run sometimes creates some perplexities in terms of the relationship between movement and space traveled, especially with the ~elven dash~ activated, but the many battle choreographies are truly splendid, especially those that emphasize the double nature of the protagonist. The graphic engine, now well tested, does not suffer from frame rate drops (at least on PlayStation 4 Pro) but in certain cases there are small pop-up effects as regards thesettings and some glitches that we don't doubt will be fixed with the next updates. The support for HDR offers memorable glimpses, enhancing a day / night system that is not incredibly sophisticated but certainly functional, as well as the vastness of landscapes that you will certainly find evocative, even more so if you care about Tolkien's literature and his film reductions. The sound, as mentioned, characterized by an excellent dubbing in Italian (too bad for some unbalanced levels in some situations - yet it would be enough to produce reprises with a volume equal to those of the original voices to make no mistake), boasts epic-style music, perfectly fitting, and a good set of effects.
