The reality is that So Many Me measures you, right from the start. Some of you may be fans of titles like Super Meat Boy, others loved the latest Donkey Kong Country on Wii U, still others have had epic experiences with Rastan or the old arcade platformers. In any case, even though they are all very different titles, they have one element in common: the millimeter precision that the player must have and in So Many Me this is only one of the key elements, but we can assure you that it will be the first with the which one to count. Although from a graphic point of view there are some points in common with Badland - although the latter has proved to be much more refined - the assonances can only be summarized in a vague aesthetic proximity of the protagonists, in addition to the multitude of ~brothers~ who follow the pack leader. In So Many Me you never get bored, you always need to stay on the move and with your brain on Xbox One goals There are 21 objectives, for a total of 1000 points, well blended between history and pad skills in hand, as well as secondary paths and challenges. In short, a challenge that is not impossible but which will require you to have an extensive understanding of the title. Hold on to a Thread We explain how the mechanics work, so that you have clear basic ideas to be able to move around the game world. It starts with Filo, the protagonist, who roams in a colorful and essential world, driven by the well-known Unity graphics engine. The setting seems to have been designed with the simplicity and stroke of a child, therefore soft and well-defined lines, with clouds crossed by a rainbow, immersed in a florid nature from which platforms that look like the ruins of ancient temples emerge. After the first steps we get to know Asimov, the forgotten spirit of the world, and after an amusing exchange with Filo our real adventure begins. What is essential to remember, but is explained to us very soon, is the presence of other clones who will follow us on our journey. These are found in certain points of the game, immersed in a sort of blob: once touched, they will join us and will always follow us. Although they are identical to the protagonist from an aesthetic point of view, this repetitiveness can still be overcome with a certain choice of alternative faces: they are placed in some secondary paths which, once undertaken, will allow to arrive in the presence of these ~masks~ for our twins. Once we have taken a leap, just press the ~X~ key on the pad to make Filo transform into a rocky cube, suspended in mid-air or in the point where it is at that given moment. His clone, which will repeat the same movements, will quickly cling to it: this allows you to overcome dangerous areas, such as sharp traps, or to reach otherwise inaccessible areas that we will be forced to follow to access vital areas in order to continue in the story . Even the first level proves to be perhaps not difficult, but still challenging and one must always calibrate the momentum well and wait for the transformation at the right moment. Things get complicated when more clones are added and a series of chained actions will be required. A long road The road to the end credits is long and in fact you will have to solve several intricate situations in order to unlock a certain access, which perhaps is found after a chasm that opens into the void, so you will realize that you cannot succeed, you will change your strategy and you'll start all over again. In the general mix, expertly blended, you will also find self-propelled platforms, the classic levers and a fundamental teleportation. In fact, each chapter is characterized by some key elements to find, with an almost always unpublished formula and a set of irresistible puzzles that will force you to rack your brains. There will be bizarre creatures to get to know and exploit - for example one of these is a kind of dragon, which is actually called Jellosaur - which are made up by drawing, only in certain points of the game, the shape of the creatures themselves. These will allow us to cross areas that would otherwise be denied us thanks to the abilities of the summoned creature. In short, there is a lot of variety, enough to keep you glued to the screen from the beginning to the end of the adventure. A non-trivial result for a puzzle platform, a genre that often ends in boredom and repetitiveness.", "date": "2015-07-23", "grade": "8.5"}
