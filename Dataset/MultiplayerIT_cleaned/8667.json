On PC, the queen platform of this genre of video games, the title of Kunos Simulazioni offers numerous customization options for sim racing lovers, as well as a respectable technical sector. Due to major hardware limitations, the game could not excel equally even on older generation hardware. By now, however, we need to look to the future, because despite the low availability of next-gen consoles, Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X | S have now been out for more than a year. The power guaranteed by these new machines has allowed Kunos Simulazioni to fill the gap with the PC version of Assetto Corsa Competizione, giving new life to the simulation video game. As icing on the cake, the update to this new and improved version has been made available for free to existing owners of the game. All we had to do was dust off the steering wheel, position the pedals and take to the track aboard the GT3 cars in the numerous tracks featured in the video game. In this review of Assetto Corsa Competizione we will therefore try to tell you what the true potential of the game is, now that it has finally found hardware that is up to it to express itself at its best even in the world of consoles. Tracks, cars and modes A sunset of Assetto Corsa Competizione By purchasing Assetto Corsa Competizione for the first time on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, you will not find any particular news in terms of content. The simulation video game stands out with its 11 classic tracks, painstakingly created by the developers and 25 cars from the GT3 category. Additional content released in the years following the game's original launch will need to be purchased separately. A real pity that they have not been added in a sort of ~Deluxe~ version, taking advantage of the transition to the new generation consoles, justified only by a reduced cost of the cover price. However, the developers have still introduced some small innovations, such as a new car, in particular the much-loved BMW M4 GT3. The latest 2021 liveries are also present, to give a breath of fresh air to the now dated original content. By taking advantage of the frequent discounts on the respective digital stores, you will be able to take the remaining DLCs home without excessive expenses, to enjoy all the excellent contents created by Kunos Simulazioni. By purchasing all the components you will have access to the following GT3 and GT4 competitions: GT World Challenge (2018, 2019 and 2020), Intercontinental GT Challenge, GT4 European Series and British GT Championship. We will not go into further details on what you will find inside the game , as we talked about it extensively both at the release of the PC version of Assetto Corsa Competizione, and later in the review of Assetto Corsa Competizione for old generation consoles. Just know that the title offers various game modes, suitable both for those who want a lighter experience, up to the most competitive and severe challenges for sim racing purists. Also in terms of customization options, such as the level of difficulty, driving aids or other options, the title guarantees good accessibility to anyone. Same content, but with something extra The sunset on the track in Assetto Corsa Competizione for Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X|S One of the main weaknesses of the Playstation 4 and Xbox One version was the lack of support for 60 frames per second. Anyone who has traveled a few kilometers on video games belonging to this genre knows perfectly well how important fluidity is in similar titles. While in the eSports panorama in the sim racing sector the focus is on 360 FPS, remaining nailed to the classic 30 was simply unacceptable. Sure, more casual gamers might as well overlook a similar element. Too bad that the title was not dedicated to them at all (also due to a lack of optimization of driving with the controller), so this past choice still remains unjustified. But again we'll stop looking back and take a look at what we can find on Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Assetto Corsa Competizione in its next-gen version maintains 60 frames per second, without sacrificing 4K resolution (the Xbox Series S version remains on Full HD resolution). An important result for the most competitive players, who will finally be able to enjoy the right experience with this racing title. It goes without saying that the visual rendering and the fluidity in the gameplay has benefitedor a noticeable improvement. The tracks, the dynamic weather, the day/night cycle enjoy an important technical leap and the overall performance for a simulation game is really excellent. Don't expect the details and ~car porn~ present in Gran Turismo 7 or Forza Motorsport. In Assetto Corsa Competizione the technical sector has always taken second place to the driving model, the physics engine and the naked simulation. We are not complaining about this decision at all, because the technical result achieved is still to be rewarded. Racing at night at the 24 hours of SPA, with the dynamic weather and track performance going down parallel to the sun disappearing over the horizon, is an experience that few titles can offer. Suzuka under the rain on Assetto Corsa Competizione for Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X|S According to the drivers who compete in the real championships, the physical engine manages to simulate the behavior of the cars on the asphalt very well. Compared to the PC counterpart, the developers have ensured that the same level of simulation has been maintained on consoles as well. This remains once again the real strong point of the video game for its level of realism and complexity, which also gives a lot of satisfaction once you become good at driving with a fast and constant pace. The experience lived through the whole video game was then further improved, thanks to fast loading, guaranteed by the powerful SSDs installed in the new generation consoles. However, there is a small technical compromise to which the developers had to submit: the absence of Ray Tracing. This technology failed to make its debut even on the new generation consoles, preferring to guarantee greater fluidity and resolution. Lots of improvements with some shortcomings Night race on Assetto Corsa Competizione for Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X|S The technical improvements and some small refreshes to the contents were not enough for Kunos Simulazioni for this next-gen version of Assetto Corsa Competizione. An important role of the simulation experience has always been covered by the multiplayer component. Now on Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X|S you will be able to compete with up to a maximum of 30 players in each online competition. In addition, the developers have introduced the ability to create private lobbies. However, the option that allows us to compete with players from other platforms is missing, even if cross-play should arrive in the next updates. To the delight of many players, the possibility of changing the FOV of the various cameras to set it according to your preferences now also arrives on consoles. The level of customization in general aims to reach that present on the PC, even if the consoles still struggle to offer the same experience. The deadzone control of the pedals has not yet been implemented, as well as other innovations present in the latest PC version. The developers have stated that they are working to catch up with all versions of their jewel. For example, VR support could also arrive in the future, starting with the new Playstation 5 device. It's really a shame instead not to have the possibility to exploit 120 FPS, perhaps at a lower resolution, to obtain an even more fluid experience for the most demanding players. The famous Eau Rouge on Assetto Corsa Competizione for Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X|S There's no denying it: Assetto Corsa Competizione gives its best with a steering wheel and pedals. You don't need to spend millions for a professional driving setup, in fact, even with an entry level device the difference compared to the controller is abysmal. However, Kunos Simulazioni has also worked for those who cannot use a steering wheel. The controller is now more precise and in general adapts better, through some facilitations, to the driving model of the video game. It will therefore be easier to grip the pad and get on the track, but at the same time it will take a lot of practice to achieve the best performance. With the Playstation 5 Dualsense the level of immersion has been further expanded, thanks to the haptic feedback of the Sony controller. Even the left trigger in the braking phase offers excellent feedback to manage the pressure on the brake pedal well.", "date": "2022-02-26", "grade": "8.7"}
