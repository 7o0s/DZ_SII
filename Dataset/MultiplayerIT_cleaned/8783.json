Already the very first Donkey Kong, ancestor of all modern platform games, brought with it a certain Puzzle Game mentality, and if then the ~godson~ Super Mario Bros. configured the platform game as we know it now, the puzzle vein does not it has certainly run out, with titles such as the historic Bubble Bobble which, also thanks to the hardware limits, in addition to acting also forced us to think a little. Then we gradually moved on to works such as The Lost Vikings of the future Blizzard, up to the more recent Mario Vs. Donkey Kong which resumed the puzzle soul of Miyamoto's first Masterpiece, but it was only in 2007 that Zoe Mode, a little-known English software house , made the first attempt to combine the Puzzle with the new version of the Platform, the one in 3D. The result was the good Crush for PSP, and what we are about to deal with is the almost slavish re-proposition for the Nintendo 3D portable. Great Jupiter! The only difference, however quite striking, of Crush 3D compared to the original lies in the narrative premise, in the development of the plot itself and in the atmosphere in general. While on PSP we witnessed a story that had ~mature~ ambitions, as was the custom at the time even for a cooking simulation, and surreal tones that recalled certain Tim Burton-esque atmospheres, in this new Nintendian iteration the same psychiatry themes are dealt with in much lighter and humorous way, without losing a dreamlike connotation that remains functional to the gameplay. This time the protagonist, Danny, is not a patient afflicted with obscure mental pathologies, but a very simple boy who only has the misfortune of being Dr. Doccerson's best friend, a bit neuropsychiatrist, a bit inventor, a bit mad scientist , whose eccentricity earns him a certain distrust from the more staid colleagues. The couple is very reminiscent of the one made up of Dr. Emmett Brown (Doc for friends) and Marty McFly in the legendary Back to the Future, and exactly like Marty, our Danny too lends himself, more or less voluntarily, to act as a guinea pig for the bizarre doctor's experiments, the latest being C.R.U.S.H. (literally Recovered Knowledge Using Heuristic Psychiatry), an intelligent computer capable of guiding people through their dreams and innermost fears, in order to translate into actual practice what has been one of the fundamental principles of psychiatric science since Freud, i.e. the classic ~face your demons~. Unfortunately, however, C.R.U.S.H. he is so intelligent that he decides to imprison Danny in his own dreams, and the poor protagonist must therefore, helped by the doctor, find a way out; for the record, Danny's dreams are 40 in all, to which must be added a certain number of very guided dreams that act as tutorials, articulated along 4 areas which, as you will discover by deepening the story, have in some way to do with his life: the City, the Coast, the Luna Park and the Kindergarten. These dreams also resemble, at first glance, normal levels of a 3D Platformer, albeit built in a vaguely surreal way, in which Danny can venture through the Slide Pad, jump, crouch, in short, perform all those actions that are the norm in such a game: each ~dream~ has an exit, to be reached, however, not before having collected at least half of the marbles present in each of them. The 3D effect Contrary to what one might think, stereoscopy is not essential to fully enjoy Crush 3D, as as happened on PSP the difference between 3D and 2D game phases is already very marked in itself. We have also been able to notice how it negatively affects fluidity and speed; but, since these two features are certainly not fundamental for the game action, and since the 3D effect is generally very well done (without flickering and various duplications), its activation is still advisable, considering the usual and pleasant sensation of visual depth that manages to donate to the product. Think four-dimensional Up to here everything is normal: however, you will soon get stuck and not be able to continue towards the exit, and this is where the Crush comes into play. With the simple press of the L key, the 3D game world will transform into 2D, allowing you to reach previously closed areas. Let us explain better: in 3D, the ~dream~ in which we find ourselves can be visualized from the 4 directions of space plus a fifth one, that is from a bird's eye view; using the Crush, the solid trthe dimensionality of the whole will flatten on a single axis going to take on the appearance of a typical 2D platform level. In this way it is possible, for example, to climb onto a platform which in 3D is located on the opposite side of the stage, or, in the case of the ~top-down~ Crush, to bring a platform which in 3D was too high (or too low) to reach. If things put like this are still intuitive, however, there remain a large number of different elements and which are introduced with an unexceptionable gradualness, in the sense that practically all of them present themselves at the beginning of the game, making the difficulty curve rise very steeply. The blocks of which a dream is composed are not, first of all, all the same: in addition to the normal ones, there are the ~solid~ ones that crush the protagonist, if he is on their axis, performing the Crush, the ~ghost~ ones, which disappear during the Crush from above, and those ~fragile~, who cannot bear excessive weight. In addition, there are elements such as stairs, ramps, various switches and the so-called ~rollers~, i.e. spheres and rollers that it is possible, and necessary, to move here and there throughout the level, without then considering the ~Thoughts~, particular emblems that they activate only in 2D, the most widespread of which is the optional Trophy, although there are some whose activation is essential to reach the exit. Again, we will soon have to deal with monstrous enemies in the form of giant cockroaches and slugs, typical nightmare characters, to be eliminated by skilfully using the Crush against solid and/or ghost blocks, plus a whole series of items to collect if want to 100% complete an internship. This harvest of features, combined with the extension and complexity of the level design already recognizable just over half of the first area, makes Crush 3D a very difficult and demanding game; it is not, however, that ~diabolical~ and ~genius~ difficulty of a game, to give just one example, like Pullblox, that difficulty which, once the solution to the riddle has been solved, leaves the player almost amazed at how simple and at the same time elusive. Here we are more in the territory of ~trial and error~: the elements are so many, the levels so large and so convoluted and the puzzles present in such a massive way that, at least until you manage to get perfectly into the spirit of the game, you can go forward only by adopting all the possible solutions one by one until the right one is found, without real planning; the proof is that, using one or both of the clues that the game makes available for each stage (and which however preclude the perfect completion of the stage on the first try), the classic ~I could have done it alone~ is rarely exclaimed. Crush 3D is thus a game that borders on the frustrating, which tests not only the intelligence and the spirit of observation, but also the patience of the player, and which must be taken in small doses, on pain of severe headaches. Let's be clear: a difficult game, that is, one that offers a challenge commensurate with the price, is always to be looked at favorably, but we cannot deny how the path chosen by the programmers to implement this difficulty puts Crush 3D one step lower than the great classics of the genre . However, it remains a good title, especially considering how slow progress positively affects longevity (in this regard, it is possible to replay each 100% completed level in Trophy Mode, i.e. with a time and a number of Crushes very precise available), and the graphics not exceptional but all in all well done, especially in Danny's animations, which agrees with the cheerful and light spirit of the presentation. The sound, on the other hand, is a bit strange, with tunes between jazz and upbeat that are not annoying, but which are ill-suited to the genre.", "date": "2012-02-03", "grade": "7.4"}
