Of course, the reference system has undergone some changes in the meantime, with the usual rich production in the indie field and above all following the sensational return of Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick with Thimbleweed Park, which now represents a new paradigm for the genre also in the panorama contemporary, but The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 is a substantially different creature, as we will try to illustrate in this review. For quite some time now, graphic adventures of this type have no longer been included in the triple A-type standard production models, due to the natural evolution of the market which has led games of this kind to be increasingly decentralized on the margins of videogame development, dedicated to an audience of niche compared to the heyday of the 80s and 90s. However, point and click has never disappeared from the scene and has been fueled largely by indie production and in particular by a series of teams coming mainly from Europe (and from Germany in particular), protagonists of a real new wave of the graphic adventure, which also includes KING Art Games. The Book of Unwritten Tales probably represents one of the best titles ever of this ~new~ wave of adventures, even if by now we can speak of consolidated and well-placed products within the modern industry. Therefore, the judgments we expressed in the first review on PC and in the subsequent one in iOS format remain fundamentally valid on the second chapter, even if there are additional evaluations to be made on Nintendo Switch. Mature fantasy but not too much The two elements that mainly characterize the gaming experience, as far as graphic adventures are concerned, are certainly the narration (understood as a set of history, construction of the script and writing of the dialogues) and the puzzle design and on both fronts The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 has reached really excellent quality levels. The story is complex and multifaceted, thanks to the presence of various characters to interpret, each with a well-established background and highly developed personalities, able to thicken the plot with different narrative lines destined to intersect perfectly during the long adventure, which it lasts about twenty hours and for a game of this kind it is a truly remarkable time. The problem may be that of relying on the events that occurred in the first chapter to explain the starting elements in the story of each character, therefore, to immediately appreciate the different personalities and motivations of each, the ideal would be to know what happened before: but the progenitor has never been released on consoles, so perhaps it is advisable to recover the previous story in some way. It is not easy to handle fantasy without falling into rather abused themes and situations that are now of little attraction for those who are not fond of the genre, but one of the greatest merits of KING Art is precisely having been able to play on the canonical elements of setting with intelligence and lightness, managing to parody but without making fun of in an obvious way. As we said earlier, in some respects the writing here approaches the spirit of Terry Pratchett, with his ability to blend elements taken from fantasy and fairy tales mixing them with a sort of social satire that involves popular culture at different levels. The epic of the four protagonists goes through truly epic moments, but without ever taking itself too seriously and managing not to flatten the protagonists into overly standardized roles. All this happens above all thanks to the quality of the dialogues, which in some moments is really close to the great LucasArts tradition (although, we repeat, Thimbleweed Park is placed on a much higher level on this front). It should be noted that the game is entirely spoken in English but with texts in Italian, characterized by a good translation. Move and click Being able to move in balance between creativity and logic without falling on one side into the abstruse or the other into the banal is a problem of considerable importance in the construction of the puzzles for a graphic adventure with a fundamentally humorous tone like this. The fantasy / fairytale setting provides strange and unpredictable situations and contexts, which helps to build puzzles out of the norm and in this sense The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 manages to offer always rather interesting challenges for the intellect. It's not a simple game, toobecause the puzzles are often structured in several phases and in some cases require the cooperative use of several characters, therefore the possibilities multiply and the solutions are not easily visible, but the rather open design allows you to work on different problems and therefore advance in various directions, reducing the frustrating effect of getting stuck on a single puzzle. The interaction between characters and the dialogues are also protagonists as active elements of the gameplay, because it is in the text that the clues are usually found to understand how to use the objects in the inventory and interact with the elements of the scenario. Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch version carries with it an intrinsic defect of the console versions of the game, namely an adaptation of the interface to the controller that is not exactly optimal. Despite the possible presence of the touch screen, which perhaps could have provided at least an alternative to the control system, with a solution that was already appreciable on mobile devices, The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 on Nintendo Switch exclusively exploits the controls through the analog stick and keys. An interface born to be enjoyed with a mouse and keyboard is always problematic to adapt to different inputs, but conversions of point and click graphic adventures on consoles are now the order of the day and we have certainly seen better adaptations in this sense. The response to the commands given with the analog stick is not always precise and it is often difficult to be able to point to the right object, also considering the quantity of interactive elements present on the screen, which at least can be highlighted by simply pressing a button, with a certainly appreciable solution. The interface without screen commands, which was very intuitive and elegant on the PC, becomes somewhat cumbersome here, with its alternation of keys to be used and the somewhat cumbersome system provided especially when it comes to using inventory items.", "date": "2019-02-06", "grade": "8.4"}
