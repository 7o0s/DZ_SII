Lately we have seen remasters of all kinds and ultimately that same Spongebob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom which seemed tasty but also almost superfluous if inserted in the current panorama. Today we find ourselves in the same situation, having to review a title that we liked very much almost twenty years ago and which we find today with a new version of all respect taken care of in many of its details having to face new challenges. We must therefore understand in this circumstance whether today's players really still need this kind of remakes and whether a mere graphic embellishment is to be considered a satisfactory rejuvenation operation for the title in question. Is a bit of hi-res and some shimmering really enough to resonate with the 2020 audience? Find out in our Mr. Driller DrillLand review. Who does not dig in company There is no great story to follow to be able to jump into the world of Driller, just know that your family tree has deep roots, with a DNA shared between the famous Dig Dug and Baraduke whose protagonists are none other than your parents. Susumu Hori, the protagonist of this game, loves to dig and in this spin-off he will have to use all his skills to complete a series of mysterious attractions of Drill Land, a custom-made playground. We are therefore talking about a title detached from the main trend, a new chapter that is excellent for getting to know the saga and its unique gameplay given the great variety of activities offered. The guidelines that you need to know before starting to play are very few, and it is sufficient to understand that your sole objective is to destroy as many colored blocks as possible trying to reach the bottom of the various levels avoiding being crushed and trying to score the highest score ever, in true arcade cabinet style. Fortunately, as we said, this Mr. Driller DrillLand will put you in front of a good amount of stages, and you will be able to jump from an Egyptian pyramid where you collect golden statues before the exit to mysterious tombs where instead you will be forced to lock up ghosts to avoid let them pursue you and take your life. The options are many and although the game scheme is randomly generated, finding a strategy to adopt is not extremely complex but will still require a good deal of practice. In addition to digging, in fact, you will have to try to make the colored blocks collapse without support on those of the same type so that they are destroyed automatically, saving you time and perhaps precious percentages of life in the classic mode. Five in all the main rooms with the possibility of collecting special points to then spend in the rewards shop, so as to unlock numerous collectible objects, however staying very far from the pitfalls of microtransactions. To play then, if you like the genre, you will really have it for dozens of hours, especially if you decide to buy the title on Nintendo Switch where the remastering brings bright colors, bright levels and even truly excellent sounds. We are talking about a game that does not ask you for more than fifteen minutes per game, in short, perfect for hit and run sessions in the portable version. Finally, the possibility of playing up to four in competitive mode on the same console should not be underestimated, a feature that could make your evenings or afternoons with friends quite fun and very Japanese. The downside, unfortunately, is that this kind of title has evolved a lot over the years and some exponents have come to rewrite it almost completely. Mr. Driller is therefore no longer the one and only protagonist to offer gameplay of this type but on balance both Spelunky and Downwell represent decidedly better experiences overall, even if only in terms of precision of controls and innovative gimmicks. Therefore, evaluate well how to spend the 20 euros needed to bring this remaster home, a price not exactly in line with the main competitors, sold at the time of writing for around two euros on Steam.", "date": "2020-07-08", "grade": "7.5"}
