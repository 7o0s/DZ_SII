{"name": "Company of Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/company-of-heroes-recensione-su-ipad.html", "text": "If you are looking for a true strategy for iPad, which is not a watered down version of the genre to work best on these platforms, then this review of Company of Heroes is for you. Feral Interactive, specialized in conversions on Apple platforms (Mac and iOS) has in fact transported what was the legendary 2006 PC game onto the tablet of the Cupertino company, completing the work with a good translation of the user interface according to the dynamics typical of the touch screen. This is all a strategy enthusiast looking for a mobile solution needs, or just a traditional gamer interested in something substantial and deep to play on the iPad: Company of Heroes is not a portable reduction with simplified and simplified mechanics linear to better fit the context, it's simply an almost direct port of the original experience. This already provides some elements to take into consideration: first of all the size and weight of the game, given that we are dealing with over 5GB of data to download and install (even in progressive packages) which on a device of this type have a certain weight, in addition to the fact that it is a rather demanding software for a tablet, at least in the less performing iPad models. Having highlighted these premises, everything else is simply Company of Heroes, so in case you need to refresh your memory, we refer you to the now ancient original review by Luca Olivato on these pages, from almost fifteen years ago. The value of the game has remained intact but it is clear that in the meantime the chances that someone has not played it previously have probably decreased: however, landing on a platform of this type allows you to reach completely new audiences, therefore the challenge of this conversion, although very late, is interesting. Already at the time of its release, Company of Heroes represented further confirmation of the value of Relic Entertainment in the strategic field, but even more than the team's previous productions (Homeworld, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War), this title was able to bring something new to a genre that is usually very static from a structural point of view. The single player story follows the exploits of two companies of US forces during WWII, chronicling D-Day with the iconic Normandy landings and subsequent battles regarding a group of foot soldiers and the events immediately preceding it and then intersected with these of the Fox airborne company, thus recounting the advance of the allies in the last phase of the war against Germany on European territory. Although the question has been extensively explored in many shooters, for an RTS it represents a rather peculiar setting and the cinematic cut given to the Campaign, complete with cutscenes and scripted elements to enrich the single player events, still represent today one rather particular style with which to represent the strategic in real time. A notable lack in this edition, however, is that of the online multiplayer: the iPad version allows us to engage in the Campaign with history or dedicate ourselves to the Skirmish mode, i.e. standard battles on different maps, but in both cases it is a single player against the CPU, unless the possibility of online multiplayer is introduced later. The war between the fingers Company of Heroes has peculiar characteristics that make its strategic structure deep, based on the management of the map and the units on the battlefield. These borrow some elements from the RPG into a whole that is, however, well blended with the classic dynamics of the RTS. The management of the troops is very intuitive, based above all on the possibility of dividing them into groups and making them act in a concerted manner according to the tactics that are deemed most appropriate to pursue the various objectives. There is a remarkable interaction with the elements of the scenario, thanks to the possibility of using them as cover elements and also adapting buildings to create new bases, which add to the ad hoc structures to be built directly on the battlefield. The progression of the units is underlined by their increase in rank, which allows the unlocking of upgrades and additional skills, all elements that make the dynamics of the clashes even more profound and encourage you to keep your attention high so as not to lose precious units. The management of the map recalls in some respects the mechanics of Risk: to obtain supplies and increase control over the scenarios it is necessary to conquervarious control points, but these must correspond to contiguous areas for a functioning supply line to be created. This pushes for a more reasoned approach to the conquest of the various areas, as well as paving the way for tactical choices in the ~breaking~ of the supply lines of the opponents, all elements that contribute to further characterize the strategic experience in Company of Heroes. The transposition on the iPad sees the main changes applied to the control system, which in this case is based on the use of the touch screen, which on paper should represent a functional substitute for the mouse but in practice often proves to be inadequate. Although the historical control system of the PC remains on another level of comfort, the work done in this case is still commendable: the game allows you to choose between a user interface very similar to the original one, with a rectangular menu of commands placed in the lower area of the screen, or the radial menu that has become quite typical in games that use the touch screen, with the command wheel that appears by keeping your finger on the screen in correspondence with the various units. The quantity of options that Feral has managed to insert without necessarily having to resort to the menus is remarkable: it is a question of having to memorize various types of commands including single touch, double touch, multiple touch with several fingers simultaneously and more which initially can be disorienting but in fact represent the most intuitive transposition of the variety of possible combinations with a mouse and keyboard. On the technical side, Company of Heroes feels the weight of past years, also because the graphic settings seem to have scaled downwards (at least with the device used, a standard 2018 iPad, as there are no options for changing the settings). The result is still pleasant with the distant shot, dignified even with a close-up view but shows considerable limitations in the interlude scenes, where the low resolution and minimal detail make the figures almost disturbing. In any case, it is a question of going to nitpick because in the game action everything works very well and above all optimal performance is always maintained even in moments of greater load.", "date": "2020-02-12", "grade": "8.8"}
