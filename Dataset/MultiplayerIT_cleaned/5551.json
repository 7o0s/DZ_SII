In fact, Alien Day is celebrated every year on this day, with which the numerous fans of the saga unite to celebrate the film shot in 1979 by Ridley Scott and all the other works that have followed it in recent decades. As you know, among these there were also numerous video games, which today is joined by Aliens vs. Pinball, revisitation of Alien and company through the eyes of Zen Pinball 2. Continuing their series of partnerships with major brands in the entertainment world to transform them into pinball machines, the guys at Zen Studios did not miss the opportunity and published even three new tables to celebrate Alien Day. Naturally we have tried them for you in preview. Aliens, Alien vs. Predator and Alien: Isolation star in the new pack for Zen Pinball 2 Game over man! The package offered by the DLC titled Aliens vs. Pinball features the pinball machine dedicated to Aliens, the second film in the saga directed in 1986 by James Cameron. We are therefore in the company of Ellen Ripley and the Colonial Marines to clean up the moon LV-426 from the infestation of enemy creatures. Zen Studios' idea was obviously to reproduce the atmosphere of the film, putting the player at the center of a war situation against the xenomorphs that populate the pinball machine. Keeping faith with its tradition, also in this case Zen Pinball 2 does not lack side elements capable of delighting fans of the franchise, including a series of samples taken directly from the old film. Especially glorious is the ~Game over man, game over!~ which is pronounced when the third ball is lost and the game ends. From a technical point of view it is a particularly fun pinball machine, in which the various elements work perfectly, even bringing us into a driving minigame. The only flaw for some will perhaps be the excessive simplicity of this table, given that it is possible to unlock the various missions simply by starting them, without therefore being forced to complete them to go on with the collection of points. Either way, it's really a nitpick of a pinball machine that you'll surely find entertaining if you loved Aliens, complete with Ripley setting marbles on fire with her famous flamethrower. Moving on to the second table offered by the package, we find the one dedicated to Aliens vs. Predator, the famous crossover that pits the two alien races against each other. At this juncture we find ourselves fighting in the role of the Predator who appears next to the pinball machine, using his thermal vision in a particularly successful mission to identify the targets to be targeted. The mission entitled ~Vertigo~ is also quite unique, in which the entire table is turned upside down, giving the player the sensation just mentioned. It is perhaps the least successful table of the three that make up the DLC, but in any case capable of fully achieving the sufficiency: beyond the singular elements we have mentioned, especially on this occasion, the presence of more demanding dynamics would certainly have led to a better rating. From Ellen to Amanda The third and final table that makes up Aliens vs. Pinball pays homage to the video game Alien: Isolation. As in the successful title released in 2014, we find ourselves in the role of Amanda Ripley, prey to a xenomorph on the Sevastopol space station. In technical terms, in this case we are dealing with a pinball machine that develops less deeply, thus imposing a game developed especially in the lower part of the table. The various situations in which you can find yourself are also taken from the game developed by Creative Assembly, sneaking between the various areas of the ship to hide from the enemy creature, and then find it on your trail up to a battle phase. In this last pinball machine we also find a rather singular double concept, linked to the level of health and ammunition that Amanda can enjoy while we get busy with the flaps and the marbles. Fighting against the xenomorph, the health of the protagonist will drop, to give rather unusual consequences: when the life points are low, in fact, the game continues to go on, but the amount of points accumulated is less than that which would be obtained with maximum health. Similarly, when there are few bullets available, it becomes necessary to reload the weapon, hitting the appropriate target. Moving towards the conclusion, in general terms we can only express a positive opinion on all three pinball machines offered by Aliens vs. Pinball, while having liked them in modo different as we told. From a technical point of view, the excellent work of the development team is confirmed, skilful and determined every time in adapting the brands that are welcomed within Zen Pinball 2 in the best possible way. When it comes to works such as Star Wars, Marvel comics and Alien itself, the task is not trivial at all. Going back to the package we just dealt with, if Alien Day is an important day for you, this is definitely an appointment not to be missed.", "date": "2016-04-26", "grade": null}
