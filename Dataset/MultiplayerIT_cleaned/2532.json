{"name": "Settlers 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/settlers-4.html", "text": "Lots of little omens What both titles have in common is the fact that both the various Caesars and the Settlers are not ~simple~ and immediate games, but require considerable patience and a lot of available time. But exactly what makes The Settlers so different from other strategy games? Definitely the level of detail visible in the game. Take any strategic, for example Warcraft. There were 3 main resources, wood, gold and oil. To ~build~ combat units it was necessary to invest some gold and, if necessary, also some wood and oil. In the game it was the ~special~ building that was responsible for the ~construction~ of the ~knight~ (for example). But... who supplied the sword for the knight? It was certainly forged by the blacksmith, who worked it using a tool obtained by working iron, extracted thanks to the hard work of the miners who will surely be supported by food... and so on. The gist of the speech As you will have well understood in The Settlers, your aim will be to have to establish a complex production chain that is capable of functioning without the slightest hitch. The first step will of course be to build a woodcutter and a ~stonecutter~ (or alternatively a stone quarry) within your territories. These two structures will be ~inhabited~ by some of your Settlers without particular jobs (defined as ~carriers~, i.e. the settlers who simply take care of transporting the various materials around your lands and who, if necessary, can ~specialize~ in various tasks). These structures will provide some of the dozens of resources that can be accumulated in the game: tree trunks and stone. Naturally one thing led to another and soon you'll need a ~forester~ to plant new trees and a sawmill to process the timber into a suitable construction material. Let's say that having played the other episodes of this series, it is easy to say that military units are at the top of this hypothetical pyramid. Your soldiers will need gold, extracted from the mines, your miners will need the food produced in the fields or on farms, these structures will be built using wood and stones... So almost all of the structures present in The Settlers serve to make the recruitment of your army possible. In fact, your warriors will be hired in the ~Barracks~, the barracks: in this fearsome building one of your ~carriers~ will be trained as you prefer. Indeed one of the differences with the previous episode is that it will no longer be possible to further promote the built units, they will therefore remain so for the duration of their lives (Settlers 4 favors a rigid division into castes, it is not so politically correct ;- ) ). So the most advanced units will have to be ~built~ as such right from the start. Temporary employment agency The ~carriers~, i.e. the non ~specialized~ settlers are one of your most important resources: they will automatically transform into the ~professional~ categories required at the moment. Every ~freelancer~ will need a particular tool to be able to work: the farmer with the scythe, the miner with the pickaxe, etc. etc. Logically at the beginning of each game you will have a minimum number of tools in order to make your settlement operational. Of course you can speed up operations by building more blacksmiths in order to forge weapons faster thanks to the (hopefully) numerous iron that will arrive from the mines, and in this case you will need a particular type of blacksmith who will make you new tools. Returning to the matter of carriers, the latter are not infinite, but are ~churn out~ by the ~houses~ (the bigger the house, the greater the number of carriers made available). If for some reason the number of settlements becomes insufficient, they will go on strike, dealing a serious blow to the well-being of your society. However on all these types of units you will not have direct control except on a small group including the ~pioneer~, a unit capable of expanding your borders, the geologist, a sort of ~prospector~ (who examines the mountains for of coal, silver and so on), the magician, the thief, etc. Your army will be freely controllable, but you will have some limits regarding the obligation of having to hit only the military structures (which will however have the same purpose: the enemy structures present in your territory will be blown up automatically). The wizard capable of supporting your maneuvers deserves a special mention... and if that's the case you can also fight by sea. Whole job agencynal Naturally you will have guessed that an army is useless if there is no enemy to contend with (similarly, power is such only when in relation to some other entity, otherwise it is ephemeral - small philosophical digression ;-) ).. And who are they? the villains in a game as ~soft~ as Settlers IV? Well, all in all, in S4 you can play one of the 3 races (Romans, Vikings and the Maa) in some mini-campaigns of 3 missions, or decide to face the main campaign of the game against the ~Dark Tribe~, the ~ real villains~.. a ~civilization~ whose aim is to make the earth die...sick in order to carry out its fearsome and terrifying plans. But after all this long digression on game mechanics, what are we left with the game? Some say that a lot has changed since the previous episode (for example the pioneer needs a shovel to ~qualify~ to practice his profession), some say that little has changed (such as some professional categories that have now need certain tools to work). What is most different is perhaps the graphic style, at least for me who skipped the 3rd episode, a bit confusing.. there is perhaps too little contrast between the various structures and the background, but maybe it will just be a matter of getting used to . It is also possible to make use of a zoom function which also involves a sound zoom: in fact, by zooming in on a particular area, you will only hear the sounds coming from it (however, you will lose a lot of graphic detail). Arrived at the fourth chapter... But how do I play? The game is fun as long as you have a lot of patience, otherwise it risks turning into something really frustrating. In fact, it is often difficult to tell if you are closing in on a dead end because the effects of a particular scene will only be visible after a long time of playing. Similarly, the games of Settlers IV take up a lot of time, most of which is spent watching your little men bring your colony to full capacity: in my opinion one of the main defects of the game (not of this Settlers IV, but of the concept that at the base) is to be fun in the first part of the game, the one in which, thanks to your help, a highly efficient society will rise from a pile of stones. Once this part of the mission is completed, it will be a question of waiting for your army to acquire such dimensions as to ensure victory against the enemy. Arrived at the fourth chapter... Ultimately I would recommend this product especially to those who have a lot of time (but a lot) available and to fans of the series or to those who have never played a game in the series and find this level of detail interesting... For the others, I don't I just have to say that in my opinion there is very little new in Settlers 4 that hasn't already been done... Lots of little omens Settlers is certainly one of the few games that has no equal, having carved out a genre of its own. It is certainly a strategic game, in real time, but these few words are not enough to define it. The only games similar in concept are those of the Caesar series (in addition to Pharaoh and Zeus, from the same software house) and vice versa. The only real big difference between the two series is that perhaps the various Caesars are closest to Sim City as a style of play: in fact, in Caesar, constructible buildings cover every aspect of life (not to mention the fact that just like in Sim City , the conditions of the city increase with a skilful urban planning), while in the Settlers everything is more oriented to the sole extraction of resources and to the economic aspect.", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
