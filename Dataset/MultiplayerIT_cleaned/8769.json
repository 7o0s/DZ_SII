{"name": "Okabu", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/98371-okabu-balenuvole-e-lenzuola.html", "text": "The wonderful kingdom of Okabu is threatened by the pollution brought by the Doza race, and in particular the species of whales (clouds in the shape of a whale, in fact) suffer from the fumes that poison the air. Two brothers, Nimbe and Kumulo, therefore decide to head towards the origin of the problem, but end up being overwhelmed by the dangerous effluvia and fall to the ground. They wake up in the Tenori village, surrounded by friendly Yorubu, who discover they are suffering for the same reasons: the Doza have destroyed their homes and enslaved many of their companions. A natural alliance is therefore established, which leads the two baleen whales and some Yorubu to advance together with the aim of driving the Doza out of the kingdom once and for all. This is the incipit of Okabu, the debut title for HandCircus on PlayStation 3, available exclusively in digital format via PlayStation Store. It is basically an action game with puzzle elements, in which new skills are gradually gained and you have to use them to solve the riddle of the moment, through a series of ever wider and more complex scenarios. The first minutes of the game are so simple as to make one fear the worst, namely that the whole experience has been designed for a very young audience and therefore is unable to offer a minimum of challenge for the most experienced gamers. The two baleen clouds move fluidly between small gardens and houses, greeting the Yorubo and interacting with them to complete disarmingly trivial quests. Nimbe and Kumulo can in fact load themselves with water by bathing in a pond, then release it on plantations that need a little rain, or spray it against a particular target (for example the Dozabot, androids built by the Doza) to put it out of action. You can switch from one whale to another by simply pressing the Triangle button, or play with a friend in cooperative mode (only locally, however), always in an extremely intuitive way. As mentioned, the first impression is that of an excessively easy and bite-free title, but fortunately things change after a few stages and the elements that really characterize the HandCircus product are introduced. Playstation 3 trophies Okabu's forty-two Trophies are fairly simple to unlock. In fact, most of them are obtained by completing levels and eliminating a certain number of dozabots. More complicated to get are the secret Trophies, which imply the completion of particular missions (destroying a hundred statues, eliminating as many dozabots with a cannon, etc.). It hurts Okabu While Nimbe and Kumulo are endowed with extraordinary abilities, it would have been hard to base the entire gameplay of Okabu on their raids from one part of the scenario to another. For this reason, in the course of the adventure we will meet four characters to carry on the back of the cloud whales, each with unique skills that will be used alternately to solve increasingly complex puzzles. The first character is Captain Monkfish, a funny Yorubo armed with a suction cup that can launch towards any type of object to hook and drag it: doors, chests, explosive charges and so on. Picolo is then added to him, a factor capable of ~hypnotizing~ animals and people thanks to his own magic flute: by playing it we can spur buffaloes and sheep to move in the direction we want, smashing the obstacles in their path, spur the chickens to eat the grass blocking a passage or having Yorubo stand on switches. Finally, Roki and Kat will arrive later: the first is a ~repentant~ Doza, who can control a large number of electronic devices as needed, the second is accompanied by a bird capable of carrying objects and activating certain mechanisms. All these possibilities are mixed following a certain progression, even if at the beginning we notice the almost traumatic passage from the more banal sections to those in which even quite elaborate puzzles must be solved, composed of several elements in succession. In the end, however, the experience remains fun and light: the puzzles are never too obscure and therefore you can solve them with a minimum of reasoning, while the whales cannot be killed and the only price to pay, in in case you are hit by the enemy, it is to recover your character near a tree of regeneration. Other aspects of the HandCircus product are decidedly more problematic, such as the often non-optimal management of ~remotely controlled~ characters and some annoying slowdowns that occur during the most crowded situations (not many, luckilyna). The comic graphics once again have their say, thanks also to a good choice of colors, and make Okabu an almost unique game of its kind, with the whales that ~glide~ across the screen and contribute to the creation of an extremely immediate experience. The sound sector is made up of very funny ~voices~, in Zelda style, and of a musical accompaniment that is irresistible at first, but which gradually becomes a bit monotonous and, above all, does not stop even in the moments in which it is necessary to underline the action in a different way (see when the story of the Doza is told), unfortunately showing little attention to detail.", "date": "2012-02-09", "grade": "8.0"}
