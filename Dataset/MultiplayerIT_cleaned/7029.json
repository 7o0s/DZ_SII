Zombies, while managing to preserve the spirit and atmosphere that millions of people they know well and are now fond of. Published on Xbox One and Xbox 360 last February, Garden Warfare has finally found its way to the PC, clearly on the Origin platform, and is therefore preparing to conquer a new, large slice of users thanks to its simple but captivating mechanics, an important strategic element and a technical sector that in the Windows environment manages to give the best in terms of detail, effects and fluidity. Of course, the experience does not start in the best way, given that on the one hand the game requires an always active connection as an anti-piracy measure (which would not even be so unpleasant, given that in the end it is always an online shooter) , on the other it uses a too permissive approach towards voice chat, which is active by default and therefore translates into shouts, cackles, rumbles, people singing (in German, in our case) and, in general, an incredible noise which it is not possible to deactivate permanently but which requires each time to open the in-game options screen and silence all users or only some of them, with the problem, however, of having to repeat the procedure for all any new entries. An annoying defect, which can be remedied, at the moment, only through a workaround that is anything but official. Plants Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare confirms all the solidity of its play system also on PC Silence, the slaps speak The game modes of Plants Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare are not very numerous, but they guarantee sufficient variety. On the competitive front, we start with the ideal option for novices, ~Welcome Mat~, which is a very relaxed team deathmatch, in which you even get more health if you die frequently. In short, an excellent system to familiarize yourself with the control system and the philosophy behind the game, which on PC we can manage with the traditional combination of mouse and keyboard (using keys 1, 2 and 3 to activate special skills) or preferring the perfectly supported Xbox 360 controller. The latter solution that we tend to prefer in third-person contexts, given that it guarantees support for aiming while losing in speed and pointing precision, but at the same time it allows you to manage the movements of the character in a more natural way. Then there are two weight modes, both also present in the ~classic~ variant, which does not include customizations, improvements and so on: we are talking about ~Elimination by teams~ and ~Tombs and gardens~. The first is the traditional team deathmatch in which two teams of twelve members face each other on the battlefield with the aim of being the first to reach fifty eliminations and win the match; the second is instead a territorial mode in which the zombie faction attacks positions, while the plants must defend them, just like in the original Plants Vs. Zombies. This is probably the most entertaining competitive option, given the numerous facets also in strategic terms, with the possibility for the plants to activate turrets and tactically organize the defense by dividing the roles, while the zombies can count on a progression which, in if successful, it will lead them to conquer various areas up to Dave's famous villa. The offer is closed by the ~Mixed mode~, or the classic playlist that alternates the various situations, and the ~Gnomba~, a reinterpretation of ~capture the flag~ in which the two teams must take possession of an explosive garden gnome and deposit it at one of three enemy hotspots to blow them up. To these competitive modes is added a cooperative, ~Garden Operation~, which in practice offers a free and third-person reinterpretation of the dynamics that characterized the tower defense of PopCap Games. In fact, four players in command of as many plants must defend their garden from the onslaught of increasingly numerous and dangerous zombie hordes, with the debut of big and powerful bosses to mark the closure of each wave. Seedlings and dead plants We have just mentioned the strategic value of Plants Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare, which is particularly evident in the territorial and cooperative modes. In the moment in which it is necessary to defend an area of the map, in fact, certain classes become essential to offer the necessary support to teammates and maximize the effectiveness of offensive maneuvers. On the plants front, let's think for example of the Sunflower, a small and not very resistant character, but equipped with a rather precise burst attack and, above all, healing skills that can put the other team members back on track; or at the Masticazombi, whose name says it all: the typical brawler capable of attacking only from a very short distance, but lethal and equipped with an ~underground~ special that can decimate the ranks of zombies without even the vanguard being aware of it . Then we have the Peashooter, balanced between attack and mobility, and the sniper on duty, the Cactus, also capable of depositing dangerous explosive charges within the scenarios. As far as zombies are concerned, the lightest and most versatile unit is the Footman, also ideal for stalking given his ability to make very high leaps. Then there are the Engineer, with his grenade launcher and the ability to release dangerous drones that attack the enemy team; the Scientist, armed with a sort of shotgun but also capable of activating devices for the healing of his companions and for immediate transport to alternative areas of the map; and finally the Fuoriclasse, a slow unit but equipped with a powerful Gatling gun, also able to damage enemies with a running charge in a context in which melee attacks are practically absent. Each class has a number of variants, upgrades and customizations that you can unlock by using the money you earn during each game to buy surprise sticker packs and put the pieces (literally) of all these goodies together. An excellent system, however, devoid of any attempt at monetization, which makes the focus on individual characters much more interesting with a view to their maximum development. The PC version Although starting with a bit of a disadvantage compared to its console counterparts in terms of market debut date and DLC release (the free Tactical Taco Party pack, for example, will be released on Origin ten days after Xbox LIVE), and while suffering from a couple of quite annoying technical flaws (in this case the management of the voice chat we talked about, the lack of a server selector and the presence of a bit of lag, a phenomenon fortunately quite sporadic), Plants Vs Zombies: Garden Warfare appears in dazzling form on PC, strong in a graphics engine capable of ensuring a good rendering of the settings and surfaces, without smudged textures or evident slips, and of offering a frame rate stably above 120 frames per second on test configuration, at 1080p resolution (on Xbox One the game runs at 900p and 60 fps) and with all settings on the ~Ultra~ preset. The feeling, therefore, is that PopCap Games has done an excellent job in terms of optimization, moreover ensuring that even the owners of less powerful than average machines can enjoy its multiplayer-based third person shooter, going to decrease the aforementioned resolution or by foregoing the highest quality adjustments for textures and their filter, shadows, terrain, decorations, anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion (the latter present with the HBAO but not the HBAO+, a witness the lack of specific support for NVIDIA-branded features). For the rest, the general design, the rendering of the characters and the cartoonishness of the settings are all elements that combine to compose the picture of a very pleasant technical sector, born to be functional to the action rather than to ~amaze with special effects~, which which is great.", "date": "2014-07-02", "grade": "8.0"}
