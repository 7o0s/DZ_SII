I love you Slender, big black ageless puppy, I love you Slender, but where you're from no one knows. I love you Slender, when you chase me with your claw, I love you Slender, you're my monster I know. Please now Slender don't grow up anymore, otherwise you'll become a wildebeest to me. Slender, you have a tuxedo and big eyes no longer Slender. Slender, only you know how to kill Slender! After the moment of the song, the time has come to talk about Slender: The Arrival, the first commercial game from the author of Slender: The Eight Pages, a tech demo that became a cult phenomenon on the web about a year ago. Someone came to define it as the future of horror games, while others, given the overly simplified mechanics that characterized it, wondered if it would actually have stood up to it with a longer and more articulated product. The premises were good. Structurally The Arrival is divided into five chapters that make up a very classic story, but suitable for the context (we won't reveal anything about the plot because we love you). Instead of proceeding alone, Mark Hadley, the author of the tech demo, collaborated with Blue Isle Studios, a more experienced software house behind it, to create a more technically attractive title (the original was very ugly). From this point of view there is little to complain about, because we are faced with a well-finished project, with large and detailed levels. Some objects are not modeled in an exceptional way, but in general there is something to be happy about, above all for the really well done atmosphere, thanks also to the perfectly timed idea of the player's point of view filtered by a camera, which allows you to exploit electronic disturbances as an element of tension, heralding the presence of the supernatural. The scenarios are very classic environments for the American imagination (and therefore also ours), such as the large house of the introduction, with attached courtyard and garage, or the forest or the mine that can be visited in subsequent levels. The movement of the vegetation caressed by the wind is convincing, just as the play of light in the various environments is convincing. Of course, you don't expect anything miraculous, but for a 10 dollar stock we are facing a very good result. Largely predictable The huge problem of Slender: The Arrival is the strong point that made Slender: The Eight Pages famous, namely its limited gameplay. We finished the game in just over two and a half hours, discovering that the longevity of the title depends on only one factor: luck. The reason is obvious: in all levels, apart from the prologue, there are objects to find scattered around the map. There is no indication of where they are, so on your first playthrough you simply have to be lucky to find them all. Unfortunately this is also the only mechanic of the game, remained identical compared to the freeware tech demo. Of course, the scenarios change, the enemies change, since now the Slender carries servants as dangerous as he is, but the substance remains the same: you look for the required objects and, when you find them, you move up a level. The gameplay then immediately becomes monotonous, despite the greater cosmetic variety, balanced only by the horror moments. But even here there is something to question. The brief experience of The Eight Pages made sudden deaths tolerable. After all, it was a free title, made only to experiment with an idea and to make the player jump from his chair. In The Arrival, enemies become more menacing with each new map you explore. Since there is no combat, and since everyone can kill the protagonist without any effort, the increase in the level of difficulty corresponds to the possibility of the current monster appearing ever closer to us, with the final maps in which one can find the death upon you at any moment. This translates into sudden deaths, which in the advanced stages can become continuous, with frustration soaring and tension collapsing. In short, if we add up the chronic lack of things to do, apart from wandering around at random (at least until the maps have been learned), the rest is nothing. Even the horror fades after a while, being a few reiterations of the same solutions and soon you end up being victims of routine. Thus the tension ends up diminishing and only the moments of fear caused by the surprise remain, those that Hitchcock considered mere sideshow tricks to scare the audience, ~boo~ suddenly made that at the end of the film, in our case of the video game , they leave nothing.", "date": "2013-04-09", "grade": "5.7"}
