The case is not so curious if we think that the French publisher has long been looking for titles and ideas capable of breaking through and launching it also on the eastern side, and what better genre could he conceive than a Jrpg? And in fact, on the DSi digital delivery service, there was a clear lack of a full-bodied, complete and satisfying game like a retail store title. But how much can a title that costs a handful of euros actually be? Legends of Exidia can be downloaded for 800 DSi-Points and while it cannot be compared in all respects to the best exponents of its genre on cartridge, it still represents a decisive step forward towards the maturity of DSiWare software. The adventure is a very classic and very stereotyped Jrpg game with action, platform elements and easy puzzle solving that never hurts. Both the isometric 2D graphics and the style of play immediately bring to mind great classics such as Secrets of Mana but above all Defender of Oasis with which it shares a lot. No turn-based combat and no extreme character and equipment upgrades, Legends of Exidia is structured to run quickly and without many thoughts. The difficulty level also seems calibrated downwards for this reason: the adventure can be completed in a few hours, and the twenty-five side missions are nothing more than short excursions throughout the story, all completed in a matter of minutes. The incipit of the story and its premises are a hymn to the fantasy clich: the Kingdom of Exidia is threatened by the army of Morgost who has invaded Olinor, land of Princess Sofia guardian of the spheres of Magic. Once in possession of the latter, the army also wants to conquer the last sphere that allows them to be able to resurrect the evil Daraka, hidden in Minasdril. Plot and words seem to follow the classic of the classic Lord of the Rings, and so many settings in which the game takes place: mines, woods, strongholds, villages surrounded by greenery. The amount of locations present in Legends of Exidia is commendable, as is the attempt to visually diversify the few hours of its duration. A frantic and fast Action-RPG However, the sense of dj vu that someone might have while playing Legends of Exidia is not due to who knows what fantasy film or book. Gameloft developed the game around the old Heroes of Might & Magic 2 that appeared on mobile phones a few years ago, and then made some aesthetic and functional tweaks. The game action takes place on the upper screen, while the one below, thanks to the touch, is delegated to manage inventories, menus and maps. The Nintendo DSi hardware isn't as exploited as a game entirely created from scratch for this platform could be, but still there are some interesting features. It is possible, for example, to take one's own photo and place it within some environments of the game, and the integrated microphone is used for some puzzles. The graphic sector, pleasant and colorful, despite its care and precision is decidedly dated and brings to mind the fabulous years of 16bit. However, returning to the present day, and above all considering the hardware on which it runs, one could certainly expect a little more effort. The sprites are never overly large, there are no effects such as zoom, rotation, transparency. The enemies and characters scattered throughout the game are almost always made up of the same recycled models and with diversified colors, as well as most of the sprites dedicated to the environments. The game, while being precise and flawless, could technically dare something more; this, if you are a fan of the old jrpg for Super NES or Megadrive, is not necessarily a defect because Legends of Exidia triggers a pleasant feeling of videogame romance. The product relates well to the hit and run use of a portable console, being fast, frenetic, perhaps too easy in its extreme simplification. The quests last a handful of seconds, the Bosses are defeated with a few blows and without many strategies, the puzzle solving is immediate. You grind levels and experience at the speed of light, and this factor is able to keep you glued to the screen without being able to detach yourself from it. The linearity of the story goes hand in hand with the simplification of the combat system: basically everything is done by pressing the A key, including the combos that are obtained by pressing the same key several times in sequence. The B key is instead delegated to spells and ranged attacks. Thethe audio sector is fluctuating and records excellent background music but poor sound effects, badly sampled and too recycled. Legends of Exidia represents a good starting point for the Nintendo DSi-Ware online service, with an underrepresented genre dedicated to a group of players today (unfortunately) a minority.", "date": "2010-02-11", "grade": "6.0"}
