{"name": "Worms 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worms-3d.html", "text": "Resistance is futile! Despite the revolution of the third dimension, the prerogatives of this third chapter remain unchanged from the past. In fact, the player finds himself having to manage a team of worms (worms, in Italian), who must complete a military mission, with particular attention to strategic behavior. In achieving the objectives, therefore, the speed or frenzy of our actions will not be fundamental, but rather the adoption of a reasoned strategy. From this point of view, it is good to remember that our actions and those of the enemy (be it the CPU or a friend, in multiplayer mode) follow one another according to a system of shifts, lasting 45 seconds each, which run out automatically in moment in which an attack is carried out, or objects of various types are used, by pressing the X key. Sometimes a sort of bonus of a few seconds is granted at the end of the turn to make the necessary movements in order not to suffer damage due to one's same attack, for example in case of using a hand grenade or a mine. The focus on the strategic component is further motivated by the intrinsic slowness and chronic weakness of the soldiers, worms in fact, who certainly cannot launch themselves into decisive individual actions. Therefore, the study and positioning on the battlefield, the parsimony in the management of the available arsenal and the adequacy of the weapon to be used, the effectiveness in single attacks, the management of objects (beams, jetpacks, etc.) assume importance. ) that allow you to change the shape of the battlefield to your advantage. YoU miSsEd! The setting of the battles is predominantly maritime (beaches - islands); a peculiarity that becomes problematic since our soldiers do not know how to swim. One of the main attention is in fact the maintenance of our worms ~afloat~, which, trivially, means placing them in sufficiently high and at the same time ~solid~ places. The explosions, in fact, generated by hand grenades, mines, bazooka shots, or missiles (both enemies and ours, it should be specified), produce destructive effects in real time on the natural elements of the battlefield. Going on concrete, a worm positioned on a hill such as a palm tree is easily ~knocked down~, as it is sufficient to hit it in the appropriate point, at least in theory, to generate the disastrous fall of the soldier who until a few seconds before bombarded us with bombs from a privileged position. All this, as already specified, takes place in a theoretical way, since Worms3d offers a collision detection system that is at least inaccurate. We are not referring to the senselessness of certain evolutions on the battlefield (the explosion of a bomb ~holes~ an island, and a small lake is born in the middle), in line with the comic and ironic style of the title. What leaves us perplexed are rather bridges that remain standing without the pylons (although this was also the case in the previous chapters), worms apparently suspended in the void or floating on the water, and so on, the result certainly not of design choices, and which seems to us however absurd to have to attribute inexperience with 3d for a historical group of developers like Team 17. Prepare to die! There are 3 modes in Worms 3d: Single, Multiplayer and Challenges. The heart of the game is articulated in the set of campaigns present within the single mode (absolutely satisfactory in terms of number and variety), supported by a tutorial. At the beginning of each mission, an explanation of the objective is provided, linked to the recovery of objects according to the annihilation of the enemy by our (customizable) ~Human Team~. These objectives are essential, that is, you cannot complete the campaign without obtaining the objects described in the various introductions to the missions, while defeating the enemy. Despite these ~stakes~, a good degree of freedom is granted to the player, who can allow himself to develop his own strategies at will, with the only constraint of having to retrieve the required items once success is achieved. In fact, the enemy teams do not tend to defend the objects necessary for our victory, but rather limit themselves to trying to eliminate us directly; although this is not an indication of a very refined Artificial Intelligence, it indirectly guarantees that degree of freedom to the player mentioned above. The main flaw of Worms 3d, however, is certainly the imprecision of the control system. Not so much with regard to the allowanceaction of the keys to the various functions (~circle~ to access the weapons menu, left analog stick for the ~physical~ movements of the worms, directional cross to calibrate the aim in first person mode, activated with ~R1~, while at ~r2 ~ it is up to the panoramic view, ~square~ for jumps, ~X~ assigned to fire for weapons and objects), but rather for a response to the commands that is, to say the least, approximate, especially in the management of the jump and double jump, which can be carried out using a double press of the ~square~ key. Near bridges, or areas where the risk of falling into the water is very high, these inaccuracies become decisive, so much so that the game is frustrating, and partially undermining the good conditions, also by virtue of a dancing camera, which invites almost always to difficult manual management, through the right analog stick. However, with the transition to 3D, Worms has not changed its comic look, as evidenced by some cel shaded textures, the bright color choices, and the design of the Worms themselves, which does not change one iota compared to the past. From the past it also inherits the irony of the battle cries and animations with which fallen soldiers greet the world of the living. What's really new is that there are only unpleasant and unjustified drops in frame rate, truly inexplicable, given the small amount to move for the graphics engine. Comment This is certainly not the case in which technical evolution corresponds to a playful revolution. Yes, because the transition to 3D for the Worms saga does not mean a radical change at all for a structure that in fact remains unchanged. This does not mean that Worms 3D is a product to be discarded, but rather it is very enjoyable both in single player, thanks to the wide range of missions and challenges available, and in multi, and only partially spoiled by control systems and collisions not up to date. height. While waiting for a real renewal, enthusiasts will certainly not be disappointed. Pros: Varied and plentiful solo missions Fair freedom granted to the player It's Worms! Cons: Poor controls Poor camera Poor collision detection system An ~almost classic~ of turn-based strategy games for Personal Computers returns to the console planet, and it's not just any sequel: it's the third episode of the Worms saga, which marks the definitive transition to 3D.", "date": "2003-12-15", "grade": null}
