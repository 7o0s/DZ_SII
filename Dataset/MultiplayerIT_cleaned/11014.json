{"name": "World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king-recensione.html", "text": "To install a big game, you need a big box After having witnessed a crescendo of sumptuousness in the sector's collector's packs in recent months, one could not expect less from Wrath of the Lich King. Massive boxes like large tomes have now been made standard, which would not look out of place in contemporary libraries as much as in a warlock's laboratory, the difference is made by the contents. Which in all honesty, where more and where less, follow the usual archetype of art book, in-game object and a further variable gift, whether it's a coder leather map, a miniature or a DVD. Blizzard, strong in the material possibility of being able to pamper its users without skimping, has opted for the above combination, to which must be added a DVD of the making of, a CD with the soundtrack, a mouse pad with the map of the new continent Northrend and two World of Warcraft card game starter decks, with two exclusive cards per box. The in-game object that is given to owners of the collector's edition is the small undead pet dragon Frosty, which will add to the large group of vanity pets already present in the game. Ultimately the contents are extremely attractive and if we consider that the very limited collector's versions (we are talking about just over 400 pieces throughout Italy) were booked for around 60 euros, the composition of the bundle is the most complete and advantageous we have ever seen in the last few years. We insert the installation DVD into our war PC, ready to guide us after about ten minutes of anxious waiting and a few brief update patches, in the territories of the enemy that many have been waiting for for years, the fallen prince Arthas Menethil. Winning game does not change That is: the practical demonstration of how it is possible to bring a brand to new levels of completeness through small and constant tweaks, rather than with upheavals typical of our local transformation. Levels, which between us, we thought we had already reached as regards the player versus environment content of the game. Yet the Blizzard machine is not tame, it never stops. There is always something to clean up, a lore to develop that will lead to a new and compelling storyline, a talent branch to overhaul to make a class more usable in its entirety, a piece of interface to soften, to ensure that the The use of the vehicle is even more intuitive. Ultimately, the premises for Wrath of the Lich King are to re-polish a concept which in itself already represented, as always asserted by insiders and non-experts, the peak of everything the sector has produced in the last 10 years. Having said that, it must be said that WotLK is not exclusively a finishing job. The contents, generous as always, represent hours of gameplay to be enjoyed in every pixel, starting from the 10 areas that make up the new continent north of Azeroth, the hunting ground for this further chapter of the saga. Frost, monsters and touches of class Northrend, ancient land of frozen peaks. The roof of the world, they call it the most. But for most of the Warcraftian fanbase, it remains the land of the Lich King. There were terrible battles here, which saw the victory of the first Lich King, Ner'zhul, over the arachnid people of the Nerubian and the creation of the ~Scourge~, the undead scourge responsible for the destruction of much of Lordaeron. Here, where dragons come to die in the Dragonblight, under the watchful eyes of the keeper Malygos. Here, where Illidan Stormrage and Arthas Menethil confronted each other and where the latter, victorious, merged his essence with Ner'zhul, becoming the second Lich King. This is the starting point. As anticipated in the September test, both for the horde and for the alliance there will be the possibility of starting the new path towards level 80 from two distinct starting points: Borean Tundra in the south-western end of the new continent and Howling Fjord in the southeast one, both reachable from Azeroth or Kalimdor. It is not difficult for us to understand the reasons for this double starting zone: with The Burning Crusade, especially the first few days, there was a massive assault on the only starting zone, Hellfire Penisula, which not only caused stability problems on occasion to some servers, but made it extremely difficult to carry out the quests, between constantly campered spots and players of the opposite faction to look after. And here's how you learn from your mistakes: two starting zones allow you to dilute the players and make the questing smoother, drastically reducing the big breaks due to the repop of some NPCs needed to complete the missions. The biodiversity of each environment immediately catches the eye, rendered with the same methodical care as always. In particular, in Borean Tundra it is possible to admire a series of different ecosystems, well blended along the entire extension of the gigantic map. As mentioned in the past, Northrend is about the same size, if not slightly larger, than Outland, but with some really large areas, encompassing three, if not four different flightpoints to assist you in getting around. And we can't help but dwell a little on the little visual miracle that continues to amaze us. There have been no revolutions in the technical part of the graphics engine, shadows aside. Frost, monsters and touches of class Yet it is impossible not to gape at the colossal landscapes of Northrend. The feeling that one gets, unlike many other products of the genre, in which the landscapes appear as random land masses, with a few trees, stones or mobs as a contour, is that nothing in Lich King is left to chance. From the abandoned shack on fire, to the hollow tree fallen along the river, used as a bridge, to the breathtaking view passing over the complex of Utghard Keep. Many have wondered how a game with an outdated graphics engine and few polygons thrown out can be visually satisfying. And the answer must be found in everything that can be admired right from the start of the game: the alchemy of colors, the search for detail, a streamlined and fluid graphics engine, which allows excellent levels of enjoyment even on older machines. We saw the excess in Age of Conan. We saw the compromise in Warhammer Online. But there is little to do: this is the umpteenth demonstration of how an adequate technique and an artistic sector of delirious skill manage to put the word game over on every consideration in the graphic merit. We believe, among other things, the choice of forcing players to go back to the ground, parking their flying mounts up to the highest levels of the expansion, the best possible, in order to enjoy all this show of lights, textures and sounds . Yes, because if the artistic imprint in the graphic sector amazes, the soundtrack enchants. Not only the violins and fanfares that rework the main theme for the third time, making it a point of reference in this four-year adventure. But each reason in the game represents a further extension of what the visual part has already transmitted, a continuum of sensations that make the immersion fairytale. During a test session we ventured into the Nexus, one of the first low-level instances that the expansion offers us. We were literally amazed. Among the timeless tunnels, the feeling that the soundtrack has given us, halfway between ambient chillout and sometimes visionary electronics, as if there were the best Jean Michelle Jarre set with his synthesizers among the ice of Coldarra, it is a partnership between the senses that is almost dreamlike in its completeness. Hats off to the best gaming artists of our time. A ship loaded with... Contents. They will result in lore always rising to the occasion for some. In about fifteen new instances for others to explore. In the inevitable and sometimes exasperated grinding of factions, money, new objects and ingredients for still others. The barber shop, flagship for those who consider fashion a priority. Who Said Inscription? How can we not talk about this new and very important work skill? Unlike many other products, as simple as WoW's crafting system is, it has never been left behind. Almost all job skills have been tuned to complement the development and enrichment of the character in the end game. Inscription is a further piece that will make your alter ego more unique, as well as powerful. Through this new skill and the production of special inks from the herbs already present in the game, it will be possible to create glyphs which, applied to our character, will modify a myriad of aspects of the skills. From the range of spells to damage, from cooldowns to substantial changes in the effect of styles, the possibility of inserting three major and three minor glyphs will make our character even more unique, depending on our game needs. Also note how Inscription will allow you to create parchments with buffs, but above all to make the enchantments of the Enchanting skill transportable, through the use of so-called vellums, portable containers, which will finally give the possibility of expanding the enchanting market and putting own productions at auction. But there are so many things to keep busy. And this time it's also certified! Anticipated with the Echoes of Doom patch, the systemof Achievement is one of the new features introduced to the game. Nothing innovative, mind you, especially for console owners or, by heart, for those who played City of Heroes or Star Wars Galaxies a few years ago. Nonetheless a pleasant addition. The completion of these objectives, which in some cases require medium to long-term planning, can provide prestigious rewards, such as titles, mounts or tabards. The over 500 Achievements entered will certainly provide another form of completion of the character's life and history, prompting players to put punctuation on their exploits, for personal taste or for boasting. A ship loaded with... And speaking of feats, we were also pleasantly surprised by the level of development that many quests have reached. Ok, there will always be the usual ~kill X~ or ~harvest Y~, but stories are always a great boredom deterrent, hilarious or epic as they are. Priceless moments, such as the documentary filmmaker dressed as a Murloc, which will elicit more than a smile. Overall, we appreciated the scripting work that has been done to many missions, making the unfolding of events and the stories related to them pulsating and more satisfying. To complete this vision, the phasing system enters WotLK. Simply put, this addition allows you to change parts of the map, terrain or backgrounds, so that they appear different only to players who have performed certain actions or businesses. If, for example, our character has completed a mission in which he had to burn a building, to us the building will appear as a charred ruin, while to those who still complete the mission it will appear as intact. The mechanics had already been introduced in part with the stealth or invisibility of wizards, however now it has been expanded to involve the game world, finally doing justice to the immersiveness. Another pleasant surprise will certainly be the part relating to the end game. The feedback sent for years by users regarding the impossibility, for most of the player base, to enjoy all the contents, reserved for numerous and extremely competitive guilds, have been of some use. The success of Kharazan, probably one of the best scripted instances of the entire game, convinced the developers to take half a step back. And so, all the instances of the final phase of the game will have both their share of 10 people and the raiding zone of 25. The latter will obviously give a greater number of rewards and probably, items being equal, those obtainable in raids they will be a little more powerful. But in this way it will certainly be possible to please both the casual players, eternally condemned to 5-point instances, and the power players, who will continue their advance towards the end game as before and more than before. Even this taboo towards the total enjoyment of the contents has fallen, the last obstacle is still missing in making everyone happy, as in a hippie community: the faction of PvP fundamentalists! Christmas barrel We'll be clear right away: what for many has always been WoW's Achilles heel hasn't undergone a sensational revamp. Also in this case the watchword remained ~targeted changes~. In particular, in addition to a new battleground (we are at five in four years, isn't it still a little?), mindful of the limited success that the integration of PvE and map PvP objectives had in the previous expansion, the most relevant change is was the introduction of an entire area completely dedicated to PvP and siege engines. But let's go in order. Strand of the Ancients will be the new battleground, designed for 15 players per side. Moving away from the classic ruleset that we have come to know, the two factions will clash over two game rounds, reversing the attack and defense, with the aim of conquering or defending some points on the map. The main novelty lies in the use of siege machines, which will help us destroy the 6 walls that separate us from the various map targets. Timing is key in this new battleground, as whoever takes the least time to conquer, with the same objectives, will be the winner of the map. For the moment, the information on Lake Wintergrasp, the new full PvP area, is more smoky. It should basically be a classic objective territory, with the ultimate goal being to capture and defend a central castle. Also in this case you will have the help of some war supplies, including gyrocopters, catapults and orc shredders. The possibility of having siege machines and buildings to destroy certainly represents the beginning of a new path, the one that many lovers", "date": "2008-11-26", "grade": null}
