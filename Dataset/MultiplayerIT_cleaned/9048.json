It's a game of manual skill that some developers have even been able to translate into decent quality video games, and which certainly served as a source of inspiration for the guys at Adult Swim for the creation of Monsters Ate My Condo. In this particular action puzzle, in fact, we will find ourselves lining up colored apartments, thus forming a condominium of variable dimensions, and we will have to be careful to ~parade~ from time to time the rooms that can help us get bonuses and keep the energy of our beloved giant monsters. Yes, you read that right: giant monsters. In a context that also involves four huge cousins of Godzilla, the extraction of the apartments will turn into a sort of Christmas lunch for these greedy creatures of houses (and people!), and the only way to lengthen the game the most possible will be to make the monsters swallow apartments of their own color, or line up three or more of the same shade so that they can be eliminated and the tower that has been created in the meantime thinned out. Watch out though: if an apartment ends up on the ground, it will be game over. How scared it makes me There are four giant monsters that will keep us company during each game, to be faced in the ~endless~ or ~time attack~ mode. The latter is unlocked after reaching a certain score and sets even more rigid rules within what, however, always remains a ~survival~ type structure. We were talking about monsters: the first is Boat Head, a small crab that has become enormous following exposure to some radioactive agents. Its name comes from the ship that got stuck on top of its head, and its special power is related to slowing down time. The second monster is Reginald Starfire, a kind of wacky, gigantic unicorn with a past as a frontman in an 80s boyband. Its special power is called ~solid tower~ and precisely prevents the tower formed by the apartments from tilting as long as it is active, allowing us to carry out all the ~extraction~ we want without any risk. Then we have Mr. Shigoto, a former Japanese businessman transformed into a huge green creature, with a penchant for typical Bavarian costumes, whose special power consists in amplifying the effectiveness of combos. And finally there is Lord Ferocious, apparently a harmless little dog but controls a fearsome giant robot. His special power multiplies the points scored while active by ten. While apartments of four different colors fall from above, our aim is therefore to pair those of the same shade in groups of three to five and thus score a mountain of points. The two monsters that accompany the action can be fed by extracting the ~bricks~ that make up the central tower, an operation that allows us not only to pair the apartments to be eliminated, but also to keep their respective energy bars high. Each combo produces the arrival of a bonus which, fed to the monsters, activates their special powers. The gameplay of Monsters Ate My Condo is therefore confirmed to be very simple and immediate, while boasting a series of facets linked to the peculiar abilities of giant creatures, and is accompanied by a technical sector that is perfectly suited to the situation, thanks to the very colorful and nice graphics and the curious pseudo-Japanese-style music.
