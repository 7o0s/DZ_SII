{"name": "GrimGrimoire - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grimgrimoire-recensione.html", "text": "In a short time each map becomes a mix of two-dimensional sprites who fight each other ferociously... Lillet Blan and the Grimoires of Power The story of GrimGrimoire develops between one battle and another through a series of written and spoken dialogues involving the various inhabitants of the Academy, represented through splendid artwork. If the first internships turn out to be simple training aimed at instructing Lillet in the use of magic, from the very first time the five days are relived things get complicated both narratively and playfully. GrimGrimoire, moreover, is a real-time strategy game, and if it weren't complicated it would be decidedly boring: fortunately, both the gameplay and the story are really interesting, even if a bit chaotic. Essentially, in GrimGrimoire there are three types of magic: Glamour, Necromancery and Sorcery, and each is effective against another but weaker than the rest, in a sort of scissors, paper and stone. For each type there are various grimoires, which allow you to summon supernatural creatures and cast particular spells with which Lillet will be able to keep the forces of evil at bay: in general, the various battles require in fact to destroy all our opponents or protect someone, keeping intact our Rune, basically our base. However, in order to practice the various spells Lillet will need Mana, which he will be able to scrape together by sending his weakest troops to the crystals around the play area, practically the most basic action that allows us to obtain the resources necessary to carry continue the fight. As the Mana accumulates and as time passes, each battle will become increasingly hectic and frenetic: with a few simple commands we will be able to create new attack or defense troops, send them individually or in groups towards enemies or to protect our farmers of Mana, and use the various spells available to increase our chances of victory or survival. In a short time each map becomes a mix of beautifully drawn and animated two-dimensional sprites frantically fighting each other, and the player will have to think quickly: it is better to send our fairies against the imps, or perhaps it is the case to create ghostly knights, immune to physical attacks? This kind of questions becomes more and more numerous in a short time, and as in any good self-respecting RTS, the speed of our decisions and the ability to judge will be the key to victory, especially in the ~Trial~ mode which joins the ~ Story Mode~ more classic offering the player various increasingly complex and elaborate stages and with a vaguely puzzle spirit. It must be said, however, GrimGrimoire manages to be frustrating in the advanced stages, despite the simplicity and immediacy of its gameplay, above all due to the very slow initial stages of the fights and their disproportionate length, combined with the impossibility of saving during the fight, huge defect of a game in which a battle can stall and last even an hour, even if that hour will be decidedly spectacular and surprising, especially when the biggest and most powerful creatures enter the scene, equipped with attacks as spectacular as destructive. Lillet Blan and the Enchanting Sprites ~Enchanting~ is definitely the right word to express the quality of the two-dimensional sprites created by the Vanillaware graphics. In addition to the cartoonish and decidedly Japanese style, the various creatures that will face each other in battle show a delightful chromatic choice, thanks to the pastel shades, and an impressive fluidity in the animations: the most complex battles almost look like a cartoon or, better, a book of fairy tales come to life. Each fight is seasoned with numerous luminous and particle effects that enrich the visual show, making it more elaborate and captivating, especially in the case of the more choreographic attacks: between flame-breathing dragons who climb up the castle stairs and ghostly knights who engage in furious battles with fiery demons, there really is to be surprised. The low variety of battlefields is a bit disappointing, indeed a handful of screens, static although decidedly detailed, while the care taken in the creation of the interlude screens or the various menus, simple and elegant, is remarkable. On the sound side, in addition to the now usual option for the selection of Japanese audio, GrimGrimoire still offers a good dubbing and an apt choice of actors, and above all a soundtrack that is never annoying and always rather in theme with the action: when a battle may force you to concentrate for an hour or more, music tracks must never be irritating, and althoughetitives those of GrimGrimoire succeed in the enterprise without infamy or praise. The Nippon Ichi continues its march undaunted in the now waning PlayStation 2, once again giving us a high quality product that will surely delight RTS lovers, a rather fugitive genre in the toy library of the second Sony console. Although frustrating in the more advanced stages, and with an excessive length of battles at times - further penalized by the impossibility of saving during combat, GrimGrimoire is a strategy game with a rather original and intriguing plot, enhanced by simple but well thought out mechanics, and by a truly splendid two-dimensional visual realization. Recommended for all fans of the genre, a must try for all others. Pros Excellent 2D Well crafted gameplay Complex and addictive Cons Sometimes too difficult and frustrating Fight length unbalanced Impossible to save during fights GrimGrimoire is available for PlayStation 2. Time travel is an idea that has always fascinated everyone. There are those who have fantasized about Michael J. Fox's De Lorean for days, those who have read and re-read H. G. Wells novels, there is Bill Murray who constantly spends Groundhog Day, and then there is Lillet Blan who continues to reliving his first five days at Hogw School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--- er, the Silver Star Tower Academy of Magic. The new NiS effort developed by Vanillaware draws heavily on the world created by JK Rowling: there is a school of magic populated by bizarre creatures (including a leonine professor and various ghosts), there are teachers who train their students at 'use of magic (including Headmaster Gammel Dore, a very successful quote from Albus Dumbledore) and of course there is a bad guy who wants to kill everyone and who, indeed, succeeds. In fact, on the fifth day of school, the perfidious Volde--- um, Archmage Calvarous manages to free himself from the imprisonment imposed on him by the Headmaster and practically exterminates everyone... apart from Lillet. Our heroine thus decides to use magic to go back in time: by reliving the first five days of school as much as possible, she will perhaps be able to become powerful enough to hinder and defeat the evil Archmage when he attacks the school on the fifth day. And you will be at the forefront of the deadly battle that awaits Harry Pot--- um, Lillet Blan.", "date": "2007-11-07", "grade": null}
