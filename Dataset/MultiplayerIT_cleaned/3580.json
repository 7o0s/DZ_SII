{"name": "Wolfenstein: Youngblood", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wolfenstein-youngblood-recensione.html", "text": "Wolfenstein: Youngblood, played on PC for this review, presents itself as a sort of spin-off of the Bethesda series set in an alternate 1980, with some parts of the world still under the control of the Nazi army despite the defeats inflicted on the Germans by B.J. Blazkowicz and his allies during the 1960s. If in The Old Blood we found ourselves revisiting past events, specifically Blazko's experience with the Second World War campaigns, flavored with a pinch of supernatural elements, in this new project signed by the guys from MachineGames, joined for the occasion from Arkane Studios, the opposite occurs: the two twin daughters of the valiant American fighter, Jess and Soph, raised as infallible warriors but still young girls in the soul, find themselves having to face a situation bigger than them when their father disappears mysteriously, without a trace. Together with Abby, the brilliant daughter of Grace Walker (whom we had met in The New Colossus and who over time made her way, becoming director of the FBI), the two discover some clues that lead to Paris, one of the capitals still under control of the Nazi army. So the sisters decide to make a difference: they secretly climb with Abby on Grace's helicopter and head to France, donning two powerful Da'at Yichud armor and preparing to hunt down the Nazis... this time for real. Cooperative experience Wolfenstein: Youngblood introduces a cooperative mode for the first time in the franchise: the entire campaign is faced by the couple formed by Jess and Soph, and it is possible to choose whether to play offline (delegating the control of one's partner to the artificial intelligence) or online, by hosting a match that is private or open to any participant under a drop-in / drop-out system, or by joining someone else's match. The difference obviously lies in the progression: if we host the action it will be based on our progress between the missions and not someone else's, in the latter case exposing us to a fair risk of spoilers. However, completed missions are stored on both saves, including those not yet unlocked. Getting organized with a friend is clearly the best option, and Bethesda has seen fit to favor it by introducing the interesting Buddy Pass, included in the Deluxe Edition of the game for just 10 euros more, which brings the price up from 29.99 euros by default at 39.99 euros. This is a feature that allows two to play with a single copy of the title in a nutshell: the owner can invite anyone to face the campaign with him, provided he does so with only one person at a time. The only limit of this gimmick is the fact that, on consoles, those who participate without owning the game will be able to complete all the missions together with their friend but will not unlock any achievements. As in the best-known cooperative multiplayer-based productions, the two protagonists often have to interact to open doors and activate switches together, but it is above all in the context of combat that their collaboration takes shape. By tackling the missions with a friend, you can coordinate to silently eliminate some guards and avoid having all the Nazi soldiers on you, manage the boss fights while keeping your distance from the enemy, find ammunition and resources (which remain available to both, we don't have them is stolen), and so on. The Blazkowicz sisters are endowed with independent energy, but share three lives: when one of them is knocked down, the other must quickly reach and rescue her, or else lose a life. Where the situation is complicated, one can choose to deliberately sacrifice one of the three possibilities to quickly get back into the game and help one's partner, but be careful: there are times when game over is punished with a certain severity, referring us to the beginning of perhaps a particularly multifaceted and complex mission. Gameplay and structure The formula used so far by MachineGames for the Wolfenstein series is quite simple: use cinematic cutscenes narrated in an amazing way to glue traditional shooter missions, in which you move within generally linear scenarios, following a path dotted with man hand from tougher enemies and possibly from bosses. The system is reproposed for Youngblood, but with a couple of important innovations: the quality of the narrative sector remains very high, even if it does not reach the peaks of The New Order and The New Colossus also due to a pure and simple matter of charisma, but the introduction of cooperative mechanics and especially the level design realizedcreated in collaboration with Arkane Studios significantly change the face of the experience. During the campaign you find yourself visiting basically four areas of Paris, each divided into two or three districts, to which are added the Catacombs which act as a base for the French resistance and as a hub for accessing assignments, with the usual expedient of interacting with the various characters to unlock new side quests. However, the approach to the scenarios recalls the episodes of Dishonored rather than the previous chapters of Wolfenstein: there is an unprecedented verticality, also promoted by the ability of the protagonists to perform a double jump, which allows for example to get on a truck, from there reach a balcony and enter a building to find an alternate route; or explore the surroundings in search of an alley, a hidden passage that takes us to a secret area, such as the sewers. The 80s are not as valued as we would have expected from the point of view of pop culture in a Nazi key, except in the form of unlockables such as audio cassettes and film covers, but the settings know their stuff and present themselves as a further extended version and embellished by the Roswell of The New Colossus, filled with detail and featuring remarkable architecture. It is a pity that certain details make one turn up one's nose (see the obviously fake reflections on the windows: it would have been enough to put more relevant cubemaps to avoid blundering), but the lighting system enhances the landscapes and buildings well, giving depth to the scenario without never arouse a sense of flatness. The developers have worked a lot on the maps also because you find yourself visiting them over and over again during the campaign: in the context of secondary assignments it is completely normal, but once the secrets and gimmicks of the level design have been exhausted, the backtracking begins to weigh a little. Yet it is often impossible to escape them: although they are immediately accessible, the final missions require skills that must be unlocked using experience points and money, going to enhance the physical characteristics of Jess and Soph, adding new maneuvers to their repertoire and improving the weapons that make up their arsenal, again not very numerous (a pistol, two machine guns, a shotgun, a carbine and a set of special cannons) but endowed with a precise personality and well managed in terms of ammunition: it will happen that you find yourself short of bullets and this will force you to use all the tools available, without exception. However, considering the price of the game and the duration of the story mode, which we completed in about ten hours by proceeding straight and completing only a few side quests (just 18% of the total), this type of solution fits us widely. Technical realization Those who feared that the aesthetics of the 80s, albeit in an alternative-Nazi version, could monopolize the graphic style of Wolfenstein: Youngblood can breathe a sigh of relief: the references to those years are few and the feeling is that one could find in any period, which however cannot be considered a merit. Fortunately, this is one of the few blunders of an irreproachable artistic direction: if in the traditional metal bases the atmospheres of the series remain the same as always, the urban settings have a lot to say in terms of architecture, detail and level design in general, given the 'unprecedented verticality and the presence of passages, alleys, hidden areas, interiors that can be visited and so on. Thanks to an excellent lighting system, which is reflected on the objects, enhancing them and never flattening them, there are moments of the campaign that are visually of great impact. It is clear, it would have been nice to have a greater number of different locations available and perhaps some clearer references to the attractions of Paris, which are not received without adequate narrative justification, but in principle the development team has done a lot and filled the experience with content, crafting a much more substantial structure than one would imagine for a base price of just 29.99. In short, great protagonist locations of Youngblood, but the characters? The quality of the narration of the cinematic sequences is excellent once again, with very engaging moments and gimmicks that always manage to elicit a laugh, but the pure realization of the cutscenes shines less than in the past, especially in the final stages. Soph is a nice character, Jess appears less successful due to the hairstyle, in-game the quality of the polygonal models is good but far from that of the best videogame productions, still linked to a conception that feels the weightor years. A fair amount of variety has been done as regards the enemies, although their artificial intelligence often does not shine (they can be bypassed and surprised without major problems, for example), while an old problem concerning the bosses arises again: they are all very similar to each other and it's a shame. The soundtrack is excellent but not the best ever for the series, the sound effects have the impact one would expect from those weapons and explosions, and finally the Italian dubbing is once again very well done, with interpretations convincing from the entire cast. The PC version with the latest NVIDIA drivers looks extraordinarily well optimised, running at 2160p and 60 frames per second with all settings maxed out and v-sync engaged on the test configuration. A test of strength for the id Tech 6, which is confirmed to be perfectly scalable on any hardware, given the abundance of adjustments and the inclusion of a dynamic scaler that keeps performance stable by changing the resolution depending on the load but leaving the resolution intact.
