Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. After the excellent free running game Subway Runners, the guys at Kiloo Games are back on the App Store with a new, fun production... once again at no cost! We're talking about Frisbee Forever 2, the second episode of an action series that starts from a very simple basic idea: put yourself at the controls of a Frisbee through increasingly more complex paths full of obstacles. The gameplay, as it is easy to imagine, is very simple and uses a choice of touch or accelerometer-based control system. In the first case you simply have to press the right or left part of the touch screen to tilt the frisbee accordingly and therefore make it follow the trajectory we want; in the second case this operation is performed by tilting the device, even if we had the clear impression that in this way the precision necessary to complete the medium and high difficulty levels is lacking. The game structure starts from a traditional ~rewards~ system, with our performance being evaluated at the end of each stage based on the stars collected, assigning us a gold, silver or bronze medal and a certain number of coins. The latter must be used to ~purchase~ the following areas, for a total of eight scenarios each consisting of ten missions. We start from the windmills of Meadowland to move on to the sighting lighthouses of Viewpoint Hill, from the oriental atmospheres of Dragon Sea to the snowy expanses of Cloudy Cliffs, concluding the journey among the statues of Rio Grande and the ruins of The Lost City. In addition to these locations there is also the nice Bonus World and the Gift World, both regulated by particular dynamics that allow us to obtain interesting extras. And speaking of extras, always using the coins we will be able to unlock new types of Frisbee. Fly fly fly fly fly Maya the Bee Given that the mechanics and controls of Frisbee Forever 2 are extremely simple, it is clear that the thickness of the game is provided by the surrounding elements, in this case the conformation of the scenarios. At the beginning of each stage, we give our Frisbee the push necessary to cover a certain distance, but we have to go through particular circles or go along ~acceleration ramps~ for the disc to keep floating in the air until it reaches the finish line. Sometimes the route is deliberately rendered in a confusing way to make us lose orientation and therefore end the momentum prematurely, while in other cases the pitfalls are represented by strong air currents that push us out of the ideal line, or by sections in which it is necessary go through bottlenecks and therefore there is the risk of crashing into a wall and thus ending your journey. The variations on the theme are numerous and accord with the nature of the locations, legitimizing their functions as well as their appearance. In the more advanced levels there is a bit of ~trial and error~, more than normal considering that the paths become more complex and you have to try to memorize them to collect as many stars as possible without losing sight of the main trajectory. All this is accompanied by a well-made technical sector: the polygonal graphics flow smoothly and without uncertainties, showing us an alternation of colorful and convincing landscapes, while a soundtrack based on acoustic guitar effectively accompanies the action.", "date": "2012-09-08", "grade": "8.1"}
