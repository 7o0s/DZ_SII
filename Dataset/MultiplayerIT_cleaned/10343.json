After admiring Princess Crown and Odin Sphere, many will have thought about how nice it would have been to see the skilled Japanese scribes at work on a subject more similar to their culture, and almost to please everyone, this Muramasa has arrived: The Sword Demonic. Action game with an ancient taste but with an excellent technique, this new title aims to rehabilitate the structure and the typical 2D representation of cornerstones such as Castlevania and Metroid within the current market, where similar products are often relegated to alternative operations in digital delivery or similar, and he succeeds in large part thanks also to his particular aspect which contributes to characterizing his charisma. It is true that after the initial marvel in front of the graphics, the structural defects tend to emerge, but dwelling excessively on the half-empty glass can make us lose sight of the overall value of this new Vanillaware production: an action, platform and exploration game that takes us back to the glories of the bitmap era and the scrolling action of the 90s, of which this Muramasa could represent the evolution and updating in line with the new awareness of the expressive potential of the video game. Of course, a better balance between the glories of the graphics sector and the actual fun resulting from the gameplay would have been desirable, which is why Muramasa certainly does not present itself as a masterpiece but ~only~ as a good action title that has the merit to refer - something that has become uncommon - to a not necessarily casual audience. Two stories in one A large part of Muramasa's charm lies in its particular historical and stylistic location. Taking up various cues from classical Japanese culture - monogatari games, kabuki theatre, classical legends - the story stages a canvas that touches on various topical figures in the repertoire, telling two different stories that intersect, covering the same scenarios (for the most part) in a different order, told through a slow and reflective rhythmic cadence, almost theatrical even in its affectation. On the one hand there is Momohime, a princess possessed by the spirit of a ferocious swordsman and therefore forced to pursue his designs for revenge and his thirst for blood, despite her pretty appearance, on the other there is Kisuke, a young warrior on the run who has lost his memory and only remembers having to retrieve a sword. Everything is grafted into medieval Japan of the Genroku era, in the period in which the shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi sets the entire archipelago on fire for his thirst for power. The battles that ensue involve a vast use of ever more powerful swords, so as to awaken and lead to the earth gods and demons from the afterlife. The gaming experience does not substantially change in the choice between the two fighters, but we are witnessing significantly different stories that also lead to different clashes, in particular as regards the spectacular bosses, focal points of the plots. The possibility of going through the game through two different points of view is to the full advantage of longevity, which settles in total just over 10 hours of play, a good amount for a purely action title. The swords that can be used for each character and their relative evolutions, which determine different powers and techniques, are also different from each other. Demon swords The katana represent the central element of the game: the protagonists can equip three of them at a time and switch from one to the other at any time, but the total number of usable swords is around a hundred. In addition to those conquered by defeating the bosses, it is possible to forge a large number of them in the appropriate section, following a tree diagram that represents the evolution of weapons towards higher levels. To unlock a new weapon, it is also necessary to meet certain spirit, strength and vitality requirements of the character that can allow it to be used. There are also three standard types of katana: the medium one, the small and fast one and the long, slow and powerful one. Old time action We therefore find ourselves exploring a vast world entirely made in 2D, scrolling through sequential screens with occasional crossroads, trying to achieve the various progressive objectives. The structure of the levels is reminiscent of that of the aforementioned Castlevania or Metroid: instead of proposing closed and separate sections from each other, the levels are freely explorable once the barriers are opened.and enclose them, forcing frequent consultation of the map and also a lot of backtracking. Basically, what is required of the player is to reach various points of interest to carry on the plot, almost always corresponding to cutscenes and fights with huge bosses: once these are beaten, increasingly powerful swords are obtained capable of destroying barriers of various color that block access to various sections of the map, gradually expanding the breadth of the explorable world. The relative emptiness of the wonderful environments and the total lack of puzzles or secondary quests to complete (apart from the alternative levels entirely focused on the clashes) determine a certain flatness in the exploration, badly supported by the absence of a valid movement system rapid and by a structurally inaccurate level design, which often forces you to grind kilometers in empty backtracking, saved in part by the beauty of the screens. The properly action component is focused on clashes with white weapons: with the katana it is possible to hit enemies, parry opponents' blows, repel throwing weapons and perform different special techniques for each sword. While the minor difficulty level does not propose dynamics that are too different from the frantic pressing of the attack button, the difficult mode forces a more reasoned approach: the use of the parry is mandatory and particular attention should be paid to the energy of the sword, which leads to the frequent change between the three katanas equippable at a time. In fact, swords wear out and finally break, except to regenerate inside the sheath, which determines the need not to abuse a single blade, but rather to switch from one to the other on the fly (the sheath in combat also represents a technique in itself, which hits all on-screen enemies at once). To fully enjoy what the game has to offer in terms of challenge, therefore, it is highly recommended to play it on the highest difficulty level. There are also small ~role-playing~ hints, limited to the evolution of the characters' vitality, strength and spirit statistics which grow together with the level of experience and allow the use of ever more powerful swords. Muramasa: The Demon Sword - Video review Muramasa: The Demon Sword | Watch all videos | See all images Classic control Muramasa allows the use of the classic controller, the Gamecube controller or the Remote Control with Nunchuck, but does not have any implementation related to motion sensors. Also in this sense, it is a deeply classic game, in which we use the stick to move the character (run and jump), a button to attack and parry (several shots can be performed by combining the pressure of the button with the directions of the stick), a key for the sword's special ability and one for switching weapons on the fly, as well as the d-pad used to select and consume healing items. Interactive painting Just look at a few images to understand the effect that Muramasa has on the player: the graphics entirely drawn in 2D are simply beautiful and the classic style adopted increases the wonder factor. The woods, the countryside and the cities are completely similar to interactive paintings inspired by classical Japanese painting with the subdivision into screens which, moreover, recalls the panel and scroll structure typical of the Yamato-e and Emakimono narrative-painting. The bright colors and the small animated details repay the eye so much as to make the curiosity to see the new scenarios the real engine that drives us to continue in the game, as well as the element that saves us from boredom in the long backtracking phases. The character sprites are also well drawn and animated, always characterized by the particular style adopted which makes them grotesque in some cases, sinuous or terrifying in others but never banal. There is a necessary recycling of elements as regards scenarios and characters, with identical models reproposed perhaps with chromatic differences or slight modifications - this too is a typical solution of the old 2D videogame school - but the result is never unpleasant and what appears on the screen is always a feast for the eyes. Always in line with the great aesthetic care are the interlude moments that amplify the ability to immerse yourself in the general atmosphere of the game: when you arrive in the villages and cities it is possible to visit inns or shops where you can buy some typical food of Japanese cuisine, complete with a careful ~subjective~ representation of the dish to be eaten, or in some cases a little monkey can accompany us towards a thermal springdungeon in which to regain strength; they are small touches that denote the great care placed in the aesthetic component of the game. The same care can be found in the audio sector, which musically mixes pieces with a Japanese-classical taste with modern and disruptive elements to better underline the most eventful moments, remaining in any case as an organic whole, supported by themed sound effects and dialogues suitably spoken in Japanese, to keep the typical atmosphere intact.", "date": "2009-12-02", "grade": "8.5"}
