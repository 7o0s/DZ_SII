{"name": "Chronos: Before the Ashes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chronos-before-the-ashes-recensione.html", "text": "With the review of Chronos: Before the Ashes, exceptionally, you can return to the splendid and very disturbing world of Remnant: From the Ashes. Once again Gunfire Games is involved, it is clear: in the summer of 2019 Remnant arrived on consoles and PCs, immediately capturing the attention of the public; it was an action RPG with very clear (and effective) soulslike ideas. The story of Chronos: Before the Ashes is tied to that of Remnant, but it is curious. Now, this video game has already been released in 2016, strictly exclusively for devices related to virtual reality. Thanks to the ~success~ of Remnant, Gunfire Games has seen fit to re-propose it in a version that no longer needs VR, available from December 1, 2020 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. How did it go? Not very well, but the title is still very interesting for fans, both of the genre to which it belongs and of the franchise in particular. We explain why. The plot If you read the review of Remnant: From the Ashes at the time, you probably already know that the plot - intricate, never perfectly clear, indeed very cryptic - represents one of the most fascinating aspects of Gunfire Games' production. It goes without saying, therefore, that fans cannot miss Chronos: Before the Ashes, even beyond all its defects, which are not few. In fact, the lore of Remnant is directly linked to the prequel (it is natural) and both productions enrich each other. We will try to explain why, without running into easy spoilers. The world, in Chronos: Before the Ashes, is already ending, and the portals between the realms have been discovered, via the red stones. A brave warrior embarks on his mission in the Labyrinth, intending to face and defeat the Dragon. No Root, therefore, for the moment: their corruption will come later. The context is also much less science fiction (albeit with some incursions) and mainly fantasy. But it is still a very inspired setting, and treated in detail by the touch of Gunfire. You will then adore again all the atmospheres, worlds, and places visited. And probably, at the end of the narrative and after having collected all the documents and collectibles present, you will know even more about the lore. It is interesting to note the presence of both new creatures and ~uncontaminated by Root~ versions of some of those that appeared in Remnant. The gameplay: fighting makes you old The gameplay of Chronos: Before the Ashes alternates extremely interesting ideas with milder and less well-finished mechanics: a mix that does not always work, and which keeps the player's attention and interest only for a certain number of hours. Overall, we feel the nature of a production born on VR and designed for VR, then adapted by necessity to a completely different use. So let's start from the most innovative idea: in this production, you get old by fighting. Every time the player dies (and he will die several times, because also in this case the action RPG mechanics meet the soulslike ones) he sees his age increase by one year. The adventure begins with the hero being 18 years old, and will conclude with well, probably old age, if not directly close to actual seniority. Growing up (and getting old) means unlocking some bonuses, but also penalties. Every ten years, for example, a passive bonus of the player's choice is activated: more health forever, more experience points after each elimination, overall better weapons, and so on. At the same time the statistics change. For example, getting older means being affected by attack and defense parameters. At the same time the arcane skills become more efficient, with a predilection for magic. The style of play therefore adapts to the years spent in the Labyrinth, marked by the various deaths of the player. To keep the gameplay unchanged, in a certain sense, it is appropriate to die little. Playstation 4 trophies Obtaining all the trophies of Chronos: Before the Ashes will not be easy, because you will have to explore all the possibilities offered by the title - including fights, collectibles and puzzles. However, you will also be rewarded with the coveted Platinum Trophy. Pay attention to the level of difficulty, definitely not within the reach of every player; as well as the genre, for that matter, which could welcome you very brutally. Weapons and combat Chronos: Before the Ashes' weapons and combat are extremely basic. The hero wields a one-handed weapon (simple sword, axe, scythe): the attack parameters and the offensive slightly change, but nothing that can really change a style of play all in all.to quick attack and instant dodge. The other hand holds the shield with which they parry, deflect and interrupt enemy attacks. The player can take advantage of the light attack and the charged one, alternating them with defense and parries. Nothing incredibly deep here either, but the combat-related mechanics work quite well. The fact is that it all ends here, there is little else: we are far from the depth and tactics of Remnant. The weapons can be upgraded, but without great possibilities; moreover, their variety is at an all-time low. As you level up you can spend points to increase your stats. At most, from time to time charged attacks and some bonuses use magic, which can never be used for ranged attacks anyway, because they don't exist. In short, you must like close combat, and its very bland typology: the enemy movesets are basic, the hero's possibilities are equally meager.", "date": "2020-12-06", "grade": "6.5"}
