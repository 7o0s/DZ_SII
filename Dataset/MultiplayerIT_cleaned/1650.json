Rygar: The Legendary Adventure, keeping true to its origins, presents itself as a pure action game, without even too many narrative frills. The story that forms the backdrop to the Tecmo product is indeed rather banal, but it still performs its duty in the economy of a title that certainly does not have its strong point in the thickness of the plot. The user therefore plays the role of Rygar, a powerful gladiator of the pseudo-Hellenic realm of Argus, who is forced to have to save his beloved princess from the clutches of the Titans, evil semi-divine creatures guilty of the ruin of the country itself. It goes without saying that in the course of history our hero will discover that he is the classic ~chosen one~ in whose hands the future of his people lies, and so on. In short, all things already seen. Fortunately, however, on a purely playful level Rygar proves to be decidedly more valid and original than the storyline on which it is based. This mainly thanks to the peculiar weapon with which the protagonist is equipped and to the multiple uses of the same: it is the so-called Diskarmor, a name that alone already highlights the double nature (attack/defense) of the instrument. Physically, the Diskarmor looks like a round shield (which it actually also performs the functions of) with decidedly sharp edges, equipped with a chain that allows Rygar to throw it at enemies. Over the course of the game, the user will come to obtain three different types of Diskarmor, which in addition to differing in range and power, each boast a different series of moves that can be performed via combos of the two attack buttons, as well as a peculiar evocation (moreover with an all in all reduced offensive potential). The player can switch from one Diskarmor to another at any time by pressing the R2 and L2 keys, thus being able to take advantage of their different characteristics depending on the situation: a pity that the low level of difficulty of the game does little justice to this operation , rarely essential to be able to continue. Nonetheless, Rygar, by virtue of the well thought-out combat system, immediately reveals itself to be a decidedly fun title, capable of maintaining a strong link with the original coin-op (in terms of setting, storyline and partly even the scheme of game) but at the same time presenting itself in an attractive guise even for younger users. The Devil May Cry style adopted by the developers undoubtedly contributes to this, with a dynamic camera system, made up of still and moving shots, and gameplay focused on action and the composition of combos. Take the art and split it into parts As mentioned, Rygar is set in a land very similar to ancient Greece, which the developers of Tecmo have been able to recreate on the screen with great effectiveness: the cosmetics of the title are in fact of an excellent level, especially as regards precisely the various scenarios that form the backdrop to the adventure. Colosseums, temples, ancient ruins and ruined towns are just some of the fascinating settings of Rygar, often embellished with decorative elements such as statues, urns and so on. In a possible attempt to foment artistic vandalism, however, the developers have made it possible to destroy most of the elements of the scenario, which collapse under the blows of the trusty Diskarmor often with truly massive consequences: such a destructive work, however, serves the noble purpose to reveal various power-ups and bonuses, capable of increasing the abilities of Rygar and his weapons (in a similar upgrade system - coincidentally - to what was seen in Devil May Cry). However, the considerable care taken in the creation of the scenarios is contrasted by a certain lightness in the polygonal modeling of some characters and in some of the protagonist's animations, defects which however do not significantly undermine the overall quality of the whole. An aspect of Rygar absolutely devoid of negative notes (it is appropriate to say it) is instead the exceptional musical accompaniment, composed of epic instrumental pieces performed by none other than the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra. The sound effects stand at discrete levels, while the dubbing (in English) fails in the slightest to give pathos to characters that are already not very charismatic and tend to be mono-expressive in themselves. Comment Rygar: The Legendary Adventure is a deliberately classic and slightly old-fashioned action game in its fundamental structure: if it is true in fact that the Tecmo title presents an absolutelyavant-garde, however the game scheme undoubtedly suffers from the link with the original 80s coin-op. As a result, Rygar is a game almost entirely devoted to action and combat, the depth of which does not go beyond the commitment necessary to execute the various combos. It goes without saying that such a game structure brings with it strengths and weaknesses: Rygar is therefore a product with an indisputable fun factor, but which suffers from its own intrinsic simplicity, proving to be rather repetitive in the long run, also due to a level of difficulty really too low. Pros: High-level graphic design Exceptional musical accompaniment Immediate and fun gameplay Cons: Repetitive game pattern Excessively low difficulty level Trivial storyline and not very charismatic characters For the ~sometimes they come back~ series, Tecmo has well thought of dusting off one of its old glories and reproposing it, in a version obviously in step with the times, to the always hungry PlayStation 2 user. It is therefore with a mixture of curiosity and healthy skepticism that the gaming community has welcomed the arrival of this Rygar: The Legendary Adventure, divided between the absolute willingness to relive a classic of the good years that were and the inevitable aura of pessimism fomented by some illustrious past failures.
