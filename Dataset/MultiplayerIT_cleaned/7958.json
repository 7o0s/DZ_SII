Keeping this jumble of genres together is Heavy Metal. Perhaps the less informed will be wondering why a title that is now four years old is once again being talked about: simply finally Double Fine has had the opportunity to prepare a conversion of its Brutal Legend for our dear PCs, released through Steam. Tim Schafer's mixtape As anticipated in the introductory hat, Brutal Legend is one of those very difficult titles to classify, products that on paper would seem to have neither rhyme or reason, yet for some magical reason they manage to stay together and fascinate their own audience. The merit is undoubtedly of the two minds behind the work, who with their humor and charisma have given life to a game that is fun only by adding up its individual parts, otherwise rather tasteless. As described in detail in the review by our Matteo Santicchia, the adventure tells the story of a roadie devoted to the religion of Metal, the real one and far from the watered down music that the majors have been proposing to us in recent years. Although his work is far from appreciated, he is a man devoted to his commitment, so much so that he died for it, sacrificing himself on stage during the last show. However, Eddie's journey has just begun, as he will awaken in a world parallel to ours, populated by creatures that seem to come from the best covers of Iron Maiden and company. A land subjugated by an evil one, while our protagonist, shouldering an ax and a magical guitar, will play the part of the predestined savior. However, the real highlight of Brutal Legend is not the gameplay, but the artistic direction and the hilarious curtains. And if you know and love classic Metal, the one that is said to be dead, then you will find yourself right at home. We embrace Ax and Guitar The PC version of Brutal Legend does not report any changes, proposing itself as an adaptation practically identical to the original, without even adding content, except for the inclusion of the two DLCs. So you will begin your adventure by learning the basic combos that characterize the action component, with Eddie making his way through enemies by swinging his ax and unleashing lightning emanating from his guitar. Soon you will have the opportunity to free some Headbangers, subjects all muscles and little brain, capable practically only of moving their heads up and down. What could be done to children in these conditions? But obviously make them fall in love with Metal! So they will follow Eddie in his adventures, being ordered what to do and where to go with simple commands. Starting from here, the title builds up an elementary real-time strategy structure that will immediately appear very simplified to a PC user, partly due to precise design choices (Tim Schafer was certainly not trying to create a Starcraft with a Metallara setting!) and in partly due to the control system. The pad has forced the developers to eliminate any frills, limiting control over the units to a few commands. The transition to the PC version has not helped in the slightest and indeed, the title, although it also works with a mouse and keyboard, cannot hide its origins. In short, a good gamepad remains the best choice. Quick adaptation Same contents and same gameplay, therefore; Tim Schafer and associates have certainly not spent sleepless nights trying to give PC users a dedicated product. Fortunately, the graphics sector can boast some tricks, however. We're talking about small details which, however, enrich the Brutal Legend's certainly rewarding aesthetics. We don't have the latest technology in our hands, but rather a solid product, refined in a somewhat cartoon style, which can boast characters modeled and animated in a truly appreciable way. The scenarios then enjoyed a slight tweak, complete with an expanded horizon line thanks to the computing power made available by our hardware. Also noteworthy are some new effects, such as Depth of Field, SSAO and Anti Aliasig. The settings are very limited, but the good optimization allows you to run the title on practically any configuration. For the test, in addition to a Phenom II X3 with an nVidia 570 and 4 GB of RAM that didn't blink in maintaining the sixty frames per second, we tested the title on a 13-inch MacBook Pro. The endowment, being a model dIn 2011, it boasts an Intel i5 processor, 4 GB of RAM and an Intel HD3000 video card, however it turned out to be sufficient, reducing some details, to play decently. Finally, let's mention the post-launch support, which has seen Double Fine already release several updates to fix some bugs and file the last few edges.", "date": "2013-03-13", "grade": "8.0"}
