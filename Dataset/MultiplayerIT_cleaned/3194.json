{"name": "Murder by Numbers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/murder-by-numbers-recensione.html", "text": "Already from the initial screens, with the real theme song sung in full anime style exploding on the screen, it is easy to understand how this game is something special and therefore the Murder by Numbers review could be of interest to all those who are certain of a quite an out of the ordinary experience. To tell the truth, the game is built by bringing together different elements that we have already seen elsewhere, but juxtaposed in a combination that is new and particularly fascinating. The eclecticism is almost excessive, to be honest, and the title developed by Mediatonic can easily seem like a sort of strange, cheerful and colorful Frankenstein of different gameplays, but also thanks to the strong characterization given to the graphic style and the characters, it still emerges with a rather well-defined identity, beyond the inhomogeneous contrasts between the different phases of the game. The sensation that immediately arises is that of a return to certain experiments of the Nintendo DS era, when the hybridization of graphic adventures with different genres and suggestions led to unexpected and often very valid results. Inevitably, it is precisely to that panorama that one must look to find equivalents and it is there, in fact, that Murder by Numbers evidently finds its roots. The game is basically what comes out of mixing Ace Attorney and Picross, which can sound strange and actually feels quite bizarre to play, but in a good way. We are faced with something lively and unedited, which manages to balance a puzzle game with a simple but demanding structure like a puzzle classic with a rather interesting story, held up also thanks to colorful characters who give life to always stimulating dialogues and hardly trivial. It probably doesn't have a complex case construction like Ace Attorney, nor the various modes of interaction that make it a real investigative adventure, but it must be taken into account that it is something different. In fact, Murder by Numbers is above all a puzzle game embedded in a narrative adventure based on dialogues and some choices on the part of the player. The story of Honor and SCOUT The story therefore has great importance in the structure of Murder by Numbers, a game that in fact unfolds above all through the various dialogues that help us discover the events, solve the cases and learn more about the bizarre cast that gives life to everything. The protagonist is Honor, an actress who became famous in the role of detective in a TV show and who finds herself investigating real cases during a particularly intense day: at the beginning of the story, in fact, our heroine (already tested by a divorce not easy) is suddenly fired from her role, accused of the murder of a friend and television producer and makes the acquaintance of SCOUT, a bizarre floating droid with memory problems but with a great ability to see evidence and useful objects. From that moment, thanks also to the support of the new improvised sidekick, Honor's great investigative skills emerge, who begins to investigate first to be able to prove his innocence and then for personal vocation, actively supporting police investigations into various cases that upset Los Angeles and proving increasingly skilled. The 90s setting recovers colors and extravagance in the typical style of the time and is built through graphics that point to anime and still recall Phoenix Wright in the way it represents the characters, all decidedly over the top and strongly characterized. It must be said that in general there is a lack of creativity and depth with which cases are constructed and told in similar titles, in particular in the aforementioned Capcom series, just as the interaction is limited by choices that hardly change the course of history and the solution of cases. To all intents and purposes it is more of a visual novel than an adventure, but the brilliance of the exchanges between the characters and again the strong characterization of these make the whole experience quite memorable. Gameplay mixed between puzzle and adventure The gameplay is composite and the various sections on which it is built are not fully harmonized, but this is not a great flaw and indeed can represent a curious feature, which increases the particular charm of the game. A map allows us to move from one setting to another and within each of these we can dedicate ourselves to dialogues with the characters present - which usually take the form of informal interrogations, with the possibility of pursuing various topics or presenting objects and evidence on which to focus the discussion - or examine the scenerio searching for items, information, and potential evidence to advance the case. The trend is rather linear, in the sense that in order to advance, one basically finds oneself gradually exhausting the various topics of discussion and then trying to gradually find all the sensitive objects within the scenarios, with a scansion that is substantially decided by the screenplay . The exploration phase of the settings is very elementary and serves to introduce the puzzle sections, which are in fact the most purely playful soul of Murder by Numbers: by activating SCOUT's scanning mode we find ourselves sliding a sort of viewfinder over the scenario until this does not react to the sight of something of interest, but the procedure is essentially automatic as you just swipe on the image until the viewfinder turns red. The procedure, with attached puzzle, is justified by the fact that SCOUT's sensors are still damaged and in order for the image of the objects of interest to emerge, one must therefore go through the phase of solving the puzzle. The explanation doesn't actually make much sense, but we are interested up to a point: what matters is that the puzzle mechanic works very well. The structure is the same seen in Picross: it involves filling squares arranged on a grid (which can have different dimensions and characteristics) based on the indications given for each row and column on the quantity of squares to be coloured, divided into sequences. The solution derives from the fact that between each sequence there must be at least one empty square and from the intersections that are established as one progresses. As you will have understood from these few confusing lines, it is a system that is much easier to understand by trying it directly than by reading a written explanation, but it is based on classic mechanisms of more purely ~mathematical~ puzzles, resulting universally appreciable even by those who usually he doesn't really spend his free time racking his brains to the max. A strong identity It is easy to see how the puzzle is somewhat forced into the context of the game, with the idea of having to solve a puzzle in order to bring up the image of the object to be considered as evidence or as an important element for the progression of the investigations. On the other hand, it could not be otherwise: making sense of the sudden transition from a visual novel to a puzzle that falls within the more classic ~pen and paper~ puzzle structure is difficult and necessarily requires a logical leap of considerable size. However, the imaginative construction of the game world and the oddities of the cases and characters we are dealing with clearly overshadow gray and boring topics such as logical holes in the script or in the very conception of the game, therefore it is not even to take care of it more. The graphic structure on which Murder by Numbers is built, strictly in 2D, is very simple but also of great effect, thanks above all to the very incisive character design which also exploits a considerable study for the look of the various characters, in terms of clothing and general style. Mediatonic is a team with great experience, always focused on rather limited productions, therefore over the years it has managed to get the most out of a limited technological system, focusing everything on hand-drawn graphics and on the strong characterization given by a high-impact style and Murder by Numbers stands at the apex of this path. It seems like a trivial thing, but the sung acronym itself works great to consolidate the strong identity of this game and you will easily find yourself humming it even in the days following its conclusion. The cases are different and the time required to complete the game is considerable, considering the genre: it easily goes beyond 15 hours of gameplay, enough to bring out the risk of running into a certain repetitiveness, given the scarce variations applied to the formula, especially with regards to the puzzle core. Another potential problem in our area is the fact that the game is not in Italian but entirely in English, with obviously abundant texts.", "date": "2020-03-15", "grade": "8.0"}
