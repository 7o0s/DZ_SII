What happened? We'll find out later, when we face the situation again (and can wrap it up). Meanwhile, the second level takes a step back which takes us immediately after the end of Legend. Lara is looking for a way to reach her mother, apparently trapped in some unknown dimension. It begins with an underwater sequence in which Lara has to dive to try to penetrate a submerged temple, while showing off her buttocks. The control system is the classic one and fans of the saga will not struggle to move Lara perfectly from the very first sequences. As tradition dictates, our favorite heroine can jump, cling to ledges, climb, hang from poles, throw the grappling hook to cling to specific (pre-set) points, shoot and so on. Make the first move The only new move concerns the possibility of using the ledges of the walls to climb like a kind of spider woman. Sinuous movements, soft step and the game is done. As in Legend, the motorbike is back, but this time used in a much more brazen and spot on way; that is, to run inside temples, tombs and the like (Lara must have studied archeology at some university in the Bronx, there are no other explanations for the taste she feels in defacing the crumbling remains of ancient civilizations despite being an archaeologist). For the rest there isn't much to report that hasn't already been seen in the past, if not the possibility, at the beginning of each mission, to select a dress for Lara and the presence of a scanner/map whose usefulness is doubtful (you can safely never use it). The art of bad taste Speaking of settings, what comes to mind for the control system; that is, despite some variations on the theme, they are exactly what you would expect from a video game starring Lara Croft. In reality there is a peculiarity, namely that the developers have chosen to make a sort of crossover between very different civilizations, creating a mix that very often expires in pushed kitsch. What would come to your mind if you were told to look for Thor's belt in a ruined temple located in Mexico? Finding statues of Odin scattered practically all over the world made us smile a little and we came up with titles like Maciste against Zorro, or Hercules against the Three Musketeers, or all those works in which the presumed creativity of the authors gave birth to combinations that remained to history more for bad taste than for creativity. There is no shortage of risky merger examples and at times, if you think too much about it, it all appears rather ridiculous. What would you say, for example, to an archaeologist who has never noticed that her house is located above a deconsecrated cathedral? Well hidden for heaven's sake, but... Forgetting for a moment the absurdity of certain scenarios, it should however be specified that, in general, the levels are built very well and are decidedly ingenious, in fact referring more to the first episodes than to Legend himself in terms of overall difficulty and the time required to get to the bottom of some passages. Indeed, in hindsight Underworld is one of the most difficult episodes among the last ones and in this sense it beats Anniversary by different lengths, but above all Legend. Use the intellect Probably aware of the fact that one of the major defects of Legend was precisely the short duration, mainly due to very simple levels and without particular jolts in the puzzles, in Underworld the developers have radically changed direction, returning to ask the player for a certain spirit of observation and a good ability to think about what to do. It is difficult to enter the more complex areas with a clear vision of how to move and act. First you have to look around, explore, make empty attempts, observing the effects, and then get to the resolution of the riddle of the moment. A much more reasoned approach therefore, which revives the tradition of the saga also known for its difficulty. Obviously some players will turn up their noses at the relative novelty, but those who grew up on bread and platforms will be able to enjoy it to the fullest. Stop the cameraman! Unfortunately Underworld is not without its flaws and some are unfortunately particularly annoying. Most noticeable is the camera mishandling that plagues pretty much the entire game. As a genre dictates, while our heroine prances cheerfully and Junoesque through the scenarios, the camera follows her looking for the best shot to show her position and whatit is necessary to overcome the given obstacle. But we made a mistake in conjugating the verb tense of the previous sentence, because the camera ~should~ do what is described, but in Underworld it often does the exact opposite. The moments in which the shot goes crazy and make it practically impossible to continue, if not relying on luck, are not rare. In many cases it happened that the shot didn't show important holds or platforms, in others we made mistakes driven by the impossibility of seeing where to go. The worst cases however, are those in which the framing is too tight on Lara, making it virtually impossible to see anything apart from her back. What did you eat tonight? Another flaw of no small importance is the tendency of the beautiful archaeologist to get stuck (not with men, don't hope for it). Let's see the typical case: running against a rock we discover that it is an insurmountable obstacle, so we try to get Lara to run, but ours doesn't accept it and it performs a sort of ballet; in order to continue, you simply need to stop giving input (joypad or keyboard) and then, calmly, let it maneuver. Had it happened rarely we wouldn't have complained, but even in this case the problem was repeated very often, especially in the more intricate levels, and it was really annoying. How annoying were the cases in which Lara got stuck between several obstacles, forcing us to make painful attempts to get her out of the way or, in the most tragic cases, to load the most recent save. Honestly, we hadn't seen anything like this for years and, from what we can remember, in Legend and Anniversary things were much better from this point of view. This ~heaviness~ in the movements, constantly penalized by unexpected and frustrating stops, is reflected in a certain lack of fluidity in the action: if it is pleasant having to observe the scenario to understand what to do, it is not equally pleasant to have understood it and not be able to do it due to the not really state of the art control system. Better to avoid fighting To have been sacrificed a lot compared to Legend is the combat system, which in Underworld is rather anonymous and inconsistent, almost annoying. Enemies all behave in the same way, be they hell dogs, black panthers or giant spiders, and in general they don't shine for artificial intelligence. The automatic targeting system makes most of the clashes mere pretexts to break up the platforming action and the few situations where you shoot more are certainly the weakest part of the game. Let's take for example the level of the ship, where the many enemies armed with firearms are careful not to develop a minimum strategy or from staying behind some cover... one feels like shooting them down more out of pity than out of necessity, given also the rich quantity of medikits that are scattered throughout the scenarios. From a technical point of view, the work done by the Crystal Dynamics guys is very good, with well-constructed and very refined environments that frame spectacular sequences of great visual and emotional impact (see the clash with the giant octopus, just to an example). The impression is that we have tried at all costs to reproduce the sense of wonder that permeated the first episodes, and that much has been done in terms of scenography to tickle gamers. If it is not fair to compare Underworld with the older episodes of the series, which as such must be framed at the time of their release, it is however possible to say that visually it is much more spectacular than Legend and Anniversary. Perhaps the only technical defect that can be found is due, paradoxically, to the excessive richness of details of some scenarios, especially those with rich vegetation, which can partially hide and make the footholds necessary for the continuation of the adventure less evident. From the point of view of the soundtrack, there are pleasant accompanying music and adequate and well-kept sound effects, but nothing that makes you cry for a miracle.", "date": "2008-11-20", "grade": "7.7"}
