{"name": "Winning Eleven 7 International", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/winning-eleven-7-international.html", "text": "We are international The first screen that we find is inherent in the choice of languages to use, six of which pleasantly include Italian. After an unprecedented high-quality FMV we arrive at the main menu, which positively testifies to the identity of a product that stands out from a sterile and commercial re-edition. Completely new music, even if not transcendental (negligible electronic compositions, with no licensed tracks), the added value of languages and a completely new stage. But there is no shortage of bad news: no trace of the infamous 24 additional teams (the press releases have never fully clarified the presence of this addition), and a player database still in Japanese. This last aspect certainly does not help the internationalization of the title, and even if it is possible to load an old filedata from the previous WE (6 and 7), it is not possible to completely solve the problem, as a good 10% of the players will remain in kanji. Furthermore, no trace of the multilingual commentary by John Kabira hoped for by the polyglot film disclosed on the web, nothing more than a bizarre promotional stunt. This means that depending on the language chosen, we will hear the respective commentators in game, including the hated Tecca-Capitani couple. Finally, we point out the persistence of a historical deficit of the saga, in fact there are still no official licenses and uniforms, if we exclude the few inherited directly from PES3. The same player and team number database is still embarrassing when compared to the vastness of the one seen in the latest FIFA, a penalty that once again discredits the title in the eyes of users who consider this feature crucial. Do the evolution Facilitated by faster loading (thanks to DVD support), entry into the field holds several surprises. First of all, the use of a higher resolution immediately catches the eye, which gives a more defined and satisfying image, moreover the already excellent fluidity has been further improved, also thanks to the addition of new animations. Let's add the definitive removal of the annoying clicks, to tell the truth a phenomenon whose subjectivity has never allowed a univocal explanation. The blur effect in out-of-game sequences and replays has also been completely eliminated. These filings bring out an irrefutable reality: the graphics engine is seriously fruit, making a radical reprogramming desirable for the next episode. Even the playability has actually undergone some additions that do justice to Konami's statements inherent in the renewed gameplay: the speed has significantly increased, not so much in terms of movements, but rather in terms of the dynamics of the actions. Performing a dribble is now decidedly difficult due to the defense opposed by the cpu, which defining fierce is pure understatement. All this, combined with the high frenzy of the actions, forces the player to continuous passes and in general a strategic construction that penalizes the individual's virtuosity. Furthermore, the shots on goal are much more energetic than WE7, and the actions on the wing are deeply revised, with crosses that willingly find the attacker's head ready to score. PES3 veterans have already experienced many of these things, and this is an important element in understanding the path taken by the Konami coders for this latest incarnation of the ~king~. But as already mentioned, WE7 is something more than a Japanese PES3, benefiting from some improvements, first of all a less nervous refereeing (no more cards at hand), the correct application of the advantage rule and the hand ball. The downside of these new additions is the rendering of a slightly unbalanced game towards the spectacular, an aspect that could be unwelcome for those coming directly from WE7. Regardless of these considerations, it should be emphasized that the title always remains very demanding and relentless as one would expect, but there is no doubt that Konami winks at an ~International~ version in a playful, rather than a formal sense. Comment Writing a review of a title like Winning Eleven is always difficult, the time required to thoroughly evaluate its mechanics is ill-suited to the editorial one. So let's express the infamous judgment, reserving the benefit of the doubt about what we will probably mature only in many months of intense sessions. The latest Konami birth is reconfirmed as the absolute leader of football simulations, and albeit con a renewed spectacular component, still light years away from competing productions in terms of realism and playful subtleties. But also a title to be carefully considered by veterans for the new additions: those coming from WE7 will find a significantly different game, destined for potential criticism and new praise, while PES users will have a few (but welcome) additions that perhaps do not fully justify the huge outlay required. A clearly transitional product, still aimed at a demanding user, but willing to convert others as well. Only the release of the eighth chapter will be able to confirm whether Konami's is a momentary episode or a sign of a new evolutionary course. Pros: It is the best football simulation on the planet. Improved graphics and new animations. 6 languages to choose from... Cons:  But player names still in Japanese. The high frenzy might make purists turn up their noses. Chronic shortage of licenses. It's been a while since Konami jumped into the world of simulated soccer on consoles. After the splendid exploits of the two Fighting Eleven on the SNES (ISS and ISS Deluxe by us), the adventure continued with the split into two distinct sagas, curated by different teams. Enormous confusion ensued, especially for the PAL market, which imposed a new nomenclature to distinguish the two series. So while International Superstar Soccer mirrored the more arcade side of this splendid sport, Winning Eleven was renamed Pro Evolution Soccer to represent the realistic one. The latter has become an authentic cult fetish, acclaimed all over the world for its high simulation component. Probably for many of you this historical clarification is superfluous, but it is good to analyze in detail the profound evolution of play that has affected both markets. Indeed, there is no doubt that WE has gradually come out of its privileged niche position for connoisseurs, to aspire to a more commercial position. The data speak for themselves, if EA's FIFA saga reigned supreme before, the number of users converted to PES has been increasing. The second chapter (WE6 in Japan) was a resounding success that prompted Konami to a new calibration of the gameplay, functional to greater integration between the eastern and western versions. The fewer resources and talent employed on the recent ISS have completely diverted attention to PES, loading a considerable responsibility on the shoulders of the programmers. If the first two chapters adequately distanced themselves from the eastern counterpart with greater action and immediacy, in the third chapter we witnessed an incarnation very close to the WE7 equivalent. The reasons are clear: the success found in the West has made it possible to dispel Konami's fears about the competition, facilitating more faithful porting. Coming to today, the latest version that we are about to review is a remix of WE7 based on three specific purposes: to update the title with PES improvements, to further evolve in playful terms, and to conquer an important position in the export market.", "date": "2004-03-12", "grade": null}
