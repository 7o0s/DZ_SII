{"name": "Rapina a dito armato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/127019-lawless-rapina-a-dito-armato.html", "text": "First work of the English team EightPixelsSquare, Lawless openly refers to the light gun shooters that dominated arcades between the nineties and two thousand, a genre that has now almost disappeared due to the crisis of the arcade market and the lack of appeal that these products they have always recorded on consoles. This is certainly not the first attempt to recreate such a playful experience on a touch screen, but so far no game has managed to offer something that was even remotely comparable to the sensation of shooting at the screen holding a plastic gun: so let's see if Lawless succeeded in the enterprise... Lawless & Orderless Set in Los Angeles in the 90s, Lawless puts the user in the role of an anonymous henchman committed to carrying out a variety of crimes on behalf of his boss: as expected, it is a simple pretext to show off the widest range possible of environments within which to riddle the enemies with bullets. All that Lawless loses in terms of pure narrative (the story does not exist in all respects) he gains in terms of the differentiation of the scenarios, very vast indeed: from the vault of a bank to the attic of an opposing clan leader , from an airport to a public park crowded with unsuspecting passers-by and so on, with the constant guarantee of an excellent visual impact. The remarkable polygonal complexity of the settings is highlighted by the use of bright colors and well-defined textures, and the massive doses of light effects and destructible elements keep the spectacular rate high. In this regard, it is almost regrettable that Lawless's stages are so short, with shootings - however intense - that end within two minutes at the most: even if these are timings that are absolutely suitable for the mobile play setting, the feeling at the end of a level is to have played a little too little. This impression is exacerbated by the perhaps excessive amount of parameters to manage in support of the actual action: there are weapons to buy and upgrade, allies to hire, special events to register for, statistics to view, special abilities to unlock, characteristics of the various characters to compare and more: a bit too much for a title whose gameplay at the end of the day begins and ends in a matter of seconds. Very entertaining at first, Lawless can get repetitive a little too quickly However, it must be acknowledged that Lawless is smart enough not to fall victim to his own free to play model: although the emphasis placed on the purchase of new content is very strong, the software allows you to move forward quite easily even without having to bend over to the inevitable microtransactions. Real money can only really serve those who want to grab the best weapons and upgrades right away, while everyone else can play for free until the inevitable moment when Lawless starts to lose its edge and become seriously repetitive. Despite all the trappings put in place by EightPixelsSquare, the title is still reduced to a slightly too easy target practice given that your index finger is an infinitely more accurate tool than a light gun: you therefore proceed without practically ever risking the game over until you get tired of the product's play offer, perhaps finding yourself opening the application again just to kill time from time to time. Too bad that Lawless cannot count on a more robust play structure, because technically the work done by the developers is at least noteworthy, and not only for what concerns the aforementioned visual aspect. The controls are therefore extremely intuitive and precise: it is sufficient to point a finger at an enemy to fire, with the on-screen character automatically taking cover in the absence of any solicitation. The feeling that the various weapons give back is also good, while in terms of audio, nostalgics of the genre will undoubtedly appreciate the proverbial ~Go! Go! Go!~ which constantly goads the player to continue to the next stage.", "date": "2013-12-30", "grade": "7.3"}
