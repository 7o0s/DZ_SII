The octagon is surrounded by supporters and cameramen. Within seconds our field of vision shrinks: we focus on an uppercut, a hook. We try in every way to knock Tony Ferguson down, while we snap around that Irish giant Conor McGregor like a cricket, to avoid the blows. At the moment of hard-earned victory, fame, success and above all new contracts are ours. Who said that there is only Dragon Ball FighterZ available to lead the way these days? EA Vancouver has finished the development of UFC 3, the third chapter of a relatively recent franchise but which improves in something with each new edition. Its latest incarnation on consoles recovers all the advantages of the previous one, insisting on some noteworthy innovations. The result is probably the best MMA fighting game currently on the market. I also beat you on social media We will soon tell you about the many game modes offered by UFC 3, but first we must insist on the main novelty of this third edition, on which EA itself has bet a lot on, showing it several times over the last few months. It's the Career Mode, the new one: revised, enhanced and enriched with new features that, in some moments, bring it closer to a small management of the resources of our professionals. The title clearly shows that it is aimed at a specialized audience, which celebrates a specific type of sport, that of mixed martial arts. And who therefore expects to find in UFC 3 a faithful reproduction in every detail, inside and outside the ring. EA has satisfied everyone. You start with choosing between the classic difficulty levels, while ~legend~ will be available after completing the Career at least once, and having conquered the title of champion. You then select the weight class for your athlete, and immediately after the fighting style: striker, brawler, balanced, grappler or submission specialist. The fidelity in the details of the type of sport in question is accompanied by a really deep editor, where we will be able to create our fighter from scratch by customizing it in every single aspect. Tattoos included, divided for each part of the body. Personality, entrance music, posture, taunts and guard can also be modified at will. But above all, next to the name, the title asks us to enter our nickname on social media. This detail introduces us to the new basic mechanic: the promotion of encounters. The career mode basically sees us face one challenge after another, starting from the minor leagues of the World Fighting Alliance (WFA) to naturally arrive at the UFC. But virtual weeks pass between the fights, which will be spent training, strengthening and, precisely, exciting the public in view of the next challenge. To do this we will have to post on social networks (or rather, ~pretend~ to post on social networks) provocations to our opponents. ~I'm very ready, it will be a one-way fight!~. The opponent will answer us back, always on social media: ~Disappear, go back to the gym to train~. The pre-match clamor enriches the performances with new parameters, which can go to our advantage or favor the opponents (if we have neglected social networks, we will certainly take a few more slaps). Obviously it is also important to train in the gym, to strengthen ourselves physically and be ready for the fight. But dedicating ourselves only to our body is not the best choice. UFC 3 instead aims at a wise management between one and the other thing, and it is here that the management mechanics emerge. In fact, after each match we earn money, fans and weekly points. Week points are spent on managing training in the gym and posts on social networks: we can't do both together, and neither of them is free. With ever better performances we will have more chances to win the match, and in this way we will sign more and more important contracts. We will need the money to unlock new gyms, to rent for training, and so on in a spiral that (hopefully) will lead us to glory. Playstation 4 trophies The trophies of UFC 3 span all possibilities offered by the EA title. The coveted platinum will require us to play online as well, while we try to carry out some actions that would not be counted during free clashes. However, many trophies will unlock automatically as you play match after match. The trophies that will take the longest are for getting the biggest contract ever on Legendary difficulty, and reaching level 150 on UFC UltimateTeam. Arm yourself with patience: a true champion never backs down. On the edge of reality UFC 3 does not give players discounts of any kind: it is not a fighting game in which you just need to press random buttons to win. In fact, it's not a fighting game, period. It is a sports simulator, which requires perfect mastery of all the complex game mechanics present. Before being able to master the situation, days of training will be needed, and the presence of tutorials always at hand says a lot about the learning curve. The controls have been updated, and it will take some time for old UFC 2 fans to feel at home. The parry system, for example, now manages the high guard with R2, and the low guard with the simultaneous pressure of R2 and L2. The grappling and submission system has been made more intuitive, but not too much: the latter remain the even more uncomfortable mechanic to manage, especially during online clashes where reactivity becomes even more important. Very often we pass from tactics to general confusion; however, everything else works great, favoring a very high degree of immersion, which finds its crowning glory in the encounter with the graphics sector. Because there's no getting around it, UFC 3 is a sight to behold. We arrived at pure photorealism, out of the blue during the game presentation we went from the gameplay to a real television movie, and we didn't even notice the transition. The fluidity on the pitch is equally excellent, and you can immediately see the effect of the new Real Player Motion technology, capable of making everything more realistic and believable with 5000 new animations. We only encountered some uncertainty during online battles. It's nothing too annoying, however, among other things we have not had the opportunity to fully test the network component because the servers are still deserted, so the situation could improve rapidly in the coming days. A note of merit also for the proposed game modes. Varying a substantially identical formula is never an easy task, and we'd be lying if we told you that out of the blue UFC 3, for a change, takes you fishing. However, there are so many things to do, and the Career is only one of the options available. There is the Match Mode, to challenge artificial intelligence or a local friend on the fly. There are tournaments and ranking championships. There's even a new Knockout mode, where you dictate the victory conditions, whether you want to hit what kind of strike or other limitations. On the UFC Ultimate Team, then, a separate book could be written, like that of FIFA (whose functioning, however, is very similar). For those who are still unable to adequately master the more complex mechanics, EA has also thought of ~Get up and strike~ and ~Submission duel~, to play games focused only on those aspects. Customization is the flagship of UFC 3, if you haven't figured it out yet: the player must feel free to try everything, when he wants, at his own pace. Until he feels ready to go punch someone on the octagon. Someone very important.", "date": "2018-02-05", "grade": "8.5"}
