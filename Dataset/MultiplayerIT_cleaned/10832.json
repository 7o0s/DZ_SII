Throughout videogame history, the victims of too many expectations have been many, often even decidedly illustrious: it is therefore with a pinch of fear that the release of MadWorld was awaited, a very violent action by Platinum Games acclaimed by anyone who had seen it even just in passing as the savior of hardcore gamers on Wii, now at the end of their strength after months and months of forced fasting. Fortunately, the response in the field of the Sega product proved to be unequivocal, giving all the uncertainties a clean cut: of chainsaw, of course. Black & White & Red The little information released by Platinum Games regarding the MadWorld storyline meant that the scenario was that of a disturbing reality show centered on the exploits of the protagonist Jack - a thug equipped with a retractable chainsaw connected to his right arm - who had to climb the charts by killing their opponents in the bloodiest way possible. In reality, as we had the pleasure of discovering, the underlying plot is decidedly more elaborate, and capable of genuinely involving the player: written in collaboration with Yasumi Matsuno (former game designer of Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII) and told through tasty cutscenes that skilfully mix sequences with the game engine and comic book style illustrations, the story revolves around the evil project of a terrorist group, which after having blocked the accesses to a part of the imaginary Varrigan City, forces its inhabitants to participate in this macabre game of massacre, all obviously filmed by cameras. Our ~hero~ Jack initially appears as a simple contender with the desire to lead a little hands, but it soon turns out that his goals go beyond simple bloodshed. We won't reveal further so as not to spoil the surprise for those interested, but the fact is that the storyline is the first, unexpected surprise of a product with a decidedly long list of merits. At the top positions must certainly be ascribed a technical realization that it is not an exaggeration to define as the most amazing but seen on the Wii, already incensed by specialized critics in the various previews. First of all, MadWorld boasts a style that is as courageous as it is spot on: as is evident from the images, the game is completely in black and white, with the exception of the red of the blood (which literally flows in rivers), a solution that cannot fail to bring to mind that aesthetic masterpiece that is Sin City, or simply the pages of a comic, world to which the Platinum Games title is clearly inspired. the technical realization is among the most amazing yet seen on Wii But MadWorld's excellence doesn't end with its style: even on a purely technical level, applause goes to the developers for the intelligence with which they have been able to exploit the limited resources of the Wii through a variant of cel shading. The polygonal models appear solid and well defined, with really excellent and very varied animations, but the scenarios are no different, and offer environments that may not be huge, but extremely accurate and full of details. The imposing size of some bosses and the tasteful minimalism of the interface and menus are other points in favor of MadWorld, which nevertheless gives its best in the -deliberately- exaggerated representation of violence: between cutscenes and in-game sequences that mark the executions of Jack, the game shows an unparalleled level of gore, accompanied however by sumptuous camera cuts and a persistent underlying irony. Equally ~outrageous~, but for different reasons, the sound sector: MadWorld alternates enigmatic silences with musical accompaniments that blend hip-hop, rock and electronics in a mixture that works great. Note of merit for the excellent Italian dubbing of the two television commentators who accompany Jack's deeds: even if some of their sentences are repeated beyond measure, one cannot help but smile listening to their exchanges of jokes which it would be euphemistic to define as politically incorrect. . This crazy, crazy world Although objectively MadWorld's audiovisual system certainly represents its spearhead, Sega's production does not resolve itself into a mere exercise in style, on the contrary: despite some limitations, the playful structure is solid and absolutely worthy of the hardcore user to whom he addresses. At its core, MadWorld is a modern variation of the classic scrolling beat 'em up, with some elements that wink at that No More Heroes so loved by the ~serious~ part of the Wii public. The game is divided into a series of stages set in the various districts of the urban island taken by terrorists, each equippingof specific objectives that are unlocked upon reaching a certain score, which must be increased by killing enemies in the bloodiest way possible: the best way to do this is to concatenate the elements that the developers have punctually distributed within the scenarios, and which it will be a pleasure for the user to discover and exploit as they see fit. Just to give an example, a full-bodied combo can consist in blocking an enemy with a tire, piercing him with a road sign, putting a bunch of firecrackers in his mouth, crushing his head inside a helmet, making him fly through a window and finally slamming him repeatedly against a studded wall or throw it under a moving train. The settings abound with instruments of death just waiting to be soaked in the blood of the opponents, such as circular saws, meat grinders, spikes, guillotines, electrified nets and so on and so forth: the possibilities are varied, and even if with the go of the adventure there is an inevitable recurrence, MadWorld offers enough structural depth to compensate for this factor. Sega production is not a mere exercise in style The Platinum Games title is in fact a thoroughbred action game, which also uses the Wii control system in an exemplary way, without therefore necessarily wanting to exploit certain characteristics to the detriment of performance. The management of Jack's basic actions (including movement, attack and jump) is almost entirely entrusted to conventional keys, with the exception of some strokes to be performed by moving the Remote horizontally and vertically: otherwise, contextual moves, executions or the quick time events that mark the boss fights are delegated to the requests of the two peripherals. Just the ~bad guys~ at the end of the level are another strong point of MadWorld, not so much from a playful point of view (after all it is always a question of avoiding their attacks and then fighting back), but rather for the subjects with whom you interact find to do, starting with neo-Nazis with turbines instead of arms, passing through geishas with a passion for murder and ending with gigantic followers of Frankenstein. Finally, the icing on the cake are the minigames that punctually make their appearance in each stage, presented by the hilarious character of the Black Baron, a pimp of uncommon vulgarity who ends up being killed every time in the most gruesome ways. We leave users the pleasure of discovering them all, but just to give an idea of the madness that distinguishes them, it is enough to know that you can find yourself using baseball bats to throw enemies at targets or playing golf using the heads of unfortunate. As is evident, MadWorld is an excellent action title, but some limitations prevent it from entering the Olympus of video games. First of all, the adventure - however intense - is objectively rather short (6-8 hours) and devoid of substantial replay value, with a very slim multiplayer component that allows two users to try their hand at minigames. Again, the sections on board the motorcycle are decidedly subdued compared to the rest of the play offer, but above all in our opinion the game perhaps rests too heavily on the need to kill enemies in an elaborate way, stimulating the user to a creativity that will soon it becomes routine and preventing him from giving himself to a more instinctive massacre. Comment MadWorld is a real white fly on Wii: a courageous, adult, foul-mouthed title, with a very strong gore component, devoid of multiplayer ambitions and which does not linger too much on the exploitation of Remote and Nunchuck at all costs. But it is above all an excellent action game, and if therefore on the one hand it is right to reward a product that brilliantly covers one of the most dramatic holes in the video game offer of the Nintendo console, on the other hand one wonders how successful the product will be Platinum Games within the boundless casual user base of Wii. As it stands, MadWorld could be one of the most esteemed candidates for the ~best game no one ever played~ award of 2009. Hardcore gamers, bring it on...Pro Exceptional technical sector Original and fun gameplay Huge doses of humor and violence Against Short adventure and low replay value Variety of situations only apparent Interview with Platinum Games Multiplayer.it The Japanese market is currently third, behind its US and European counterparts. How does this situation affect your work? Are you inclined to pay more attention to western players than ten years ago? Platinum Games To be honest, this does not surprise me at all, as I believe the developmentswestern actors superior to the Japanese ones, and I also think that the Japanese studios had better make up their minds to work really hard to reach their quality standards. The gaming market is becoming increasingly global, and for this reason I would think it right that we always think of the Western public as well, regardless of the type of game that is produced. Particularly in an economically difficult period like this, it is decidedly better if one's work can reach a larger catchment area. M.it What are the projects currently under development at your studios? PG Apart from MadWorld, we have Bayonetta, a pure action game coming out for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Infinite Space, a science-fiction RPG for Nintendo DS, and an as yet unannounced title that Shinji Mikami, creator of the Resident Evil series. So we really have a lot of irons in the fire. M.it MadWorld is a truly unique title within the Wii panorama: don't you worry about missing the target relating to the console's primary user, ie casual gamers? PG Honestly not, as we designed the game to appeal to both hardcore and casual gamers. MadWorld boasts a very immediate control system, and you can play it quickly for about ten minutes as well as face it continuously for hours, at the player's discretion. We wanted to make an adult product for the Wii from the beginning, and we hope that MadWorld manages to shake things up a bit on the Nintendo console, perhaps inspiring other developers to follow our path.M.it What came first in the development of MadWorld , the look and feel or the gameplay? What inspired you both? PG Actually, they arrived at the same time. We wanted to create black and white graphics whose only color was red blood, and at the same time produce an overly violent game for Wii. Everything else, from the story to the gameplay, flowed naturally from these foundations. As for the black and white style, we really wanted to offer something never seen before, which would give users the feeling of being in front of a comic book. The same violence in the game is inspired by the world of comics, as it is deliberately ridiculous and exaggerated.M.it In MadWorld there is a very high rate of violence and blood. Were you worried about censorship? If necessary, would you have changed any aspect of the game? PG We were actually a little worried about censorship, but fortunately things went in the right direction. The violence in MadWorld is neither realistic nor disgusting, and we made sure it was exaggerated just like that in a comic book. The control bodies seem to have understood this aspect and the game should come out without problems practically everywhere. Obviously we would have been available to modify something if necessary: we wanted the game to come out at any cost, and we are convinced that the impositions of censorship must be respected.M.it There is something else you would like to add about MadWorld, from Platinum Games or anything else? PG Play MadWorld, you'll love it! Interview by Umberto Moioli", "date": "2009-03-10", "grade": null}
