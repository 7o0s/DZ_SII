{"name": "Jack Keane - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jack-keane-recensione.html", "text": "Jack Keane, the protagonist of the point and click graphic adventure subject of the review, is a particularly unfortunate ship captain and full of debts up to his neck. It's late 19th-century London, and our hero finds himself tied to a chair atop Big Ben, where two criminals are trying to recover some money Keane had borrowed to buy his ship. After having freed himself in a daring way, ours will accept a mission for the British secret services, which will lead him to circumnavigate Africa until he arrives on an island south of India. It will be here that the real fulcrum of the main plot will develop, which focuses entirely on a terrible threat to the Western world: will the English queen still be able to drink her five o'clock tea? Or will he have to fall back on a sub-brand that is ill-suited to his royal palate? You too will understand that the situation is dramatic and must be resolved at all costs. Could this be why the worst scoundrels of the British Empire (and beyond) were employed to try to get to the bottom of it? The first two words that come to mind starting Jack Keane and hearing the first dialogues are Monkey and Island. In fact, the general atmosphere is comparable to that of the third episode of the infamous adventures of Guybrush Threepwood, even if there are differences and Keane is a decidedly more experienced character than the young pirate of Melee Island. The beginning is dazzling, with the screenwriters who have slipped in a series of very apt jokes, linked to amusing puzzles. The light-hearted tones will continue throughout the game with absurd and well-characterized characters who are often pleasantly ridiculous, even when they tell dramatic events. Especially agent Montgomery, an incompetent braggart who feels like a super spy, made us laugh more than a few, which is rare in these dark times. The comedy of hexagons The hilarious moments occur on the screen throughout the game, even if the last part becomes slightly more serious as the tone and interest fades. Note the inclusion of sexy elements in the plot (don't expect much, anyway) which brings Jack Keane closer to the cinematic / theatrical comedy on a narrative level where winks and direct references are not lacking. We are not yet at the level of Aristophanes, and we are not in the least bit close to the glories of any Larry, before the sad restyling of recent years, but these are well-integrated situations that add that pinch of pepper that in a comedy-oriented graphic adventure is not it never hurts. note the inclusion of sexy elements in the plot The comedy of hexagons From a technical point of view, the developers have chosen to create all the settings in 3D, following the style of their previous work, the successful Ankh series. They therefore focused on very cartoony architectures with bright saturated colors. 3D is not exploited to the maximum, i.e. it serves only to manage the movements of the virtual camera, trying to avoid sudden changes of shot where possible. Unfortunately you cannot rotate the shot, zoom in on some details or manage the camera in any way. This determines a very classic gameplay, also confirmed by the game interface which follows the standards of the genre without deviating too much from it. We'll talk about the interface in the next paragraph, however. Instead, let's continue to examine the visual rendering. The characters are well modeled and characterized, while the scenarios are of fluctuating quality: in fact, in some you can enjoy a good level of detail, while in others you feel a certain poverty with visible deficiencies (such as the hexagonal barrels or part of the vegetation of the 'island that appears slightly ~monolithic~). Overall, to conclude, we are faced with a good job with some flaws here and there. Not too hot spots To show a few too many problems is the interface. As already mentioned, it is presented in a very classic and decidedly intuitive way: with the left mouse button you examine the objects while with the right you interact by collecting them, using them, or joining them together. The inventory is located in the upper part of the screen, while in the lower part the actions are indicated. The dialogues are multiple choice and do not present anything innovative: from a list of sentences you choose the one you want Keane to say that's all. Unfortunately we have noticed that the response to the player's inputs is not always very precise and immediate: sometimes we had to press the keys several times to make Jack perform the chosen action. But even this is not a big deal, in hindsight. It's annoying but nothing more, since there aren't hectic moments in which precision is everythingto go on. a real flaw is the detection system of the interactable elements Not too hot spots A real defect is the detection system of the interactable elements; by pressing the X key, in fact, it is possible to identify the hot spots of each scenario. Or, at least, it should be possible to identify them, given that in our test we sometimes see the interactability indicators appear in wrong points of the screen, where there was nothing that could be interacted with, while in other cases essential hot spots are not been highlighted. Soon we begin to strongly doubt this feature which, so poorly implemented, still forces the most shrewd player to go hunting for objects in the different scenarios, just confusing him. Instabilities resolved and not Jack Keane's biggest flaw, however, is the series of bugs that afflict him. Fortunately, compared to the English version, many problems have been resolved (consult the appropriate box regarding the validity of the Italian version) and therefore we breathe a sigh of relief because there are no truncated sentences or dialogues that are difficult to understand because they are asynchronous with the text. However, there is still a certain general instability (especially on Vista) which crashes the game from time to time and makes it difficult to take pictures (mmmm, this doesn't concern you that much). Joking aside, we have repeatedly found ourselves staring at a black screen instead of a movie, unable to do anything other than restart the PC. It doesn't happen very often, but it does happen. Comment Jack Keane is a well-crafted graphic adventure that reaches full eight in the final evaluation thanks to the excellent care taken in the Italian edition and the budget price. It is a game suitable for all hardened adventurers, who will find it on average long, and for those who want to try the genre starting from a brilliant but not too complex product. Pros Funny dialogues Well-defined characters Interesting puzzles Cons Not very stable Some drops in graphics quality Indicators of interactable areas are often inaccurate The Italian edition Jack Keane is distributed in Italy by FX Interactive which, as usual, has flawlessly taken care of all those elements that are often overlooked or treated superficially because they are considered secondary. Therefore, for the modest price of 19.90, you will take home a full-bodied (for a graphic adventure) manual in Italian, completely in color and full of indications and suggestions to start playing. In addition, the texts have been completely translated into Italian and dubbed by professional actors, who do not regret the English version of the game and indeed surpass it. Most noteworthy is the absence of some bugs in the British version, a sign of an excellent job of adapting the version on sale in Italy.
