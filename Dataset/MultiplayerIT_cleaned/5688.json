{"name": "Demoni e angeli", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/163949-disgaea-pc-demoni-e-angeli.html", "text": "Nippon Ichi has now become synonymous with strategic JRPGs for gamers, a bit like Square Enix is for more traditional Japanese RPGs. This software house which has its headquarters in the prefecture of Gifu, is in fact the author of absolute masterpieces of the genre such as for example La Pucelle: Tactics and the titles of the Disgaea series, the fifth chapter of which we recently reviewed for PlayStation 4. Each production branded Nippon Ichi is characterized by a great depth of play and a massive dose of irony, two elements that now constitute a real ~trademark~ of the team. The same that we also find in this Disgaea PC, revised and corrected porting (includes objectives, cloud save system, new command set) of the first chapter of the saga, Hour of Darkness, originally released on PlayStation 2, and above all of its remake for PlayStation Portable, Afternoon of Darkness, from which it borrows some extras. The plot behind the game is light and a bit crazy and tells of a world populated by demons, the Netherworld, thrown into chaos after the death of its ruler, Krichevskoy. In the two years following his departure, in fact, the subjects divided into factions and clashed with each other to seize the scepter, taking advantage of the fact that the designated heir, the megalomaniacal son of the King, Prince Laharl, was sleeping soundly. . But when, with the help of his faithful vassal, the demoness Etna, he awakens, he decides to take back what belongs to him, and the adventure begins. All the strategy and madness of the magical universe of Disgaea finally comes to PC Tactics and corruption The focal point of the adventure is the castle of Laharl, the place from which the protagonists leave for their missions or return to perform the classic tasks of a self-respecting tactical jRPG. Indeed, once a stage has been completed, it is possible not to continue immediately to the next one and return to the base. There you can explore the rooms to talk to the residents, visit the shops available for the purchase of various items and have your wounds treated in a kind of paid medical clinic, as well as check the status of your units or your items, and so on talking. Also inside the castle it is possible to convene the Dark Assembly, an assembly made up of Senator demons to which it is possible to present particular requests that will vary and increase in number as the game progresses and with the growth of the mana level. During a session, the gamer can, for example, submit to the attention of the court his desire to unlock new classes, new special maps or improve the quality of the products sold in shops. To obtain positive results, however, it becomes essential to know the tastes of the Senators present in the chamber, and their propensity or otherwise to approve the request, so as to be able to adjust accordingly. Because in Disgaea PC it is possible to convince bystanders to vote in favor of a request by bribing them with gifts or, in extreme cases, with beatings. Also in this session it is also possible to transmigrate one's units, making a no longer useful party element ~reincarnate~ into a new character, without however losing certain bonuses even if starting from a low level. Color strategy From the point of view of playability, Disgaea PC is obviously equal to the console counterpart, therefore it is a turn-based strategy divided into chapters and sidequests, where the battles between groups of characters that take place on a pseudo-map are the protagonists. 3D, where you have to move your party members against the enemy hordes. At each turn you can move your ~men~ within a certain square in relation to their parameters and the conformity of the area in which they are located. The characters can then perform various actions, such as attacking with a weapon, a spell, a special technique, or lifting what is next to them, such as enemies, allies and Geo symbols. This function is not only amusing for the effects it can cause on certain elements of the group, see for example the poor Prinny (penguin-like creatures who embody the souls of human beings who have lived without honor, such as thieves), but it useful for easily vaulting over an otherwise inaccessible point on the map by hurling a teammate over it, or for building a stack of characters to perform a variety of further actions. Disgaea PC separates the movement phases from the action phases, treated here independently: once decided what to have a team member do, in fact, the player can select the Execute command from the menu to make him act, or leave him still, waiting, while he movedother units, perhaps to surround the opponent or prepare for a team attack. The latter, linked among other things to the affinity between the characters who will perform it as well as to their position on the field, consists of a combination of multiple attacks performed by multiple characters on the same target, in such a way as to inflict as many as much damage as possible. Compared to other titles of the genre, Disgaea PC also includes the Geo Panel variable: colored panels positioned at certain points on the battlefields. Each color has its own specific function, and is able to activate particular bonuses or maluses that affect the actions of the characters who are above one of the squares involved, whether they are allies or enemies. Determining the color and additional capabilities of a panel is a pyramid-shaped object called a Geo Symbol, usually placed above one of them. This element can be destroyed, effectively eliminating its influence on the ground, or used to generate the so-called Color Combo and therefore chromatically modify other squares. For example, breaking a Yellow pyramid after having placed it on top of a Red box, all the panels of this color will change to yellow, inflicting a certain amount of damage to the units that eventually stand on it, or, if turned green with the appropriate Geo Symbol, will improve by 20% the attack capabilities from a distance of the characters who will then position themselves above them. By destroying the various Geo Symbols in the right order and in the same turn, it is therefore possible to trigger deadly combinations capable of wiping out anything found on the panels, or of temporarily improving (or worsening) some of the characters' abilities. Thanks to this variable, the game offers a multiplicity of situations within the same area and often more than the characteristics of the party members, knowing how to adequately exploit the conformity of the terrain or the bonuses present on it becomes decisive for the final outcome of a battle. The world inside an object Other peculiar features of Disgaea are the level cap of the characters set at 9,999 and the possibility of increasing the level of objects in the Item World, ~the world~ within the elements present in the party's inventory. In practice, each item contains a certain number of randomly generated floored dungeons populated by numerous hostile creatures: by accessing them it is possible to increase the power of the ~analysed~ object (weapons, armor), facing enemies and overcoming the various levels present, bosses included. Furthermore, inside the objects you can meet special monsters that are generally neutral but which, if faced and defeated, turn into a further bonus that can be associated with the statistics of the inventory piece, which will become even more powerful. These creatures, called ~specialists~, and the respective bonuses they bring with them, can be moved at will from one object to another, enhancing the item of equipment that best suits you. Which adds further salt to the adventure and further increases its already quite remarkable longevity. As if all this were not enough, once the main story is completed, a new game mode called Etna Mode is unlocked. The latter, a sort of ~what would have happened if...~ typical of some films, consists of a reduced version of the original adventure, this time experienced by the user through the eyes of Prince Laharl's vassal, who is accidentally killed by the little devil. With Etna as the absolute protagonist of the scene, humor and puns abound if possible even more, above all thanks to the presence at his side of the angelic (and naive) Flonne as assistant. Everything that happens in the game and that we have described up to now can be managed comfortably with a simple click: in this sense, we must applaud the development team, which has optimally adapted the game commands to the computer keyboard and the mouse, which you can use on its own to do just about everything. The keys are also fully customizable and the controls are obviously also available for the joypad. Technically speaking Still on the subject, but taking a look at the aesthetic aspect of the product, it must be said that Disgaea on PC re-proposes the good things already seen in its previous incarnations on consoles, limiting itself to some graphic tweaks which, however, do not always enhance what it's probably one of the best two-dimensional graphics ever. The characters are also well characterized from an aesthetic point of view, effectively drawn by the graphsthere by Nippon Ichi Software; however, they are those of the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable edition, which is why they are pixelated and chromatically a little more faded than the rest. There is a special option that should improve the vision of the same, but in reality this only ends up making them more blurry and it is advisable to keep it deactivated. Beautiful, in relation to the comic style adopted by the development team, also the environments where the battles and the explorable areas take place, which among other things present a new set of more detailed textures specially created for the PC edition: nothing transcendental, mind you, but a pleasant addition that certainly improves the visual impact of the scenarios. In general, the animations and the various effects are nice, especially those related to the special attacks of the protagonists, often really crazy by concept, while we point out the frame rate as a negative note, which at 30 frames per second with V-sync active has limped in some breakers. Trying to change some settings we didn't get better results: for example, disabling the V-sync speeds up everything that moves on the screen a little too much, while with SSAO enabled, compared to an overall visual gain, we have every so found some visual artifact. They are obviously not huge or insurmountable problems, the kind that seriously affect the enjoyment of the game and therefore weigh excessively on the final grade, but their presence is certainly a little annoying. Different speech as regards the sound sector, which can boast the presence of the dual language English and Japanese while the text on the screen is only in English, a fair variety of sounds and a good soundtrack, even if in the long run this perhaps ends up becoming a little repetitive. Luckily, new songs can be purchased in the in-game store.", "date": "2016-02-24", "grade": "8.0"}
