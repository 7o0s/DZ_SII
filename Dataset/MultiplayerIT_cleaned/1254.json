Mizner can be taken as a sort of red thread linking all the RPG production of recent years. In fact, the developers, perhaps moved by the sometimes far-fetched belief that by adding the characteristics of several genres, one must also add the number of enthusiasts as future buyers of the final product, are continually churning out games that wink in an often blatant way now at this, now at that aspect of some illustrious predecessor. It seems that the key to progress is contamination, but we tend to forget that, in order for several genres to coexist, it is also necessary for each of them to exist independently, otherwise any definition loses its meaning. We leave these considerations of a general nature to the space in the box opposite, and limit ourselves here to using them as a starting point for introducing Sacred, the new action-rpg developed by the German company Ascaron. The key word is precisely ~action-rpg~: we are dealing with a product that combines typical elements of a role-playing game (such as the advancement and growth of the character, the personalization of his inventory, the main and secondary missions, the free exploration of the world) to purely action elements, i.e. a combat determined not only by the character's abilities, but also by the player's reflexes. This is certainly nothing new, and in fact few RPGs nowadays boast of being ~original~; as we said above, most of the time the products are exalted precisely by emphasizing their proximity to certain illustrious predecessors. The most illustrious predecessor in this case is undoubtedly Blizzard's Diablo II, perhaps still unsurpassed in its genre; but titles such as Divine Divinity, of which the sequel Beyond Divinity is imminent, nor the award-winning (and much-regreted) Baldur's Gate, mentioned by the developers themselves when presenting their effort. However, it is worth immediately clearing up a misunderstanding: Sacred is not a ~clone~ of Diablo or of the other titles mentioned above, it has its own personality and introduces elements of innovation that are not very great but such as to form the backbone of a product which, however, shows some originality. It was perhaps to be expected, given the developers: Ascaron is not a group of inexperienced but of highly renowned authors of management games with an economic background and with vague strategic forays; their latest Patrician III, thanks also to a skilful promotion and distribution, is literally monopolizing the interest of discussion groups dedicated to strategists practically all over Europe. Sacred is their first action role-playing game, and to be a first work (at least in the genre), it must be said that the results are more than satisfactory. [CS]It is worthwhile, however, to immediately clear the field of a misunderstanding: Sacred is not a ~clone~ of Diablo..[/CS] The character structure Sacred is set in a traditional fantasy universe, where pleasant farming villages and majestic castles alternate with desolate lands and camps of orcs and bandits. The first operation that the player must perform is to choose one of the six available characters: the gladiator, the combat mage, the ~seraphim~, the dark elf, the elf of the woods or the vampire. These are predefined characters and cannot be further customized at the start of the game, just like the characters in Diablo II; the character selection screen also recalls the Blizzard title, with the difference that in Sacred each of the figures also pronounces a presentation phrase when we pass the mouse pointer over it. The swirl of characters covers the entire traditional fantasy ~spectrum~: ranging from the strong warrior (the gladiator) to the frail magician (the ~seraphim~), passing through a whole series of intermediate combinations. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the level advancement system is also reminiscent of Diablo II; in reality, there are differences and they are profound. Let's start by saying that each character is outlined by three registers of values: characteristics, passive skills and active skills. The characteristics are the usual: strength, dexterity, constitution, and so on; every time our character gains a level, the program consequently also increases its characteristics, leaving us to distribute only one point: in this way the characteristics are customizable, but it is impossible to distance a character too far from its specialization ( a gladiator's strength always increases by a lot, for example, even if the player always puts his point in another characteristic). Passive skills are also common to all p'scharacters, and range from increased proficiency with a certain weapon to the ability to regenerate active skills faster to greater physical endurance; what varies from character to character is the level at which these skills become accessible. War skills, for example, are accessible early to the gladiator, but very late to the ~seraphim~. At each level-up, the player gets the opportunity to distribute a certain number of points among the passive skills; when certain levels are reached, the possibility of adding some new passive skills is also offered: however, everything is left to the player's choice. Click to view the whole gallery Active skills are the ~special moves~ or spells you can cast during gameplay using the right mouse button - these are unique to each character. The real element of novelty lies precisely in these skills, which, unlike the passive ones, are not earned with increasing experience: in theory, they are all accessible from the start, only that, to use one of them, it is necessary find the related ~rune~. These runes are part, and herein lies the novelty, of the ~random~ treasures, i.e. the treasures that the program randomly generates in the enemies' inventories or in the various receptacles placed in the environments. The point is, therefore, that no preventive strategy related to the development of active skills is possible in Sacred; surfing the net, you will find guides that explain step by step how to grow a character in Diablo II, analyzing in detail the distribution of skill points at each level up: none of this is possible in Sacred. This element of randomness has positive aspects as well ...no preventive strategy regarding the development of active skills is possible in Sacred The character structure negative aspects: among the first, an exponential increase in replayability can clearly be placed, even with the same character; among the latter, however, it should be considered the fact that, not being able to count on a ~unique~ development of the skills, the programmers had to relegate the latter to a more accessory role than what happens in Diablo II, for obvious balancing reasons. Then of course things change depending on the character chosen: if it is relatively simple to play with a warrior without making use of active skills, the matter becomes decidedly more complicated with classes directed towards the magical arts. Active skills can also be improved: in fact, if our character finds the rune of a skill he already possesses again, that skill will be increased by one point and will become more effective. The use of active skills is not determined, as often happens, by the ~mana~, which is absent in Sacred; each can be used indefinitely, but a few seconds of ~recharge~ must pass between one use and the next. Interface elements In Sacred, the character is in the center of the screen and always stays there. Moving is done using the left mouse button; with the same button the interaction with the world also takes place (collection of objects, dialogues, simple attack). The right button is delegated to active skills. Weapons and active skills are selected by placing them in the appropriate slots, respectively at the bottom left and bottom right of the screen; initially only one slot per type is available, but as our character grows, the available slots also increase. It is possible to switch from one weapon to another and from one skill to another also via a system of keyboard shortcuts. The inventory screen summarizes the owned objects, the skills learned through the runes as well as all the characteristics of the character: all the elements present in this part of the interface are very traditional and will be recognized instantly by any fan. The diary is very detailed: in addition to the various quests (not coldly listed but accompanied by a rather extensive explanation) we will find all the books collected during the adventure, a part dedicated to statistics, a precise description of the character and the skills learned. On the other hand, the automapping system can be improved, which in any case performs its function more than worthily; by pressing (continuously) the TAB key, an ~in game~ map appears which shows all the places close to our character; the whole world, on the other hand, is displayed in a separate map, which also indicates all the positions of the shops and in general of the available ~services~. In addition to the traditional merchants, ready to sell and buy goods in exchange for gold, we will meet blacksmiths , masters of ~combo~ ehorse traders. Blacksmiths can enhance our weapons and armor by inserting runes or jewels into them, a bit like in Diablo II, with the important difference that in Sacred, blacksmiths can also remove previously set runes and jewels from their location. The ~combo~ masters are used to create combinations of active skills, which can be connected in a sort of ~sequencer~ so that they can be launched simultaneously with a single click of the mouse; with a careful use of the combos it is possible to create truly lethal moves, but there is a contraindication: usually the recharge time of the combos is very high, compared to that of simple active skills; therefore we will be able to use these ~special moves~ only in the most critical moments. The horse traders realize one of the biggest dreams of computer role-playing players, namely the possibility of using mounts to move more quickly in the game world. There are horses of various types and of various power but, in order to maintain a certain balance, the programmers have chosen to inhibit the use of most of the skills by the characters on horseback: it is possible to fight on a steed but it is much more complicated to survive one difficult fight; this makes the use of mounts advisable only when moving to already ~pacified~ areas (in the game there is a respawn, but by revisiting a previously ~clean~ area you will encounter much fewer enemies than the first time). Fortunately, the horse can be temporarily left in the city without risk, since with a simple whistle it will rush close to our character, even if he is in a very distant area. The structure of the world and quests The originality of Sacred lies above all in the way the game world is organized. The kingdom of Ancaria is, in this case, a single immense map, where there are no loading points and only very few obligatory routes. The main quest is divided into four acts, but each of them does not correspond to a different setting, as happens in Diablo II or Neverwinter Nights: all moments of the plot take place in the world map, which is open and freely explorable right from the start. start of the game. Naturally, the main quest helps us by directing us to areas with monsters suitable for the changing level of our character, but nothing prevents us from roaming from the beginning in areas populated by very ferocious monsters. The vastness of the world is impressive, hours of real time are needed to get from one part of its borders to the other; fortunately, in addition to horses, there are also ~magic portals~ similar to the ~destinations~ of Diablo II to make our movements faster. In Ancaria, rather varied settings alternate, from villages and cities to forests, from sunny deserts to solitary snowy lands. The originality of Sacred lies above all in the way the game world is organized. The structure of the world and quests In addition to the main quest, there are countless side quests in Sacred. In fact, practically every city and every village we visit will be dotted with NPCs (non-playing characters) with some question marks in their heads: these are NPCs anxious to give us some task, which our character will be free to accept or refuse (if refuses can still accept later). The secondary missions are very similar and all rather trivial: usually it is a question of killing some particularly powerful monsters, or of recovering some objects. The reward is usually twofold: gold and experience points. The experience gained from completing side quests is substantial, and this also helps differentiate Sacred from Diablo II. The assignment of missions and the completion of the same is practically the only way that our character has to interact with the many non-hostile NPCs that populate the game world; in Sacred, in fact, there are no dialogues worthy of the name. The NPCs will tell us a few sentences relating to the area or the story's background, and our character is not allowed any kind of answer. The character of the various settlements contributes to increasing our hero's sense of ~loneliness~, very little differentiated and generally rather anonymous: the vastness of the world and the variety of settings are counterbalanced by a decidedly insufficient socio-ethnographic environmental construction, which makes so that it is almost impossible, after long hours spent completing the campaign, to remember the name of a single city where our hero set foot in his wanderings. Something more will remain in mind of the main story, which although not the maximum originality has i", "date": "2004-07-13", "grade": null}
