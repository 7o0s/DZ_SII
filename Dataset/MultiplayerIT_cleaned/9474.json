The hype generated around the famous target render had serious repercussions when the shooter in the first person came out concretely on the market 4 years later: the public literally split in two, divided between those who loved a characteristic and extremely personal game feeling and those who could not get over a rather flat and repetitive level design and the lack of a noteworthy plot. Few, however, returned to discuss Sony's exceptional marketing move because the technical work done by the guys at Guerrilla Games was unquestionably excellent. Killzone 3 arrives on the market exactly two years after its predecessor probably more muted but no less awaited by all fans of the saga. And what we can already say after playing it far and wide is that we certainly liked it but to a lesser extent than the prequel. Six months before, six months after In fact, Killzone 3 lives within an incredible paradox for some design choices followed by the development team: a decisive lightening of the controls and physicality that distinguished the second title and a search for an extremely more accurate and detailed level design but at the same much more fragmentary time, they made Killzone 3 an FPS decidedly more in line with today's canons. And here is the paradox: the loss of those typical connotations of the series in favor of the purchase of gameplay traits made standard by the various Call of Duty and Halo (which are two obvious sources of inspiration in this sequel), could please the third effort of Guerrilla to all those who have not been able to digest the predecessor but, as written a little above, there is no doubt that the players who have instead loved it for its particularities, will find themselves displaced and perhaps disappointed by Killzone 3. But now let's go down into the details of the game instead of going further. The sequel takes place over a period of approximately 6 months: through the classic system of flashbacks and flashforwards we will play a sort of tutorial set forward in time, and then go back to carry out a handful of missions exactly starting from the epilogue of the second Killzone. Missions that will then return to connect to the setting seen in the opening of the game and will continue until narrating the final assaults of Sev, Rico and Narville on what remains of the devastated planet Helghan. If the good protagonists remain practically the same, with minimal additions worthy of note, the bad guys are brand new. With the Mussolini emperor Scolar Visari filed away, the Helghast's misdeeds are now directed by Admiral Orlock (clearly inspired by Stalin, probably for a level playing field) and something between a managing director and an army general in charge of the industries nation's military, Jorhan Stahl. The two are then surrounded by a whole series of advisers and secondary ~specks~. The narrated story is in any case very present and incisive with even rather long cutscenes that often transship within the missions to show some crucial event and highlight a change of objective or an expansion of the front. Nonetheless, the narrative canvas remains extremely superficial, at times even banal, with obvious and approximate dialogues and sudden changes of scenery that try to cover the sometimes extreme level design choices. In fact, it is often evident how the narrative bends to the need to justify why we are in that scenario rather than the other way around: it is almost a mere glue to hold the various levels together and this is regrettable given that Guerrilla's effort to giving more substance and body to a universe, the one that sees the ISA battle with the Helghast which, at least on paper, could be extremely interesting. Playstation 3 trophies Killzone 3 offers 52 trophies of which 20 are secrets related to the single player and cooperative campaign, its progress and the completion of some objectives within the missions such as the destruction of certain targets when in vehicles. Part of the ~free~ trophies are instead linked to the killing of certain quantities of Helghast and the use of some weapons or explosives. To top it all off there are about ten trophies related to multiplayer and in particular to the use of the different classes. During the review session including single and multiplayer we did not encounter particular difficulties in unlocking just under 50% of the available trophies. Advancing like prawns Killzone 3 can be playedgame with four different difficulty levels, the last of which is unlocked only after completing it for the first time. The advice of the writer, as often happens for first-person shooters, is to play it immediately at the highest level available. In fact, unlike the prequel, there are never really frustrating situations (as happened with the epic final battle in the Visari palace) and the action gains depth and intensity. Provided therefore that you are experienced enough in the genre, the nine missions that make up the game's campaign can be completed in a good eight hours. However, there are more difficult moments above all due to the rather fluctuating artificial intelligence. The enemies perform particularly effective and intelligent guerrilla warfare with many grenade launches to force the player to come out and a realistic tendency to move from cover and lean out of it to help any comrades involved in encirclement tactics. At the same time, however, it has happened on more than one occasion to see the enemies stunned, especially when far from cover or in elevated positions. On the other hand, their allies are decidedly more deficient, who can be divided into two sections: the nameless soldiers who, in Call of Duty style, limit themselves to going forward in the fray in waves only to be mowed down within a few seconds and the companion of mission, usually Rico, who in a more prudent and realistic way tends to make better use of the covers. However, even he performs really stupid actions, especially when he has to show us the way forward and can rarely be considered an important aid in battle. Furthermore, compared to the second Killzone, now we too can be healed if critically injured, but it seems that the developers wanted to implement a trick to avoid the abuse of this possibility. In fact, we happened to notice that usually if you end up on the ground more than a couple of times in the same situation, Rico or someone else will tell you that they are unable to reach you, even if in death view you will see him walking calmly a few meters from you. Also noteworthy is Guerrilla's decision to offer the player the possibility of carrying a third weapon, the heavy one. In this way, with the digital cross, in addition to being able to select a pistol and a machine gun, it will be possible to equip the rocket launcher or, later, the arc cannon, a particularly high-performance missile launcher, the WASP and an explosive dart rifle. Even the fixed turrets can be dropped and taken with you, without going to occupy the precious slots of the more classic weapons. Repeating what has already been said at the beginning, the level design boasts an enviable variety, however losing that homogeneity that distinguished the second Killzone and dangerously approaching the typical canons of the genre. We therefore find situations of urban warfare, pitched battles where large numbers are the protagonists and scenarios where instead one advances in small groups. The levels aboard vehicles and mechs are inevitable (perhaps the lowest qualitative peak of the entire experience) and the stealth-style map where you advance following the instructions of your partner who offers directives on timing and the enemy to kill is obvious. We don't want to go into more detail, perhaps ruining the surprise, but the inspiration for Activision's best seller and, especially in the finale, for Halo, is sometimes very evident. The coverage remains fundamentally unchanged compared to its predecessor, now certainly more amalgamated and above all faster in responding to commands but with two interesting additions. First of all, the slide that can be activated simply by running and pressing the button to enter cover; in addition, the possibility of literally jumping over the cover has been implemented. Thanks to these innovations, the gameplay accelerates considerably, the melee shots (particularly violent in this sequel) gain in utility and the covers enter more fluidly in the player's movements and in the tactical component of the shootings: covering up becomes really fundamental because even in Killzone 3, as in the prequel, going forward with the weapon leveled and head down only leads to premature death. Helghasts are tough to take down and with a well-aimed volley they'll smash you to a pulp. Group fun The steps forward made with this chapter in the multiplayer field are absolutely indisputable, however, with one big drawback. The Killzone 3 campaign can in fact be played entirely in cooperatives but, and here's the negative note, only and exclusively inlocal split screen, with a friend sitting next to you. And, as if this weren't enough, the co-op campaign doesn't take into account what has been done in single. This means that even if you have finished the game alone, you will be forced to start from the beginning in case you want to play in cooperatives. On the other hand, the news for competitive multiplayer is only positive. The Warzone mode remains with support for up to 24 players and its mission-based gameplay already seen in Killzone 2, while Guerrilla, a classic 16-player team deathmatch and Operations are brand new for this sequel. It is basically another mission-based game mode where a team of players must infiltrate the opposing base through various stages of objectives. The peculiarity of the gameplay is represented by real cutscenes that divide the game phases and which narrate what is happening, giving the players a breather and preparing them tactically for what they will have to do next. Also in this case the maximum supported players are 16. The maps included in the game are instead 8 but not all are available for all game modes. It is also essential to point out a sort of skirmish, called Zona Bot which represents to all intents and purposes an offline solo multiplayer. In fact, by accessing this option it will be possible to play competitive modes by replacing the opponents in the flesh with bots controlled by artificial intelligence. In this way it will be possible to practice with the gameplay and with the maps and test the various classes taking advantage of the fact that all the upgrades are unlocked by default. And since we're talking about classes, a great deal of innovation for the series has also been done in the system that manages their enhancement. In total there are five (from the doctor to the engineer, passing through the spy, the sniper and the tactician) and each one has two specific skills, a primary, a secondary and a heavy weapon. By gaining experience during multiplayer you earn levels, ranks and unlock points that can be spent to enhance the two skills or increase the available arsenal, all in a way, however, unrelated to the class used. In this way the player is free to invest his points and above all to experiment with all the classes without binding himself to one in particular. Finally, as you rank up, you gain access to a small selection of general abilities (such as power armor or larger magazines) and two different types of grenades. Moves in 3D We could not test the game with a 3D TV under review but for all the details on this mode, we refer you to the detailed test edited by Antonio Fucito on the occasion of the PlayStation Experience. As far as the Move is concerned, Killzone 3 offers full support to the Sony peripheral which must be accompanied for obvious reasons by the navigation controller or by a normal pad. Once active, it will be possible to configure the sensitivity on the various axes and the amount of auto-aim which is however automatically deactivated starting from the third difficulty level and when playing in multiplayer. The detection is quite precise and responsive but we do not recommend the use of the Move to fully enjoy Killzone 3 considering the great precision required in aiming and a certain reactivity essential to respond to the events in the game. Using the Sony movement device, in fact, a certain slowness is acquired in making the protagonist turn, as it is necessary to move the viewfinder to the most extreme edge to rotate the view and this can have repercussions especially in the sections on board the vehicles. Killzone 3: The Official Guide The official Killzone 3 strategy guide, written taking into account all difficulty levels, including Elite, will be released in shops on March 11th at a cost of 19.90. Among its pages you will find tips and tricks to successfully complete the single player campaign, to be immediately competitive in multiplayer mode and leave nothing to chance. Each of the maps featured in the game has been analyzed in depth, revealing the best positions for snipers, the ideal strategies for controlling an area and the shortest path between one objective and the next and much more. Furthermore, by purchasing the guide, you will be entitled to two unlock points to immediately start your experience with the new Guerrilla title. What a show! Also technically Killzone 3 can hardly be argued. The glance offered by every single level of the game is always exceptional thanks to the extreme variety of level design that leads us to explore very different scenarios from each other: from the environment", "date": "2011-02-14", "grade": "9.0"}
