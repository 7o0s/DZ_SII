We have many examples in this sense on the App Store and Google Play, from Framed to 80 Days, passing through the never too praised Monument Valley: titles capable of exploring innovative mechanics and structures, which guarantee a different experience than usual. This preamble to say that even the Mediocre guys, already authors of the interesting Smash Hit, have bet on the concepts and pulled out of the hat a peculiar mix between driving, strategic and puzzle game, enriched by a pleasant 70s atmosphere and based on a very valid intuition, that of the time paradox. Does not Commute tells the story of various characters, each driving a different vehicle, whose lives intertwine (literally) within a handful of roads and intersections. There are the nurse who returns home after a grueling shift, the employee who is late for an appointment, the elderly gentleman who likes to take a walk in complete tranquility: everyone has to get from point A to point B, and all are part of a puzzle to be solved. The trajectory followed by each driver is in fact memorized and makes up the traffic we will gradually have to deal with, in an attempt to avoid collisions and to complete all the required routes within a time limit that only the bonuses on the road can lengthen. In the event of a mistake, a rewind button at the top left resets the last maneuver and allows us to repeat it, albeit at the cost of a precious second. Does not Commute is a particularly fascinating and original title, a difficult but highly enjoyable challenge The second on the right Does not Commute can be downloaded for free on iOS and Android devices and played in an ~endless~ way, but it also allows you to switch to the premium version by spending 1.99 euros (2.21 euros on Android) and thus unlock the checkpoints, therefore the ability to restart the campaign from the last stage reached. A solution extremely similar to the one seen in the aforementioned Smash Hit, which allows you to decide how we want to enjoy the experience, without resorting to any other in-app purchase: nor the traditional energy bar that is consumed with attempts, nor of the fake ~continues~, nor of the paid upgrades. The power-ups are there, in fact, but they can be used freely, when we deem it appropriate: they improve the road holding of the vehicle, increase its speed or make it immune to impacts; and we will see many impacts during the game, unless we study the first trajectories in such a way as to never centrally invade a lane. All by referring to a very simple and responsive touch control system, where a press on the left or right of the screen determines the direction of the car, but where it is not possible to brake or vary the speed. This means that you have to deal with the tantrums of a rampant vehicle, as well as the exasperating slowness of an old small car or bus. There is certainly a lot of ~trial & error~ in the gameplay of the new Mediocre title, and also a lot of frustration when you crash a few seconds from the end of a level, given that the impacts definitely slow down our movements; however, when the elements of the experience ~fit together~ properly, things work damn well and the satisfaction is great. Given these undoubted advantages and a pleasant but only functional technical sector for the action, it is a pity that only the interface has been translated into Italian and that all the texts relating to the characters are in English, because in this way we lose inevitably a little involvement with respect to the intertwining of situations.", "date": "2015-05-02", "grade": "8.0"}
