{"name": "NBA 2K7 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-2k7-recensione.html", "text": "It's definitely a golden age for basketball. After the new chapter of the EA Sports saga, comes that of the famous Visual Concepts, a team that has been working on the NBA 2k brand for years. If the last edition represented a somewhat hasty debut in the next gen, this new update comes with all the credentials to become an absolute reference in the genre. Party People The first thing that catches your eye once you start the game is the new menu setting, which is decidedly original. All modes are managed through a drop-down system that can be called up with the right analog stick, while the quick match, the most frequently used mode, is presented instantly through a scenic polygonal city, with the logos of the teams to choose from projected onto two skyscrapers. This system allows you to enter the actual game (through a spectacular zoom in the arena) in surprising times, thanks to a loading system well camouflaged by special effects. Not only that, the overlay menus are available at any time (think Xbox Guide in the 360 dashboard), allowing you to instantly switch between quick play, league, den or street basketball. On the other hand, however, the system often proves to be a bit too cumbersome and not very intuitive, forcing the user to call up the menus even just to go back from a page. And considering the complexity and things to do in NBA 2k7, it's no small matter. The game stands out for the high number of modes and for the level of customization, since you can change practically everything, from the rules on the pitch, to the speed. The possibility of creating 10 teams from scratch, drawing players from the large roster from the US league, is welcome. But it is certainly in the association and street basketball mode that the care taken by the programmers is noticeable: the first simulates the real NBA championship, presenting an interesting managerial insight, the second brings the competition to city courts. Precisely from these the 24: 7 mode develops, a kind of story mode, in which we will be able to create a player from scratch to make him embark on the long journey towards the stars of basketball. Also present this year is the den, a special room, typical of 2k sports, where it is possible to play mini-games, keep trophies, and even unlock classic players (who said Michael Jordan?). Not to mention the complex Live mode, which we will delve into later. All in the field with Shaq Once on the parquet we can finally admire the graphic update created by Visual Concepts. It is immediately evident that the engine is the same as last year, but the programmers had a year to optimize it to the fullest, with decidedly appreciable results. This time the scenographic impact is simply frightening, with an entirely polygonal stadium, enriched by details that only those who don't play will be able to grasp. The home team's mascot moves non-stop, running between the seats, annoying the public, or bursting onto the pitch during time outs and intervals. The entire sideline is teeming with animated polygonal characters, from the coaches, to the substitutes, the cheerleaders, and even the parquet cleaner! One of the things that struck us the most is the routine that manages the public, it can happen that someone gets up to go for a drink, or to the bathroom, even in the upper rings. These are details that amplify the identification to hitherto unknown levels. In the real field, things are even better, with a profoundly improved animation sector since last year, all in the splendor of 60fps. Now each player has his own unique scoring moves, moves that are impressive in terms of fidelity to real-life counterparts. The independent movements of the uniforms are still surprising, as is the sweat, particularly noticeable in close-ups and replays. As icing on the cake, everything is embellished by a direction that seems to have diligently learned from the EA Sports school, with interlocks accompanied by hip hop music, sponsors and much more. A truly abnormal work that will only be appreciated by those who closely follow the American championship, but which demonstrates the total dedication of this software house to the sporting discipline. However, there are still details that lower the visual evaluation, in this case the realization of some faces which is really bad, and the situation does not improve even with those more relevant to reality. The style adopted by the programmers seems more caricatured than realistic, as does the insistence on presenting bright, almost cartoonish tones. Annoying even the handchange of a lighting system, which makes the image exaggeratedly flat. Overall looks great, but we feel the engine needs some heavy refinement work to stand the test of time. De-fence! A very different matter on the gameplay side, where the Visual Concepts title has already reached the state of grace, so much so that it is affectionately considered the PES of basketball by many players. A compliment not just, but amply deserved. The simulation complexity has reached dizzying levels, with the Isomotion special moves system (complex but satisfying), a more effective implementation of the blocking, the dunks, the alley hoops, and all the moves that one can expect in a real game. The product, like its predecessors, is still characterized by a notable difficulty, especially against the CPU, suspiciously reactive towards the counterattack, deadly under the basket. While the high percentage of error that characterizes our players still leaves some suspects, with borderline cases in which it happens to see a Kobe Bryant about to dunk, but with the ball already in the hands of the defense. The free throws are in line with the general hardness, the choice to manage them through the right analog stick probably arises from the need not to excessively alter the balance of the game, but the timing required frankly seemed excessive to us. The street basketball mode deserves particular mention for the graphical improvements compared to the last edition. The fields are made much better, and it is possible to face matches of up to five against five, both in the half and full fields, and the playability takes on a more aggressive tone. A real game within a game, an ideal pastime between one game and another. How do you consider this player? On the online side, Nba 2k7 is perhaps the title with the most advanced support, together with NHL 2K7, ever seen on Xbox Live. It is possible to play ranked or player matches, entire leagues and online tournaments, complete with dedicated lobbies. The attention paid to relations with the other players is particularly appreciable, the phases dedicated to team management are not visible to the opponent, and a small interesting survey is proposed at the end of the match. It will be possible to report to the servers if the player has assumed correct sporting ethics in the match, in order to filter the subsequent ones in order to obtain a balanced online experience. Unfortunately we encountered lag problems in the games, the fluidity left something to be desired, with a framerate halved compared to the offline one, and the free throws were afflicted by a strange shaking that made correct execution practically impossible. Issues that we hope will be resolved as soon as possible by 2K Sports. Goals NBA 2K7's goal system follows the trend of all recent games. Instead of presenting 6 of 150 points, the total 1000 are divided into many small objectives, of variable difficulty. It starts from ranked victories to scoring with certain players, to performing certain actions on the pitch. It is probable that the player achieves them randomly rather than targeted, since many, if not all, are directly proportional to the time invested in the actual game. And we assure you that it will take a lot... Comment NBA 2K7 has assumed a now mythological fame among basketball fans, with good reason, since it is the best videogame representation of this spectacular sport. Visual Concepts has worked hard to dilute an already high caliber gameplay, embellishing it with an excellent graphics engine, to be enjoyed strictly on HD displays. Perfection still doesn't exist, certain aesthetic gaps need to be reviewed, and we would have liked more leniency in games against the CPU. But they are minor details compared to the experience that this title is able to give. For basketball fanatics it is a daydream, hoping that the online problems will be resolved as soon as possible, which will somewhat mitigate the enthusiasm for this production. Pros High playability Exciting scenographic impact Definitely vast Cons Some faces are really badly made Free throws too challenging Online not very fluid", "date": "2006-11-14", "grade": null}
