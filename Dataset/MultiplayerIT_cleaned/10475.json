Titles of great technical quality were created, which however promptly got lost when it came to the point, or rather the pure and simple gameplay. The use of the iPhone touch screen and the creation of d-pads and virtual buttons has not yet fully convinced, so few expected great things from the new Gameloft fighting game. Well, we are faced with the proverbial exception that proves the rule: Blades of Fury is not only beautiful to look at but also fun to play, thanks to a control system that works really well and allows us to face our opponents almost as if we were holding a real joypad . There are two possible choices to play: icon control and gesture control. In the first case (probably the best for immediacy and precision) we can carry out the three types of attack (horizontal, vertical and magical) and the parry by pressing the relative buttons on the touch screen; in the second case, the execution of these maneuvers takes place after having ~drawn~ the lines or keeping the fingers still on the screen. The movement of the character is instead always delegated to the virtual stick, which can be changed in favor of a less versatile d-pad if desired. The surprising thing about the game is its completeness, understood as the number of moves that can be made both offensively and defensively: our character can produce spectacular combos, grab the enemy in a devastating grip, perform a spiritual attack of different power, parry or dodge attacks, better manage the impact with the ground and even roll before getting up. The armor of the soul The story behind Blades of Fury clearly draws inspiration from that of Soul Calibur, only that in this case the ten available warriors (some unlockable by completing the game, as per practice) instead of challenging each other for the conquest of a sword are looking for a magical armour. The motivations of each character are different and sometimes unfortunately end up a bit ridiculous, but we must appreciate the fact that each of them has a reason, that is, that one does not fall too much into the stereotypes associated with fighting games and instead, the focus is on the peculiarities provided not only by the weapons supplied but also by the armor. In fact, each character is equipped with a different tool (swords, spears, daggers, whips, etc.) which makes his attack maneuvers unique, and at the same time he can count on a protection which, however, can be broken when he suffers a number of hits, leaving him stunned for a few moments. The normal combos are accompanied by a magical attack whose bar is charged by taking hits and which can be used at three power levels: in its most effective version, it can be truly devastating and can make a difference. In these situations, the opponents' AI is a bit disappointing, in the sense that they often stand there waiting for us to charge the magical attack and then suffer it without even parrying. Fortunately, this is an isolated case, in the sense that in all other situations the behavior of the enemies appears plausible and sometimes even shrewd, with a clear improvement as the fights ensue. As for the modes available, Blades of Fury allows us to try our hand at an interesting ~story mode~, an ~arcade mode~ and a classic survival mode. Unfortunately, multiplayer is only possible locally, via wi-fi or bluetooth. Too bad, because an online challenge mode would have really made a splash. Technical realization Graphically, Gameloft's new title pushes the iPhone almost to PSP levels, which is saying something. The polygonal models of the characters betray the simplicity of their structure due to a few too many edges, but in general an excellent job has been done both as regards it's about quality rather than style. The animations are good and quite fluid, also we must consider the ~active~ role of the armor in the economy of the game, since their breakage is visible. The scenarios available are numerous and generally well done, full of details and characterized by generous dimensions, even if during the fights we will be able to move only within the confines of the ~ring~ (just like in Soul Calibur, ending up outside the square translates into a defeat). The sound sector accompanies the action in the best way, thanks to good music and effects. Moreover, it is possible to play by listening to your own playlist.
