{"name": "Devils Hunt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devils-hunt-recensione.html", "text": "As you will understand by reading the review, Devil's Hunt is a Devil May Cry that didn't make it. There is good will, some things are good, but it is the whole that is lacking. One might say that to make an action these days you need much larger budgets than what Layopi Games had, but here the problems are above all structural and go much further than some ugly textures or some skipping animation. History Devil's Hunt is based on the novels of the Equilibrium series by the Polish writer Pawe Leniak, of which we frankly know little or nothing (they are not translated into Italian or English as far as we know: the writer's official website is only in Polish), part that also founded the development studio. The story of the game is quite simple: Desmond, the protagonist, son of a wealthy businessman and lover of clandestine boxing matches, has one of those days that to define as bad is an understatement (we won't reveal the details so as not to give you too many advances). Finished in hell, he gets to be able to return to earth thanks to Lucifer, who makes him his executor: essentially a soul-devouring demon. In short, however, the situation becomes quite complicated and our hero, not too by chance, ends up transforming himself into the main actor of a new conflict that has flared up between angels and demons. What his role is clarified on several occasions, even if the machinations that form the background to the plot are revealed only in the second half of the adventure. It's a pity for the abuse of clichs and for the highly televised plot twists which, combined with characters as deep as a glass, somewhat frustrate the general theme, which would like to aim for the universal but ends up taking on decidedly adolescent tones. structural, the story of Devil's Hunt is divided into chapters, each set in different places. On his journey Desmond will visit buildings under construction, infernal circles, abandoned motels, glitzy skyscrapers, damp prisons, some neighborhoods of his city and a whole series of other very dangerous places. From a purely scenographic point of view, the title of Layopi is really well done, especially in the infernal levels that seem to be traced by the metal imaginary, between gigantic Gothic towers, lakes of flames and blood, cages full of the damned, destroyed bridges and so on. It is a pity that the magnificence and spectacularity of some locations, which we reiterate are capable of producing truly breathtaking landscapes, clash a bit with the anonymity of that boiled fish of the protagonist, obviously a tough guy with an always ready joke (yawn), even when they are about to skin him alive. In general, the character models smell very much of ~stock~, even in the animations (apart from the protagonist). The monsters are doing better, even if the general style is not very original and they all know they have already seen it. After all, hell is that, one might say. Gameplay: exploration In terms of gameplay, Devil's Hunt is a clean and very linear game. Even too much, as we shall see. Basically, Desmond's entire adventure is a mixture of cinematic sequences and exploratory phases full of fights, in which there are very few things to do and very few elements to interact with. Exploration is the game's first big problem: it's just an interlude between one fight and the next. The level structure of Devil's Hunt is the most linear we've come across in recent times. Not bad, one might say, except that the only actions allowed to the player are walking, running and pressing a key when the icon appears that indicates a possible interaction to proceed from area to area (white squares). Let's give some examples: do we have to climb on a ledge? Just get under it, press the interact button and watch the automatic animation of Desmond climbing. Do we have to crawl through a tunnel? Ditto: interaction key and go. Everything is automated to a fault, with very flat and uninteresting level design made up of small areas stuck together. Even the few puzzles encountered are disarmingly simple and often only require you to... press the interaction key after finding a certain object, for example a sacred symbol to be destroyed to remove a barrier, or a large chain that supports a tower of hell. For the rest, there are some secrets around, slips of paper with drawings or writings on them, which give some details on the background of the story being told, and mirrors full of souls, to be broken in order to be able to assimilate them (by pressing the usual key interaction, of course). Too bad mirrors and secrets are always in plain sight. Sincertainly it had never happened to us to finish a game in the first game by finding all the secrets without the slightest effort, moreover, and without these significantly affecting the game time. In short, Devil's Hunt from an exploration point of view is really rigid and creates situations that we do not hesitate to define as embarrassing. For example, in one situation we climbed onto a crate by pressing the usual interaction key. Looking around we saw a single soul on the ground that we decided to go collect. Too bad the game system prevented us from doing this: yes, in most cases Desmond can't go back after an interaction. Are you on a crate? You can only continue to follow the trail of white squares, because jumping to the ground is not possible. Combat system The best part of Devil's Hunt is certainly the combat system, which is not without its problems. Whenever a group of enemies is encountered, Desmond activates his infernal powers which allow him not only to throw punches of different strengths, but also to use some special techniques. The latter are linked to three skill trees, one available immediately, the other two activated by certain plot events, and unlockable by spending the souls collected during the adventure. Among the powers there are passive ones, such as more life points, more demonic rage (which is needed to transform) and still others, and above all active ones, such as shooting energy waves, creating hellish flames, healing oneself, concentrating the void in one shot and so on. Active techniques must be assigned to the appropriate keys to be used during combat. You can have three of each style, with the latter being interchangeable during the action. The need to choose which techniques to bring with you guarantees a certain variety and theoretically allows you to develop your own fighting style, except that then you really have to fight and everything is a bit frustrated. Basically, to win the fights in Devil's Hunt, the important thing is to continuously use all the special techniques, which have not too punitive cooling times, learn when it is appropriate to transform into a demon, Desmond's final power that allows him to beat taking no damage for a short time, and when to initiate a combo, with these being unlocked by spending souls in the skill trees screen. Some problems in the collisions of shots with enemies (sometimes they seem to pass over the opponents without causing damage), the general slipperiness and a certain confusion of the action due to the lack of camera lock on the targets, makes developing your own technique an more difficult feat than to beat enemies as they come and use finishing moves when possible, i.e. after having weakened them enough. The general feeling is not negative, but obviously we are very far from the glories of a Devil May Cry 5 or an Astral Chain. Here everything is rougher, so to speak. Their enemies come in many varieties (angels, demons of various shapes, club-wielding behemoths, lost souls, rebellious ex-servants of Lucifer, and so on), but all with very similar attack patterns: they just charge at head down Desmond using their powers. Some stop by the distance, but that's about it. The bosses do much better, some of which are bigger and have more interesting abilities, while never being too difficult. However dealing with them is the best part of the whole adventure. Finally, several bugs and problems that afflicted our test should be noted, including subtitles that end up off the screen, jumping animations, framerate drops and more. It must be said that in the time we have been given to try the game several updates have been released which have fixed the situation a bit, so it is likely that the residual bugs will be fixed post-launch, at least the more serious ones.", "date": "2019-09-17", "grade": "5.0"}
