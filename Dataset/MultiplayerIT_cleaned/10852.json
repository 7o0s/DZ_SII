{"name": "Tiki Towers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiki-towers.html", "text": "In the Forbidden Islands hide the legendary golden masks. Given the environment which is particularly unsuitable for men, the recovery of the treasures is assigned to particularly intelligent monkeys. The main objective of Tiki Towers is summed up in bringing five primates from a certain point to the classic finish line at the end of the level, all seasoned with the collection of delicious bananas useful for the assignment of special trophies. Fruits are the key to the game: each monkey can only pick one banana and bringing home 100% of them is the only way to unlock the next levels. The stage approach is divided into two moments where the first is essential for the success of the level: the construction phase. In frozen time, a magic hand will act as a pointer for placing building material. The difficulty level is given by the real protagonists of Tiki Towers the bamboos, given that in each level there is a limited number of units and each building is fully interactive with the surrounding environment. Let's take a tower that is not too solid: as the monkeys pass, this will collapse causing the totality of the group to fail to cross, consequently the failure of the level. Once the work is completed, it is possible to free the chimpanzees to run and reach the level exit, always hoping to have done an excellent job. Otherwise we will see our creation collapse and level failure if even one primate is unable to reach the exit. Therefore very good longevity for Tiki Towers, which boasts of five islands where nine challenges will be available in each one. There are also three unlockable prizes by completing certain tasks and a hidden mode, the so-called ~ecological~, complete with a prize for completing it. The air you breathe in Tiki Towers is that of a colorful and cheerful puzzle game. Thanks to backgrounds inspired by the tropical setting and game landscapes close to temples, Tiki Towers never ceases to please the player's visual taste, however falling into the abyss of monotony since the locations of the islands all look a bit alike. The graphics engine used to simulate the interactivity between the environment and the bamboo is really well done: the bamboo rests perfectly on the platforms in the level and bears the weight of the dear little animals who will use it as a bridge or trampoline. Building a mill, for example, can be used to reach some locations, and therefore bananas, using the load of the primates as an engine for the blades. There is a limit of endurance of our creation given by environmental and design factors: if the tower is not well balanced or too taut, this limit will be inexorably exceeded due to the animal ~loveliness~ to which it will be subjected and a consequent collapse will be inevitable. The audio compartment is of good quality. The opening rhythmic background alternates with calmer moments during the game phase, ready to return to full speed as soon as the level is completed. PRO Puzzle game of increasing difficulty Immediate and simple Presence of modes to unlock AGAINST In some situations too complicated Bottoms too similar Small number of prizes", "date": "2009-02-25", "grade": "S.V."}
