And so, while this fashion shows no signs of losing its charm among cinema, literature and videogame users, Nexon also brings the latest revision of Counter-Strike to the West, adding to the original formula of the Valve shooter precisely a good dose of pathetic not dead. Officially available on Steam for a week, after a beta phase that doesn't seem to have gone smoothly between crashes, server downs, matchmaking problems and less than enthusiastic comments, Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is over virtually in our hands and we were able to test its mechanics and modalities, with an eye to the free-to-play aspect, to understand if a title originally released in 2003 (but actually dating back to four years earlier) still has something to say today, beyond the zombies. Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is a dated shooter in every aspect, from the graphics to the gameplay Vetustoooooh The impact with the game is inevitably traumatic for those who didn't expect to deal with such an outdated shooter. The technical sector therefore ends up immediately acting as a characterizing element for the experience offered by Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies. After all we are talking about a title which, in the intentions of the developers, should also run smoothly on a PC equipped with an S3 Trio video card (ok, not really but almost!), and which therefore exaggerates in terms of frame rate and resolution , however, in the face of terribly simple and angular polygonal models, animated in a sketchy way, which move within scenarios that are also particularly bare, two if not three generations old. Unfortunately, the additions made by Nexon do not improve the situation, indeed we found the skins with half-naked women quite useless, the types of zombies available terribly anonymous and badly made, while there would be a pitiful veil to be drawn on the more imaginative game modes, such as the ~football match~ in which it is possible to beat up one's opponents in an attempt to score, but which moves and works in all respects like a mediocre mod. Therefore, it is better to review the most significant part of the offer, the one that actually provides a good dose of variety without attempting anything particularly original, rather relying on well-tested models: the traditional deathmatches, the cooperative hordes and a interesting variation on the survival theme. When there's no more room in hell... The modes available in Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies are twenty, characterized in the interface by a color that indicates the type: the red ones are based on zombies, the blue ones refer to the original Counter-Strike and the green ones, as explained a little while ago, they present themselves as absurd and imaginative applications, which however leave the time they find and are quite ugly to look at and to play. It starts with ~Zombie Hero~, a real race in which a team of undead must chase humans to turn them into zombies who will then, in turn, join the chase; albeit from the point of view of a context that is not exactly friendly compared to the platform mechanics, indeed full of quite evident edges. Then there is the ~Zombie Scenario~, a Left 4 Dead-style cooperative mode that develops through a series of checkpoints, with the aim of stemming the advance of the living dead up to destroying a target in order to complete the mission. It is a pity that in this situation the weaknesses of a very cumbersome gameplay come to the surface, with ammunition running out continuously (and must be purchased on the fly, by accessing the shop screen where possible, spending the money earned during the games) and the enemies who do not think even remotely of stopping their rapid advance, proving to be far too resistant to the fire of our weapons. ~Zombie Escape~, ~Zombie Mutant~ and ~Zombie Original~ are all variants of ~Zombie Hero~, while ~Zombie Shelter~ seemed to us one of the most interesting solutions in the package, given the introduction of survival mechanics and a clear progression. In practice, a team of humans must defend a base from the nocturnal attack of CPU-controlled zombies, while during the day it is necessary to explore the scenario in search of resources necessary to build traps, turrets and structural reinforcements. A good idea, but also in this case materialized lousy, you see the bosses who are completely disinterested in attacking us if we remain at a certain distance. ...the dead will walk the earth The standard game modes, therefore those without zombies, refer to the canonsthe classics of the Counter-Strike franchise, between team deathmatches and cooperative missions in which you have to defend yourself from increasingly numerous hordes of enemies. They are pleasant for a while and are also supported by a fast and effective matchmaking, fixed after the aforementioned beta problems. The point is that when the novelty factor (the zombies) is lacking, the limits of a production that is far too dated to be attractive today emerge even more overwhelmingly, also and above all due to much more solid competition and evolved, even in the free-to-play field. By the way, it must be admitted at least that Nexon has not forced his hand to force users to buy the inevitable packages of weapons and upgrades. The pay to win is clearly present, given that by paying it is possible to obtain boosts immediately; however the discussion does not go beyond this, as the weapons are all accessible by default and can be purchased using the virtual currency earned during the games. Similarly, the crafting system that allows you to build new equipment works by putting together objects conquered on the field, thus passing the concept that experience pays off. This is actually the case, Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies can be played for free without any particular problems, especially in the cooperative modes. But with Left 4 Dead 2 available for pennies, it remains difficult to understand who the Chinese publisher really wants to turn to.", "date": "2014-10-20", "grade": "4.0"}
