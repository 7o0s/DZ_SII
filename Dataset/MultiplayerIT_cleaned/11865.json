{"name": "Alpha Wing 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/alpha-wing-2.html", "text": "Alpha Wing 2 is part of the new collection signed by Glu, a software house that has already created high-impact titles in the mobile sector and which this time is keen to demonstrate its versatility, working on difficult terrain. Mobile shoot'em-ups, in fact, in some cases boast a good technical realization but do not adapt to the type of device on which they run, resulting in cumbersome or even frustrating. It seems that now things are changing, the developers have evidently begun to take into account the limits of the control system related to many phones, and are looking for effective solutions. In this case, Glu found many solutions for Alpha Wing 2, indeed he really did a masterful job. As anticipated, the game allows us to select one of the three available characters (a girl, an alien and an android) based on the characteristics of the respective vehicles, not so much related to the agility of the vehicle as to the type of fire it produces. Once the choice has been made, we leave for the first of the three planetary systems, each divided into three stages plus the boss fight, and we begin to become familiar with the philosophy behind this shoot'em-up. Firstly, the game mechanics are classic: vertical scrolling (ideal for the mobile screen), hordes of enemies that approach in pre-established ways and shoot the impossible at us, vehicles to destroy that release power-ups. The only thing Alpha Wing 2 lacks is the classic ~smart bomb~, but on the other hand we have an energy shield which, once activated, protects us from enemy fire until it is exhausted. To use it again we will have to wait for the relative bar to fill up again, which translates into a significant strategic element, given that protection must only be used when it is really not possible to avoid an attack. The first intelligent solution found by Glu concerns the speed of enemy fire, adjusted so that it can be avoided even with a slow and insensitive joystick. The second solution has to do with the management of upgrades and the longevity of the game: with its nine stages in total (plus bosses), Alpha Wing 2 cannot be defined as a very long shoot'em-up, so the developers have thought well not to give us the opportunity to continue the game after a game over, reserving however the right to immediately access any of the levels already reached previously. It seems the same thing, but it isn't: weapon upgrades are the key to passing advanced stages, so starting from scratch the last level of a setting translates into a rapid departure, pushing us to start from a previous stage or even from the start to preserve firepower. The third solution that Glu has found to make his new title a high quality product is revealed in its technical realization. On a visual level, in fact, Alpha Wing 2 is probably the best shoot'em-up available for mobile phones: the static screens boast a really excellent character design combined with a great graphic definition, while the actual game is an excellent mix of graphics bitmap and polygonal. The ships are all well designed, the explosions are done very well and the three-dimensional scenery scrolls rather fluidly, changing radically depending on the setting. The use of colors is excellent in every situation, and the sound sector, while not shining, acts in a functional way to the action, without disfiguring. Controlling the spaceship is extremely simple: you move it with the joystick and you can set the autofire from the options (highly recommended), while pressing the 0 key activates the energy shield. Naturally, the goodness of the joystick of the mobile phone can transform the gaming experience, but in principle the Glu title manages to adapt even to the most difficult devices in this sense. PRO Technically outstanding Playable and fun Above average longevity...
