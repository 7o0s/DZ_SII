This is the last single-player based episode for the Gameloft series, which has always tried to offer a first-person shooter as close as possible to the atmospheres and mechanics of Call of Duty. The idea of bringing the game to Nintendo Switch therefore seemed legitimate to us, but since the announcement we have been well aware of the fact that translating an experience designed around mobile devices to consoles would not have been easy. The reasons are many, but they concern in particular the approach to design, thought for a short and impromptu use, with missions that are completed within a few minutes and which are therefore very distant from traditional productions for home systems. We were also curious to see how the developers would handle a physical control system (but the game also supports aiming via gyroscope) and how they would modify the original freemium dynamics in the transition to Switch. We can answer this last question immediately and in a positive way: the energy of the action has been eliminated as well as the microtransactions, which also went to create possible imbalances in the multiplayer modes, when you were faced with opponents who had spent money royal to get upgraded skins. Structure and missions The Modern Combat: Blackout campaign tells a fairly banal and derivative plot, but it does so with a cinematic attitude that in 2014, on mobile, definitely had its reason. The missions take place within six different scenarios, almost all of which are very suggestive: Venice, a Japanese temple, an unidentified urban centre, then again Piazza San Marco, the Ryogoku district and finally the Gilman headquarters. In each area you have to complete three or four main tasks and a series of secondary missions which on the one hand offer new situations and variations on the theme, involving us in rapid sieges or shooting sessions with the sniper rifle; on the other they help us get the number of stars needed to unlock the more advanced stages. Structurally this works, after all we are talking about a rather traditional and well-tested progression system, and this helps to create a decent duration for the single player sector, which can be completed in the order of nine or ten hours depending on one's ease: not bad for a product that costs 20 euros and has such a synthetic approach to missions. However, it is this aspect in particular that keeps the enthusiasm in check, because the brevity of the levels is actually a legacy of the mobile version which does not go well with the Nintendo platform at all, even if you play exclusively in handheld mode. There are still some unexpected difficulty peaks during some phases, but you can manage them better thanks also to the physical controls, which however we found not very refined and require a lot of adjustments to be able to shoot decently. As for the variety of situations, as previously mentioned, we cannot complain: the classic Call of Duty shootings give way to sequences in which we control the turret of a moving armored car or a motorboat fleeing from a helicopter, or even they require us to rescue a comrade and shoot the pistol at the approaching enemies until we have brought him to safety. In the secondary missions, then, we grapple with even more diverse and peculiar challenges. The multiplayer modes Just like the mobile version, Modern Combat: Blackout includes a set of competitive multiplayer modes on Nintendo Switch that require a subscription to online services in order to function. The equipment is quite complete between team deathmatches and classic deathmatches, and also those aspects that in the original for iOS and Android created clearly unbalanced situations have been eliminated. The controls, however, also constitute a clear limit to the fun at this juncture, probably prompting you to abandon this part of the experience prematurely. Gameplay and technical realization Drawing a bit from Call of Duty and a bit from other classic shooters, Modern Combat: Blackout offers a traditional approach to the genre, with two slots for weapons plus grenades, four customizable classes to choose from for your agent, upgradeable thanks to the unlocking of accessories and appendices, as well as a layout of the controls that will be immediately familiar to you. The game starts with auto-aim turned on, but resorting to it turns the experience into somethingreally trivial, given that the reticle hooks like a magnet to the targets and therefore does not require any effort on your part. It's better setting everything to manual, but as mentioned you have to make quite a few changes to the various degrees of sensitivity of the sticks to obtain a decent compromise. Unfortunately, this initial heaviness conveys a bad feeling and the gunplay never manages to be fully satisfactory, remaining several leagues away from products such as DOOM and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. Also the fault of the technical realization, which in many situations betrays the mobile nature of the experience, exposing raw polygonal constructions that the authors have peppered with effects to improve the general visual impact. An expedient that worked great on a smartphone screen, but which on Nintendo Switch, especially with the console connected to the TV, does not convey the same feeling of quality, net of some glimpses that are confirmed as inspired and suggestive here too. Furthermore, and this seemed to us rather serious, while Modern Combat: Blackout ran on iOS and Android at 60 frames per second without hesitation, on the Nintendo platform it fails to exceed 40 frames and this unusual middle ground ends up giving the frame rate a continuous inconsistency, an apparent jerkiness that is emphasized precisely when looking for the precision necessary to score aimed shots.", "date": "2019-02-20", "grade": "6.0"}
