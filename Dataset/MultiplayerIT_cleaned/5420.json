Just think of Kingdom Hearts Unchained  or Tales of Link, which we reviewed recently: the formula is more or less the same, seasoned with abundant fanservice to keep the attention of the players most connected to the brands. After Final Fantasy: Record Keeper, Square Enix tries again with this Brave Exvius, modeling it on the model of another successful social RPG, Brave Frontier, but adding something that could appeal to those looking for a more demanding mobile title than usual... Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius is a social RPG dedicated above all to lovers of the Square Enix brand Random heroes The most interesting feature of Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius is the great emphasis placed on storytelling. The story and the many dialogues, but also the exploration and interactions with NPCs, try at all costs to make it look like a real JRPG rather than a ~gacha~ disguised as such. They are only half successful, and ultimately they also represent perhaps the weakest point of the Square Enix proposal. That doesn't mean the plot isn't intriguing. The protagonists are Rain and Lasswell, knights of the kingdom of Grandswelt who, during a mission, come across a shady figure intent on destroying the crystals that maintain balance in the world. A mysterious girl appears to them in their time of need and, after having saved them, gives them the power of visions: thanks to it, the protagonists can summon the spirits of the heroes who have protected the crystals in different worlds and eras to fight the forces of bad. In short, after an interminable prologue, the player gets the chance to ~fish~ the most famous heroes and villains of Final Fantasy and enlist them in his personal army: Tidus, Zidane, Kain, Kefka, Terra and so on. Each of them is characterized by a rarity and a starting value that the player can increase through the usual grind of units, materials and resources in order to build a truly formidable party. Represented through detailed sprites of generous size and animations, the heroes deployed on the battlefield learn spells, special attacks and Limit Breaks that the player can swipe and tap and then unleash in sequence on the targets, ringing combo after combo. The combat system is simple, but provides a decent amount of depth. At times, Brave Exvius gives the impression of wanting to be even a tad bit too complex for the kind of game it wants to be. We are not sure that the exploration of dungeons, linear and repetitive, and of cities, too large for their contents, is suitable for a social RPG for mobile systems which should lend itself above all to short gameplay sessions, especially if we consider the usual limit imposed by the resource that we consume on each mission and which is recharged over time or with the inevitable - but negligible - microtransactions. Despite this, we appreciated Square Enix's effort to offer something more than the usual ~carrot and stick~ combination all based on fanservice. In terms of content, then, Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius offers daily and weekly challenges, periodic bosses, rare expiration extractions and all the typical ambaradan of the genre, but enriched by a more complete and strategic role-playing component.", "date": "2016-07-09", "grade": "7.0"}
