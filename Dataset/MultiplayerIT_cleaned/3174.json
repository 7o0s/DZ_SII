We have been heroes countless times, in the pixel worlds of video games: warriors, paladins, bards, hunters of evil in different guises and in thousands of different stories. Yet, in all those different adventures, we have often found recurring elements, including one in particular: the village. This is the point where the hero can rest, prepare for the tough quests that await him in the dark, experience a few moments of tranquility before the storm and of course buy or sell materials and items, do business in various ways. The village is a fundamental constant yet it seems to remain in the background like a theatrical backdrop, but is that really the case? Isn't it a deeper structure, with its own history and dynamics that persist beyond the vainglory of the heroes, as a central element around which the destinies of so many adventurers revolve? What if the village was the fulcrum of everything, the engine of the events that lead the heroes to collide with evil? On the other hand, isn't that where they always return in the end, looking for comfort and blessings, for supplies and money that will give value to the booty so bravely conquered? Isn't that the place that ultimately raises adventurers to the rank of heroes and bears witness to their deeds? Well, imagine how such a complex and important place can work: always in danger and on the edge of darkness but perfectly organized, able to respond to every need of any adventurer who wants to try his hand at the numerous surrounding threats. That's right, there is a manager behind such a complex infrastructure and this manager is the protagonist of Evil Hunter Tycoon. The SuperPlanet game puts us in the role of a sort of mayor of a village, who takes the place of the real manager of the place, capable of entirely managing the business of adventure and the fight against evil. It may seem strange but it's really a big job, which requires great dedication and management skills, organization and obviously a flair for business. The manager of the fight against evil Evil Hunter Tycoon, as the bizarre title suggests, is precisely a management system, which puts us in control of an entire village all organized to be at the service of heroes intent on fighting evil. As mentioned in the introduction, it reveals just what could be hidden behind one of the typical hub-villages of role-playing games, always placed on the edge of extremely dangerous areas full of monsters and treasures and always ready to welcome adventurers and offer some good commercial exchange. The mechanism is therefore all played on the balance between the village and the adventurers, which goes a bit beyond the simple laws of the market structured on the supply-demand relationship. Like a real broad-minded manager, the Tycoon protagonist must welcome the aspiring heroes, direct them as he sees fit towards the open quests (which unfold without too many complications in the contiguous territories, populated by monsters of various types) and then establish commercial relationships . This is the basic dynamic, but the game does not end here: it is necessary to manage an enormous amount of materials that can be used to create various types of objects, ranging from food to magic potions, from weapons to enchanted equipment, all which obviously animate the trade in the village. Materials can be purchased from other cities or requested or purchased directly from adventurers, who can find them in the various surrounding loot. As the economy expands, the village grows into a larger city, increasing its level and accommodating more adventurers. At this point it becomes necessary to expand the structures and build new buildings: therefore the classic role-playing elements of a city hub enter the scene with an infirmary, restaurants, taverns, inns, shops, a blacksmith and all the typical places of interest that the DOC adventurer usually visit before embarking on new quests, only that in this case we have to manage them, supplying them with materials and making sure that they work properly. Although the action of the heroes is completely automatic, once the objective to be completed is assigned, these still fall within the Tycoon's control. This is because through the various structures of the village it is possible to level up the adventurers andequip them to better cope with the challenges outside, as well as teach them new skills. Finally, in addition to observing the behavior of the fighters inside the deepest and potentially richest dungeons, it is possible to pit them against various bosses to obtain high-level rewards. The graphic style of Evil Hunter Tycoon is the classic very detailed pixel art, which is somewhat reminiscent of that of Kairosoft productions such as High Sea Saga or the recent Social Dev Story. The aesthetics are remarkable, but the interface is difficult to navigate and generally unpleasant, due to the extremely small size of text and icons and a certain general confusion in its organization, so much so that it becomes a real obstacle to gaming comfort . Moreover, it is a free-to-play that focuses heavily on grinding, but does not seem to force too much in-app purchases, which would also be numerous. These are mainly used to obtain rewards faster and unlock more powerful and rare heroes, but real walls do not emerge, at least for the first few hours of the game, which force the purchase, beyond the vision of some advertising.", "date": "2020-03-25", "grade": "7.2"}
