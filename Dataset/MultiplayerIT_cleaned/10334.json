The new tie-in developed by Eidos Montreal, which tries to reinvent the Guardians of the Galaxy in the context of a videogame dimension, in a very similar way to what was done with the Avengers last year, would have needed a few weeks of work in more on the finishing and the review build testifies to it eloquently. At the same time, however, on the one hand Square Enix has guaranteed that the day one patch will fix several problems (without however introducing support for ray tracing on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, which will arrive guiltily later); on the other we are faced with an adventure that fans of the Guardians and of Marvel productions in general will not be able to deem less than exciting. The reason is easy to say: the team of galactic heroes led by Star-Lord expresses during a long campaign, characterized by a duration of about 20 hours (but replayable at least once due to the crossroads and the differences they produce), all those dynamics and those gags that determined the success of the film adaptation directed by James Gunn. The characters, moreover, take plenty of inspiration from their counterparts seen on the big screen. With the only exception of Gamora, which refers, however, to the traits and the more noisy character of the paper version. This type of interpretation, almost entirely focused on the narrative, is supported by an excellently crafted Italian dubbing, with almost always perfect for the role and often able to imitate the voice actors of the films, resulting in indistinguishable in some situations and helping to stage memorable sequences. If that was what you were looking for in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, smile: you have been satisfied. History Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, Gamora sitting in her seat on the Milano As for the aforementioned Marvel's Avengers, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is not an origin story, as in the game the supergroup led by Star-Lord is already consolidated and infamous, and we know its formation well: in addition to Peter Quill the infallible assassin Gamora, Drax the destroyer, the shrewd Rocket and the mysterious Groot travel aboard the Milano. As mentioned, Gamora is the only character who in many ways distances herself from her cinematic counterpart, both in terms of design and character, and this will not fail to destabilize those who know Thanos' adopted daughter only through the interpretation of Zoe Saldana . In any case, in the course of the adventure there will be moments in which the lethal fighter will reveal some important backgrounds, gaining depth compared to an initial framing that is perhaps a little frivolous. Amazon offer Marvel's Guardians of The Galaxy [Amazon.It Exclusive] - PlayStation 5 69.99 See Offer However, the protagonist remains Star-Lord and the playable flashbacks of his life on Earth before becoming a Ravager reiterate this on multiple occasions, opening the door to a short subplot that the writers of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy have exploited to explain how precious and particular are the Blasters that the protagonist always carries with him, a gift from his father, capable of changing shape, characteristics and functionality depending on the situation. In the early stages of the campaign we find the Guardians intent on hunting down a monster on a remote planet . The fact that Rocket transforms some sequences into a race between him and Quill (complete with an interface that changes accordingly) immediately highlights the tone of the story, and so everything translates into an extremely natural tutorial with respect to both the exploratory mechanics and to the combat system, which we will return to shortly. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, the full team in a classic situation: all handcuffed In any case, the expedition is not successful and instead of a huge monster, the heroes find themselves having to look after a funny colored llama, which they decide to take with them to Milan. Intercepted by the Nova Corps, however, they are arrested and subjected to the inevitable scene of individual description, in a sort of official presentation from which Quill emerges as usual wounded in his pride. This event leads us to the first decision we will have to make in the game: hide the blade or a case of illegal components from the controls? Arriving on the Nova Corps ship, the Guardians notice the presence of a delegation from the Universal Church of Truth and ask to be welcomed by Ko-Rel, commanding officer and poisoned former flame of Quill, but in the team in charge of escorting them there is only his young fidaughter Nikki. However, something goes wrong, an explosion occurs and Peter finds himself having to help the girl get back to her mother, who, to thank him, frees him together with his companions on condition that they pay a hefty fine. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, Lady Hellbender and one of her pets Where to find all that money? It is at this point that the plot of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy begins to mesh, involving the fearsome monster collector Lady Hellbender in a sequence that you may have seen, and in which you have to choose whether to ~sell~ her Groot or Rocket in exchange for units at enough to pay the fine. Also in this case the decision we will take will change the course of events, producing different situations. Without wanting to anticipate anything else, there is no doubt that the story of the new Eidos Montreal title is well written, net of a couple of situations which could have been solved differently. The dialogues even seemed brilliant to us, with a large number of amusing gags which refer, as mentioned, to the dynamics of the cinematic Guardians and which only towards the end begin to abuse a bit of the various ~come on, guys~, ~we are a team~ and above all ~rocket!~, and what... rocket. Methods and contents Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, the Guardians in conversation from Cosmo The Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy campaign, which, as mentioned, can be completed in about 20 hours, is made up of a total of sixteen chapters and once completed it guarantees access to the traditional new game plus, to be exploited perhaps for take a second round. In fact, replayability undoubtedly represents one of the focuses of this production, given the presence of the crossroads we have mentioned. There are scenarios that would certainly have deserved a second visit, above all Knowhere: the gigantic head of a Celestial transformed into a space crossroads, safe haven for bounty hunters and Ravagers and domain of Cosmo, the Russian dog with a superior intellect and psychic powers. It is possible to literally get lost among the attractions (for example the Collector's exhibition) and the alleys of this location, but it would have been nice to aim even more convincingly in this direction and give life to collateral activities and Yakuza-style minigames, with the possibility of returning to Knowhere even after the game is completed. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, Star-Lord on the streets of Knowhere Having said that, the variety of settings is certainly one of the elements that Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy certainly does not lack. During the adventure we will find ourselves exploring some very inhospitable planets, the aforementioned ship of the Nova Corps and Knowhere, Lady Hellbender's fortress and other scenarios, characterized by a level design that often resorts to slightly too inflated gimmicks in action adventures, such as crossing a bottleneck or sliding down slides to compensate for the lack of fast loading on Xbox One, PS4 and some PCs. Equally, however, the assist mechanic is exploited in these contexts to create fairly multifaceted environmental puzzles, in particular those involving the activation of electrical circuits and the prolonged use of Star-Lord's visor, which in perfect Batman: Arkham Asylum style allows us to analyze our surroundings in search of objects with which it is It is possible to interact in some way, for example by asking Drax to break through a wall, Gamora to cut the cables blocking a passage, Groot to create bridges and wooden scaffolding, or Rocket to hack panels and slip into narrow tunnels. Gameplay Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, a fast-paced combat sequence If the focus of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is undoubtedly the narrative sector, from the gameplay point of view you have to accept some limitations, a bit of chaos and a pinch of repetitiveness, in a framework that we nevertheless found enjoyable and fun. As you know, in the game it is possible to directly control only the Star-Lord, while the other members of the team will move independently, supporting us with specific actions when we ask them. We have just mentioned the mechanics related to environmental puzzles and exploration, to which are added platform phases in which to take advantage of Peter Quill's rocket boots to make double jumps and rapid forward sprints. That's not all, however: the character's Blasters can equip four elemental attacks (ice, electricity, fire and wind) that will come in handy both in battle and for solving any puzzles. The diverse lineup of the Guardians of the Galaxy In fact, we will not find great depth in the combat system, which recalls Frer via the visual that of God of War and will see us unloading loaders on loaders against enemies of various kinds and types: from the most improbable alien monsters to squadrons of soldiers equipped with high-tech weapons, naturally passing through a large number of bosses that include absolutely exciting names in the eyes of any Marvel fan. wall or barrier, while the various Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot do the same. Acting on the left backbone, however, a menu opens that activates a sort of bullet time and allows you to select one of the companions to launch against the opponent we have hooked. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, chained attacks create frenetic and spectacular sequences Each Guardian, including Quill, can unlock four devastating special maneuvers with experience points, which charge over time and require a cooldown period to use again. In the advanced stages of the campaign, this mechanic turns into a real frenzy of chained attacks, producing spectacular finishers but highlighting the limits of the character we control, unable to inflict significant damage on his own. The Gathering idea is nice: when the relative indicator is charged, Star-Lord gathers his friends like a coach to motivate them based on the mood they express, and if the choice proves to be right, all the characters receive a boost The balance of the solution identified by Eidos Montreal is precarious and the upgrades that can be obtained at the workbenches, by spending the resources collected around the levels (which reward exploratory curiosity even with numerous extra costumes for the Guardians), do not change the situation a lot. However, the system manages to hold up until the end and in the final stages of the campaign, when the enemies become decidedly numerous and tough, one becomes fully aware of the philosophy behind this strategic combat system. Milan The Guardians of the Galaxy travel aboard the Milano, Star-Lord's spaceship, inside which it is possible to move between one mission and another in order to unlock collectibles, talk to your companions (motivating them, if necessary), change music on the stereo, use the workbench for upgrades, visit the cabins and the hold, take a shower, close the mini-fridge door left open for the umpteenth time and finally sit in the driver's seat to proceed towards the next destination. Milan is also the protagonist of some shooter-style sequences during the campaign, nice, but quite banal. Graphics and sound Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, a scenario with lights and colors that highlight the quality of the artistic direction Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy includes the now traditional two graphics modes on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X that allow you to play at real 4K and 30 fps or at 1440p and 60 fps. Also given the current absence of ray tracing which will only be added later, there is no doubt which of the modes to prefer: the 60 frames make the experience more enjoyable, especially during fights, without highlighting an effective loss of detail .Unfortunately, at the moment, there are some performance problems in certain levels and situations, an excessive scaler intervention in the most agitated phases (but we will have to wait for a technical analysis carried out with special tools for confirmation in this sense), some effects that they run at half frequency (see fire) and a very consistent amount of glitches, which force you to reload the last checkpoint in order to eliminate them. The day one patch, already available at the time you read the article, should have fixed some of these problems, certainly related to a hasty finishing phase. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, a scenario that looks like an artwork Having exhausted the purely technical discourse, allow us some considerations on the artistic depth of the game, which in our opinion manages to give truly suggestive glimpses and to combine everything with a lot of fanservice. For an old guard Marvel comic fan, being faced with such sequences can only be exhilarating, and we are sure that you too will literally jump out of your chair when you find yourself in the middle of certain situations, within certain scenarios and in the company of certain travel companions. We liked the design of the protagonists, which", "date": "2021-10-25", "grade": "8.0"}
