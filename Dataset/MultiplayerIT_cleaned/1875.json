{"name": "Sheep", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sheep_b.html", "text": "Sheepfold sweet Sheepfold Abandoned game forces the polygonal environments of the previous versions, the game adopts an isometric view of the playing field where the various protagonists are represented in the form of small but well-designed sprites. The graphical approach to the game is undoubtedly pleasant also and above all due to the choice of adopting comic and deformed graphics which, in addition to arousing immediate sympathy, are better suited to the new game setting. For the rest, mechanics and game purposes remain unchanged: gradually wider and more structured game levels where sheep of various nature and character run around waiting for our shepherd dog to convince them by hook or by crook to reach the fixed half. The first choice that the player must make is that of the sheepdog. Assuming that Sheep offers only very placid Scottish shepherds, the choice of the protagonist is limited to sex: a sinewy male Collie, powerful but not very fast, or a very charming female with high speed but little substance. Before seeing the chosen animal run around on the playing field, the player must acquire some fundamental notions to successfully pass the level: the type of sheep present, the time limit and the minimum amount of sheep to save. There are different types of sheep, from the most docile to the most stubborn up to real anarchic and intractable beasts. Obviously each sheep needs a different approach, while the more docile ones are satisfied with the presence of the shepherd dog to navigate correctly, others need a sound aid (read barking), others still need to be picked up and transported to their destination. These differences presuppose a minimum of strategy even when choosing the protagonist who will influence the approach to the game for the entire duration of the game: the female carries only one sheep at a time but directs more quickly with her presence; the male has reduced speed but can carry two sheep at a time. Usually the time limit available is more than sufficient, also because it serves not only to save as many sheep as possible from the thousand dangers present in the playing fields (electric fences, combine harvesters and various newfangled things), but also and above all to track down the various bonuses present, useless for the purpose of completing the level, but rewarding as a score. Finally, the minimum number of sheep to save is purely indicative, in fact every noble-minded player will do everything to save all or as many sheep as possible in order not to see the poor things transformed into curly-haired angels. Technically speaking, Sheep does not present itself as a title with a particular graphic impact, but in all honesty it would have been difficult to hypothesize the opposite; the choice of the cartoonish and very colorful setting gives a few points to an otherwise minimalist graphic cosmetics. Although the strong color contrasts are probably aimed at a greater usability of the game, the small size of the characters and the isometric setting of the playing fields make a good source of light indispensable in order to play Sheep. The sound sector is more pleasant in the vaguely country music than in the effects (almost completely absent). Convincing the impact with the commands that include, in addition to the obvious use of the directional cross for movement, the A and B keys to bark and collect the most stubborn sheep. The left backbone which serves to widen the view of the playing field, making the elements almost invisible due to the distance, is almost useless. Comment Sheep is not a game for everyone. It is not immediate like the vast majority of titles for the Nintendo portable nor deep like other strategy or role-playing games already in the line-up. That said, the Empire Interactive title is still well made, deep and long-lived enough to justify the expense. If you loved the PSX version or have an aptitude for strategy but don't have the patience to face the complexity of other titles Sheep is a must. For all the others it is a title that must be tried. Pros: Playability not immediate but appreciable Graphics and sound fully sufficient Fairly long-lived Cons: Not suitable for everyone Average or a little more in almost every respect At the beginning it was Sheep for PSX and Personal Computer, recently Herdy Gerdy and now Sheep again, revised and corrected according to the potential-limitations of the Gameboy Advance, who proposed in the form of electronyx the ... ~second~ oldest profession in the world: sheep farming. Although Sheep has a shepherd dog as protagonist and virtual alter ego, as in Herdy Gerdy, the aim of the game is to lead a flock of animals, in the case of lost sheep species, within pre-established areas, in a limited time and with various obstacles to overcome. The differences with the polygonal version of a couple of years ago are more aesthetic and leave intact the basic substance and structure of what can rightly be defined as a primitive real-time strategy with platform intrusions.", "date": "2002-12-13", "grade": null}
