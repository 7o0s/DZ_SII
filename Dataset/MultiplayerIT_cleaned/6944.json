In reality, the heart of the genre has never stopped beating, alive and pulsating, branching out along the arteries of a large number of declinations. From the evergreen EVE Online to the arcade epic of Strike Suit Zero, from Star Conflict to the stoic series of X or the hybridizations with the 4X of Sword of the Stars, without forgetting excellent (and discussed) examples such as Spore, by a certain Will Wright, and Notch's 0x10c chimera, abandoned while running, extinguishing its roaring load of promises in the silence and darkness of deep space. A panorama where GoD Factory: Wingmen, thanks to its proposal, can very well find its place and, indeed, even indirectly benefit from the unexpected comeback of the joystick and the unstoppable interest aroused by any application of an object of desire such as Oculus Rift, peripherals both supported natively. Reviewed GoD Factory: Wingmen small multiplayer space combat revelation When speed is not synonymous with superficiality GoD Factory: Wingmen is a space combat multiplayer title whose bow can count on more than a valid arrow, between a decidedly gratifying ~mixed~ cut, a certain personality and a structure with rather marked depth and tactics, where two teams composed from a maximum of four participants battle each other with the aim of arriving at the destruction of the mother ship of the opposing side. The extremely high pace and affordable approach are the viaticum for an experience full of nuances and aspects to be mastered both in terms of the pure dynamics of the clashes and in a more general perspective, referring to the conduct of the matches. The control system, to begin with, starts from the classic basics of driving a spaceship (propulsion, pitch, roll and so on) with a substantially immediate assimilation setting, to then provide a repertoire of advanced techniques such as dash, boost and drift that require logic and dexterity similar in some way (in some way, mind you...) to those of a fighting game. The same goes for the offensive resources, distributed between a primary fire mouth and several secondary ones mounted on the wings of the aircraft, with the possibility of delivering real combos of side effects to the victim of our attentions. Status alterations that can be countered by ~purifying~ with a special skill, which in addition to its - predictable - cooldown times also involves the zeroing of any positive bonuses and whose use, therefore, must be weighted with a certain extra attention. Not only that: the players are invited to take the field with not one but two ships, thus having the possibility of better adapting to the turn the match is taking. Each model can be chosen from one of the four species provided (Charion, Arblos, Human and Guantri), each with specific general ~vocations~ to be mixed in an increasingly adherent way to one's style as one rises in rank and obtains credits , through which to have access to the purchase of new technological discoveries, to be assembled using a rather complete and versatile editor, capable of providing satisfaction even to those who have the vocation of hangar engineer. The value of the pack That the raison d'tre of GoD Factory: Wingmen does not lie in the pure and simple extermination of the opponents, in a trivial ~dogfight team deathmatch~, several structural elements think about reiterating it. First of all, the match does not end in the case of annihilation of the rival formation: if both of one's ships are destroyed, on subsequent returns one climbs aboard the drones, weakened ~replicas~ of one's first choices. An eventuality that can be postponed by taking advantage of another interesting feature developed by the developers, namely the sharing of one's ships with a companion. However, where the emphasis placed on multiple levels in collaboration (even in details such as the percentages displayed in the lobby relating to the balancing of each formation based on the choices made by the respective members) finds its full outlet is in the destruction of the enemy cruiser. Reaching the goal alone is essentially impossible: the ship is made up of sThese sensitive parts, several of which boast considerable resistance, which can only be won with the fire of several attackers, whose coordination in these situations is more fundamental than ever. Furthermore, each neuralgic point is directly connected to a concrete aspect of the gameplay: to give some examples, by destroying the Repair Station the enemies return with 70% of their energy, by putting the Conning Tower out of action, the information on their radars suffers various types of penalties, while by tampering with the Cannon the broadside that each mothership fires automatically at its nemesis, to lend a hand to the outcome of the battle, will be launched every 5 minutes instead of 3. These are aspects that a particularly close-knit team can exploit in a targeted way, to condition the performance of the match in certain directions, in accordance with some of its particular tactics. Speaking of the flow of the matches, however, the fact that not infrequently everything tends to concentrate in a few areas, around real bottlenecks that frustrate the dynamism and sense of space that in many points of view GoD Factory manages to convey very well, and which it strives to promote, in a sort of conceptual own goal. This unpleasant feeling of static (relative, of course) runs the risk of soon being accompanied by a monotony: although its structural elements are randomly generated from time to time, the game offers only one map, the panoramas of which can begin to generate a strong sensation of flatness and repetitiveness rather quickly. And the same is true on other content fronts: if the possibility of plugging holes in lobbies thanks to bots or even deciding to play exclusively with them, in a sort of ~single player~, is certainly appreciated, especially because artificial intelligence has proved to be up to par, the introduction of other modes to support the only one foreseen, perhaps able to exploit the intriguing gameplay directives in their own way, would have done only good, and in terms of concrete longevity of the title, and in those of perception of the value of the initial package.", "date": "2014-08-29", "grade": "8.0"}
