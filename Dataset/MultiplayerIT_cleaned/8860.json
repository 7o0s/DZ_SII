Video games have not been spared from this new ABBA-mania, first with that SingStar ABBA released in 2008 and now with the ABBA You Can Dance here: let's see if the Swedish band's hits lend themselves more to singing or dancing. . Not just IKEA Not unlike the previous Michael Jackson The Experience, ABBA You Can Dance takes the well-known mechanics of the Just Dance series and applies them to a selection of 27 hits drawn from the group's boundless repertoire. It is therefore possible to dance to the famous notes of songs such as Dancing Queen, Waterloo, Fernando and company simply by holding a Remote and mimicking the movements of the character on the screen. Being the game inspired by a quartet, the choreographies give their best if made in multiplayer with three other friends - each of them equipped with a controller - and are undoubtedly very funny even if not entirely free from defects: to begin with, there you need a room large enough to allow four people side by side to be able to wave their arms around without the risk of putting their hands on their faces or breaking some very precious piece of furniture. Furthermore, due to an evident lack of space on the screen, playing in a group, the icons indicating the next step to be performed cannot be displayed, with the consequence that users not used to Just Dance could initially find it difficult to keep up with the rhythm. Excluding these two aspects, ABBA You Can Dance is still a very enjoyable product, whose charm is obviously directly proportional to the liking one feels towards the band's songs. The game also offers the most singing subjects the opportunity to try their hand at karaoke, both as a stand-alone mode accompanied by the official videos of the pieces, and as a side dish to friends' dance: a pity that this extra, albeit pleasant, is quite an end in itself , as there is no scoring or evaluation system to reward performers' vocal efforts. Something that is instead very present for what concerns dance, with users who can compare their performances with those of the guests within special rankings. The roundup of available game modes is closed by the so-called Mini Musical, a sort of homage to the theatrical show in which it is possible to face a series of songs in sequence: nothing transcendental, indeed, but it still makes up the number. Once upon a time beautiful song Being a direct derivative of Just Dance, ABBA You Can Dance does not present particular distinctive features compared to the other episodes of the main series, proving to be immediately familiar to anyone who has had some experience with the Ubisoft brand. From a graphic point of view, therefore, the solution adopted is exactly the same, with the silhouettes of dancers filmed live standing out against vaguely psychedelic backdrops that change according to the chosen song. If the visual impact is therefore known and far from exciting, it must be said that the quality of the choreography is undoubtedly very good and varied, with the steps that often recall those seen in the band's official videos or those of the theatrical musical. Unfortunately, the developers forgot to assign an indication of its level of difficulty to each of the 27 tracks present, forcing users to make their choices without being able to take into account the complexity of one or the other ballet. Again, ABBA You Can Dance inherits most of the chronic defects of the series, the first linked to the fact that the game only detects the movements traced by the Remote held in the right hand, and therefore it is in fact possible to make amazing scores simply by sitting down , waving only his arm and not giving a damn about the rest. However, the detection of the motion sensor is not among the best, and it often happens that the software ignores or captures flawlessly performed gestures late. However, the Ubisoft production is forgiven thanks to a considerable amount of extra material relating to the history of the Swedish group, including photos, curiosities, texts and so on, all elements that will certainly make collectors happy.
