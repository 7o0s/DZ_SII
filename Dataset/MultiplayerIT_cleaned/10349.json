First of all, the team of developers, n-Space, who found the most appropriate technical solutions to bring the essence of the popular series produced by Activision to the dual-screen console: in its portable version, COD manages to be fluid, fast and sufficiently detailed to offer excellent scenarios for our many firefights. Secondly, the structure of the missions is set in the name of variety: the standard action on foot is often interspersed with sections in which we drive different vehicles or, as in the case of Mobilized, with some simple minigames touch screen based. Finally, the control system that follows the standard command layout for Nintendo DS FPS games: the d-pad to move the character, the left back button to open fire with the weapon equipped and the stylus to move view, switch weapons and aim more accurately. To run and crouch you have to quickly press the d-pad twice up or down twice, a sensible solution after all, which is assimilated after a few minutes of play. More than anything else, the problem is the aim: entrusting its refinement to a double tap with the stylus would have been the ideal solution, while touching a special button on the touch screen, however large, is anything but comfortable. War is difficult The references to the aiming mode, in the case of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare - Mobilized are anything but of secondary importance, given the decision of the developers to make the game much more difficult than in the past. It is possible to eliminate enemies without having to use sniper shooting, but this is an operation that eats up precious seconds; time that in this case we do not have, because it is enough to expose oneself to enemy fire for a few moments to die. With these premises, the approach to the games must obviously change from what we were used to, turning into a long sequence of stalking in which you shoot one target at a time because doing otherwise would be impossible. The problem is that our teammates, strong in their invulnerability, often end up doing the job for us and advance leaving us behind: a situation that is anything but funny, which can only be mitigated by adjusting the difficulty level to minimum possible. The very large waste of bullets inevitably leads us to constantly change weapons in order not to run out of ammunition, collecting those left by killed soldiers. Also in this case we can carry only one main weapon with us, accompanied by the classic grenade. As mentioned above, the standard game action is interspersed with stages in which we drive some vehicles (a tank and the turret of an AC130, in this case) and some minigames that become accessible once the campaign is completed already from the starting screen, together with three other extra modes (Challenge, Arcade and Survival) that allow us to replay the levels already completed with different rules, in this case respecting time limits or facing increasingly numerous hordes of enemies. Unity is strength The game has multiplayer for six players both locally and online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, in which we can take part in the classic team deathmatches, sabotage, capture the flag, etc. The number of modes available is high, the search for rooms appears fast and we have not encountered any particular problems during the games. The graphics engine used for Mobilized is the same that moved Modern Warfare and World at War, and is able to guarantee great fluidity together with a decent level of detail. The scenarios are large and populated, the use of colors ensures a certain chromatic realism and the alternative action sequences appear convincing. The polygonal models of the characters are quite simple and angular, but the quality of the animations is decent. Doing better than that on the Nintendo DS was likely going to be very tricky. The sound consists of discreet music and a good dubbing in Italian, while the effects are of little impact.", "date": "2009-11-30", "grade": "7.5"}
