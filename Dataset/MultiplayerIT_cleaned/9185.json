{"name": "Sempre pi in alto!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/90752-tiny-tower-sempre-piu-in-alto.html", "text": "With Pocket Frogs, the Californian development team NimbleBit has catalysed the attention of numerous iPhone and iPad users with that winning alchemy well known to those who have played at least one casual game based on the freemium sales model: continuous and repetitive activities, however from small prizes and new unlockable elements able to gratify the player and keep him clinging to a sterile mechanic underneath. Tiny Tower proposes exactly the same formula, although this time the developers wanted to enrich and enhance the experience with a unique style, lots of humor and an elaborate notification system. Are we in front of the new Farmville? A growing enterprise Mocking the management genre, Tiny Tower asks the player to build and manage a building used for commercial activities, in which to start a shop or service of any kind on each floor: from fast food to laundries, from libraries to convenience stores clothing. The goal, you will have already understood, is to earn more and more money so as to add new floors, enlarge your tower and expand your business empire. Obviously, to carry out each activity it is necessary to hire employees (called Bitizen), and this is where the casual game of NimbleBit starts to get interesting: predictably, each of the people will be more competent in one type of job or another, becoming more or less productive depending on the activity performed. However, the developers have done everything to give a touch of personality to each of the funny Bitizens, who have a secret dream, customizable clothes and an account on BitBook, the most famous social network in the Tiny Tower world. On BitBook, various employees update their bulletin board with whatever's on their mind, sometimes complaining about their jobs and other times praising them. Does it remind you of anything? Who knows, maybe a particularly obnoxious message will convince you to fire its author. To increase the number of Bitizen you then need to build warehouses used as apartments, and then you'll have to decide what to invest your hard-earned savings in: create a new warehouse to expand the number of employees you can hire or give life to that yogurt shop you've been craving for a long time ? Or, again, will you decide to please your less enthusiastic employee by giving him the job of his dreams? As in many freemium games, the entire game mechanic is based on waiting: Bitizens will take time to sell the products in their stores, as well as waiting for new supplies to arrive or for a new floor to be built . In moments of waiting, the only real interaction is thus reduced to transporting customers via the lift, a practice that is not necessary but which allows you to speed up earnings and bring VIPs into your structure: in fact, sporadically special customers appear capable of buy all the products in an instant, attract more people or speed up the delivery times of the stocks. Sure, it's still a freemium application, and the less patient player can instantly increase their resources by using their credit card, but the excellent notification system allows you to appreciate the experience without necessarily getting bored. Just activate the Push system, leave the game in the background and go back to your daily activities, after which you will be notified with convenient pop-ups every time a Bitizen has sold all the supplies, when new deliveries have arrived and, in general, when there will be important things to do. Added to this is a good online component, which thanks to the integration of Game Center allows you to visit your friends' towers, trying to compete with who has it longer... sorry, taller. The graphic creation is very successful, with a retro style that is not only pleasant, but also extremely well-finished, capable of making Tiny Tower one of the most visually captivating social games on the square.
