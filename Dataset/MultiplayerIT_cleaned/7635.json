The reason, then, is incredible: ~we never had the time to make advertising stuff like gameplay trailers, special photos, tweaks and so on. We are few, and we were all engaged in development~, explained the co -founder of Image & Form, Brjann Sigurgeirsson. In other words, the Swedish developer didn't have time to advertise their game, and these days, advertising is everything. Or maybe not? What is certain is that SteamWorld Dig, as soon as it came out, advertised itself, through word of mouth, videos uploaded to YouTube by enthusiastic players, and so on. Before playing it, we too knew him by reputation. However, at first it wasn't that clear why all that enthusiasm... Despite starting off quietly, SteamWorld Dig is one of the best eShop games for the Nintendo handheld Who goes slow... We have to admit that the first ten, twenty minutes of the game didn't excite us particularly. Indeed, to be honest, they even bored us. The incipit is super intriguing: the player controls Rusty, a kind of cowboy robot in a future where humanity has died out and been replaced by synthetic beings. Rusty arrives in Tumbleton, a run-down town where his uncle worked before getting lost in the underground mines. They give us a pickaxe and tell us to go find it, and so the game begins. A few minutes later, we discover that Rusty's uncle isn't lost: he's really dead, and now it's up to us to help Tumbleton, finding the gems hidden underground and bringing them to the surface. In short, the first few minutes of the game flow like this: we immediately notice the exceptional response to Rusty's commands, who can jump, bounce from one wall to another to climb the vertical tunnels, and of course use the pickaxe to destroy the rocks. Operation, the latter, at the limits of tedium: you can hit the rock in all directions, and three hits are needed to crumble a block. Sometimes we will find gems inside, sometimes little hearts that recharge our vital energy. Sometimes we will find enemies that we can get rid of with a pickaxe. Our pockets, moreover, are not that big, and therefore we will have to go up and down often to resell the precious stones found and go back to digging. In short, the premises are not the best: everything seems incredibly repetitive and all too simple. There's something not right, also because graphically SteamWorld Dig is delightful: it's completely 2D, but both the general character design and the choice of colors have something special. The animations are excellent, the soundtrack sounds like something out of an old western. I mean, how does such a boring game look so good? The 3D effect This is probably the main sore point of SteamWorld Dig: the stereoscopic effect is there... but you can't see it, in the sense that it is so weak as to be almost invisible. Might as well disable it and save on battery life. ... does not rust The answer is very simple: SteamWorld Dig is not a boring game. Far from it. The first few minutes certainly are, but then something happens. After we've collected some gems, we go back to selling them and the Tumbleton shopkeeper lets us buy a new pickaxe. This one is more powerful and destroys blocks in one hit that we have had to hit three times so far. What's more, it also destroys blocks that they thought couldn't crumble, and this allows us to venture even further down. The setting begins to change, the world gets darker. We come across a few puzzles: pull a lever there, open a door here, nothing particularly original, but it adds spice to a formula we're already beginning to understand. Soon we'll have to go back up to sell more gems, but even that doesn't last long: our pockets will get bigger, which means we'll be able to stay underground longer and collect more minerals before returning to the surface. There are also three parameters to take into account: Rusty's hearts, that is, his vital energy; water, with which to feed the steam servomechanisms of our robotic alter ego, and which is recharged by defeating some enemies or finding underground sources; the light, because it is better that our lantern does not run out, several hundred meters underground. And then there are the upgrades: special boots, new picks, jackhammers, ladders, all the ambaradan of the perfect miner. Each new upgrade allows you to overcome a new enemyco or apparently insurmountable obstacle and to reach new locations. You can proceed a little as you like, digging in the direction you prefer in a map that is randomly generated at the start of each new game, but you must always be careful and dig using logic, in order to avoid being trapped, with no way out. SteamWorld Dig could be called a ~Metroidvania~, because each new power-up opens new paths and offers further possibilities. And considering the quality of the level design, which gradually becomes more complex without ever being heavy, it is immediately clear how it is that SteamWorld Dig has become so famous without the need for advertising.", "date": "2013-09-10", "grade": "8.8"}
