Also thanks to a happy marriage with WiiWare for the first chapters, the series has in fact managed to build a certain popularity while maintaining a strong creative that has never known constraints. One of the most interesting and appreciated chapters of the series is undoubtedly Runner, first released in 2010 precisely on the online service of the Nintendo console; and the first sequel of the various Bit.Trips was actually born from it, entitled Bit.Trip Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien, which for convenience we'll call from now on simply Runner2. Once upon a time we just jumped... In this case there are no platform time exclusives: Runner2 is in fact available immediately on Steam, Playstation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and Wii U eShop; and it is precisely on the Nintendo console that we based our test, although there are no substantial differences in the contents of the various versions. The new Gaijin Games title largely takes up the mechanics of the previous episode, delegating the biggest points of detachment to the graphic component which in effect constitutes an almost generational turning point for the series. The 8-bit retro style that had contributed considerably to defining the various Bit.Trips has in fact been set aside in favor of an absolutely more modern and current solution; if it is undoubtedly true that long-time fans will be able to turn up their noses in the face of what risks being interpreted as a loss of personality, in reality, beyond the very respectable personal tastes, the team must be acknowledged for having had the courage to free themselves of a ~dress~ that risked becoming limiting for the evolution of the franchise. And in any case, the work done by the Californian artists is anything but banal: very colorful, with an enormous variety of situations between the various game worlds, full of personality, intriguing and fluid, Runner2 is an aesthetically pleasing product certainly not destined to upset the world , but still absolutely effective and enjoyable. As for the pure and simple gameplay, as we said, it is largely borrowed from the first episode; in a nutshell, the goal is to control Commander Video (or one of the other selectable characters), an inexhaustible runner who moves automatically, trying to make him reach the end of the level. Obviously the enterprise is much less easy to do than to say, due to a whole series of obstacles and enemies destined to stand between the hero and the finish line; if the first levels are based on the use of a few trivial skills, obviously starting from a fundamental leap, during the adventure different skills are progressively unlocked which contribute to strengthening and at the same time making the game mechanics more complex and complicated. If Runner2 is therefore fundamentally attributable to the platform genre, it is however equally true that it is an atypical product in which the syncopated rhythm and the density of the level design requires coordination and attention above the ordinary. The absence of available lives is explained precisely in this sense; the mistake and the consequent death is a moment to be quickly forgotten, because a new attempt is only moments away with the automatic restart from the beginning or from the middle of the level. The presence of a checkpoint is in fact one of the most incisive differences of Runner2, which abandons the fundamentalism of the predecessor which required instead to repeat the entire stage as a result of a death even if it occurred a few steps from the finish. Here instead the consequences are in fact less dramatic and irritating, reducing the side effects of the trial and error formula that characterizes the product; more generally, the ability to choose 3 difficulty levels combined with a less extreme level design makes Runner2 a more affordable and mainstream game than the progenitor of the series. However, where the more experienced can find enjoyment is undoubtedly in the ability to collect all the objects scattered throughout the levels, to consequently increase the final score to be fed to the online rankings and perhaps compare it with friends. The over 100 levels overall, the splendid dynamic chiptune soundtrack based on the player's actions and the engaging boss fights finally outline the picture of a very high quality product. Finally, a parenthesis for the use of the GamePad, which allows simplecement (but pleasantly) to be able to play the game entirely on the controller even with the TV off.", "date": "2013-05-01", "grade": "8.5"}
