{"name": "Stuntman", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stuntman-4.html", "text": "Scene 1: FirstEngineAction! As the title already suggests, the latest Reflections production, debuting on Ps2, in fact attempts to simulate the career of a stuntman, grappling with six different films. In the intervals between one job and another, there is also time for spectacular performances in a festive arena, between piles of cars to be knocked down and the classic jump into the flaming circle. In short, this is the fulcrum of the story mode, which constitutes the main playful stimulus, although there are two other modes (speed challenges and stunt editor) of lesser interest, which allow you to train and have fun in the arena in a free way with the cars unlocked in career mode. However, it is not the originality of the concept that should discourage occasional drivers: the care taken in the attempt to immerse us in the ~stuntman dimension~ is decidedly adequate. From the historical black and white stills of the introductory film, passing through the shy and hasty attitude of our virtual alter ego (excellently dubbed), up to the pernicious reproaches of the director: the elements that make up what for Americans is called presentation are assembled with great care and style, so as to make the charm of the stuntman's work almost palpable, dangerous and obscure at the same time. Given these assumptions, expecting frenetic, shamelessly arcade gameplay would be at least apparently legitimate. Stuntman, on the other hand, remains firmly faithful to its simulation presumption, and therefore immediately makes itself unsuitable for that very large range of soft-core users, who only want immediate and carefree fun from a game. The extremely sophisticated physics make it very challenging to master the large range of vehicles that we will have to take control of (jeep, police car and yellow Hazzard car included). A correct weight distribution near a jump, for example, becomes essential both for the success of the jump itself and for avoiding a ruinous landing. In the same way, excessively prolonged braking or a handbrake held on for a second too long can have fatal consequences. The reason for so much concern is simple: in a film there is no room for improvisations or errors, and the Reflections seem to have decided to develop the entire gameplay on this concept. The suspicion of sadistic intent on the part of the Anglo-Saxon coders immediately materializes in the first gray London curves: the objectives to complete and the dangers to escape on the set are many, and the practice necessary to arrive intact at the end is really a lot. As if that weren't enough, a decidedly pretentious director never fails to stop us whenever the meager time limits granted have been evaded. The deformability of every single component of the bodywork of the cars on the set is a double-edged sword; if on the one hand it constitutes a feature of sure impact from a visual point of view, it is also true that it ends up being a further serious handicap for the player. In fact, every slightest collision, in addition to making us waste precious time, causes almost certain damage to the vehicle, which must not be excessively damaged in order to complete the stunt. And, believe me, getting out of a tunnel on the wrong side of the road unscathed, zigzagging in pursuit of a van that seems to have been kissed by fate is no small feat. However, this does not mean that Stuntman is a title without interesting content. If you arm yourself with great patience and are willing to suffer what could be called the cynicism of the Reflections, completing each stunt can be a source of great satisfaction. Acquiring a certain feeling with the vehicles, despite the high level of difficulty, is not impossible at all, and the progressive increase of one's driving skills is undoubtedly satisfying, albeit challenging, while the memory of the glories of the Pso era resurfaces in the mind of Destruction Derby and Drivers. What is certain, however, is that the unhealthy instinct to throw the joypad out the window will manifest itself anyway... Technically speaking Technically Stuntman stands on more than discrete levels, but does not even touch the excellence achieved by other 128-bit racing games (Gt3 above all). The excellent quantity of polygons concentrated on cars and environments, the almost total absence of flickering and aliasing are in fact balanced by a frame rate that is certainly not for combat (30 fps with decidedly evident drops in some stages) and quality textures that are anything but how sublime. If the design of environments and vehicles is sufficiently inspired, the animations of the extras who flee the rush of our passage are to be rejected. A decidedly less negligible detail compared to the previous ones is the length of the loadingsi: given that several attempts are necessary before completing a stunt, having to wait almost a minute every time to be able to start over often becomes a reason for further frustration. The quality of the sound oscillates between the goodness of the dubbing of the voices of the stuntman and the director, the likelihood of the roar of the engines and the anonymity of the musical themes. Stuntman does not take on the connotations of the Grandiosa videogame experience (we do not believe he had the ambition) not even in terms of longevity. What penalizes it above all is the low replayability factor: assuming you want to complete the story mode (in about 12/13 hours), the two free modes are not enough, with lots of extras to unlock, to justify the recovery of the Atari branded package from the our collection. Comment What is Stuntman? A frustrating, unplayable game with no good ideas? Surely not. Stuntman is an original title, at times engaging but difficult and undermined by some defects (both formal and structural) which prevent it from revealing itself with the strength of its great potential. A title to be seriously taken into consideration especially by fans of the ~reckless~ genre, to which it can give a few hours of healthy entertainment, while those who have little patience or perhaps have little digestibility of the defects and choices of the Reflections highlighted in the review, are better off stay away from it. Pros + original and cool + refined physics + excellent presentation Cons + sometimes frustrating + sometimes jerky + overly linear It has been almost a year and a half now that, examining the vast array of racing games on the monolith, one has to seriously deal with a certain Gran Turismo 3. Who has so far attempted to challenge the eminence of Polyphony Digital's latest creature in its own territory it has failed quite miserably. And by virtue of this, the first merit of Stuntman should be considered that of approaching the racing genre in a different way than the competition, as required by the Reflections tradition. Having thus averted a priori the risky tug of war with the King, Stuntman sets out with the ambition of gaining the favor of those who appreciate the spectacular nature and adrenaline of flat-out pursuits, acrobatics and explosive accidents in racing, rather than the search for the lap record or the ideal trajectory.", "date": "2003-01-08", "grade": null}
