It is no coincidence that various software houses, to get around the obstacle, have often relied on the iconic RUF, a German company specializing in the processing of Stuttgart racing cars. Bearing in mind that Porsche hasn't officially appeared in a simulator proper for twelve years, the agreement made with Kunos Simulazioni could only be welcomed with great enthusiasm; after all, the sublime physical-dynamic model of Assetto Corsa and the ability of the developers to give a soul to each vehicle reproduced represent universally recognized qualities and a source of pride for the Italian videogame industry. After a few months of waiting, the dream of many virtual drivers came true on October 25, with the launch on Steam of the first of the three planned Porsche Packs and the related, advantageous Season Pass, which will arrive on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November. As always, the DLC was accompanied by an important code update (now at build 1.9) which embraces several new features; among the main ones there are a considerable improvement in the audio sector, the addition of the tire model 10 for the GT3s, new leaderboards, the Sparco license and a whole series of fixes and refinements for artificial intelligence, graphics, online collisions and even more. There is also a couple of free content of great depth, namely the fascinating Porsche Panamera Turbo, which we will discuss in the next paragraph, and the spectacular historical version of the Silverstone circuit, the ideal stage for many of the racing cars present on Assetto Corsa. The first Porsche Pack enriches Assetto Corsa with seven racing cars from the prestigious German brand On the road Let's start our roundup with the ~little one~ of the lot, the elegant 718 Cayman S coup, the third generation of the series translated from the 718 Boxster roadster. The number 718 is a clear homage to the historic racing car of the same name, which suggests the transition from the previous generation six-cylinder engine to the more efficient (and less polluting) four-cylinder with turbocharger, i.e. a 350 horsepower 2.5-litre . On Assetto Corsa, thanks to its agility, driving pleasure and excellent braking system, the 718 Cayman S offers all the qualities that characterize the real model. Overall performance isn't stellar, but the top speed of 285 km/h and 0-100 km/h in 4.7 seconds are numbers that deserve respect and above all harbingers of fun. The abundant torque of 420 Nm also makes it effective in drifting, and it is no coincidence that a dedicated challenge is available among the special events in Vallelunga. The polygonal model is wonderful, both indoors and outdoors: in fact, in 4K, the only drawback is represented by a few small imprecise shadows. The sound of the engine is also excellent. From the Cayman we move on to a true icon among sports cars, namely the famous and best-selling 911, which for over forty years has been the forbidden dream of countless motorists. Present in the 2015 Carrera S version, on Assetto Corsa it is one of the best balanced and fun cars to drive, perfectly translating the combination of performance and comfort that has always characterized the Porsche line. With its 420 horsepower and 500 Nm of torque, the car, powered by a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine, reaches a top speed of 308 kilometers per hour and, for the first time in the history of the Carrera, breaks through the wall thanks to the Sport Chrono Package of four seconds in the 0-100 km/h, placing an excellent 3.9 seconds. Also in this case the polygonal model, as well as the sound of the engine, are excellent: the only flaws are once again small imperfections of the shadows, however visible only in the most hidden areas of the bodywork. Taking another leap forward we arrive at the wicked 918 Spyder, a so-called hybrid ~hypercar~ analogous to the rivals Ferrari LaFerrari and McLaren P1: it is no coincidence that the old Top Gear trio ardently desired to put them all on the same track, a dream shattered by manufacturers that today is made possible thanks to Assetto Corsa. Technologically highly advanced and with various features developed in collaboration with the Porsche racing department, the car reaches a top speed of 345 km/h and does 0-100 km/h in just 2.6 seconds; a real missile on four wheels thatit can also offer enviable comfort and reduced fuel consumption, when compared to space performance. The 4.6-litre 608 horsepower eight-cylinder is accompanied by two electric modules which, overall, make the 918 Spyder reach 887 horsepower and a monstrous torque of 1,279 Nm. On Assetto Corsa, this translates into impressive reactivity and a unique driving pleasure, linked to the excellent weight distribution and the extremely powerful braking system. To be pushed to the limit, this jewel undoubtedly requires a lot of practice, but it is so well simulated that it pushes to improve without causing a minimum of frustration. The car is also wonderful in terms of sound and aesthetics: the highly detailed interior, rich in carbon, is a real sculpture. We close the section dedicated to road bikes with a nod to the Panamera Turbo, the powerful luxury saloon made available to everyone with the 1.9 update. Characterized by a spectacular sound, which gets nastier between fourth and fifth gear around seven thousand rpm, the Panamera is the most docile of the entire Porsche package to tame, while offering performance in line with those of the 911 Carrera S, thanks to the 306 km/h top speed and even better acceleration, i.e. 3.6 seconds for 0-100 km/h. After all, even if it weighs a good 2,070 kilograms, it mounts a 4.0-litre V8 that unleashes 500 horsepower and a maximum torque of 770 Nm. The polygonal model is excellent, which lacks only a pinch of aliasing on the rear window, even in 4K. For the track Derived from the 911 Carrera RS 3.0, produced in just over one hundred units in 1974, the 911 Carrera RSR (acronym for RennSport Racing) 3.0 was its powerful racing version, equipped with a 330 horsepower six-cylinder engine which allowed it to reach 280km/h top speed. Immediately recognizable thanks to the generous rear spoiler and the overabundant wheel arches, which cover huge Firestone tyres, the Assetto Corsa is a rather nervous car, tending to oversteer but still very fun to drive. The typically racing interiors are characterized by an obsessive attention to detail and its wild soul, as well as the roar of the engine, is underlined by the mechanical squeaks that can be heard continuously while trying to tame it. In short, we are faced with the classic legend on four wheels that requires respect and a good dose of practice. Slightly faster than the 911 Carrera RSR 3.0 but much simpler to drive, the Cayman GT4 Clubsport is the classic ~trackday animal~, a modern car not approved for the road born to bite the asphalt of the tracks. With its 385 horsepower 3.8-litre six-cylinder boxer and a weight of 1,300 kilograms, it reaches a top speed of 300 km/h in absolute fluidity and fluency, falling into the category of the most suitable racers for beginners in the Italian simulator. It is not among the most desired Porsches, but the excellent braking system, agility on technical circuits and the balance of the chassis make it an excellent alternative to more famous models. The polygonal model and the sound of the engine are also excellent. With a leap back in time, let's move on to another icon that came out of the Porsche factories, namely the famous 935/78 'Moby Dick', so nicknamed for its large size and the main color of the livery, i.e. white. Born to participate in endurance races, the car was equipped with a 845 horsepower 3.2-litre engine, which allowed it to reach 366 km/h on the Hunaudires straight at Le Mans. Despite the victory in the debut race at Silverstone, the 935/78 'Moby Dick' had some problems with reliability and fuel consumption compared to other prototypes, characteristics that made it shelve only after a handful of races. On Assetto Corsa the car is particularly nervous to tame and requires a lot of experience to be driven to the limits, it also offers a braking system that is anything but effective. The polygonal model, full of aerodynamic appendages, is excellent as is the sound of the engine, which is often accompanied by powerful flames from the mufflers. If the learning curve takes a significant leap going from the 911 Carrera RSR 3.0 to the ~Moby Dick~, with the barchetta 917/30 Spyder a real chasm opens up. The numbers of this four-wheeled monster speak for themselves: 800 kilograms in weight, a twelve-cylinder twin-turbo engine capable of delivering 1,400 horsepower with a maximum torque of 1,200 Nm, a maximum speed of 385 km/h and a 0-100 km/h of just 2.4 seconds. Developed to participate in the libertine Can Am category, the car was nicknamed ~unbeatable~ or more amicably ~Turbopanzer~ by American enthusiasts. Asyou will have guessed, it is one of the most complex models ever to drive on Assetto Corsa; it is sufficient to touch the gas pedal more than necessary to immediately find yourself in a spin, furthermore the brakes do not shine for efficiency and the oversteer is omnipresent. Taking its measurements therefore requires commitment and patience; we really don't dare to imagine the sacrifices of the pilots Mark Donohue and George Follmer who drove the original. The polygonal model, very faithful to the real counterpart, has a rather simple silhouette that becomes more complicated in the rear part, where the various gears of the engine are clearly visible. Suffers from a hint of aliasing on the front spoiler and around the front wheel arch louvres.", "date": "2016-10-30", "grade": null}
