{"name": "Spore", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spore_a.html", "text": "Will Wright is one of the most important names in the video game industry: co-founder of the Maxis team, he created some of the best-selling PC titles ever and still loves to amaze and innovate today. Spore is only the latest of his creatures, and in many ways it stands as the ultimate life simulator: instead of controlling the development of a city like in Sim City or the social life of an individual like in The Sims, we'll start from those who are the ~seeds of life~ in a planet-type. We will therefore have to manage these microscopic beings and make them evolve as millions of years pass, with the game mechanics changing hand in hand through five distinct phases: the ~cellular~ phase, with microorganisms that feed on each other to grow and develop ; the ~creatures~ phase, with the setting becoming three-dimensional as the battles become more complex; the ~tribal~ phase, in which everything turns into a kind of real-time strategy; the ~civilization~ phase, in which the emphasis is placed on the conquest of territories; finally, the ~space~ phase, in which the civilization we have developed sets out to conquer the universe. As mentioned at the beginning, Spore has been simplified on mobile and therefore we will be able to try our hand at the ~mobile~ phase only... The game, therefore, looks like a sort of very elaborate Pac Man: our creature starts from infinitesimal dimensions and must feed on smaller beings to grow. At the top of the screen there is a bar that indicates how far the boost is left, and which drops if you are attacked by a larger creature. The stages develop infinitely in all directions, so there is no limited number of prey and it is possible to escape from predators in any way. To eat a creature, just come into contact with it or press the 5 key when you are in its vicinity: our little creature will launch into a shot that can turn into a combo if the objectives are multiple and they are all close together. Proceeding between the stages, we will see that our creature will become bigger and bigger and will be able to feed on those who were previously its predators, just pay attention to their natural defenses. Defenses that we too will be able to develop, using a special enhancement and customization screen between one level and another: in addition to equipping the creature with different types of ~accessories~, we will be able to customize its appearance by balancing the choices between shape and size, or change the colors. The more you go on, the more Spore acquires thickness, in short, from all points of view: if in the first stages the emphasis is placed only on movement, later you access a series of attacks and defense systems, with clashes which get more complicated. Once the eighteen levels of the main mode have been completed, we will be able to make our creatures collide in a special arena, as well as access a series of online options of sure interest. The technical realization of this new EA Mobile title is excellent. The graphics can count on a rather fluid scrolling, without slowdowns of any kind, and on an excellent use of colors: the stages are characterized above all by the shades, and some combinations are really beautiful to see. The sprites are perhaps a little less brilliant, but we must take into account the fact that it is possible to modify your creature in various ways. The prey and predators on duty are quite varied, with good design and unobtrusive animations. The sound is made up of good quality MIDI music, catchy, which accompanies the action in the best way and does not get annoying. PRO Very simple and immediate Technically well done Some innovative and interesting finds AGAINST Somewhat repetitive action Limited structure It's just a taste of <strong>Spore</strong>", "date": "2008-10-14", "grade": "S.V."}
