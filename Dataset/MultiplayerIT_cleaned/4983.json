In particular, we have seen how with it BioWare has tried on the one hand to detach itself from the past and not to remain too anchored to certain elements that have characterized the Commander Shepard series, as if to underline a new beginning or in any case something different; on the other, not completely cutting ties with the ~old~, maintaining some ties especially as regards design and way of telling the adventure. The universe, the background, in some way the artistic style, are in fact all elements based on the same scenario created by BioWare, but the protagonists, the characters met, the environments and the planets are completely new and unrelated to what was told in the previous saga. As well as a couple of key aspects of the gameplay, above all the combat system. However, the result of what has just been written does not seem to have fully convinced all fans of the series, and in the end the title, which we already knew would have to deal with a complicated legacy and monumental expectations, ended up dividing the public and arousing several controversies. Also due to a series of annoying glitches and several shortcomings in the character animations. In any case, to offer you a more complete service and given the importance of the game, we thought we'd also offer you the review for the PlayStation 4 version and now the Xbox One version. Mass Effect: Andromeda is an overall good but imperfect title, destined to be discussed for a long time A new home The story that surrounds the production begins in 2185, before the invasion of the Reapers and in the period in which the events of Mass Effect 2 take place, when through the Andromeda Initiative, the best scientists, soldiers, explorers and colonizers of various species are sent to Andromeda on a one-way trip to establish a permanent presence in an ostensibly resource-rich galaxy. But this is not really the case, so after having remained virtually in hibernation for more than 600 years, without any contact with their place of origin, the members of the expedition awaken in 2819 and discover that the planets that were to host them are all other than habitable. This is due to a robotic race that has built strange technological artifacts that make the worlds selected for colonization unlivable. Not only that, to complicate things for the pioneers, led by the protagonist, one of the brothers Ryder, Scott or Sara depending on the gender chosen to play, there is also a strange form of dark energy that threatens to destroy their spaceships , and an alien species that does not welcome the presence of members of the Andromeda mission. In short, the foundations for a good story would all be there, despite the lack of underlying originality. Yet, despite the premises, this after a promising start, with the feeling of really being in a new universe, lost and without indications, slowly flattens out and on balance, without expiring, reveals itself to be devoid of that epicness that characterized the Trilogy by Commander Shepard. A notable flaw, considering how a compelling story is in our opinion one of the key elements of the experience of this type of video game. Be that as it may, speaking of gameplay itself, the central theme of Mass Effect: Andromeda is obviously the exploration of new worlds. This takes place within a limited number of planets whose maps are quite generous in size (therefore it is not a true open world), and where it is possible to move in total freedom on foot or using the Nomad, a land vehicle totally customizable both from an aesthetic and technical point of view, to discover its secrets, or to complete the many main and secondary missions. These can be tackled in no specific order and generally lead the player to search for new life forms, materials useful for the needs of future colonies and for his own ship, or for his own equipment, and so on. The secondary missions are many and initially varied, even if after a while they all tend to look alike and prove repetitive in their unfolding. The main objective, however, remains to progress in the adventure and make the planets suitable for hosting outposts, which is feasible only after having possibly eliminated hostile races and threats, qalmost always climatic and environmental, such as the anomalies created by the technological artifacts mentioned a few lines above, which must be blocked. By stabilizing or in any case making certain locations livable, it then becomes easier to explore them in depth and perhaps find previously impregnable or hidden areas and places precisely because of the existing ~problems~. In this context there is obviously no shortage of the usual alien races eager to eliminate the presence of the pioneers, and therefore the consequent fights to the death for their own survival. Frantic battles In this sense, Mass Effect: Andromeda offers the first major novelty, which then brings with it a series of important changes related to equipment, biotic powers and in general to the growth of the party, such as the skill system that regulates the progress of the protagonist who is now applied en bloc also to the evolution of his companions, just to give an example. We are referring to the combat system which, contrary to the past, abandons RPG/action hybrid solutions (no tactical pauses or slow-motion effects) and pushes the accelerator on the frenetic and open-faced clash. Almost banishing any cover, which is now completely automatic, in favor of continuous movement to attack or avoid blows. In short, compared to the past, this time the game offers a fighting style that draws heavily from the best known action and third-person shooters, starting with Uncharted and Vanquish. It is no coincidence that the traditional classes have been eliminated in favor of a more fluid and attractive system precisely for the player more prone to action, and a certain emphasis has been placed on aspects such as the possibility of acting vertically and remaining for a few moments in air thanks to the jet pack to hit opponents in cover, and on a type of quick dodge, capable of covering a good distance without any type of reload. The same two party members who accompany the protagonist into battle as always can be easily commanded with two simple commands. Everything, we repeat, to favor a certain ~ease~ of control and action. In these situations, we would like to point out some drop in frame rate in a couple of outdoor scenarios, during some agitated phases with many enemies, explosions and various effects on the screen. But even if the title does not always keep the 30 frames per second constant in these cases, there is not a drop so excessive or sharp as to be annoying or to make the portion of the game unplayable. Returning to the user's commands and allies, their artificial intelligence, like that of the enemies, ~lives~ with ups and downs: overall it behaves quite well, but occasionally it gets lost in a glass of water, like when it forces the user to go and heal an injured teammate, given that the other member of the team may pass by him as if nothing had happened. Similarly, as far as enemies are concerned, they are able to act following a certain logic, encircling the opposing team, using cover to target them and the verticality of the scenarios to surprise them even from above. But this is mainly true for those more gifted from the point of view of equipment or ~level~ and race, not for more ~simple~ creatures or of a lower ~category~. For the rest, in the game the user has to worry about taking care of human relationships with the other characters as per tradition. An important role is exercised in this sense as per tradition by the dialogues, essential to discover more details on the history behind each of your allies, but also to further develop relationships with the crew and the races with which you come into contact. and moral choices, which are re-proposed here with a slightly different approach than in the past. In this sense, a crucial role is played by the new ~choice wheel~, thanks to which the exchanges of jokes and speeches are more dynamic and with more nuanced tones, given the presence of many lines of dialogue and the different possibilities offered by new options . In reality, the flexibility of the system appears more of a facade, in the sense that questions can be asked and answers more vague or ambiguous than in the past, but sometimes some of these appear to lead equally to the same result, as if a direct or more vague on a certain topic would produce the same effects in discussion with the creature with which you are currently interacting. However overall we liked it. Xbox One goals Mass Effect: Andromeda offers 55 Objectives for a total of 1000 points. To get them you need to meet the requirements of the game, such as reaching level 40 in single playeror level 20 in multiplayer, develop a tech, combat, and biotic power up to rank 6 (solo) or complete 25 strike team missions and APEX recoveries in multiplayer, just to name a few. Loyalty and emotional ties Almost the same situation for the Loyalty Missions, similar to those of the other Mass Effects, but this time not mandatory or strictly linked to the main mission: the system provides, as always, that to increase the loyalty of each of the team members, the gamer can face a series of missions related to each of them. Helping an element of the team can therefore make him more loyal towards the protagonist and his companions, and so on. Sentimental relationships are inevitable: in this sense, it should be emphasized that they are richer in nuances and possibilities, but at the same time, however, quite disappointing and boring in the long run, because they are too stereotyped in evolution and not very interesting as a whole. We cannot conclude our review without first talking about the technological aspect of the game. Even in the Xbox One version, where it features a 900p resolution and good image quality, the title doesn't reach such high peaks of excellence as to leave the player speechless, but it does appreciate the same aesthetically as a whole. The level design is in fact excellent and leads the player into different scenarios from each other, also for the variety of flora and fauna, with excellent lighting effects and truly suggestive views. Too bad that some areas appear a bit bare in proportion to their size, and that sometimes in some places they seem to lack an adequate number of polygons, but to be honest you have to be really picky to notice these details. On the other hand, the modeling of the characters is good with an appreciable effort in facial acting, at least when this is not battered by showy bugs relating to the lips and expressions. This happens in particular during conversations where in a couple of circumstances we also happened to see a character freeze suddenly while his voice ~magically~ continued the discussion, people appearing and disappearing in the background, in the background, and being unable for several seconds to be able to choose a question or an answer in the appropriate dialogue menu, due to a sudden stop of the inputs sent via the joypad. This last problem, to be honest, has only happened twice, but we point it out for the record. More frequent, however, are those relating to animations, which in many cases leave you speechless, but in a negative sense: it is surprising that even today a title of this thickness and with a development team like BioWare behind it is unable to offer stability and quality in refinements, and may be affected by glitches like these. Defects that do not affect the usability of the product or ruin it 100%, but which are certainly annoying. Finally, as far as the audio component is concerned, Mass Effect: Andromeda offers an excellent dubbing in English (in Italian we only have the subtitles) with many lines of dialogue, a series of sound effects that are quite spot on and suited to the various settings, but against a soundtrack without infamy and without praise.", "date": "2017-03-22", "grade": "8.0"}
