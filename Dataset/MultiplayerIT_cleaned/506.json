{"name": "L'Era Glaciale 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lera-glaciale-2-recensione.html", "text": "A mouse for a friend The game is essentially a canonical three-dimensional platform in which we have complete control of the camera. The adventure leads us to take on the role (or rather the fluff) of Scrat, the nice rodent that even those who have not seen the film will surely know due to numerous promos and various advertisements. The main purpose of the greedy Scrat, as it is easy to imagine, is to collect as many acorns as possible, regardless of the glacial melt that worries other animals so much, such as the sloth Sid or the saber-toothed tiger (well yes, it is much more I use the English term sabretooth) Diego. After collecting the required number of acorns, a secret passage to a new area will open. The moves available are more or less the classic ones of the genre: jump, double jump, an offensive move that consists of kicks and punches and, in the more advanced levels, throwing stones (also to be used to distract larger and more dangerous enemies) . From time to time Scrat also has to improvise a swimmer to overcome small streams or emulate Sam Fisher in amusing stealth sequences where sometimes it is necessary to play dead to divert the attention of larger animals. Ice Age 2 is rather easy and linear A mouse for a friend As was more than normal to expect, especially considering the target audience to which this product is aimed, ~Ice Age 2~ is rather easy and linear: ultimately, all you have to do is follow the trail of acorns, collect them to unlock the next area (perhaps having to take out some unwelcome enemies from time to time), repeat steps one and two. A small variant to the scheme just described is given by the sporadic but nice sub-games, in which the other characters of the animated film will also take part. Ultimately, however, while for a child all this could be an excellent way to spend a few minutes having fun, it is clear that older or sufficiently experienced players could get bored within very, very short times. To appreciate the humorous vein, exactly in line with what was seen in the cinema. Graphics and sound From a graphic point of view, Ice Age 2 turns out to be exactly what is enough to provide a pleasant visual sector that does not clash with the animated film. Naturally, latest generation effects such as HDR and singing company are completely absent, and the resolution can be set to a maximum of 1024x768, but the characters are well modeled, the environments reconstructed more than worthily. The graphics engine is very light, and runs well even on less powerful PCs, but a DirectX 9 video card is required as a minimum: a bit strange, given that the game could very well be able to run even on older video cards. As for the sound side, in addition to very nice music and in perfect cartoon style, we find an excellent dubbing with many of the actors who have lent their voices to the characters in the film (fantastic Claudio Bisio in interpreting the sloth Sid). Cross-platform The differences between the PC version and the console ones are minimal, and only in terms of graphics. On PS2 and GameCube in particular you will have a lower resolution and you will not be able to use filters such as anti-aliasing or anisotropic filtering. That's all. Final comment Ice Age 2 immediately shows itself for what it is: a platformer generally aimed at younger people, easy, a little too repetitive but technically more than sufficient. It goes without saying that seasoned gamers would do well to stay away, but the sympathy of the product could infect more than one, especially in the segment of the public to which it is mainly aimed.Pros Very nice and pleasant Technically discreet Cons Suitable mainly for a very young audience Too easy and straightforward Of the many animated films that have invaded cinemas in recent years, one of the most appreciated by the general public was undoubtedly ~Ice Age~, which narrated the adventures of some cute animals during the period of a distant terrestrial glaciation. In the sequel, released in cinemas a few days ago, we find the protagonists grappling with a totally unexpected event: the sudden melting of the ice, which effectively puts an end to the world they had known up to that moment. On the other hand, the canonical videogame tie-in that exploited the success of the feature film was not unexpected at all. Indeed, here we are talking about Ice Age 2 for PC, Xbox, GameCube and Playstation 2.", "date": "2006-05-05", "grade": null}
