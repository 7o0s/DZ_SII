{"name": "Aqua Rush", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/aqua-rush.html", "text": "Aqua Rush is a video game released in arcades in 1999, therefore quite recently. Belonging to the puzzle game genre, it is a sort of ~Tetris in reverse~, in the sense that the vertical progression of the pieces to fit starts from the bottom and goes upwards, where a barrier of blocks inexorably descends until causing the game over. The innovation brought about by the game lies precisely in the blocks: they are not bricks of different shapes, but virtually always of the same element, in this case liquid, which can be shaped to fit into the empty spaces. Every time we manage to completely fill a ~row~, it disintegrates, projecting all the pieces below it upwards. These pieces in turn fit into the empty spaces and possibly create other full ~rows~ to be disintegrated, in a ~combo~ party that can lead to the resolution of a stage even with a single move, if desired. In this mobile version, Aqua Rush basically maintains all its characteristics: there is only one game mode and three difficulty levels, each with a different number of stages to face. Learning to shape the ~liquid blocks~ is very immediate, but the game becomes more difficult after just a few stages and it will take a few games to understand its philosophy as well as to determine which strategies are the winning ones in the various situations. Each of our blocks is virtually made up of three parts, each of which can be ~stretched~ by pressing a few buttons on the numeric pad. The lengthening is only possible vertically, therefore from a simple initial bar we can obtain a square (stretching all three ~appendixes~ twice) or an ~L~, or whatever shape is necessary to fill the empty spaces of the elements that they come to meet you. All this is repeated until we reach a sort of hot spot, a wall in the obstacles that blows everything up and ends the stage. On a technical level, Aqua Rush unfortunately immediately reveals a careless programming: the game works in its structure, however simple, but the graphics move slowly and heavily, as if our cell phone were calculating who knows what. Unfortunately, this lack of optimization, because that's what it is, also negatively affects playability: smooth graphics would have made everything much more engaging and fun. It could also be that everything is due to the sound effects, which in this case are sampled and not MIDI, but then it would not be possible to explain why other developers (Gameloft) have managed to do much, much more with even mid-range terminals, using much more effective graphics engines and sampled sound effects.
