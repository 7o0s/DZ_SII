{"name": "R.U.S.H.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rush_a.html", "text": "The films of the ~The Fast and the Furious~ series, which tell the world of clandestine racing in their own way, see the protagonists face off in races in which the only thing that matters is speed. The routes designated for this type of challenge are in fact very long straight lines, sometimes even very busy state roads, and the cars that participate are processed in order to get an extra cue in the final stages. Little or no attention is paid to the handling factor, as there are no corners to navigate, and consequently the valor and skill of the drivers only counts up to a certain point. The new title developed by Qplaze refers precisely to the world of clandestine car races, even if in this case the challenges consist in covering a certain route within a time limit and trying to survive the traffic. No direct opponent, in short, and no ~nitro~ that can shoot our car at the speed of light to make the last overtaking: we will be alone with our ability to change direction at the right time, also because failing to do so often translates into a deadly impact... R.U.S.H. offers a single game mode and provides us with five different cars, which must be unlocked by successfully completing the races and boast peculiar characteristics in terms of acceleration, final speed and steering sensitivity. Once on the ~track~, arrows on the screen will warn us of the presence of obstacles on the various lanes, giving us the possibility to move so as not to crash. What we will have to do, in addition to avoiding the other vehicles (often with risky maneuvers, carried out at the last moment), is to change gear by pressing the 5 key or by pressing the d-pad up, while pressing the d-pad to the left and to the right obviously it will allow us to steer. The routes are characterized by the presence of checkpoints that we have to reach within a time limit that is lower each time, so avoiding accidents becomes a fundamental factor in concluding a successful race. The game has different consequences depending on the extent of the impact: grazing another car will not affect our race, while hitting it could cause us to spin. Finally, a head-on will literally blow up the cars involved and make us lose several precious seconds. Depending on the stage, we'll find ourselves racing in the day or at night, in the sun, in the rain or even in the snow: the atmospheric factor will influence the movement of our vehicle, possibly adding inertia or making it more difficult to change direction quickly. The graphics of R.U.S.H. it's really good, probably the best we've seen in a racing game of its kind on mobile. The extraordinary levels of Need for Speed Undercover are not reached, but the EA Mobile title uses a classic view and is therefore based on a very different gameplay. In particular, the fluidity with which the track moves and the presence of stages so differentiated in terms of graphic elements, colors and atmospheric effects are astonishing. Furthermore, despite the heavy traffic, there are no uncertainties or slowdowns. If we really want to nitpick, it must be said that the explosion that follows the most dangerous impacts shows a series of defects in the polygonal construction, but it is a negligible defect. The sound consists of fairly good quality MIDI music, but unfortunately it doesn't leave its mark and doesn't add anything to the action.
