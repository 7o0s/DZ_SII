The series made its debut way back in 2007 on the Nintendo Wii, when the novelty of motion sensors represented an opportunity that was far too tempting for the developers to end up neglected: let alone in the party game genre, where for the first time players could be offered the possibility to physically get up from the sofa to mimic the movements on the screen. At the time Carnival Games did not particularly shine on Nintendo Wii, but no one is denied a second chance, and here 2K Games tries again on Nintendo Switch, with a package of mini-games designed to be immediate, fun and within the reach of everyone. It didn't go very well unfortunately, and by reading our review you will understand why. Gameplay: mini-games and village festival Carnival Games for Nintendo Switch is proposed as a light (and cheap) package containing 20 mini-games organized by thematic areas and a couple of modes. You can play up to four players physically present in the same room (no online functionality), each with a single Joy-Con available. If you were antisocial you could also consider playing alone against a not particularly smart artificial intelligence, but in any case the experience, as you might expect, would suffer a lot, lacking group laughter and the magic of playing all together. Main topics of Carnival Games are the party for its own sake, the village fair, the carnival theme: all the contents are exuberant and festive, most of the mini-games are inspired by the world of the circus or by the rides present during the holidays locals. A decidedly apt atmosphere, but the enthusiasm unfortunately begins to fade once you start playing for a very simple reason: not all mini-games are initially available. Mind you, it is not, at least in absolute terms, such a serious defect: after all, Super Mario Party also offers a group of mini-games immediately available to the player, then requiring you to unlock the others as you continue to play with friends. But be careful, because if the Nintendo title can count on an arsenal of 80 mini-games, minimizing the repetitiveness of the first moments, Carnival Games has only twenty mini-games in all. Of these, just eight can be started immediately, while all the others will have to be purchased using Tickets. Let us also add that the mini-games immediately present are not even the most inspired of the entire production, and it is understandable why Carnival Games risks being abandoned almost immediately by those present. The mechanics linked to the Tickets is fundamental within the title, and it is one of the many aspects of the production that in theory works very well, while once implemented it creates significant damage. Each mini-game, completed in both solo and party modes, grants players a Ticket reward based on leaderboard placement and overall performance. These tickets are the only way to unlock all the other mini-games present, and secondly also alternative audio tracks and customizable elements for your alter ego. The problem is that almost everything costs a lot, and the prizes in Tickets are around modest figures. Imagine getting twenty to thirty tickets per game, when it suits you, and being faced with a minigame that requires 400 to unlock: you probably won't play it for a long time, and it is said that your experience with Carnival Games last so long. Contents: many games, but not very convincing Ideas and good will are the two really positive elements behind Carnival Games: unfortunately, game in hand, almost everything else turns out to be incomplete, done too quickly or simply superficial. This begins with the variety and offer of content present: as long as it comes to throwing colored balls into glasses or hitting a baseball on the fly to hit a home run, things still work fairly well. But mini-games like the war between balloons/hot air balloons and the speed race of spaceships are at the limits of acceptable: the controls are not clear, their implementation proceeds in an even worse way, and it all ends in a general chaos where you proceeds somewhat randomly until the end of the game; mini-games that will probably never start again at a later time. It certainly doesn't help a poor technical realization, poorly finished, the angular polygonal models, the featuresalmost grotesque of the characters present, and an irritating dubbing in Italian, not so much for the tone of voice, but for the fact that the presenter continues to speak continuously at a high volume and always repeating the same things: if it were at least possible to shut him up! The inclusion of movement controls as a reward for certain objectives achieved within the title is also completely incomprehensible: the player expects to be able to start the baseball minigame by ~physically~ imitating the hit of the bat on the ball, and is instead forced to use the left analog in coordination with the pressing of the A button at the moment of impact. If he manages to get a high score in the match, then the game will reward him with the ability to use the motion controls: a decision that not only triggers a giant question mark, but which also in our case does not he rewarded us at all. For some strange reason, a bug, a message on the screen indicated that it had unlocked the new control system, but when it came to activating it, it didn't want to start working: maybe it was just bad luck, because in other minigames it was regularly activated.", "date": "2018-11-14", "grade": "5.0"}
