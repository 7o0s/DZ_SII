But when one of the members of the security team awakens from cryogenic sleep, there is no planet in sight and the rest of the crew appear to have undergone a disturbing mutation. What happened? We will find out in the twelve levels that make up the single player campaign of Dead Effect, a first person shooter with zombies based on science fiction, originally released on iOS and Android just over a year ago and now arrived on PC, via Steam, after the traditional passage in Early Access. In its first incarnation, the game had disappointed due to a woody and badly organized touch control system, which inevitably compromised the experience, but at the same time showed a series of potentials that should not be underestimated: a solid system, a technical sector of excellence and the ability to create the atmosphere one would expect from such a product. All elements that have somehow had an ~outburst~ on the Windows platform, and which we can therefore appreciate in their purest form, free of constraints and restrictions due to the previous mobile connotation. Born on mobile, sci-fi FPS Dead Effect brings all its zombies to PC, and it does it right Kill them all. Again Dead Effect was born from an independent reality formed, however, by developers with various important collaborations behind them. This must be why the cornerstones of the experience do not disappoint: an old school shooter, the game does not get lost along the way between puzzles and backtracking, but simply places us in front of some doors to open or switches to activate, following the vocal indications of a German scientist who seems to have figured out what happened and who represents the protagonist's only hope of solving the matter, one way or another. Of course, to appreciate these aspects you have to dig a little and not stop at the initial impact, spoiled by an evident lack of refinement: the interface, born on mobile, is really ugly and the commands, although customizable, support poor use of the Xbox 360 controller (the obligatory solution for those who use the PC from the sofa, connecting it to the TV): the screens between one mission and another, as well as the ~hacking~ that is used to access certain sectors, both require the use of the mouse, while in some situations the triggers need a repeated pressure to respond to inputs, which detracts from the dynamism of the gameplay. There is also room for ~freemium~ aspects, such as the possibility of buying an energy regeneration system which inevitably makes the challenge milder, allowing us to catch our breath between one fight and another rather than advancing cautiously to the next medical console . It goes without saying that we appreciated the difficulty above all of the game, the hardcore look of some really messed up sequences, with hordes of zombies proceeding in our direction and which must be mowed down by coming to terms with an effective but full of limitations arsenal; moreover often subject to the end of ammunition, an eventuality that leaves us with only one electrical attack available. As spectacular as it is (it literally blows off the heads of the undead), the device requires a few seconds of reloading between shots, and only works at point-blank range: don't count on it too much if you're clearly outnumbered. However, the character has a couple of tricks up his sleeve: the Dead Effect, which gives the title to the game and which consists of a devastating bullet time to silence the toughest opponents, and a sort of ~shock wave~ which blow away the closest enemies. However, both moves require a substantial recharge time, so they must be used wisely. Kill them The Dead Effect campaign is completed in less than three hours, and this too is a factor that derives from the original mobile connotation of the product. In support of the story mode, however, we find the possibility of replaying the individual missions and trying our hand at two extra modes, Survival and Biohazard: the first is exactly what it seems, that is a challenge to last as long as possible against infinite opponents, while the second is a test of skill where zombies come in waves, but with predetermined stages and, therefore, a clear sense of progression. However, there is a certain degree of replayability, considering the system that regulates the purchase and upgrade of weapons, with the traditional two currencies (credits and gold bars) which push you to retry some missions to raise the money necessary to unlock the equipment that does not papart of the standard equipment. Of course, the downside is precisely the fact of finding yourself completing the game using only a pistol, machine gun (or rifle), grenade and the aforementioned electric shot, without being able to experiment with other solutions. Bearing in mind a sale price of just 7.99 euros, however, it seems to us that the offer is fair, and that lovers of first-person shooters can find a valid pastime in the BadFly Interactive title between a game of Wolfensten: The New Order and one in Titanfall. On the technical front, however, the game knows how to be appreciated: the English dialogues are not the best in terms of conviction and quality (we have the classic hero with three testicles and the aforementioned doctor with a marked German accent), but the graphics make use of solutions interesting, offers convincing polygonal models and does not even lack a certain type of effects, such as volumetric fog and a fairly advanced lighting system. Bearing in mind the hardware on which the project was born, there is really a hat off, even if in a competitive market like the PC one, some elements tend to amaze much less than on smartphones and tablets. However, there is a good variety of enemies, each with a peculiar pattern (bastard bombers, watch out), and the authors have somehow managed to give a minimum of detachment to the settings, which being the corridors of a spaceship risked to repeat itself excessively.", "date": "2015-01-05", "grade": "7.0"}
