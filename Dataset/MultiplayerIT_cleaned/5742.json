It took almost a month for Camouflaj to fix the problem and finally allow Apple device owners to return to help Hope in her desperate attempt to escape from a mysterious and oppressive totalitarian regime. Too bad that the infinite patience of the buyers of the series has not been repaid by a chapter up to the previous ones... Rpublique - Episode 4: God's Acre marks a worrying decline for the series Map of the problematic Not content with arriving fourteen months after the previous installment, Rpublique - Episode 4: God's Acre also lacks a summary of the events that have occurred so far, a lack that is difficult to digest especially considering how dense and full of names and characters the story concocted by Camouflaj. Even players with an iron memory can only be disappointed by a narrative component that in this chapter proves tired, tedious and at times so naive as to appear almost amateurish: we don't reveal anything specific to avoid the risk of possible spoilers. but the impression is that Hope's adventure has reached a dead end from which the designers of Camouflaj don't quite know how to get out. A feeling of surrender that is perceived in practically every aspect of Rpublique - Episode 4: God's Acre, which proves to be short of breath both from a technical and a playful point of view. With all the extenuating circumstances that it is possible to give to an independent team, it is difficult to be satisfied with a cosmetic that has not substantially evolved since its debut at the end of 2013 and which today shows rather evident technical limits: we are mainly talking about washed-out textures and angular polygonal models , all gaps that the title already brought with it from the first episode but which here suffer the effects not only of the passage of time, but also of a decidedly unfortunate starting stylistic choice. Rpublique - Episode 4: God's Acre is in fact set outdoors, divided between two main locations (a cemetery and a labyrinth of hedges) which do not shine in terms of inspiration and above all are debased by a color palette which seems to contemplate only green and grey. The cold, spotless and fascinating interior sequences are a mere memory of the previous chapters, and the same fate awaits numerous gameplay elements that contributed to making the play structure set up by Camouflaj balanced and particular. There are no longer the Prizrak patrolling the areas, replaced by a single nemesis (Mammoth, a huge guardian with a double personality) which is not only much less interesting, but also takes away the typical pleasure of the previous episodes of investigating the identity of the various enemies and maybe pickpocket them to get some useful items. Unfortunately, this is the tip of the iceberg of a list of playful components that - for frankly inexplicable reasons - the developers have brutally swept away: the inventory practically no longer makes sense to exist, the violations of ports and computer systems have disappeared and there are no more upgrades for the OMNI View system, and as a consequence Rpublique - Episode 4: God's Acre is orphaned of a large part of the interactivity that had characterized the series so far. What remains to be done here is to photograph certain elements of the scenario to recover audio fragments, collect some collectibles and move Hope through the scenarios to solve puzzles that are also uninspired. To give the measure of how out of focus Camouflaj's work appears, it would be enough to mention the useless structural complexity of the main settings, almost completely devoid of content but which force the player to switch from one surveillance camera to another with an unnerving frequency to make Hope move a few steps, highlighting all the limits of a control system that simply wasn't born for these purposes.", "date": "2016-01-29", "grade": "5.0"}
