{"name": "World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-recensione.html", "text": "We have reached the end of our long coverage: we have told you about our adventure in the islands of Kul Tiras and Zandalar for three weeks and, after reaching level 120 and scraping together some equipment in expeditions, we dived into the first raid, Uldir, which Blizzard released just the day before yesterday along with Mythic+ dungeons and the new Warfront mode. World of Warcraft is an MMORPG full of content for all tastes, but the beating heart of the endgame is PvE in raids by ten or more players. We faced Uldir on the normal difficulty level and the design of the fights with the monsters and constructs that infest the ancient laboratory of the Titans did not disappoint us: the bosses in this expansion, both in the raid and in the other dungeons, are truly among the best that Blizzard has been crafting all these years. Among other things, Uldir is only an introductory foray that serves to give players a long-term goal until the release of the next content that will most likely be presented at BlizzCon. And here the donkey actually falls, because the launch of Battle for Azeroth has not completely convinced us. In the following lines we will explain why, but now we have to make an important premise. It's nothing that we haven't already written in the past, mind you: MMORPGs are titles in constant evolution, the developers put their hands on the code every other day as well and it's not strange that they improve or worsen with the passing of the updates. Take Warlords of Drenor: the fifth expansion of World of Warcraft started with a bang, but then Blizzard got lost in a teacup and reached the next with shortness of breath. Legion, on the other hand, had its minor hiccups, but after an extraordinary start it still kept a decidedly high profile throughout its course. Battle for Azeroth, on the other hand, started off with some hesitation. This doesn't mean that Blizzard can't significantly improve the offer and arrive at the next expansion exceeding all expectations, but we can't predict the future and we only have to judge what we're playing now. Ten levels with no surprises And what we're playing now, in the middle of the endgame, is an expansion that Blizzard hasn't finished as it probably would have liked, thanks to the rush to go out on the market so as not to leave its loyal consumers too dry-mouthed, left twiddling their thumbs to more than six months after the last Legion update. Irvine's company has always been famous for the care it puts into its works, but in the case of Battle for Azeroth we have encountered some problems of some significance in terms of balances or pure and simple game design. The thing that left us most dumbfounded was precisely the growth phase of the character from level 110 to level 120: as we have already had the opportunity to point out, net of some less interesting secondary missions, the storylines focused on the inhabitants of Kul Tiras and We especially liked Zandalar because they help define the new locations. On the gameplay front, however, the ten additional levels were disappointing: with no new feats or spells to learn, the levels just follow one after the other without any real incentives. The fault also lies with the new legendary amulet, the Heart of Azeroth which perhaps grows too parallel to us, ending up quickly dissociating itself from the individual increase of the character. In Legion the specific skills of the Artifact weapons, tangible objectives to be achieved, prompted players to scrape together the Artifact points in the most disparate ways. In Battle for Azeroth, the Heart of Azeroth levels up slowly by collecting Azerite and does not reward the player immediately, but only when and if it finds Azerite armor pieces that depend on the amulet's power. The whole mechanics of the Heart of Azeroth and the specific skills, moreover, seemed a bit superficial to us. Blizzard promised a huge variety of builds and configurations, but the reality is that some skills are vastly better than others, so players ended up dressing up and down alike, hunting for items with stats and skills more appropriate. In addition, the skills in question translate into passive bonuses that do not change the rotations and combat styles of the classes in the slightest, unlike what happened instead with the powers of legendary items, the skills of Artifact weapons or the bonuses in the sets of previous expansions . The choice to abandon the iconic outfits that were looted in raids and which gave players specific bonuses capable of distorting the styles ofgame in the face of dramatic improvements in performance, frankly, astounded us. Blizzard has decided to distance itself from this tradition because on a practical level it always involved various imbalances and consequent balances, but in doing so it has also renounced the so-called ~fantasy class~, even homologating the aesthetics of the new equipment. It's too early to figure out what that might mean on the long run - luckily there is transmog! - and it wouldn't surprise us if the Irvine boys decided to head back. Joys and sorrows of 120 In the past, we have carefully analyzed the pros and cons of the system employed in Legion with Artifact weapons and legendary equipment, but it must be admitted that in recent days we have felt a little lack of the iconic weapons that all players wielded and the orange little things that never came out and, when they finally appeared on the screen, maybe they weren't even what we wanted. Was it better when it was worse? Well, not quite, but almost. We missed the Artifact weapons for the simple fact that, once we reached level 120, we actually had to get new weapons by scouring shipments or relying on crafting and above all on luck, since world quests almost never offer weapons in reward. The problem could have been easily solved by offering other resources in terms of equipment. Take Island Expeditions, for example: we loved these new three-player scenarios. They are fun, original and partially procedural, so they change settings often, guaranteeing a certain level of challenge thanks to the ingenious artificial intelligence of the enemies that simulate a team of real players. It's a real shame that this mode only pays off in Azerite and minor collectibles like toys, pets and mounts - if it had given the opportunity to equip characters, it probably would have been played a lot more. He deserved it, because it's one of the best gimmicks in Battle for Azeroth. The Warfront, which essentially simulates a game of Warcraft III, is also a fun pastime - perhaps a little naive, since it can't be missed - and fortunately rewards players with weapons and armor, but only the few days in which is open before switching to the opposite faction. It would have been better to always have access to this fun content. In a certain sense, we missed the legendary for completely opposite reasons, in short: the possibility of finding them at the end of an expedition, a battlefield or after completing the daily requests of the emissary, pushed us to face different activities every day effectively hooking us into the game like a perfect carrot hanging from the proverbial stick. Not that there is nothing to do, once you reach level 120, mind you. The maps fill up with world quests, and you can dive into increasingly difficult Mythic+ dungeons, PvP, and raids. However, most of the daily content revolves around reputation levels with the various factions and once the desired thresholds are reached, the range of activities narrows down enormously. Our impression is that Blizzard has drawn its weapons too soon. Legion brilliantly passed the first weeks after launch thanks to a whole series of features and contents capable of keeping the players' interest very high: the accumulation of Artifact points, the aforementioned search for the legendary, the missions related to the Enclave and the taking of Suramar that unlocked weekly and so on. Battle for Azeroth, on the contrary, would seem to have already played the cards available right away. The War Campaign turned out to be short and relatively interesting, the Island Expeditions very enjoyable but not very profitable; then, once the main storylines have been completed, all that remains is to wait for the release of the new contents by repeating expeditions and raids ad nauseam. As it has always been, of course, but in this case it seemed to us that the threshold of repetitiveness had been reached too soon. However, it must be emphasized that the perception of the limit in question varies from player to player. For us who are used to optimizing times partly for work and partly for passion, from the point of view of endgame activities, it was easier to notice these shortcomings in terms of content, but the more casual players who can only dedicate a few hours per day to their adventures on Azeroth perhaps they will never realize these problems, busy as they will be completing mission after mission and discovering all the littlehidden secrets in the corners of Kul Tiras and Zandalar. And in the end that's what really matters.", "date": "2018-09-07", "grade": "8.0"}
