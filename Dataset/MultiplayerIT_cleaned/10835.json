{"name": "Sway", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sway.html", "text": "Sway's world is turned upside down by a careless wizard and his failed magic. Miraculously all the inhabitants were saved but remained stuck in the various locations of the devastated world. The only one unharmed and free is the lizard Lizzy who, thanks to her Spiderman-style sticky skills, begins her journey through the various levels with the aim of freeing the seven trapped friends. As? By finding the three hidden keys and reaching the exit. The plot is certainly not brilliant but Sway amazes with its style of play. The commands are reduced to the use of Lizzy's two hands, which can be exploited through movements on the iPhone touch screen; the red hand is associated with the left side of the mobile while the green hand with the right one. Both hands are freely controllable by pressing the part dedicated to the chosen limb and by rotating the finger Lizzy will begin to dangle until we let go. The protagonist can be hung from any platform and handhold by simply holding down the dedicated section of the touch screen. Like a new Tarzan, the lizard dangles from level to level until he reaches the classic finish line. The locations are divided into four distinct environments: wood, grass, metal and sand. A total of 15 levels, multiple goals intersect in the middle of Lizzy's adventure. In addition to the search for missing friends, each territory hides a number of pink stars to collect and a measure of the time used to complete the route. Stars and time are the two variables thanks to which the classic medals are awarded, a metaphor for the objectives achieved in the level. If the aim of the game is to free the companions, the latter will give that extra bit of replayability to Sway. Once an element of our team has been freed, we will be able to select it and count on the unique and peculiar skills of each protagonist. For example, the Ninja is fast and boasts of long leaps, while the monkey has a good grip but slow. Consequently, it is possible to completely replay Sway with each character unlocked, perhaps trying to beat the personal bests obtained. Sway's platforming profile is enhanced as you explore the levels. In fact, there are various obstacles starting from fixed and mobile walls, presses, spikes and the like that divide Lizzy from the finish line. The difficulty of the challenge grows as the levels go by as more and more frequent obstacles are proposed where the use of gray matter must be combined with manual skill. The graphic sector of Sway is reduced to bright colors contrasted with bare and lackluster environments. The few objects placed on the platforms act as obstacles but do not emphasize particular care or richness of detail. Opposite opinion instead for the painstaking dedicated to animations and movements: the rocking of the protagonists and their twists are always precise and credible. The variety of costumes dedicated to unlockable characters stands out above all, some really hilarious. The soundtracks used in the various stages are very good, always engaging and never tiring.", "date": "2009-03-08", "grade": "8.0"}
