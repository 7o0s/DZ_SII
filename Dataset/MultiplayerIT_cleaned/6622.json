Let's talk about the State of Play game (not to be confused with the Sony PlayStation event), which takes us - as the title suggests - to Antarctica. We have already told you what we think of the original version in our first review, but in this case we will tell you about the PC version, which we played via Steam and which will be available from August 3, 2022. Between present and past South of the Circle takes us to Antarctica South of the Circle is a deeply narrative-driven adventure in which we will move between the past and the present. Today is Antarctica, immediate danger and exploration. Our protagonist, Peter, has just survived a crash with a small plane while trying to reach a British base at the South Pole. The pilot is injured and Peter is the only one who can go to get help. On this solitary journey through the snow, however, memories will make their way, which will take us back to the moment that started it all: the meeting with Clara. The woman, like Peter, is a Cambridge scholar looking for a topic for her first publication, which serves to sanction the transition to a permanent role within the university. Peter - climatologist - has been working for years, but still can't find a valid thesis. The turning point will be marked by the meeting with Clara. The woman is brilliant and the two become colleagues and lovers. South of the Circle takes us on a journey lasting about three hours, in which we will have to make a series of ~dialogue~ and plot choices. The former will be represented in the form of reactions: we will be able to express ourselves in certain verbal exchanges in a cheerful, calm or doubtful way, however without this really influencing the progress of the scenes. There will then be a series of key plot moments, during which our choices will offer clear special icons that will be recorded by the game. Without spoilers it is impossible to explain in detail the structure of the choices, but we can say that they are completely irrelevant and fundamental at the same time. There are no right or wrong choices and the game will make us understand what it really means to choose and what is the value of memories. It is an interesting way to propose a plot, which will slowly unfold leading us to discover the truth behind our trip to Antarctica. The context is also very interesting: these are the years of the Cold War, with its difficulties and mistrust. South of the Circle is completely based on its own plot and we can certainly say that it is one of those works worthy of attention, if we accept the great (and voluntary) playful limitations. pc South of the Circle offers various environments, but exploration is nothing However, the quality of the game in narrative terms had been well or badly known for some time and, now, the question is whether to opt for the PC / console version or whether to stay on the Apple Arcade one. A first difference is the graphical presentation. Even if the style has remained the same, that is minimal but pleasant, the superior power of PC and console has allowed State of Play to propose a slightly more defined work, with some scenes a little more dense with polygonal elements. It is not a complete transformation, mind you, just a set of small tweaks that could also be missed. There are very small issues with some shadows and some animation, which are more noticeable on a big screen, but these are minor trifles. There is also a difference in the input system between the two versions, but considering the low level of interaction of South of the Circle it is not particularly relevant to lose access to the touch screen. South of the Circle isn't always just snow More relevant is how you want to approach South of the Circle. The work of State of Play is segmented into small sequences, between past and present, which often last a few minutes. It is a great choice for the mobile version, so that the player can easily start the game, complete a section or two in a few minutes, then close the adventure and return to it at the next break. On computers and consoles, on average, the player tends to start the game with the idea of spending a fair amount of time on it. For this reason, the presence of some phases that are a little slower than the rest of the game risks weighing slightly more, given that within a large session one gets the impression that those sequences are much less useful than the rest . Of course, nothing prevents you from starting your PC for alreadyoke even just 10 minutes and enjoy the experience in small bites, just as nothing forbade Apple Arcade to play for three hours in a row with the smartphone in hand. South of the Circle revolves around Clara and Peter Finally, we point out that the game is translated into Italian (interface and subtitles), with an excellent English dubbing. The soundtrack is also pleasant and delicately accompanies each section of the game.", "date": "2022-07-31", "grade": "8.0"}
