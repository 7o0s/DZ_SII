{"name": "NBA 2K23", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-2k23-recensione.html", "text": "In addition to NBA 2K, the other flagship of Take Two are certainly the open world games of Rockstar Games: not only GTA, but also Red Dead Redemption or Bully are able to teach the rest of the industry how to build an experience of this kind, what to do to make it enjoyable and what to avoid like the plague so as not to annoy your users. They range from level design that is as free of barriers or dead ends as possible, to filling the environments with interesting things to do, that always leave something to the players. Above all, however, it is always a pleasure to wander through these worlds thanks to means of transport that are fun to control and characters and scenarios capable of entering the heart. With that in mind, we don't understand how Visual Concepts, a studio that tends to know how to develop a video game, can present the City of NBA 2K23 to the same people who judge the open worlds of Rockstar Games, but also those of Borderlands. We know we're being tough and starting the NBA 2K23 review in a rather unexpected way, especially considering the final numerical evaluation, but we really don't understand how a level product like 2K's can stumble again on its own steps. A limping metaverse How not to want a neighborhood with snakes in a basketball game like NBA 2K23 The goal of Visual Concepts is increasingly to create more than an open world, a sort of metaverse, or a virtual space that lives and breathes basketball in which, through a polygonal avatar, we can interact with others and with the different activities proposals. An ambitious intent, which has its origins in the District (which by the way is still the hub on PC, Xbox One, Switch and PS4) and which has increasingly become the fulcrum of My Player, the main mode of the NBA 2K23 in which you play a promising NBA basketball and take her from the bench in her rookie year to the Hall of Fame. If once, with mixed results, the attempt was to tell a basketball story in the style of He Got Game (or the more recent Hustle), now the whole epic of our alter ego has been fragmented within the City, a agglomeration of shops, businesses and characters who seem to think about nothing but basketball. Nothing to say so far, it's a smart way to create a hub in which to bring together some of the main game modes, from Jordan's Challenges to competitive matches, obviously passing through the single-player career. On paper, then, this year's novelties attack the weak points that emerged in previous editions: the collegiate career is optional, the peripheral districts of the city have become thematic and have greater personality and a rapid transport system has been introduced for move from one point of the city to another. Too bad, then, that the realization of all these things collides not only with matters of good taste, but above all with rather incomprehensible game design choices. All right to be realistic, but was it really necessary for rapid transit to be at stations and not take us directly to where we want to go? Why do we have to walk for 50/100/200 virtual meters to reach a specific point in the city? Or why do you have to queue for exercises in the gym or wait your turn to play a game on the pitch, when a classic matchmaking could speed everything up as well as make the challenge fairer? Queuing at the NBA 2K23 pitch is one of La Citt's incomprehensible choices Why do we have to spend 80 euros, put up with a lot of advertising from the various brands present and have the ever-present microtransactions if we then have to queue in our own game? Except that it is fun to go around the city, but this is marred by an incomprehensible level design, full of dead ends, invisible walls and obstacles that make moving on foot (or even worse with a skateboard) a plague worthy of the first experiments with open worlds. No contextual animations, there is no possibility to climb over a parapet or jump an obstacle: walking around the city takes away the desire to explore everything My Player has to say. And there are many things, such as the weekly activities at the Cinema, the challenges on the pitch with the other players and meeting the many stars who are hosted in the game, coming from the NBA universe, but not only. Then maybe we are old, but having a city full of people who think only of money, sneakers, clothes and success and structured like a US college fraternity is quite demeaning and puts what is ultimately the heart in a corner everything: the love of basketball and the sacrifices necessary to get to vetta. There are many personalities who meet in La Citt In this sense The W, or the career for a single player who examines the rise of a WNBA player from a playful point of view, is much more enjoyable, since it focuses on the game, training and sports growth and not on the whole bandwagon around. We understand, however, that women's basketball, even in the USA, is less electrifying than men's due to some choices that reduce its spectacularity and therefore not everyone will want to play it. Watch She Got Game on Netflix to understand what we are talking about. Jordan's Challenges His Majesty Michael Jordan in NBA 2K23 All of this hurts doubly because NBA 2K23, when it wants to talk about sports, does it like no other video game on the market. The work of Visual Concepts is not just a hyper-updated manual of the current NBA, with all the values, statistics, trends and patterns of overseas basketball emulated to (almost) perfection. It's also a love letter to chunky ball, a way for aging fans to play with their teen idols and for newcomers to discover the names that made the sport great. The easiest and most direct way to understand the passion and knowledge of the game that permeates the VC studios is to start the Jordan Challenges, a collection of the 15 games that helped create the legend of Michael Jordan, the strongest and most iconic basketball player Of all times. NBA 2K23 isn't simply a goal-based mode (score so many points, make so many assists, annihilate your opponents...), but it's a meticulous reconstruction of the history of basketball, not only from an aesthetic point of view. No matter what game of NBA 2K23 you use him in, MJ is always phenomenal What is obviously striking are the filters that simulate CRT televisions, the stands packed with people in flared trousers, the vintage commentary or the absence of the 3-point line, what conquers is the reproduction not only of the rules of the time (nothing zone and orbi barrel under the basket), but also of the trends of the time. You will find yourself racking your brains to figure out how to stop Pat Ewing, a true colossus under the boards, especially in college, but also to study a way to get out of the blocks of the Bad Boys in one piece. Between one challenge and another you will not only get to know the most famous quintets of the 80's and 90's, but you will touch the evolution of this sport firsthand, as well as being exalted by MJ's exceptional qualities. In fact, the Bulls star has been perfectly reproduced with all of his most famous dunks and plays present and ready to use: you will have in your hands a unique, very strong basketball player, capable of doing everything. The eras In NBA 2K23 Eras you can leave the Supersonics in Seattle! This research work could not be ~wasted~ on just one modality. For this reason, 2K Sports has chosen three historical years (2002-03, 1991-92, 1983-84) to give you the opportunity to take charge of one of the teams of the time and rewrite the history of the NBA. This can be done both by influencing the decisions of the League itself (such as the removal, change or introduction of certain rules) and the history of the franchises, by choosing players in the Draft instead of others, so as to avoid the suns and build a real Dream Team. You can even choose to leave the Supersonics in Seattle, so to speak! However, it is also an opportunity to leave everything as it is and relive some of the most electrifying rivalries ever, playing with some of the most iconic teams to ever walk the parquet such as the Lakers and the Celtics of Magic and Bird, the Bulls of Jordan or the Lakers of Shaq and Kobe. NBA 2K23's history filters are wonderful As we said, however, it's not just about having the ability to control those teams, but about trying to replicate their style of play, as well as the basketball of those times. A slower, more physical game, often with the three-point line closer and a tendency to put down those who take too many liberties in the ballpark. Yep, we're talking about the original Bad Boys again. A real time machine for lovers of the ball in segments, who will be able to appreciate even more the gameplay proposed in this edition of NBA 2K23. The gameplay Some historic dunks by Jordan Until Visual Concepts rewrites its graphics engine from scratch, it is difficult to think of major changes in the gameplay of NBA 2K23. Like all good tailors, however, the 2K Sports team knows its garment perfectly and is able to give it a different shape at each edition in order to adapt to different needs. As we have just told you, the gameplay of NBA 2K23 changes its face depending on the ~game~ you will face: a Jordan college game is different from a playoff final of My Player, a women's basketball game is different from that between the Celtics and the 80s Lakers. This is undoubtedly the greatest merit of the production of 2K Sports, the reason why this series stands, despite the problems and contradictions, above the other sports games on the market. The game is highly customizable and adaptable to everyone's needs, thanks to a whole series of granular options that affect practically every aspect of the experience. Sure, sometimes it's not easy to find where to change these options, but you can go from increasing the ease of scoring a basket to seeing all the patterns drawn on the parquet. In an effort to continue perfecting the classic formula, VC has changed the shot indicator for the umpteenth time. In this case it is a simple crescent that must be filled completely to maximize the chances of scoring. A simple system and for this reason very readable, which lightens the graphics in the game and simplifies understanding where one went wrong. In addition to the indicator revision, the percentages of realization have been changed: following the trends of the real sport, the team has tried to decrease the incidence of three-pointers by increasing the effectiveness of Giannis-style slashers or Jokic-style centers , Embid or Ewing, just to go back to the classics of the past. Even the defense has been revised and now it no longer aims, also in this case as in real basketball, to rely on spectacular shots, such as blocks or steals, but on positioning. Intuiting the opponent's movement and sliding in the same direction by creating contact not only slows down the attacker's action, but also soils the opponent's shooting percentages without committing a foul. Then if you have a LeBron, a Bird or a Shaq in front of you, or people who know how to absorb contacts, they will probably still suffer the point, but their action will gradually slow down and be led to error. The team's tendency to exploit the opponent's weaknesses is also excellent: if there is a mismatch under the basket, the computer will increase the number of balls and they will go towards the centre. Zion's (pre)power on the basket is more exploitable in NBA 2K23 As always, the new customized animations, the new interactions between bodies and better management of the ball, its rebounds and its trajectories are not counted, but the usual problems are also noted such as some forced or unresponsive movements, often inherited from the code past. Overall, however, NBA 2K23 on the basketball court is majestic, full of details and classy strokes, like a varied and always punctual commentary which, also in this case, varies according to the era told, with a more involved audience. action, livelier arenas and an atmosphere to be savored. In La Citt, on the other hand, approximate animations emerge, contacts with not very clean architectural elements and wooden controls, as well as awkward animations in the intermission scenes and polygonal models of 2000s video game fabrics.", "date": "2022-09-27", "grade": "8.0"}
