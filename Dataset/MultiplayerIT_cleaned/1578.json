{"name": "Soldier Of Fortune 2: Double Helix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soldier-of-fortune-2-double-helix.html", "text": "Graphically, Soldier Of Fortune 2 is nothing exceptional, Activision has not particularly focused on this aspect of the game. Overall, a fair level is reached, but if we analyze in detail, we immediately notice that there is something wrong. The first obvious flaw is the constant drops in frame rate, very serious for a first person shooter. On the texture and dynamic lighting front, it's certainly no better. The bitmaps that cover the various polygons are well below the average of Xbox titles, and it's definitely better not to bother sacred monsters like Halo: SOF2 in comparison comes out with shredded bones. As already mentioned, the management of the light sources is largely insufficient: the sections in the dark are particularly badly made, practically unplayable. In short, it is clearly seen, unfortunately, that the programmers have not wasted too much time optimizing the code in the transition from PC to Xbox. If the graphics disappoint fortunately it goes a little better on the playability front. By now it's standard, almost all first person shooters on Xbox follow the excellent control scheme of Halo, and SOF2 is no different. The commands are well distributed on the pad, and the response is fast and precise: it's just a pity that the slowdowns intervene too often to ruin everything, which break up the action and make it difficult to aim in the most chaotic situations. Unfortunately, technical defects aside, the problem of SOF2 is another: the single player game is boring. Too boring. SOF2 is an absolutely mediocre shooter, which brings nothing new to the genre and is too similar to too many other exponents of the genre. The missions to be faced also offer a small amount of action and challenge, with a devastating valium-effect on the player. A truly lethal mix, especially on a console on which well-crafted FPS abound. As previously mentioned, Soldier Of Fortune 2 is Live Enabled, i.e. compatible with Xbox Live. It will be a habit by now, but the Microsoft online gaming service has the ability to revive the fortunes of titles that, boring in single player, earn some points in multiplayer. And the same goes for Soldier Of Fortune 2. If offline the game is decidedly soporific, on the net and against human opponents the situation improves a bit. Unfortunately not even the sound sector is well done, if the sound effects are fairly well done, the rest is well below average. The background music is appropriate for the situation, but not enough to make you really feel in the game and participate in the battle. Comment Programming a successful first person shooter on Xbox is no easy feat. The competition is ruthless and the genre is highly inflated on the Microsoft console: emerging is really very difficult, so much so that with this direct porting from PC Activision is far from hitting the target. A poor technical sector and just above average playability are not enough to make its way between rivals of the caliber of Halo, Unreal Championship and Return to Castle Wolfenstein. The only positive note is the support for Xbox Live, which however is not enough by itself to revive the fate of an insufficient product. Pros: It is played online thanks to Xbox Live Cons: Graphics meager Sound overall below average Sa already seen Failure is not allowed. This is the phrase that characterizes Soldier of Fortune 2, porting of one of the most successful first person shooters on PC. Your name is Mullins, John Mullins. A highly trained soldier to face any adversity, John can boast of a respectable career spent in the Army's Special Armed Forces. But now times have changed: abandoned the Army now Mr. Mullins has started his own business, allying himself with a secret association called The Shop with the aim of fighting global terrorism. In other words, the usual plot as always. Usual plot, usual first person shooter: at this point you wonder if this title is the usual and monotonous shooter, right? The answer is, unfortunately, yes. With titles like Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Ghost Recon, making a successful title of this genre on Xbox is very, very difficult indeed. To stand out from the very fierce competition, you need to do more. Much more.", "date": "2003-07-22", "grade": null}
