Now Peach finds herself scurrying around in a platformer of her own, while Nariko disembowels soldiers and slices their guts. The list is slowly getting longer, and the newcomer is the little nameless princess with purple hair who is the protagonist of PrincessFury. The title alone would be enough to explain the rest. Made by the Mostar team, it is a chaotic action game that takes the foundations of side-scrolling fighting games and adds interesting tactical and role-playing nuances. No plot, zero context. The player is immediately catapulted into the action, surrounded by hordes of enemies to be dealt with by pressing a single button. A virtual stick is used to move the princess, while holding down the action button you can carry out a chained attack. So far nothing particularly original, but to make things more interesting we think about the possibility of carrying around an ever more substantial handful of soldiers: as the levels progress, it will be possible to unlock archers, paladins, halberdiers and so on. A button in the upper left corner allows you to order allies whether to follow us or move freely; it is a function that adds a slight layer of tactics, which is useful when you need to defend several places in the level at the same time. Blue-blooded action The game offers about twenty different scenarios, each of which must be overcome by completing a specific objective: you go from killing all enemies to defending crystals, from escorting a diplomat to defeating difficult bosses. The alleged variety of missions fades away when you realize that each of these inevitably results in a frenzied button mashing, in an attempt to get the better of the opposing army. Everything is slightly tempered by the possibility of unlocking and using skills and spells: the player can take the field with up to three special attacks, which can prove to be more or less useful depending on the enemies and the objective to be completed. A bolt of thunder can clear all nearby opponents, while a well-placed tornado can overwhelm an entire line of soldiers. Too bad that PrincessFury shows most of its flaws in the combat sessions, the focal point of the entire game. After a while the battles become so chaotic and populous that you can hardly see your character, while the absence of a button to run freely makes the princess extremely slow and unable to free herself from the fray. But the real Achilles' heel of the title is to be found in the poor balance of the clashes: most of the time you will find yourself facing too powerful bosses or enemies out of your reach, thus being forced to repeat the previous levels over and over again to earn experience points and upgrade the various units. Needless to say, after a while, everything becomes very frustrating. Yet, strangely, the game manages to get away with this cumbersome formula based on upgrading troops and acquiring new soldiers and skills. It's an alchemy of sadism and gratification, one moment ferociously punishing the player and the next rewarding them with new abilities. Unfortunately, the question remains why the developers have not integrated any idea capable of enticing you to test yourself and move forward: not only is there any form of multiplayer mode missing, but the absence of goals, rankings is also felt or integrations with various social networks.
