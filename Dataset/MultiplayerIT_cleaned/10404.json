The quality of the product, the completeness in many aspects of the same, etc, have made Bethesda's masterpiece, despite some flaws, one of the most beautiful games ever, as demonstrated by the millions of copies sold and the various prizes won including the Game Critics Award and the Game Developers Choice Award, testimonials of the approval obtained by the public, insiders and the media. Strengthened by this success but eager not to abandon their users, the development team has well thought of giving further vent to their creativity and not archiving the mighty game world created by releasing even five expansions in periods to expand the basic adventure without making downloadable add-ons inconsistent, which audiences have been shown to appreciate. Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition is the special and definitive edition of this product containing all the expansions released to date as downloadable content and the original game. In principle, Fallout 3 is a RPG that makes the plot, free exploration, accurate game mechanics and atmosphere its strengths. It takes up the style of Oblivion's game and gameplay mechanics, proposing a main quest that the player can follow and carry out freely and according to his style of play, and a whole series of side missions more or less linked to the main narrative. Set around 2277, the game tells of a post-apocalyptic future where the planet earth has been devastated by a terrible nuclear war between the United States and China and the protagonists live sealed in a large bunker sealed from the inside, a real ecosystem in itself standing where no one can enter or leave, in the underground of Washington D.C. (renamed for the occasion Wasteland Capital). There also lives the protagonist of the story who is literally guided from birth by the video gamer who decides his gender, basic statistics (strength, perception, stamina, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck) and even his profession, later on, when he will even support a aptitude test (the G.O.A.T.) which will provide valid clues on the one most suitable for your style of play (this test can still be tampered with to manually select the attributes of the 13 available skills). For reasons of space, for all the detailed information, however, we refer you to the exhaustive review available at this address, while we will try to focus in this article mainly on the general content of this special edition, and in particular on the extras that characterize it. Operation Anchorage It is the first expansion released by Bethesda but it is also perhaps the most ~different~ conceptually from the original idea of the actual game. The approach chosen for this DLC by the creators is in fact the opposite in terms of gameplay compared to that seen in Fallout 3 being the first more focused on action rather than on those key elements of the second. Operation Anchorage therefore puts aside the exploration phases, here reduced to a minimum, the freedom of choice on the paths to take and that of collecting objects and weapons in the simulator (we'll talk about them shortly - Ed) in favor of greater dynamism, making the all more like a frenetic Fps than an RPG. To introduce this expansion without distorting the plot of the basic product, the developers have devised a system linked to virtual reality, transporting the player through it far in space and time with respect to the events of the main quest and precisely in one of the key moments of the war between States United States and China leading to global atomic destruction: the liberation of the city of Anchorage in Alaska. The story begins with the video gamer and his alter ego receiving a mysterious radio signal from a group of renegades. After a few vicissitudes the protagonist of the adventure thus finds himself inside a military base where he discovers that the authors of the message that brought him up there have in turn found an old cache of weapons dating back to the period of the war between the USA and China. To access it, however, it is necessary to complete a complex virtual reality program, or a simulator that reproduces the battle of the aforementioned North American town. Thus begins the real game in which the main aim is to eliminate the enemies until the objectives of the various missions (for a total of four) are behind enemy lines, with a minimum of strategic management of the support teamor, of which we can choose composition and equipment, which accompanies the protagonist in military operations. Being a simulator, the reality in which we move is fictitious so the recovery of ammunition and energy is structured in collection points with real distributors, the available arsenal can only be chosen at the beginning of each mission and cannot be changed at any time, etc. All for a few hours of actual gameplay. The Pitt It is the second expansion of Fallout 3 and compared to the previous one brings the style of the settings and the game structure closer to those of the original product. The Pitt is an industrial area to the north on the main map. In it lives a handful of soldiers who reside within an ever-growing fortified city, built with the metal sheets and the effort of some slaves. The former are the ruling class, those who go to the contaminated area to look for food and new recruits, while the latter are workers who spend their days cutting and smelting metal to build buildings and expand the inhabited area. Finally, outside the ~walls~ of the city live the troglodytes, a new form of mutants in continuous growth in number: in fact, in this area there is an unstoppable epidemic that sooner or later transforms all humans into these creatures. The atmosphere that permeates the whole adventure is very particular and the player is called to make moral choices that will influence the continuation of the story from time to time. In fact, he will have to choose, for example, whether to side with the predators of Ishmael Ashur, the leader of the soldiers, or with Wernher and Midea, two rebels who want to overthrow the leader of the military slavers and who have learned of a miraculous cure, kept hidden from the population right from the ~boss~ of The Pitt. The gameplay, as we mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph, abandons the typically Fps on rails setting in favor of a well-articulated mission, with an alternative ending and with a setting worthy of the best Fallout 3 sub-quests. There are several things to do from weapons new ones, from armor and items to recover to extra abilities to unlock and upgrade. Furthermore, it is possible to enter and exit the map at any time to return to complete pending tasks or to make purchases. Of course, the longevity is not exaggerated and the dialogues are not many, it still lacks complexity but it is certainly a good product. Broken Steel Broken Steel represents the third expansion of Fallout 3 and in addition to adding an unprecedented quest with a total duration of about four to five hours, it eliminates the original ending of the game by inserting new narrative elements in order to allow players to return to the contaminated area without problems for continue the exploration, and move the maximum limit imposed on the progression in the experience levels of the character from 20 to level 30 with all the perks and corresponding skills. Obviously new extras are introduced for the protagonist, new devastating weapons of the ~energy~ and ~heavy~ categories and very fierce enemies to face such as the Supreme Super Mutants, the terrifying Ghoul Technologists, etc. This DLC also marks the return of the main character's companions. The events of Broken Steel begin two weeks after the end of the main campaign, with the awakening of the protagonist from a comatose state immediately after the implementation of the Purity Project and will have to deal broadly, without spoiling too much, with the war on remains of the Enclave and the collection of a series of components necessary for the construction of a cannon called Tesla. The playability stands at excellent levels and the feeling of continuity of the main plot of the game, thanks also to the presence of known scenarios or stylistically identical to other existing ones, the new news of Tre Cani on Galaxy News Radio contributes to making the gaming experience very positive. Point Lookout This is the fourth DLC released by Bethesda. This is the largest expansion released for Fallout 3 given that the peninsula in which the story is set is about a fifth of the entire contaminated area and offers gamers many quests and a variety of situations that follow, obviously in a small way, the characterizing structure the original game. It is not for nothing that it focuses more on exploration and environmental characterization than previous productions. In Point Lookout the gamer can in fact follow a main story and various secondary adventures which, as mentioned, resume the opening and the variety of situations typical of the main game. In short, there is that freedom dedecisional and exploration that characterized Fallout 3. Exploring the devastated and contaminated area in which this expansion is set, with its swampy coasts and the fog that unfolds through the thick vegetation enveloping everything, it is possible to come across hostile inhabitants of the area, in new ultra-aggressive and very difficult to face, in people looking for help who in turn can trigger new mini-adventures if you decide to lend a hand. And in the usual large quantities of items and weapons to recover to upgrade. This is probably the best extra content available for Bethesda's masterpiece. Mothership Zeta The latest expansion released by the development team is perhaps also the least appreciated by players. This is because, unlike the last three, Mothership Zeta takes up the Anchorage style, reducing the gaming experience to a simple linear FPS and without any choice of paths and actions to take. It also has a not very high level of difficulty which makes everything easier to complete, a not excellent plot and a little inspired design of environments and enemies certainly not at the level of what was seen in the original product and in the other extra contents. The usual radio message will bring the protagonist this time near the alien spacecraft already seen in Fallout 3 (the one in which it was possible to recover the Alien Blaster and the energy cells). Once on the spot, the latter is kidnapped via a tractor beam and transported to the Mother Ship where the adventure begins. Perhaps it is needless to add that the references to the most famous low-series films of the genre, or to those typical elements of popular culture related to aliens are re-proposed by the developers during the various phases of the story, between mysterious experiments and daring shootings in the corridors of the spaceship. However, the many alien weapons available remain positive, from the Atomizer to the Disruptor (a long-range rifle), the objects and armor that can be found inside the extraterrestrial vehicle, as well as the possibility for the most ardent fans to extend further your stay in the Fallout 3 universe.", "date": "2009-11-05", "grade": "9.5"}
