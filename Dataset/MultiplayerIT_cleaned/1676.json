{"name": "Soul Calibur 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soul-calibur-2_a.html", "text": "To each his own... As you well know, a different character has been included in each of the three different versions of the game: Link on GameCube, Spawn on Xbox and Heihachi on PlayStation 2. Let's look closely at them. Link - Fans of the big N can only rejoice: Link is in dazzling shape and boasts a polygonal model that seems to have come straight out of the Zelda demo presented at SpaceWorld 2001. Excellent reproduction of his classic moves and his arsenal, excellent characterization (never speaks, just as per tradition). Watch out, he leads like a blacksmith. Spawn - The cult hero created by Todd McFarlane seems to be at ease among the mighty fighters of Soul Calibur 2. Despite his impressive size, he is quite agile and fast, and is able to strike from considerable distances. It's just a pity it doesn't have the traditional cloak. Heihachi - From Tekken to Soul Calibur the step is far from short, so much so that Heihachi actually looks like a fish out of water: he is the only character without a weapon, he uses two metal bracelets to deflect blows. On the other hand, he is damn strong and has kept his deadly 10-hit combo of Tekkenian memory intact. The polygonal model has been completely redone, and is more detailed than ever. Welcome back to the stage of history The beating heart of every match fighting game is certainly the fighting engine, the combat system that regulates the clashes between the fighters. That of Soul Calibur II is directly derived from the excellent one of its predecessor and takes up its philosophy, expanding and improving it. The first SC was fast, this sequel is even faster and more frantic, but never confusing, with adrenaline-pumping fights and lightning-fast exchanges of blows. The new implementation of the 8-Way Run system, which this time allows you to move around the arena with a simple touch of the directional pad or the analog stick, increases the three-dimensional sensation of the clashes and makes the fights even more dynamic and lively. Then there are many other small improvements and subtleties, such as guard breaks, tweaks in the way of buffering attacks and the possibility of loading moves at three different levels even while moving, but they are all subtleties that you learn to appreciate gradually which delves into the game system. On the other hand, Namco's intention to limit the ring outs, perhaps too frequent in the prequel, is immediately evident. It is more difficult for the wrestlers to throw their opponents out of the playing area, in fact the ring outs on rebounds so frequent in the first Soul Calibur have been almost completely eliminated, and walls have been introduced in some stages which, in addition to preventing the premature end of the matches introduce new elements of gameplay, allowing the player to lock the opponent in a corner and bombard him with blows. What is more important, however, is that the atmosphere of an epic duel, a challenge to the death, is excellently rendered. 9 The roster of characters is varied and well assorted, twenty in all, fifteen of which are immediately selectable and five extras to unlock. Among the old glories we include Mitsurugi, Taki, Ivy, Astaroth, Voldo, Kilik, Xianghua, Maxi, Nightmare, Seung Mina, Sophitia, Yoshimitsu and Cervantes. Those who have already played Soul Calibur will have no difficulty mastering them right away, but there are differences, even substantial ones. For example, Mitsurugi has been slightly scaled down, while Ivy and Taki have been upgraded. Instead, he remains very strong, a real Cervantes steamroller. Strong enough to even be unbalanced, just like in the prequel. Among the new recruits we find Yunsung, a student of Hwang who closely reproduces his fighting style, the sister of Sophitia Cassandra, Necrid, a brainchild of Todd McFarlane who fights using techniques of all the other wrestlers, the fencer Raphael and the very young Talim. Above all, these last two characters are the most interesting: Raphael is very fast and adopts a nervous fighting style, made up of quick jabs and lightning-fast dodges with a counterattack, Talim is a real splinter, equipped with good combos and moves particularly suitable for catapulting the opponent outside the edges of the ring. Then there are the three characterizing extra characters for each version of the game: Link on GameCube, Spawn on Xbox and Heihachi on PlayStation 2. We have prepared a nice box just for them, which you can read on the side. The balancing of the characters is good, but alas not perfect. It is in fact quite evident that some wrestlers are, even if slightly, stronger than others. An example above all Cervantes, with good speed, attacks that do a lot of damage and combinations of moves that are difficult to anticipate. As already mentioned, a real roller compresser, especially in the hands of particularly expert players. Welcome back to the stage of history Given the credentials of the prequel, could the extras be missing? No, the extras are there, and they are really a lot. There are many game modes proposed, both in single and in two players, but the real pillar of the title is the Weapon Master Mode, heir to the Edge Master Mode already seen and appreciated in Soul Edge and Soul Calibur. In this mode, the player is called to travel the world, exploring a virtual map and facing tests of increasing difficulty in order to accumulate experience points, to level up, and money to unlock extras and bonuses. As in Soul Edge, it is possible to equip wrestlers with different types of weapons, which can be used not only in the WMM but also in other game modes, and the effect is not only aesthetic, as each weapon has specific characteristics, unfortunately only explained in incomprehensible Japanese. The gold accumulated in the Weapon Master Mode is also used to unlock new arenas, new costumes for the characters, multiple image galleries and the classic kata, spectacular sequences of different moves for each wrestler, to be enjoyed in Theater Mode. Controllers, what a dilemma! Three different consoles, three different joypads: which one will be the best for playing Soul Calibur II? Fortunately, the pads on all three consoles perform very well. The PS2 pad has already proven itself time and time again in the past while the Xbox one performed more than brilliantly with DOA3. And it goes without saying that both controllers are doing remarkably well with SCII. The cubic pad was missing from the fire test, which has always aroused more than one doubt in the field of fighting games due to the arrangement of the keys and, above all, the microscopic digital cross. Well... test passed, and with full marks, also by the Nintendo joypad: the directional cross is really excellent, lightning-fast in response and very precise, while some difficulties come from the keys, with a different shape and a rather bizarre arrangement for a beat'em up at meetings . But you soon get used to it anyway. But if you really want to play big, buying a joystick is almost obligatory. One of those in the arcade style, with a large and heavy base, short and precise stick, optimally arranged gropes, all topped off with a handful of microswitches. Your (video game) life will change from this to this. The Soul still burns The first Soul Calibur was a true technical prodigy, a jewel, so much so that, very probably, not even the Namco programmers know exactly how they managed to get all that goodness out of the Dreamcast hardware. This time to squeeze to the core there were not one, but three next generation consoles, with decidedly different hardware architecture and potential. However, Namco has worked the miracle and Soul Calibur II is a feast for the eyes, on any platform. The reference hardware for the development was the PlayStation 2, the original coin-op runs on System256, and all three versions of the game are substantially identical. A myriad of on-screen polygons, recreating fairytale landscapes and admirably detailing the models of the wrestlers, fantastic textures and excellent graphic effects, all at a constant sixty frames per second. Actually, almost constant. In fact, there is some decline, but nothing alarming: these are sporadic uncertainties that occur only during some holds or while the final move of a round is being executed: in short, nothing that could affect the excellent playability of the title. The animations are superb, already the flagship of the first Soul Calibur and here even more fluid and realistic. The only drawback: from a purely artistic point of view, the game is not always as inspired as its predecessor. Some of the characters' costumes are, well, just plain ugly, and particularly evocative stages are set against others that are a bit dull and flat. The three versions, as already mentioned, are practically the same from a graphic point of view. The use of colors changes only slightly, while in the PlayStation 2 version the 'jaggies', the jaggies on the edges of the polygons, are slightly more pronounced. 8 Our judgment on the audio sector is equally enthusiastic. The music is excellent and closely resembles the epic style successfully proposed in Soul Calibur, just as the speech is excellent, thanks to an embarrassing amount of digitized phrases, and the sound effects that accompany the game. Never has the clang of clashing swords been so realistic. A curiosity: in the loading screen that precedes each match and which presents the two contenders, it is possible to make our digital alter ego pronounce various challenge phrases by pressingthe keys on the pad. It's absolutely useless, but it's a fun idea. A note that can only make the (few and lucky) owners of the latest generation televisions happy: all three versions of the game support Progressive Scan. And if Soul Calibur II is excellent in the 480p or 520p respectively of the GameCube and Ps2 editions, it is even stellar in the sensational 720p supported by the Xbox version, also thanks to the massive use of anti-aliasing. Too bad that, at least here in the old continent, very few will be able to fully enjoy the visual impact of the game. Comment The task for Namco was a difficult one: being able to improve a perfect game, possibly without distorting its strong identity, moreover developing it simultaneously for three different platforms. Fortunately, in the face of the results obtained, we can only tip our hats and bow down in reverence. Soul Calibur 2 is the worthy sequel to such a predecessor and wins the crown as the best fighting game ever made without too many problems (a title that he shares equally with Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution. You know, it's all a matter of taste ...). So no full score and 'only' a 9.5 vote? Yes, because despite the many improvements made, the game still lacks the innovative charge and genuine freshness of the prequel. But is it really possible to improve something as perfect as Soul Calibur? Whatever console you own, buy it. And if you don't like fighting games, buy it anyway. There is no excuse that holds. Pros: Excellent technical realization Skyrocketing gameplay Large amount of extras Almost eternal in multiplayer Cons: Some characters are slightly unbalanced Costumes and stages not always inspired We've waited four bloody years for it, it's finally here. The first Soul Calibur was a bolt from the blue, a real revelation: a perfect game in all respects, without the slightest flaw. The Namco creature squeezed the Dreamcast hardware like a lemon, so much so that the game still looks damn good today, offered an incomparable atmosphere, extreme gameplay and, more unique than rare in the world of beat fight matches, a quantity extra embarrassing. In short, simply sublime, so much so that the game arrogantly took over the title of best fighting game ever made, pace of the famous competitors. With such a heavy legacy on his shoulders, it goes without saying that Soul Calibur 2 was one of the most anticipated sequels ever. And we, to worthily honor his advent, have decided to dedicate the first review with votes in the history of Multiplayer.it to him...", "date": "2003-04-23", "grade": null}
