PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 when it was released in 2014. This first RPG inspired by the television series of the same name created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker was developed by Obsidian (Neverwinter Nights 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, but also several less successful) and was postponed several times at the time for various reasons, but above all because the authors wanted to offer players - and their fans! - a product that lives up to expectations. Today The Stick of Truth may appear a little more antiquated, when compared to its more recent successor, but it remains indisputably one of the most exhilarating adventures we have been able to play in recent years, even surpassing the Fractured But Whole at times. Between fantasy and reality Everything revolves around the mythical Stick of Truth, a simple twig collected by the pestiferous Eric Cartman at the end of the episode ~The Princess of Dragons~ and now at the center of an epic conflict between the king of Kupa, Cartman, and the dark elves led by Kyle Broflovski: we are in the middle, having recently moved with our parents. We're South Park's Rookie and it's clear right away that we're not exactly ordinary kids, as we make friends galore without even talking. The development of the story is very interesting because it is far from obvious, the story is full of twists and turns and the initial theft of the Stick of Truth is just the beginning of what can easily be defined as a gigantic episode. As also happened later with The But Whole, the screenplay and dialogues were written by Parker and Stone themselves who, moreover, lent their voices to the characters as happens with the TV series: unlike the sequel, The Stick of Truth it is subtitled in Italian but fully dubbed in English. The multiple narrative stratification surprises and amuses, with the children of South Park engaged in a real LARP (live role-playing game) that they take all too seriously in a surreal context where they are the only ones who realize the threat that is breaking down on their city: consequently, each object in the game has a description in pure RPG style and the winks to the genre are continuous and insistent, snatching more than a smile. Bags of potato chips become healing potions, radio antennas become magic wands, diarrhea is an anomalous status, Canada is a remote land and so on: a continuous exchange of meanings and signifiers that will delight those who love RPGs and follow faithfully the bizarre universe of South Park. Unfortunately, this console edition has also been censored as happened on the occasion of the original release: instead of a couple of hilarious minigames, a message appears explaining the reason for the censorship, underlining that it is only a matter of a handful of seconds that does it affect the story or gameplay in the slightest. Playstation 4 trophies The large list of Trophies is inevitable: 1 of platinum, 3 of gold, 5 of silver and 42 of bronze, for a total of 51. They range from spending a certain amount of money to selling absolutely nothing, passing through trophies that they are unlocked simply by following the story or requiring particular actions such as ranting on defeated enemies or throwing one's own ... excrement at the opponents. The new PlayStation 4 version of The Stick of Truth is almost identical to the original: it returns a slightly sharper and cleaner image, but it is clear that talking about a remastering would be exaggerated to say the least. The town has been faithfully reproduced and the large areas that can be visited, separated by short loads and fake levels of parallax, are exactly those of the cartoon. Fans will find practically all the most famous locations, which we also found in Scontri Di-retti, with respect to which, however, an 8-bit Canada is added. Exploration is essential and is one of the funnest parts of the game: we will be inundated with optional missions from the very first minutes, which can often only be completed after obtaining a key or after learning the skill necessary to overcome a well accurate. The quests and rewards intersect satisfactorily and you never get the feeling of being lost, thanks also to the map that allows us to summarize our objectives and treasures yet to be discovered in an instant. The missions, although optional, are actually very important because they allow us to earnnew friends, and in fact the game menus mimic Facebook and Twitter. The idea is captivating, but it would have been appropriate to revise the management of the menus and the inventory which has remained confused, limited to long lists of objects that cannot be compared. The game offers dozens of costumes (divided into hats, dresses and gloves) with the most disparate bonuses and powers that are not just cosmetic as in The Whole But Whole: the player is encouraged to collect and combine them all to satisfy a particular build or for pure visual pleasure, but the impossibility of changing them on the fly and faster makes this feature of the game less fun than it could have been. At the beginning of the game it is possible to choose between four classes that will determine the abilities of our Newbie: Jew, Warrior, Magician and Thief. The choice changes almost nothing, apart from the five main skills that consume PP and that can be upgraded at each level up: each class can equip any weapon or accessory, so the difference is really minimal and is limited to reflecting the preferences of the player in terms of special attacks that focus more on direct damage, anomalous states, and so on. Obsidian has chosen a turn-based approach where virtually every action on the battlefield is interactive. Pressing a key at the right time you can attack normally with a single powerful blow or chain a series of light taps, but you must always take into account the defensive posture of the opponent which could nullify the damage. The various special attacks require particular key combinations. The fact of being able to have only one companion - however interchangeable - during combat may seem like a step backwards to those who have played The But Whole with his teams of four, but in The Stick of Truth you never get the feeling of being at a disadvantage and friends, moreover, are well diversified in terms of skills and mechanics, guaranteeing a good variety both visually and strategically.", "date": "2018-02-18", "grade": "8.7"}
