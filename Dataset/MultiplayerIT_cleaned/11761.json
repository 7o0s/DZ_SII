{"name": "Pursuit Force: Extreme Justice - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pursuit-force-extreme-justice-recensione.html", "text": "BigBig Studios' first Pursuit Force had been one of Sony's most ambitious projects for its PSP, so much so that according to the Japanese company it was supposed to represent one of the killer applications of the then newborn portable console. A lengthy trailer for the game was even featured on the demo UMD included in its value pack at launch. Unfortunately for them, however, things did not go exactly as hoped. The game, in fact, while presenting a conceptually innovative and in some respects unprecedented gameplay, to the point of pushing insiders to look for a new definition to indicate its genre, failed to gain a hold on the general public due to a level of difficulty quite high and to a not excellent control system. A real shame, considering the potential of the product. Potential that evidently Sony has not forgotten, so after a few years, here comes a sequel to Pursuit Force, Extreme Justice. Same development team, same concept, but new management of the characters and modes, for a gameplay, according to the intentions of the authors, finally perfect. Capital City is once again in chaos as five dangerous gangs of criminals try to get their hands on the city. We are talking about the Convicts, who have just escaped from prison, the Raiders, a sort of ~assaulters~, the Syndicates, skilled in robbing banks, the Warlords, the mercenaries and finally a mysterious organization that plots in the shadows (without forgetting the competition, that is, the agents of the Viper Division, the rival team of the protagonist). The player (or players), in the role of one of the special agents of the team that gives the product its title, has the task of thwarting the threat. Pure action Pursuit Force: Extreme Justice therefore picks up where it left off. Its gameplay is focused on the perfect mix of driving elements with others of a pure action nature, in which frenzy and adrenaline reign supreme. Chases, shootings and reckless actions await gamers following one another from level to level without any interruption of any kind. But that doesn't mean ~don't think~. Each situation, in fact, requires the user to make a wise choice of all those elements useful for solving a specific level. Starting with the policeman to impersonate, for example. Each of them is in fact endowed with its own unique abilities, and therefore depending on the situation it is advisable to focus on one rather than another. Sarah is good at air support, Gage is good at driving and high-speed pursuit, Ash is good at so-called ~special ops~, while Preach is an expert in heavy weapons. The variety of enemies to face is, as we have seen before, quite varied, so it is obvious that in relation to them, at the level in which we are, in short, we opt for one choice rather than the other. The game is substantially divided into two main modes, one of which is the classic one, ~story~, in which following a plot you have to complete certain routes in specific areas and in extreme situations (jumping from one vehicle to another under a rain of fire, or clinging to the ~feet~ of a helicopter to get on board and kill the occupants), complete with final bosses that are so reminiscent of those of the old horizontal scrolling fighting games by Capcom in terms of design and situations. For example, there is one that will be faced on an airplane, but first you will have to hit the propellers of the aircraft, or another that will give you a hard time at high speed on a rough road. Luckily, many weapons and 12 different types of vehicles are available to the player to use to face any situation. These range from motorcycles to cars, passing through motorboats, helicopters, trains and even tanks. New modes Once again there are walking sessions, improved, albeit not by much, compared to the previous episode. The other mode is instead called ~Challenge Mode~, and is, according to the developers themselves, the one that most enhances the game concept of Pursuit and the PSP. In fact, BigBig Studios seem to have understood what it means to ~play with a laptop~ and with this option they allow gamers to also play quick games, those in which it counts only to break records, collect points or Items, without thinking too much or following narrative lines. Chris Whiteside had already said it: the game is predominantly a portable experience from our point of view, even for how we have balanced it. There are six different CMs, in order to increase the longevity of the title as much as possible. Also worth noting is the addition, to the various classic game modes, also the multiplayer one, in local wi-fi with 4players to challenge each other at the same time. And the experience, it must be said, is exhilarating in these cases. Especially once you master the controls. Even if these have been improved compared to the first episode, it is also true that having to perform all those actions equally involves a lot of practice before being able to better manage the commands. However, spending some time learning every little detail of Pg control is subsequently repaid by the intrinsic fun caused by the success of incredible actions. And in any case there are always three levels of difficulty from which to select the one that best suits your needs. The picture is completed by decidedly very beautiful graphics, with always new and various excellently recreated settings, well-modeled characters, and a sound of discreet workmanship like few have seen on a portable console. Comment Pursuit Force: Extreme Justice is a great sequel. In it we find everything good that we had seen in the first episode of the series, plus new elements that greatly improve gameplay and general quality. If you love those titles that emulate the films of directors like John Woo, therefore pure action and reckless acts, then this title is definitely for you. Pros: Great graphics. Always fun car missions. Multiplayer mode. Cons: Section on foot can be improved. Commands initially a bit difficult.", "date": "2007-12-06", "grade": null}
