The title of this paragraph summarizes the contents of Northern Strike in an analytical way. The three new maps present are all set in the northern part of Central Europe: Port Bavaria, Bridge at Remagen and Liberation of Lepzig are very ~dense~ of elements and easily adaptable to the various game modes present for multiplayer battles without respite and stop. Snow is clearly the master and the ~narrative background~ sees the pan-Asian coalition in full expansion phase on the EU and intent on taking possession of the precious energy resources present under the frozen blanket. So let's move on to analyze the two new vehicles present, one each exclusively for each faction. Europeans will be able to count on the IFV Goliath, a ~heavy~ means of transport capable of withstanding heavy infantry attacks to bring troops to the nerve center of the conflict. Certainly the Goliath cannot count on an impressive speed but it proves to be an important war tool for tactical variations to the attack strategy. Asians, on the other hand, will be able to count on the Hachimoto IFV, a sort of two-seater hovercraft. A very fast vehicle but also very light and not very resistant to attacks, the Hachimoto is already very popular among the ~pairs~ of players in BF2142 for very rapid blitzes into enemy land in undefended areas or to assault soldiers left without cover. Europeans will be able to count on the IFV Goliath, a ~heavy~ means of transport capable of withstanding heavy infantry attacks to bring troops to the nerve center of the conflict Assault Lines Finally, Northern Strike presents a new mode called Assault Lines which tends to be configured as a variant of the typical Conquest. In practice, before assaulting the enemy's base camp, we must have previously conquered all the control points and then launch the lethal attack. It is easy to understand how this mode requires a particular balance between the defense of the conquered control points and the attack on the enemy headquarters. Strategy and tactics will therefore have to be taken into greater consideration in addition to the obligatory war skills of the ~video soldiers~ in conflict. Obviously Northern Strike has no structural changes compared to BF2142 with the use of the same graphics engine and the same sound and vocal effects. On the other hand, a long series of new unlockable ~gadgets~ (new types of grenades, new mines, new firearms, new upgrades, various camouflages) for all the units present in the game and which will certainly delight war enthusiasts online according to DICE. worth mentioning is a long series of new ~gadgets~ that can be unlocked for all the units in the game System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 1.7 GHz or equivalent Athlon RAM: 512 MB Video Card: 128 MB 3D DirectX 9.0c compatible Disk Space: 200 MB (plus 2.2 GB for BF2142) Drive: DVD-ROM Interface network (for LAN or Internet games) DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card Test configuration: Processor: AMD Athlon64 3500 RAM: 2 GB Video Card: Geforce 68000 Ultra 256MB Conclusions Three maps, two vehicles, a Mode and many unlockable elements: these are the contents of Northern Strike, the first expansion of BF2142 which best performs its task of responding to feedback from the online community to which DICE programmers have always aimed a lot Attention. A revolution could not be expected and so it was, but the reduced sale price ( 9.99) makes the purchase convenient and almost necessary for all online war enthusiasts according to the duo Electronic Arts  DICE. And since we are heading towards the hot season, the snowy settings will be able to refresh us a bit... at least psychologically. Pros Absolutely adequate price BF2142 online community requests fulfilled The mix of new elements is definitely successful Cons New maps cannot be used in single player No revolutions or particular structural innovations Only for aficionados of DICE online warfare Continuing the tradition already started with the previous episodes of Battlefield, the duo Electronic Arts - DICE proposes the first ~booster pack~ for BF2142 (a title which, although it did not have a ~bang~, achieved good sales and criticism) purchasable at the honest price of  9.99 exclusively through the Digital Delivery service of EA Link (of which we were able to appreciate the excellent functionality and bandwidth). Even on this occasion, the programmers wanted to listen carefully to the community's feedback and offer the content most requested by online video soldiers.
