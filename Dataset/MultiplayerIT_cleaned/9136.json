A delicate job after all and certainly not easy, especially from the point of view of the control system which in the case of devices without physical buttons must be totally reinvented. In truth, perhaps due to the costs saved in the lack of research for particular scripts or licenses, the work done up to now can be considered all in all positive, without prejudice to the chronic absence of any original concept in the development of almost all the titles released so far. In Silent Ops, as per tradition, the reference title (or rather the series) can clearly be identified in Splinter Cell, given the nature of a third-person shooter with tactical and stealth elements; however, and it will be seen in the course of the review, there are other tributes to important games, with a final result that is decidedly unsettling at times. Error, copy failed! The plot that forms the background to the events narrated in Silent Ops reviews all the clichs made famous by espionage adventures: a secret society that acts for the good of humanity called Ubiquity, an agent who lost his family in a mysterious accident and coincidentally find links between that event and the same company, the agent who turns against and creates a terrorist group to unleash the apocalypse, the usual heroes who have to stop the plots of the villains. All already seen and heard therefore, then narrated with little conviction and with confusing plots (in the story there is also a dangerous virus to which the cure must be found, but also incredible genetic mutations); as mentioned, however, it is certainly not the plot that has helped make Gameloft the giant it is today. iPad in hand, controlling the various protagonists is rather intuitive, thanks to the valid choice of not placing an analog stick in a fixed point of the touchscreen but creating one each time in the exact position where you decide to put your left thumb; the camera is completely free, manageable with rapid slides of the right thumb, while the action keys are limited to running (which becomes cover next to a shelter), attack (fighting with bare hands with nearby enemies, shooting with fire when far away) and the sniper scope, which is more useful when impersonating the sniper. A fourth contextual key appears only in the presence of obstacles to jump or climb. Despite the freedom given in the management of the shots, the first problems encountered arise precisely when in particular, more agitated occasions one finds oneself having to quickly set the camera: in fact, the most logical view does not always correspond to the most comfortable one, and the numerous bugs present ( not least the tremendous polygonal interpenetrations that often make enemies disappear) make the situation even more chaotic. However, it is the general animations of the protagonists and enemies that leave us truly disappointed: not so much in normal walking and running, as in the jumps and climbs carried out with legs apart, absolutely ridiculous to look at. It is then quite impressive, on the threshold of 2012 and with now impressive computing powers available to everyone, to see fixed facial textures during dialogues in the Metal Gear Solid style for PS1, albeit with greater definition. The three agents that you can play in the course of history have in fact the same types of attack and weapons (a pistol with a silencer and an automatic submachine gun), except for the sniper who, however, can use his rifle only when the plot; perhaps the most important visual difference concerns the female agent, code-named Foxtail, who advances with a provocative (and totally out of place) model-like swaying gait. The actual combat phase winks at both Batman: Arkham Asylum (in multiple melee clashes based on counter-offensives with the right timing) and Assassin's Creed, thanks to the possibility of knocking down enemies by diving from above or by throwing them from the parapets; in reality, however, the lack of bite and the poor characterization of the characters fail to convey the same sensations as the original titles. There are also references to Gears of War (the race and the covers for example), to Uncharted (some too many climbing for castles and some action leversnare) and finally even the inevitable Quick Time Events, here in the slide version. Technically speaking, in addition to the bad animations previously mentioned, Silent Ops stands out for dull and flat textures and almost non-existent effects (starting with the motorboats that do not produce foam on the water); however, the granite framerate, the management of the lights and the good general color rendering are saved. The title also pays homage to two splendid Italian locations, such as Capri and Lake Como (beautiful even before the advent of George Clooney), while Game Center support is strangely absent; the multiplayer is in fact managed directly by Gameloft and, with only the Team and Assault modes, it is confirmed as of a mediocre level as is the rest of the production.
