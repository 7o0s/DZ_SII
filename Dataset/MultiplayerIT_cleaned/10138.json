It happened in the past for Alien Hominid, which from a very successful Flash game was brought to consoles, and it happens today for My Brute, an all-French product that garnered much acclaim especially last year and which currently has more than one million and half of players around the world. It is basically a role-playing game in which we have to create a character (whose features and characteristics can be randomly generated, based on the characters that make up the name, or determined through a series of choices) that every day can face some fights to obtain an increase in experience and therefore an improvement in one's skills based on the concept of ~leveling~ typical of role-playing games. The clashes take place against the ~brutes~ created by other players all over the world, in a sort of online multiplayer which however does not take place in real time, and are bound by a maximum daily number which prevents us from making our warrior very strong in a short time. From the web to the App Store The conversion of My Brute for iPhone and iPod Touch was carried out by the French team Bulkypix, who set themselves the goal of bringing the exact same experience available on the web to Apple devices, adding some elements to justify a sale price that is not exactly popular (2.99 euros), especially when compared to the free availability of the original. On balance, what you pay for is the possibility of bringing your brute with you, sending him to fight when you want and taking advantage of a limitation of the clashes that is always present but decidedly softer than the Flash version of the game: in that case you could face a maximum of three fights per day, while on the iPhone it went to five. For the rest, the structure is identical: our character is created randomly and equally randomly ~grows~ based on the results of the fights, gaining more experience in case of victory but getting the level-up in any case. As the brute gains experience, his arsenal can be enriched with different weapons, equipment and bonuses. However, the action remains completely automatic and therefore it is not up to us to decide how the fight will take place or which objects will be used. Seen from this angle, My Brute certainly presents itself as a highly limited and not very engaging experience: you can choose which opponent to face among those available at the moment, but then you stay and watch what happens on the screen until the end of the game. match. Finally, once the five daily fights have been completed, the brute is put to rest and it is not possible to use it until after twenty-four hours. A limit designed for the free web version of the game which, however, does not go well with a paid conversion and is only partially buffered by the possibility of creating a total of eight characters at the same time. The social implications of the Bulkypix product are revealed in the possibility of having ~disciples~ once a certain level of skill is reached, with the continuation that translates into a greater gain of experience points and in the acquisition of new arenas (there are eight total) and new items. The game also supports the Open Feint and Facebook social networks for chatting and comparing scores. Technically the conversion work appears perfect, but on the App Store we are now used to products of a certain quality and we end up turning up our noses in front of the always the same animations of the brutes, who face each other in generally mediocre scenarios. The tested version is 1.9 App Store links", "date": "2010-03-18", "grade": "5.2"}
