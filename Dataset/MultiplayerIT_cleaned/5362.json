Although the developers have added structure where there was none before and lots of little tweaks that improve the player's life, the game remains resilient and ready to cater to individual whims. A timid narrative thread (in English) regulates the progression from the most hospitable to the most dangerous stars, offering us the possibility of building more effective weapons and armor and hundreds of new objects, but between one step of evolution and another we are free to spend as much time as we like doing what we like best. In this game there is no event or mechanism that pushes the player in one direction or another. So a flash of imagination or a sudden curiosity is enough and we're off on a tangent, between an almost suicidal mission against a UFO led by warrior penguins and a more common search for minerals for a monkey-like character met by chance in an underground laboratory. The progression thresholds mark the progress times of the game and it is right that they are there, but we decide what our destiny in the universe will be. We can spend hours capturing all the docile little animals scattered across the galaxy and letting them run free in our spaceship, spend days building colonies above and below the surface of planets, or pick up a musical instrument and join other players in public games to put together a roving band of space bards. Even the idea of creating a greenhouse the size of a planet and cultivating all of God's good things is a viable and satisfying option. Never before has such a variety of possible decorations been reached in a 2D game, so much so that we can very well undertake dozens of space journeys in search of that single detail that would make all the difference in our personal captain's cabin, or in the of the throne of our castle! Hell, there's even a medieval-style siege mission in the main story. Apparently Chucklefish put almost everything that came into his mind into his game, but overall the result works very well. Game genres mix, from 90s 2D platformer/shooter to Metroid-style dungeons, complete with our hero transforming into the iconic indestructible sphere. For our part, we have decided, for this review, to create the feathered pirate Long John Silver with a very specific purpose: to found a Space Tortuga full of armed settlers and overflowing with well-concealed treasures in a deposit which is accessed through a trap door hidden in the our private accommodations. When a samurai cyborg we were hunting gave up and asked us to join our crew as a coffee maker, the first step was taken and the course plotted. Maybe one day we'll travel to space, but until then, there's Starbound! Space geology Whatever plan you have drawn up for your life in space, it necessarily goes two ways: gathering resources and killing monsters. In this section we deal with the first aspect of the game. Unless you have friends who serve you as slaves, you will have to sweat the proverbial shit with a handy material manipulator in hand capable of collecting everything around you and putting it in your comfortable backpack. The planets are the great protagonists of the game, with many different biomes, unpredictable weather conditions and new surprises that await us with each landing. We have drilled the bottom of an ocean and discovered a forgotten civilization full of sarcophagi buried in piles of bones. We go for a walk sawing trees with colorful crowns and we trip over an anchor that rises up to the sky; after having built over a hundred steps we discover that it leads to a pirate sailing ship (damn, what envy! And in fact we have stolen the beautiful treasure map hanging on the wall...). Deserts can hide laboratories infested with crazed cyborgs and it is said that among lava flows in the center of a tropical star we do not meet some scirocco with a mission to propose. And if we get bored of a planet or we can't find what we're looking for, we can instantly teleport to the spaceship, refuel on the nearest moon and change galaxies (perhaps without leaving behind precious silk-filled moth traps like we did ). The planets therefore provide the basic setting in which the action takes place. Here people gather, hunt and build. An intelligent system attracts races of settlers consistent with the type of furniture and materials we used to build ourkingdom, whether it's simple huts by the sea or medieval fortresses with dungeons full of monsters. However, there is also a second type of scenario that forms the backdrop for the main boss missions and evidence chambers hidden in the planets. In these cases the levels are predefined and impossible to change, so no collecting and building. This allows the developers to set up varied and well-structured fights against a significant amount of very different bosses, but as far as we are concerned the result is not satisfactory. As we said, Starbound works well when all its elements are present; if even in we remove one, the gaps become apparent. And that brings us right into the creatures that populate the galaxy with the aim of making it a more dangerous, but also more exciting, place. Extraterrestrial I blow you away Since everything is destructible and randomly generated, fighting is not the best of life, because it lacks scenario planning suitable for clashes. Getting stranded is easy, as is falling into a well embracing some angry beast (for the record, monsters are always stronger at night). If you play in normal mode, the monsters are fearsome and sometimes frustrating. Dying underground and leaving all the collected material there forces a new journey to recover it and it is not said that it will be possible to bring it back to the surface, in a cycle of despair that often ends with the abandonment of the loot. Naturally this increases the tension with each new excavation. Do we launch ourselves into the void towards that alluring construction or do we suddenly return to the ship? Big risks but also big rewards govern this style of play. Acid rain, lava pits, and poisonous rivers add to the amount of unpredictable obstacles. Sometimes they even start raining meteorites from the sky, to the delight of our colonists. As for monsters, each one has its own combat scheme, just as each weapon has different types of attacks and possible elementary effects. This means that we have to constantly adapt to the environment, which keeps boredom away from what is the least strong aspect of the game. While variety works in its favor, Starbound doesn't excel in combat. The scenarios as we have said do not lend themselves well due to their randomness and the game system is too basic to offer any incentive other than the possibility of collecting precious resources from killed enemies. But as with the other elements of the game, if added to all the rest it suddenly seems less poor to us and we can appreciate it without effort. You have to watch the game from afar to focus and admire its hidden complexity. As a whole, Starbound is the work of a great architect, and we believe that within it, almost everyone can find a place to thrive.", "date": "2016-08-07", "grade": "8.4"}
