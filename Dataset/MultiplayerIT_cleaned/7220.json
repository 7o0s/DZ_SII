{"name": "Goat Simulator", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/130175-goat-simulator-capra-capra-capra.html", "text": "Let's immediately put the dots on the bleats (which have no dots): Goat Simulator is not an Italian student simulator (just kidding eh... enough with these compulsive #selfies. Come on, chase away the sadness by going back to sending photos of your genitals to your friends ). Every bug a laugh (not for nothing they use them for promotional materials) He's not even a simulator of Vittorio Sgarbi, to be honest, despite the well-known Italian art critic continually quoting them to lovingly appeal to his interlocutors. Goat Simulator, on the other hand, is a sumptuous work, capable of restoring prestige to a noble animal that is too often underestimated and negatively connoted by the vulgar! As Dante wrote while visiting a remote hill, where the drizzling fog rises: ~In a goat with a Semitic face / he felt every other evil complaining, / every other life.~ Then you say that Multiplayer.it doesn't make culture. Anyway, let's get back to us and get some bureaucracy out of the way. The new title from Coffee Stain Studios, to whom we owe the two Sanctums, is a goat simulator in the broadest sense. Yes, it is true that they play the role of a goat and yes, some graphic elements are copied from the more serious simulators that we also talk about on these colorful pages from time to time, but any simulation claims stop here. Indeed, it is not difficult to find some comic ambitions in the similarities. The aim of the player is in fact to go around a charming suburban neighborhood and literally smash everything. The goat can run, gore objects and people, lick objects to grab them and drag them along, jump and make various evolutions while in the air. At the beginning it is not clear what to do, since there is no plot and there are no missions to carry out. Of course, there are objectives that earn points, but nothing more. In short, why does our sweet little goat have to scramble in this world full of dangers? Anarchy only way Goat Simulator is difficult to describe, not so much because it has some complicated gameplay elements or because it requires some mental effort to understand. Indeed, perhaps the exact opposite is true: it is a title conceptually so simple that one is amazed when one realizes that one has spent several hours on it, moreover without regretting a single moment of time spent together with the wild goat. ~Mom, there's a goat flying~ If we dare, we would define it as the perfect representation of pure fun, a concentration of videogame anarchy that knows no comparison. Going around the map we are faced with various skits, all to be sent to catafassa. How about goring the attendees of a garden party? Or to blow away a chick who is relaxing on the porch? Each destructive action is underlined by some writing, linked to a score multiplier, which appears with great emphasis on the screen. Do you blow up a gas pump? Here we are called ~Michael Bay~. Shall we head a ball and score a goal in a goal located in a small courtyard? Then we become ~Baggio~. The amount of funny situations to discover is really high and we are often surprised by their madness. It almost seems to be in front of a collection of easter eggs. For example, we may be asked to make sacrifices of living beings to transform the goat into a demonic being with incredible destructive power, or we can find a jetpack to fly through the skies of the map (useful for completing some objectives). But again: it's possible to headbutt Stonehenge, or be abducted by aliens and end up suspended in space. In another case we will have to be crowned king of the goats, obtaining the power to make our subjects fall from the sky. There is no shortage of quotes from recent ~chronicle~ events in the video game industry, if we want to define them that way. For example, one of the buildings is the reconstruction of the Coffee Stain Studios offices (who knows if they are really like that). By entering it, in addition to butting furniture and developers, it will also be possible to try their 'new title', really playable with a lot of online leaderboard: Flappy Goat (we don't have to specify what the verse is for, right?). Goat Simulator: or when being a goat is a compliment, as well as hilarious In bug veritas We read the description of Goat Simulator on the official website: ~Goat Simulator is a small, buggy and stupid game. It was done in a couple of weeks, so don't expect a game the size and scope of a GTA with goats. In fact You better expect nothing. To be honest, you'd better spend your $10 on a hula hoop, a bunch of bricks, or a real goat.~ Whenor a furious goat meets the man, the man is dead. Come to think of it Goat Simulator is a small, broken and stupid game, but it's so small that it's sublime in everything it does. Even in bugs. Here, perhaps for the first time we are faced with a video game in which bugs are fun to the point of not being annoying. Indeed, we end up considering them part of the game. Also because they are. In such an absurd context, throwing the goat into the sky and seeing it fall off the map, and then finding yourself exploring what should simply be the scenario, is a discovery, rather than a problem. Seeing the goat hanging by the neck from some wall, with its head on the other side, or finding it piercing a ceiling after a disastrous fall, become funny situations rather than the rotten fruit of bad construction. Going into one of the houses in the neighborhood and starting to smash everything headbutts creates an indescribable chaos, over which you have no control, but it is a beautiful chaos in its childishness. Do you remember when you flooded anthills as a child just to see all the ants flee in panic (now you understand so many things...)? Here, the taste that Goat Simulator gives is more or less the same. Let's define it as a carefree destruction in which he immerses himself with an innocence and transport that makes everything else superfluous. A real deconstruction of the very concept of a video game, whose original purity reverberates throughout the gaming experience. But let's add: necks that stretch in a senseless way, polygonal interpenetrations everywhere, completely busted physics; everything contributes to creating a world outside of any canon, which however lets itself be lived and relived beyond all expectations. Indeed, thanks to the possibility of activating the slow motion effect when needed, it is possible to create spectacular skits, to be enjoyed alone or in the company of friends.
