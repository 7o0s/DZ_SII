Time for sun, sea, this year also for masks; finally, as the review of Ninjala for Nintendo Switch reminds us, also of Ninja and chewing gum. You will have more or less an idea of what we are talking about, if you have followed the evolution of the latest GungHo Online Entertainment title in recent months. Ninjala was originally supposed to debut exclusively on the Nintendo hybrid console last spring; then the first online test went as it went, and the game was postponed to the end of June 2020. We have mentioned our first impressions in the Ninjala test, now it's the turn of the actual review. Your summer on Nintendo Switch will spend in the pleasant company of this Battle Royale, which you can take on vacation and play wherever you want without spending a cent. What is Ninjala: the structure Let's start from the basics, for the sake of completeness: what is Ninjala? GungHo Online Entertainment's title is yet another free-to-play Battle Royale trying to carve out its own niche in a market increasingly crowded by now well-known titles, such as Fortnite, Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, and ( albeit paid and only on Nintendo Switch) Splatoon 2. The good thing is that the game is completely free: you can download it and start playing, perhaps without ever spending a single cent. The bad thing is the usual progression and structure provided for in titles of this type: beyond the entire amount of free content, others (especially cosmetics) are instead blocked. To unlock them you have to put your wallet in hand, at least once (preferably, for developers, more than once). And Ninjala will remind you to the bitter end, that for a small expense you could have all those beautiful things to wear. Ninjala's structure is quite simple, and immediately understandable thanks to a lean and intuitive main menu. The main HUB is nothing more than the bedroom / base / hideout of the protagonist ninja (you can create it based on the models made available by the developers). From the main screen you can immediately enter the game, playing the Battle Royale. And here we could open a whole parenthesis on the game philosophy, which actually has only the name of Battle Royale. Ninjala is the furthest you can imagine from any Fortnite or Call of Duty: Warzone; if anything, it looks a bit like Overwatch. In fact, the games are based on the deatmatch: the players eliminate each other and earn points linked to certain actions. But once eliminated, you return to the game immediately: the respawn takes just three seconds and is infinite. Finally, each game lasts no more than five minutes. Paid content and the Battle Pass Apart from taking the field immediately and giving you a good fight with everything and everyone, on Ninjala you can do little else for free: customize your character with what you have or what you can afford, spending those four free Jala that you will be able to get; train in the dojo, and you would also do well since the combat system is only apparently superficial and confusing. But the truth is that Ninjala also has an offline story mode, divided into chapters: only that they must be purchased. The first is already available at a discount at a price of 4.99 euros (normally it costs double) and should last a few hours. In the future it is practically certain that new chapters will arrive, all for a fee. Here you might start to turn up your nose, but you have to breathe deeply and remember that the game is basically designed for online multiplayer: and that it's free. GungHo Online Entertainment has studied the structure of Fortnite Battaglia Reale and the success of Epic Games so carefully (it is normal, nor was it the only one) that even the Battle Pass is practically identical to that of the reference Battle Royale. And even Ninjala is naturally divided into seasons (heck, the first will end on the same day as Season 3 of Fortnite Chapter 2, August 27, 2020!), During which players will be able to level up and unlock one after the other all a set of rewards. Try to imagine the rewards. That's right: ballets, Jala coins to spend on the purchase of the next Battle Pass, emotes, cosmetic items of various types. A pass costs 950 Jala, i.e. 9.50 euros; not too expensive, considering that once you buy the first one you will accumulate enough coins for the following ones too. Game mode Ninjala currently features only two game modes: Battle Royale and Team Challenge; the first is the same that was proposed during the public online beta. Eight players are catapulted into the arena, and begin to beat each other up; after qA few minutes the fight ends, and whoever has accumulated the most KOs wins. Various bonuses are also awarded: collection of coins and power-ups, Ippon performed in a row, and so on; it is therefore not uncommon to see matches in which the three strongest players have obtained more or less the same score, then overturned at the last second by the attribution of the final bonuses. The formula works, net of an automatic camera which occasionally starts to cause some problems, especially in the most agitated phases; you might consider activating the manual or gyroscope-based one, which is supported. The second game mode is team mode: four players against four start fighting each other and... and the game philosophy remains basically the same. It is nothing but a Battle Royale game organized in two groups of four contenders; obviously the final score depends on the individual team eliminations. The matchmaking doesn't seem to match skilled players with other skilled players for the moment, so you could easily end up matched with perfect do-nothings, with promises of Ninjala. It should also be said that it is too early to evaluate GungHo Online Entertainment's matchmaking in detail. Strengths and weaknesses Ninjala is certainly a production that can already boast a number of not indifferent strengths. Beyond the charisma itself of characters and environments, which only closely recall the style of Splatoon to then take it in a completely different direction, the title turns out to be fresh and fun, perfect for being launched in the summer. The depth and heterogeneity of the fighting style and the weapons available are certainly two essential aspects, which in themselves would need a separate discussion. Every single Ninjala player can experience a wide range of main weapons, active special abilities and passive abilities; combined on the battlefield, they will create ever-changing situations. It is a level of depth very similar to the one that struck everyone in Splatoon at the time, and which needs hours and hours to be analyzed properly; every single object lends itself well to being used against a specific opponent, with a certain weapon, and not against others. Learning to predict enemy attitudes and equipment can also make a difference on the battlefield. But there are equally obvious defects, first of all the extreme shortage of game modes and arenas: Ninjala can only be played in the Battle Royale mode and in team fights, in the face of a handful of game scenarios, not even particularly vast. Well-kept yes, explorable vertically and horizontally too, but small: small and not even exceptional, from the point of view of graphic detail (in reality, the entire production seems to be a bit angular and rough). If you add the level of confusion that after a few seconds begins to dominate every situation, it is easy to understand why Ninjala would need (now and in the long term) a little more attention and certain filings. There is plenty of time, so we are optimistic.", "date": "2020-06-28", "grade": "7.5"}
