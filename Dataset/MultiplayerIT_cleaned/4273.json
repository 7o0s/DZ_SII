Meanwhile George Kamitani and associates have already landed on PlayStation 4 with an extraordinary revised and corrected version of Odin Sphere. At that juncture, also due to a title aged so very well but which needed some tweaking to turn into the pearl that we had the pleasure of re-playing, the changes in terms of balance and the addition of a stamina bar had brought the title of the Osaka boys to an almost unimaginable degree. After a couple of years and very little information on the next game, it's time to head back to the Hydelands in search of the Dragon's Crown. This time, starting from an almost perfect title, the Pro version of the Vanillaware game is nothing more than a raw port, with improved textures and a fluidity that borders on the miracle. In Search of the Lost Crown When Dragon's Crown arrived on the market, in the now prehistoric 2013, what shocked the most was the ability to reinvent a genre that now seemed to have left the years of glory behind. Kamitani's love of scrolling beat 'em ups, along the lines of Golden Ax, has never been a secret, and while his titles have always been able to breathe fresh air into the 2D genre, they all approached a very more linear and based on the narration of the stories of its protagonists. Dragon's Crown, on the contrary, puts this aspect into the background, relegating everything related to the title's plot to splendid hand-drawn still screens, which act as a gimmick for encounters with the (few) secondary characters. Instead, what accompanies the player is a voice-over that behaves like the classic Game Master of a typical D&D session. Whichever protagonist you choose, among the six classes available, your task will always be to put yourself on the trail of the Dragon's Crown that gives the game its title. Through a myriad of dungeons full of enemies, traps and just as many bosses, the pleasure of advancing and enhancing one's alter ego is the icing on the cake of an experience which, despite five years on its shoulders, remains the highest point ever reached from this genus. With a campaign that is not extremely long, but which bases its longevity on the factor of replayability and increased difficulty, Dragon's Crown is a title capable of stealing an extraordinary amount of hours from you, supported by a multiplayer sector and cross play with PlayStation 3 and Vita to close a circle so perfect as to envy Giotto. I want more If your intention is to buy a title that can give you hours of easy and painless entertainment, you probably have never touched a Vanillaware game. Dragon's Crown, even more than the others, represents the apotheosis of the concept of grinding, also thanks to an exceptional looting system and resource management capable of taking you away several hours just in choosing your best build. The entire Dragon's Crown system is based on the substantial differences between the various classes. Never as in this case, choosing a warrior or a sorceress will substantially change your approach to the game and also the strategies to be used in battle. For this reason, retracing the paths already trodden and repeating the dozen dungeons (which double with the alternative paths) present within the game ad nauseam is never exhausting. To make the experiences even more different, Vanillaware has decided to adopt a system of skills and unique accessories for the different classes. Therefore, if the warrior uses a sword and shield and requires brutal hand-to-hand combat, the elf will instead have the strength of distance on her side, thanks to the use of the bow. Different speech regarding the magic-based classes, which require the use of mana and the recharging of the same by holding down the square key. It is easy to understand how, in the light of these strong differences, it will be unthinkable to jump into the fray with the magician, or try to keep a distance when using the amazon. To enrich the customization even more, there are a series of traits (divided between the common ones and those specific to each class) that can be acquired after spending skill points. These range from the classic increase in life points, up to the possibility of raising shields that cover allies, without forgetting particular attacks and combos, which increase the possibilities of each character in battle. We close a roundup of features of a title already more than gutted in recent years with a deThe cut that new players must absolutely not forget: the online component. Already in its original version, Dragon's Crown adopted an immediate and fun cooperative system. By simply entering the areas used for choosing the adventure to undertake, it is possible to decide whether to join a casual game or organize an excursion with your friends. A very stable netcode and a more than encouraging speed allow you to find yourself in the game with people from all over the world, expanding the catchment area thanks to the aforementioned cross play. A not insignificant detail if we consider that the whole game is based on the frenzied repetition of the same dungeons in search of new weapons and pieces of armor capable of increasing one's characteristics or infusing particular benefits and resistances to one's character. Just the possibility of playing with friends is particularly recommended when the first phase of the adventure ends and the game raises its difficulty by putting you in front of exponentially stronger enemies and devastating bosses, also giving you the opportunity to dramatically raise the level of the your alter ego. This general picture highlights a title full of content and almost totally free from defects, despite a feedback of the blows unfortunately close to non-existent and a quantity of elements on the screen that often risks confusing the player, no longer sure of where he is and what it is actually attacking. Nothing incomprehensible, but it certainly requires quick reflexes and a certain attention, an element in any case improved through an excellent visual rendering and extraordinary fluidity.", "date": "2018-05-08", "grade": "9.0"}
