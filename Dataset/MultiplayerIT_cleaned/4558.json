We therefore welcome this Super Lucky's Tale with interest, a real evolved and enhanced sequel to the first platform released some time ago, which has obviously lost the virtual setting but gained something more in terms of content and game structure. With the changes applied, Lucky's new adventure has reached the form of a complete video game, and although it is still distributed as a budget title, Microsoft has focused enough on it to include it in the Xbox One X launch line-up, the console on which it sports the famous native 4K at 60 frames per second. Not that it's really a title suitable for demonstrating the potential of the new machine, given that the graphics sector is not particularly advanced, but it still represents an interesting addition in a genre that has always been dramatically discovered in recent years, at least as regards non-Nintendo platforms. On this front we can open the biggest discussion on the problems of Super Lucky's Tale: it would have the potential to carve out a good space for itself as a gaming mascot, given the scarcity of competitors and the excellent work done by Playful Corp. in characterizing the protagonist and the world surrounding, but the test of the controller results in a highly imperfect platform. Which is a bit like saying that the developers have succeeded well in everything that is not strictly necessary for the gameplay, inserting just a couple of errors in the most important areas of the game. However, all this concerns more a regret for the wasted potential than an overall judgment on the product, which in any case maintains a certain balance between annoying defects and positive aspects. 2 and a half, almost 3D The classic canon of platformers can already be found in the narrative premise, as simple as it is effective in starting the adventure: Lucky suddenly finds himself sucked into a magical vortex inside the mysterious ~Tome of the Ages~, a magical book found by adventurer sister Lyra, with the need to solve various problems. There is a ~dysfunctional family of cuddly criminals~ (quoting directly from the game) who have decided to use the book to wreak havoc among the worlds it contains, and with Lyra left outside the vortex, it's up to Lucky to clean up the mess. , teaching each of the delinquent felines a lesson. The hybrid structure of Super Lucky's Tale alternates ~pure 2.5D~ levels (that is, with movements squashed on a two-dimensional plane but 3D graphics) with more properly three-dimensional sections, thus managing to introduce variety into the action but at the same time getting lost a bit between the two approaches without finding a fully clear synthesis. Therefore, above all the parts that act as hubs to enter the various levels are in 3D, presenting four different worlds, each made up of different stages between the main and secondary ones. The aim of the game is essentially to collect a certain amount of four-leaf clovers that allow access to the following worlds, which can be conquered by simply reaching the conclusion of the levels or by implementing a series of secondary actions that characterize each of these (collect all the letters of the writing ~Lucky ~, discover hidden shamrocks, solve puzzles). The level design is somewhat discontinuous and alternates decidedly flat moments with some excellent ideas - which emerge in the most disparate situations or often in boss fights - which in general demonstrate a certain vivacity in the construction of the levels and a remarkable variety in which it is possible to run into over the course of the game, at least by the standards of a two-and-a-half or ~nearly three~ platformer. Bread and fox There are some good moments in the platform phases, especially when the secrets intervene that open secondary roads and justify a certain replayability rate on the various levels, which often have to be visited several times to be completed to the maximum and find all the four-leaf clovers. The problem is that there are no big reasons to increase the number of these, given that for normal progression those that are encountered simply advancing towards the conclusion of the internships or a little more are sufficient, therefore the push for complete research must be dictated simply from the desire to collect everything possible. The alternation of levels and requests to complete sometimes determines a good variety of situations, che also include riddles and puzzles of various types that help maintain a good level of interest and encourage you to move forward and explore new worlds in search of further game solutions. It is perhaps in the fully 3D phases that Super Lucky's Tale most demonstrates its potential, with an articulated construction of the scenarios which is associated with a good range of movements for the protagonist, who is able to walk, run on all fours, hit by waving queue, jump and dig underground tunnels in a rather fluid mix of possible actions. However, these good foundations are strongly undermined in particular by two defects that can be fatal in a platform, especially because they tend to add up to a frustrating mix: an unsuitable shot and some uncertainty in the control system. If the question obviously does not arise in the 2.5D phases, when the game opens up to pure three-dimensionality the fact that the camera is not fully controllable at 360 degrees is strange and highly limiting. Above all because the controls often require great precision in calculating the movements and we sometimes find ourselves not understanding exactly the distances and the perspectives in which we are operating. On this front, the addition of some corrective movements capable of making the margin of error more tameable, such as the possibility of clinging to ledges or greater control over the trajectories of jumps, would have helped a lot. Xbox One goals 23 unlockable achievements for the usual total of 1000 points to add to the Gamerscore are the loot hidden inside Super Lucky's Tale. Many of these achievements are achieved simply by progressing through the game, some of these even quite rich, so it promises to be an excellent collection for point hunters even without having to dig too deeply. Bucolic eclecticism The characterization chosen for the game is very pleasant and closely resembles the classic 3D platformers of the Nintendo 64 era and its surroundings, inserting itself into the nostalgic trend that is taking hold in this period after a long fasting of titles of this genre. After Yooka-Laylee and A Hat in Time, Super Lucky's Tale also stages its own facetious and colorful world, in this case quite fairytale even if not without a certain humorous and ironic spirit. The four main settings range from a bucolic countryside with western influences to a Christmas-themed desert, just to give examples of the bizarre contaminations chosen to play on the clichs of the genre, all with further variations visible in the underground levels or in the single levels accessible from the worlds- hubs. In the face of a not too demanding graphics system, it would have been ideal to have 60 frames per second even on the standard Xbox One, however such performances are reserved exclusively for Xbox One X, on which the game also sports a native 4K to great effect. On a normal Xbox One S, Super Lucky's Tale keeps the charm of its cartoonish characterization unchanged even at 1080p but the fluidity settles at 30 fps. However, these are decidedly stable performances, but given the not excessive complexity, an extra effort in terms of frame-rate in a game of this genre would be desirable. Even the audio reflects the aesthetic register chosen by the developers, with catchy and cheerful music and sound effects that recall the classics of the genre, complete with sampled voices and words to accompany the game phases. Note, on this front, the dubbing completely in Italian.", "date": "2017-11-13", "grade": "7.0"}
