Sometimes the video game industry gives birth to titles like this undisturbed. Loco Mania doesn't have any kind of pretension, it doesn't want to impose itself on the market as a revolutionary title, but only to bring a breath of joyful and light happiness into the homes of gamers linked to simple pleasures and ancient clichs. In essence it is a game based on a couple of extremely simple rules, however capable of engaging the player even for hours. The mechanism is always the same. Each level opens onto a three-dimensional map in which the layout of the tracks that constitutes the portion of the railway network concerned is accurately represented. Scattered along the map we find access points where the various arriving trains will appear. By pressing the ~tab~ key it is possible to call up the summary map of the route, in which access points, stations, moving trains and railway points are highlighted. Every point on the map is clickable; once the mouse button has been pressed, the camera will move to the indicated point. The aim of the game is to get all the trains to their destination in the shortest time possible. An extremely concise but at the same time functional interface reminds us at the same time how many trains are missing before reaching the end of the level and what our playing time is for the current level. The real challenge will then consist in exposing ourselves on the online ranking and achieving the absolute best time for each single level, establishing ourselves as the best station master in the world. Simplicity and challenge The simplicity of the game mechanics is such as to be almost alarming and on more than one occasion we realize that we are dealing with the revised version of a flash-developed puzzle equipped with a three-dimensional graphics engine. The trains leave the special start points scattered on the map, carrying an icon on the car which indicates their destination. The rule is basic. Green train goes in the green direction, if there is a red station symbol the green train must pass and stop at the red station. As the objectives determined for the train are completed, the icon disappears. The only degrees of interaction with the environment include the activation of traffic lights that allow or not the transit of trains, the activation of the switch on the tracks and the possibility of changing the direction of the train (by setting the reverse gear). it is easy to find yourself in the situation of having to enter mental synchrony with the movement of three or more trains moving towards the same intersection and having to manage traffic lights and inversions in the most appropriate way Simplicity and challenge Every single interaction can be activated by simply clicking on the object concerned. The only thing to remember is that the reversal of the train involves a malus which obliges you to have to manage another train before the end of the level. The entry of the trains into the map occurs randomly, preventing you from learning the entry pattern by heart; the ability to know or not to complete a level is linked to the player's management skills, not so much to his ability to memorize the train sequence. During the first few minutes of the game, you realize that the challenge is more complex than you might think, since when there are so many trains in the game, you find yourself in the situation of having to manage non-trivial situations. There are two types of trains, the standard ones and the super-fast ones. In itself this fact represents one of the biggest quibbles to take into consideration in the more or less complex railway tangle on which we are called to control the traffic of a series of trains with different destinations and different journey times using the same tracks and passing over same exchanges with speeds so high as to transform frenzy into the leitmotif of the whole title. It is easy to find yourself in the situation of having to enter into mental synchrony with the movement of three or more trains moving towards the same intersection and having to manage traffic lights and inversions in the most appropriate way, calculating that sometimes the loss of some points gained can be the is the only way out to complete the level. Here lies all the complex simplicity of a game that doesn't have much variety to offer, but which on a very simple scaffolding of rules can still offer a continuous and eternally renewable challenge. Conclusions Basically what does Loco Mania have to offer? A game system as simple as the subject you try to reproduce, the game of the electric train. Making sure that every train arrives at its destination passing through its checkpoints may seem trivial but it is not at all. To complete one of the 12 levels available it takes cunning, a lot of attention and quick reflexes. Basically a game suitable for everyone, but not for everyone. Pros Fun and frenetic Online ranking system Essential but functional interface Cons It can be monotonous Upon installation it is necessary to immediately resort to the patch, traceable on the manufacturer's website Abandoned toys Does the ancient taste of playing with toys left in the dust of dimly lit attics still exist? Does the passion for simple things exist in the imagination of today's children? Maybe yes or maybe not. Maybe wooden toys are just a reminder of generations gone by, but this rule doesn't apply to great and eternal passions, to that type of game that secretly enlivens the nights of unsuspecting enthusiasts. The train, the little train, what we all wanted to have in the bedroom. A large, gigantic model that reproduced valleys and mountains, in which the tracks could run free in an imaginative sequence of eight, of crossroads, of complicated exchanges and of sidings, of remittances. Raise your hand if you have the courage to deny playful fantasies of this type, to exclude the train game from the imagination of your childhood. What if they told you that someone thought of remedying this thirst for railway raids? And if they told you that the electric train has landed on the PC.", "date": "2006-11-16", "grade": null}
