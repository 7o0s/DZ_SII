There are simply too many variations involved, too many elements to evaluate. They are worlds made up of people, as well as dragons, monsters and other goodies. They are mostly interaction games and one wrong interaction can have catastrophic consequences. Guild Wars 2, in particular, is an even more difficult title to judge, especially given the mystical messianic aura that has surrounded it for years: destined to destroy the competition, to give new meaning to the MMORPG genre, to represent a gospel all new for the games to come. A real messiah, who we have followed for more than a month. We've explored Tyria far and wide, faced different challenges and content, reached max level and conquered fortresses, fought dragons alongside famous heroes and complete strangers, yet we always feel like we've only scratched the surface. The question at this point is only one: is Guild Wars 2 really as perfect as it seems? Eccentric The answer is naturally no, but the discussion is a bit longer and more complex, so be patient. We've talked a lot about how the weapon and profession-dependent skill system works, but how do these dynamics actually play out? TERA had already accustomed us to the idea of a fully action combat system, abandoning the traditional concept of ~rolling the dice~ usually linked to the impact of shots with the target. Guild Wars 2 takes this type of gameplay even further, abandoning the idea of crosshairs in favor of a traditional targeting system, while maintaining the emphasis on the importance of positioning, dodging and mobility. The synergy between weapons, weapon skills, traits, and secondary skills is at the heart of Guild Wars 2's combat system. At first, it seems almost too simple: the five weapon skills appear too few, plus many of them are not used to inflict real damage but to move the character, control the enemy, inflict anomalous states. Within a few levels, the situation changes radically: you learn to change weapon set-ups on the fly or unlock new secondary skills, you discover how to combine everything by taking advantage of temporary boosts and depowers, dodging and counterattacking. Controlling the enemy is essential, just as it is necessary to learn the animations of the creatures to dodge their abilities or equip the right skill to remove an anomalous state, heal or cancel other nefarious effects. Once you reach the maximum level, the possibilities offered by the combination of skills, weapons and traits (secondary bonus effects that can be selected if necessary) allow for an unprecedented ability to customize your character. This depth is reflected both in PvP, in which the unpredictability of human opponents plays a fundamental role in the construction of one's ~build~, and in PvE, where Guild Wars 2 effectively seems to leave behind the sacred triad of roles in favor of a world of possibilities where everyone can do everything: just change a few traits, equip a different weapon and maybe change a skill or two to switch from one role to another. However conceptually fantastic, however, this choice is not without gray areas, and we'll talk about it again shortly. Fantastic The leveling phase was definitely one of the most fun and engaging we've ever played. The world of Tyria is absolutely stunning, and Guild Wars 2 is yet another example of how a technical sector can transcend the brute force of graphics. Let's not even bother the soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule, perhaps not one of the most brilliant of his career but always punctual and evocative; the attention to detail, the refinement of the details, the perfect choice of colors and the geographical complexity of the world created by ArenaNet overshadow the flatness of some textures and the perennial fogging effect that limits the field of vision. The cities are full of details, goodies and gimmicks that are useless, if not to make an environment teeming with life, players and NPCs even more convincing. The obsessive care placed in the design of the various vast regions is what catches the eye from the very first minutes: each area is very rich in ravines, secret passages and complex underwater areas that exist for a precise reason, where a mission or a enemy will ambush us, perhaps within one of the ingenious jumping puzzles orchestrated by the developers. The player is rewarded for exploring, an activity indeed deeply encouraged by progressnon-linear one of the leveling phase. The first few hours can be traumatic: it is difficult to shake off years of tradition and chain-connected quest-hubs, but once you get used to the mechanics of dynamic events, you realize that the ~hearts~, i.e. the fixed and not repeatable, they are placed in strategic positions to guide us from one point to another on the map, making us come across the infamous dynamic events. These events have betrayed expectations a bit, turning out to be nothing more than scripted cyclical missions, with a marginal influence on the game world. They are pleasant, often connected to each other even at a distance of miles, but not so distant from the typical archetypes of the genre: kill a few enemies, collect a few items, take out the mega boss of the moment; the only difference is that, often, you can choose how to proceed. The players in the area all contribute to the unfolding of the mission, a bit as if they were in a group without really being one: this feature, in some ways ingenious as it puts an end to griefing, competitions or misunderstandings, also has the unpleasant side of killing socialization and communication between players. Without the need to form a group, be invited or agree to face bosses that do not require particular strategies, the impression, for many hours, was that of playing a single-player product. Variegated The situation is destined to change radically once the ~final~ areas are reached, where the ~heart~ quests disappear to give way to long cycles of dynamic events that require the collaboration, often on several fronts, of the various players. In this case communication becomes mandatory to coordinate invasions and attack plans, which is why the outcome of the missions, and basically our own entertainment, depend on the players involved. Find willing and cooperative users, and get ready for some of the most exciting battles in the game. Catch the day of curmudgeons, and you can also change the area and dedicate yourself to something else. These controversial choices severely limit Guild Wars 2's potential in many ways. Another example is the so-called ~personal story~, a cycle of quests that accompanies us from the beginning of the game, telling us the story of our character and the war with the ancient dragon Zhaitan. Most of the quests are determined by the initial choices made when creating the character and by a series of decisions to be made at crucial moments in the story: on paper it is an ingenious system that increases the longevity of the title, especially if you want to replay it same race or share your story with friends. On the other hand, the story told is not all that compelling, also thanks to a generally mediocre dubbing and a hubbub of in-depth supporting actors. On the other hand, the story of the heroes of the Destiny's Edge guild is clearly better, which takes place, parallel to ours, in the various dungeons of the game: also in this case ArenaNet had some peculiar but not completely finished ideas. Each dungeon offers two game modes: the first, called ~story~, presents a series of bosses and tells the adventures of the various heroes Logan, Rytlock, Eir, etc.; the second, called ~exploration~, is a real sequel, with a different storyline and at least three separate paths, characterized by different bosses and narrative developments. It's easy to see the similarities to the Flashpoints of Star Wars: The Old Republic, and in some ways we are faced with a greater variety of situations. The problem with dungeons, however, is another. Controversial Dungeons are one of the most important content in the game, yet also one of the least played. Reached the maximum level, in fact, a world of possibilities opens up for the player, but none of them is clearly revealed. There is no precise path to follow, in this sense the game is even more cryptic than it was at the beginning, when you found yourself immersed in a whole new world without a shred of information on how to craft items, collect materials and more. From the point of view of PvE, the game revolves around two factors: complete the exploration of the world, which thanks to the downscaling system allows you to always face challenges at our height while also being rewarded appropriately, or get the best equipment . The two things, however, are partly connected to each other, after all the equipment can be obtained in different ways, but each of them will prove to be extremely challenging. Dungeons are the first resource: the exploration modes offer a currency to be exchanged for high-quality items, aesthetically in themewith the related setting. The problem is that dungeons are real exercises in frustration: the absence of a well-defined threat mechanic (based on a mix of distance and enemy artificial intelligence reactions that border on total randomness) prevents you from developing precise strategies and the design of some bosses or groups of common enemies is, well, insane, also thanks to the questionable arrangement of the checkpoints. The annulment of role-playing archetypes has the great advantage of making each class universal, so that it is impossible to be rejected for having chosen one rather than another. On the other hand, lacking a clear distinction of roles, an enormous level of autonomy and alertness is required on the field: the battles in the dungeons are excessively long, confusing and all too based on dodging and resurrections. Let's be clear, the basic idea is excellent. Playing a warrior without relying on an ignorant two-handed greatsword, but rather placing empowering banners and blowing the horn to increase the frequency of dodges, thanks to a suitable choice of traits and skills, is much more satisfying than dealing a trillion damage while our comrades are dying around us like flies. It's a real shame, therefore, that the design of dungeons and clashes turns out to be so amateurish, often reaching embarrassing levels of pure and simple zerg: considering the curriculum of some of the brightest minds of ArenaNet, it was reasonable to expect something more. Exhilarating In this MMORPG version of ~gira la moda~ (more than understandable, given the beauty of some armours) the dungeon objects are not the only ones available. For that matter, it is possible to craft, or buy, equally powerful armor and weapons. They can be forged at the Mystic Forge or purchased with Karma Points earned through dynamic events. The three factions that you can join at a certain point in the story each offer unique weapons and armor. The problem with all of this is money. The management of money and the economy has left us rather perplexed: most of the objects found in the game world end up straight in the pockets of the NPC merchants, while at auction they sell like hotcakes manufactured objects and raw materials. Quest rewards are non-existent to say the least, even at maximum level, and are quickly consumed by repairing equipment or teleporting from one point to another on the map. In short, as you may have understood, for those who reach the maximum level and intend to wear the coolest armor in the game, a farming of a certain thickness is expected. There are two good news, however: the first is that you don't pay any subscription to play Guild Wars 2, so no one is breathing down your neck and to earn the money or currency necessary to buy a new, shiny helmet, you have all the time in the world; the second good news is that none of this is necessary to deal with the beating heart of the game, PvP. The so-called structured PvP, let's clarify it right away, is the most banal. Trivial and damned funny, as well as immediate. From the beginning you can access this lobby where your character finds himself at maximum level, fully equipped like every other player in place, with all traits and skills unlocked. You can buy weapons at no cost and do all the necessary experiments, then launch yourself into a team battle and give vent to all your anger. The proposed battlegrounds are far from original, but characterized by very interesting and dynamic maps, in which each team must maintain control over as many areas as possible to win. The prizes include a special currency with which to buy real Kinder eggs containing random PvP equipment: the goal is to conquer the armor that we like best, perhaps by breaking down the objects that don't interest us and reusing the materials to produce them. Basically, PvP crafting is a real game within a game. On the second PvP mode, the elusive WvWvW, there isn't much to say except that it is an experience that recalls the ancient glories of the legendary conflicts of the Dark Age of Camelot. In this sense, Guild Wars 2 succeeds where all MMOs of recent years have failed miserably, Warhammer Online in particular. Of course, the WvWvW, in which it is possible to participate at any time thanks to an appropriate upscale of the character, is so complex and vast that it is impossible to explain it in a few lines. Suffice it to say, though, that these server wars alone get you nowhere. Collaboration and planning are key, the zerg is really useless and when you happen to be in a game without", "date": "2012-10-01", "grade": "9.3"}
