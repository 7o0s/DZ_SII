But one day a dragon, just awakened from a sleep that lasted hundreds of years, attacks his people, forcing him to take up arms to try to stop him. Obviously there's no story: the dragon is too powerful and reduces the fishermen to frying. Even the hero, who still doesn't know he is, can't do anything against the nice lizard and ends up inexorably knocked down, but only after grazing him. The feat, however seemingly insignificant, is worth the attention of the dragon, who to reward him rips out his heart making him the Arisen, the classic chosen by unknown fate whose first objective will be to go and recover the blood pump organ that it was stolen from him. Said like this it seems easy, but between saying and doing there is an entire open world involved, in reality not too open since at the beginning not all areas will be explorable and will be unlocked by following the main quest. Indeed, the start of the adventure is really bland, with some warm-up missions to be carried out in the starting village and its surroundings, which timidly acclimatize with the entire game system. We reviewed the PC version of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. Find out how it is! The basics of combat Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is an action RPG in the purest sense of the word. The combat system is borrowed from third-person action, with standard, powerful attacks, jumps and various combinations, linked to the skills that have been acquired. The style of play depends on the class that was selected during the creation of the character, that is, at least initially, warrior, archer or wizard; the archetypes of the fantasy genre. By spending the points obtained by fighting and completing missions, you can unlock other ones, such as the Destroyer, the Sorcerer, the Paladin and so on. Basically, to face enemies, you need to learn how to hit like bulls, but study their attack patterns first in order to know when and how to strike more effectively. To help us are the so-called pawns, secondary characters who accompany us throughout the adventure. These are the classic followers who act in full autonomy and who can be given some order to try to direct their actions (in reality they end up doing everything by themselves). The Pawns, creatures dedicated to the service of the Arisen from the Fault, a mystical world which is accessed through stones scattered throughout the game world, have the same classes as the hero and can be examined before being hired. There are standard ones, i.e. preset by the developers, or, by going online, it is possible to assume the personal ones of the other connected players. This is a good way to immediately have allies with better equipment than the one supplied by default, but it is also the only online function of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. Not bad, given that it is essentially a single player title and there is no lack of other forms of multiplayer. Returning to the Pawns, it must be said that at most two can be hired, in addition to the personal one that will remain linked to us throughout the adventure and which can be raised up to level 200. Monster Dogma After a few hours of play, it becomes clear that the focus of the Capcom title is not so much the main story as exploration and monster hunting, especially the bosses. Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen has an advanced equipment manufacturing system, linked to the collection of precious materials scattered throughout the game world. The rarest and most valuable are obviously hidden and protected by extremely powerful creatures, some of considerable size that must be dealt with differently from the standard ones. One of the most relevant features of the combat system is the ability to grab opponents and, if necessary, climb them to hit their weak points. This is the peculiarity of the game most loved by players, the one that earned it a certain post-launch fame and that still makes it remembered with joy. In fact, it's fun to climb a cyclops to take a sword the only eye that nature has provided, as it gives a certain satisfaction to be beaten by really big creatures like the Hydra, the Chimera or the dragon itself. Each boss must be faced in a different way and the game comes alive just when you start fighting them regularly, which are much more intriguing than the classic cannon fodder scattered around Gransys, whose artificial intelligence is often questionable. We happened several times to face practical enemiesstanding still, without understanding the reason (probably some movement pattern was stuck). However, these are small flaws of a very satisfying combat system. The developers have focused so much on this aspect, inspired without too many mysteries by the Monster Hunter series, also by Capcom, that once the adventure is over, it is possible to continue playing by hunting for rare monsters. After all, the entire Nerabisso dungeon, one of the extra contents that were added via expansion on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but which are already included in the price on PC, is designed precisely to favor this type of gameplay. Incidentally, Black Chasm is a huge underground labyrinth located on an island outside Gransys, which offers encounters of increasing difficulty with monsters never seen on the main continent. This is arrogance In terms of missions Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is not particularly rich. On closer inspection, one of the weak points of the game is its narrative side. If the main story takes a few, too many hours before taking off and becoming at least interesting, without however being able to take flight and distance itself from the clichs of the genre, also thanks to a main character who is the classic empty box (customization imposes sacrifices) , side quests are rarely interesting and only require you to kill a certain enemy, collect a certain item, escort such a character, and so on. Some missions are particularly asphyxiating. For example the one that in the first act (there are seven in all) requires you to escort a cart with the head of a Hydra on it to the capital of Gransys. Not only does the cart go at a ridiculously slow speed, but not much happens during the long journey, apart from some combat against already faced enemies such as goblins and bandits. There would be other feasible examples, but the crux is that the quests, rewards aside, do not offer great motivation to be carried out. Much better to go around alone in search of materials and resources... so much better that you can continue playing after the end of the main story having even more fun than you did up to that moment. The reasons are the unlocking of stronger creatures and the aforementioned dungeon of Nerabisso, which finally becomes approachable thanks to the accumulated experience. Even the bosses, who when challenged to inadequate levels slaughter without too many compliments, become more affordable with advanced equipment and great satisfaction is derived from their killing. The conversion The novelties of the PC version compared to the console version are very few. However, Capcom has created a port for once worthy of the machine it runs on, adding uncompressed textures and some graphic filters which, thanks also to the higher resolution, make the continent of Gransys and its inhabitants, human and otherwise, more defined. Increasing the depth of field helps to improve the rendering of landscapes, without however surprising. In general, however, the polygon count remains the same and the presence of more modern titles on the market is felt. The comparison with a The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is unfair, given the years that separate them, but also inexorable from the point of view of mere visual rendering. Of course, it must also be said that the frame rate of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen never struggles, remaining fixed on 60 frames per second even in the most chaotic moments, despite the resolution of 1920x1080 (portable up to 4K) and the level of detail set to maximum. This is probably the most noticeable and relevant improvement because it directly affects the gameplay. This is a definite step forward compared to the console versions, which instead suffered from sudden drops in fluidity, particularly annoying in clashes with large groups of enemies and bosses. A good job has also been done from the point of view of the control system. It seems strange to have to point it out, but, given some recent cases of ports made with feet, you'll be happy to know that Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is playable in complete tranquility with mouse and keyboard and also provides the possibility of configuring the keys as you prefer. Obviously you can also play with a controller (all the most popular ones are natively supported, including the Steam Controller), but it is not essential. As for the online there are no changes compared to the old versions. Not bad, since it was an accessory then and we can consider it as such even today.", "date": "2016-01-14", "grade": "8.6"}
