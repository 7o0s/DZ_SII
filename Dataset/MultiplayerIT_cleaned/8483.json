Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. The endless run trend, or running game, enjoys extraordinary popularity on mobile devices. The reason is obvious: these are extremely immediate, amusing, quick-use titles, which can entertain for a few minutes or for a longer time, depending on the needs. If in the horizontal scrolling running game sub-genre Jetpack Joyride is certainly the opponent to beat, when we talk about gestural commands and a three-quarter top view Temple Run immediately comes to mind, the Imangi Studios product that has achieved something like forty million downloads and was recently re-released with a special edition based on the Disney movie 'Rebel'. Let's say immediately that Subway Surfers is clearly inspired by Temple Run, adopts an almost identical control system and also puts us in an ~urgent~ situation, in which the character must run as hard as he can to avoid a danger, but the latter identifies himself with a surly train conductor who has declared war on graffiti artists and who will chase us after catching us making a mural on a stationary carriage. The action therefore starts from here, but the Danish developers of Kiloo Games have been very good at giving us a period of preparation before implementing the inevitable acceleration of the race, which obviously makes it more difficult to avoid obstacles and calculate the right times for the jump. We said that the controls are almost identical to those of Temple Run, and in fact the gestures necessary for jumping and sliding are the same, with the finger having to draw an ascending or descending vector on the touch screen. However, there are two very important differences: firstly, the route does not have a single lane, but three ~tracks~ on which to move according to the moment using lateral ~swipes~; secondly it was decided, wisely in our opinion, not to resort to the accelerometer in any way. Turk 182 In short, in Subway Surfers, you run, jump and change lanes on the fly. That's all? Of course not: the game is full of coins to collect which we can then use to buy upgrades, bonus letters and power-ups that allow us to jump higher, attract coins with a magnet, multiply the score and even fly thanks to a sort of paint-powered jetpack, which will propel us over the electrical cables for several hundred meters. The presence of three parallel paths translates into an excellent variety in terms of the arrangement of the obstacles, which are randomly generated from game to game, so as to never find us faced with the same scenario. Some freight cars are open and with the sand touching the ground, and we can use them to go up to a higher level and from there jump onto the arriving trains, trying to calculate the times well. Among the items that can be purchased there is also a nice hoverboard (like the one in ~Back to the Future 2~) which guarantees us an extra life in the event of an impact, at least for a certain number of seconds. And what about the technical sector? The music that accompanies our run is slightly repetitive, but it immediately enters our heads and fascinates us as we grind meters, while the graphics are truly excellent in terms of colors, detail, cleanliness and animations. The character design is worthy of a cartoon, and it's really surprising to find such a quality in a free production. The comparison with Temple Run, from this point of view, is merciless...", "date": "2012-06-23", "grade": "9.5"}
