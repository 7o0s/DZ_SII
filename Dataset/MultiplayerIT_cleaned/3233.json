{"name": "World of Horror", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-of-horror-recensione.html", "text": "Our review of World of Horror on PC arrives right next to the official release of the panstasz game, scheduled for tomorrow 20 February 2020. If you still don't have points of reference on the game (bad) we invite you to at least read our tried World of Horror on PC, dating back to last month. The version we tested in advance is the complete and final version of the title, with two important premises. The first: currently only the English and Japanese languages are present, but the developers have promised other translations in the coming months (hopefully also in Italian); the second: World of Horror on PC will support mods to customize even more enemies, protagonists and objects of your games, but these too will arrive at a later time. That said, the descent into horror fully convinced us. Storyline and game modes Now that we have finally been able to try World of Horror on PC in its full version, we can also inform you about all the details of the plot, story and main game mode. Don't worry, there won't be any spoilers in our review: we simply want you to understand how much content you will have in your hands, once you have spent the approximately 13 euros that the developer should request on Steam in Italy. As you recall, the demo featured only one protagonist with a very short story: it was the episode Spine-Chilling Story of School Scissors. Well: in the full version of World of Horror you will find it as a sort of tutorial, characterized by the ~easy~ difficulty. Indeed, the main game menu is not the smartest and most functional seen in recent years, but in any case with just four items it minimizes the risk of error (disorder, to be honest, is a danger in which World of Horror runs too much often with its menus). What you should aim for right away is the second option, that is Extracurricular Activity. Because this is precisely the main adventure of World of Horror, with its beautiful protagonist engaged in five different investigative cases around the cursed seaside city. The heroine's main room acts as a game hub: she together with the entire city will change based on the choices made in the individual chapters (which coincide with the other five investigative cases), up to the final ending. Each chapter focuses on certain situations and enemies, but everything is connected with the context; each episode also features at least two endings, which affect the continuation of the main adventure. Everything appears calculated down to the smallest detail, for what is a real tribute to the works of Lovecraft and Junji Ito, with completely personal and original additions from the developer, a true lover of the subject in question. It is worth noting that, once the entire story has been completed, the player can still fall back on two other game modes: Quick Play and a fully customizable last option. Now, in the ~Quick Game~ you will experience completely randomly generated situations: objectives, enemies, protagonists and in-game objects/weapons, all random. Each experience will therefore be different from the previous one; this offer also returns in the option known as Costomize the Playthrough, where you will set the rules of the game. A sort of crazy editor (because World of Horror often borders on madness), who who knows, could also be further enriched in the future. The context: Lovecraft and Junji Ito Don't be surprised by this short paragraph dedicated to the context of World of Horror: the video game in question is a constant, detailed, original and lovingly created quotation from the works of H. P. Lovecraft and Junji It. Now, it is probable that you are well acquainted with the first of the two, Lovecraft, by now cleared through customs by a myriad of productions (including videogames) with very often fluctuating quality: he is the author who gave life to the Cosmic Horrors, to the unmentionable beings from the space and other dimensions, to the Great Old Ones and Cthulhu. Cleverly, the developer of World of Horror has combined this material with that coming from the manga of Junji Ito, another personality whose works you should recover as soon as possible: we are certainly trivializing, but you can make them fit into a generic japan horror with disturbing colors and alienating, starting with Tomie and Uzumaki. The video game you are about to buy is set in any of the cities described by Junji Ito: a seaside town where evil walks on the loose, where nothing is as it seems, and where every school locker or window or street alley could hide a demon, a monster, orsomething even worse. So much so that the protagonists of World of Horror (and the city itself) change according to the surrounding events, slowly sinking towards madness. On the other hand the observant player will use these advantages and his knowledge of the occult to his advantage, performing perfect rituals against the enemies of turn and even improving his stats with ~objects from the other world~. If Japanese folklore fascinates you, as well as horror in its most general sense (including visual), World of Horror must immediately be one of your most urgent purchases. Gameplay and technical sector Now that you know the contents of World of Horror and also its narrative context, you will clearly want to know more about its gameplay: in short, how to play the production of panstasz? The production is a reference not only to the works of the authors mentioned, but also to the classic 1-bit of the first Macintosh computers. An adventure to be played almost exclusively as a point and click, but with much more complex and modern mechanics. And with a difficulty, it must be said, that should not be underestimated: you have to learn to explore every nook and cranny of the environments well, to use the right object at exactly the right time, on pain of almost immediate game over. The developer put the wording roguelite there for a reason. The player mainly has to solve more or less complex investigative cases, exploring all the available environments but having to choose between some options, thus excluding other possibilities; this increases the replayability of the rest, and that's good because it takes a few hours to complete the game, especially knowing what to do. The GDR nature of the production emerges forcefully during the fights, and when you realize that without paying attention to the protagonist's statistics it is not possible to continue for too long in the course of the events. The slightly cumbersome on-screen menus allow you to perform certain options during each turn-based fight. On the one hand the demons that haunt the world of World of Horror, on the other a human (at least initially), armed with a baseball bat, fists and a lot of good will (again, at least initially). Each action inflicts damage, alternatively you defend yourself or opt for pure strategy: increase of specific parameters, defensive spells, rituals and more. What matters is to knock out the opponent before he knocks out the victim. It will take a few attempts before you can adequately master the World of Horror combat system. The old school technical sector should be mentioned for a splendid pixel art of the Jurassic period, as nostalgic as it is well made, and for a spot-on, well-finished and perfectly fitting chiptune sound sector with every single situation. These two aspects alone, and also the various customization personalities left by the developer to the player, would allow World of Horror to reach enough; which then abundantly exceeds, as you will see.", "date": "2020-02-19", "grade": "8.5"}
