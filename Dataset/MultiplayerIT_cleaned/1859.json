{"name": "Hover Ace", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hover-ace.html", "text": "Full beer! From this point of view, the euphoria that assails the owner of the only PC (obviously pumped up for the happy event) is easily understandable, having heard the news of the successful release of the present Hover Ace, developed by GSC Game World (?) for Russobit-M (??) and therein (in Italy) distributed by Leader spa. It's time to find out if this Hover Ace will be worth the expense, taking on a very difficult confrontation with the aforementioned illustrious colleagues or will have to retreat after a heavy blow. Gameplay Hover Race provides us with 24 well-distinguished vehicles for a series of variables such as resistance, speed and (later) shields and weapons (laser beams, missiles, etc.), to be driven on the eighteen circuits inserted therein; the game modes are the usual for this videogame genre, such as the single race and the championship, the latter, as always, the fulcrum of Hover Race, given that from this mode you can unlock all the tracks, as well as earn money (by winning the races and knocking down the various enemies) to buy new vehicles and possibly upgrade them. It is also possible to play with seven other friends online in real high-speed death matches  as long as you can tolerate the game physics; certainly from the low degree of enthusiasm perceptible from a couple of lines higher up, the shrewd average reader of Multiplayer.it will have understood how in the present Hover Race there is something wrong and the game physics, simply laughable, drastically reduces any good intentions that permeate the writer after the first incident. Gameplay If the (good) work done by the Russian coders in the field of artificial intelligence of the opponents (whose diversification from one another is tangible, also and above all from one level of difficulty to another) is recognizable, it is also it is true that 99% of players will throw the keyboard out of the window (sorry, gamepads seem to have been abolished by the Hover Race code), when at the slightest, slight, irrelevant contact with an enemy half, your own performs a (completely unnatural) overturn lateral which penalizes the gamer by a few seconds; if at the easiest level of difficulty, such an event (and here we mean, literally, UN) can, with a lot of tenacity and luck, be straightened out, it becomes a utopia to recover ground even with normal difficulty, given that the clashes are all order of the day, leading, for example, even the most skilled video player to recite one prayer after another before overtaking, perhaps between two opponents. Unfortunately it is intuible, from what has been said up to a few lines above, that the attractiveness of the game and, above all, its longevity, go, with all due respect, to the bottom line, with immediate uninstallation of the aforementioned, although the premises for an excellent rival for Wipeout became more and more tangible seeing the.. Graphics GSC Game World indicates as a minimum system to use Hover Race, a 450 mhz processor (Amd or Intel), 128 mb of ram, any accelerated video card (Voodoo excluded!) of 32 mb and half a gig of free space on hard disk; the recommended requirements for a decidedly more gratifying experience (read less clicks) speak of a processor with a net gigahertz frequency, 128 mb of ram and a nice GeForce. The test was conducted with an Athlon XP 1800, 256 mb of DDR ram, Geforce 3 Titanium 200 with 64 mb of onboard ram, with excellent results: with a resolution of 1024x768, 32 bit color and all graphic settings set to maximum possible quality (omitting, however, any type of Anti Aliasing via hardware), the frame rate is firmly anchored on sixty frames per second, despite the graphics engine taking care to send video glare of the sun (now ubiquitous in all driving games ), trails, explosions, while admiring frozen surfaces, silent deserts, abandoned cities and all those backdrops that have become the stereotype of the typical futuristic racing game. Graphics Speed, certainly a key element for a game of this type, is fairly high, but far from the glories of Wipeout Fusion and Quantum Redshift and this is not a good thing, for a title which, although without direct competition on PC, should fill a gap that leads many users to buy a 128-bit console. The means (twenty-four) at our disposal are not entirely convincing, however, due to a not too original design and some stylistic choices (in the opinion of the author of this article)just passable (the hovecraft of Hover Ace, from a possible comparison with the vehicles of Wipeout Fusion, come out with broken bones and decades of prognosis). Sound From cosmetics, it is time to move on to examining the sound side of the GSC Game World product which, together with the exquisitely visual side (primarily the speed of scrolling, assisted by perfect frame rate stability) and the game mechanics, is one of the reasons why a video game of this kind can fly off store shelves with greater or lesser speed, as Wipeout by Psygnosis (now Studio Liverpool) taught us, seven years ago; the question that obligatorily creeps into the head of the average reader is surely who has been entrusted with the soundtrack of Hover Ace given that the aforementioned legendary saga for PSone/Playstation 2 consoles includes in its soundtrack, among the many big names in dance music /techno, names of the caliber of The Chemical Brothers, Fluke, Dj Sasha, up to Fluke and Prodigy. Sound The music of the game reviewed therein, unfortunately, represents one of the weakest points of this production, first of all because they are fugitives of that involvement and that harmony with the frenetic on-screen action that contributed so much to elevating the Wipeout series. However, lovers of the rock genre (still quite calm) will appreciate the choice of this musical genre, instead of one that is certainly more trendy but, certainly, mistreated by a part of the videogame user. Normal sound effects, some of these hackneyed. Conclusions Hover Ace is a barely decent racing game that with more care would have become a gamer recommended to all fans of sci-fi vehicles and futuristic races at speeds exceeding 500 km per hour but, unfortunately, something went wrong; the graphics are well done, the means a little less, just as the sensation of speed offered by Hover Ace is just discreet, as well as the sound sector of the GSC Game World title. Conclusions The weak point of the title, however, is to be found in the frustration that arises during the races, when at the slightest contact with an opponent, our alter ego is literally busted, losing 3-4 seconds, which are very precious especially from the normal difficulty level upward; a more accurate management of the collisions (destining the above-mentioned jolts for collisions of more or less consistent entity, assigning a simple decrease in speed to the minor ones, for example) would certainly have significantly changed this final comment, which ends with a wasted opportunity in bad luck way, since Hover Race touched a more than flattering final comment. As it is, it is only recommended for those who hate Playstation 2 and Xbox owners, but with inhuman reflexes and, above all, a lot of patience and perseverance. Full beer! If memory does not begin its slow but inexorable decline, it is since the days of Roll Cage 2 that a driving video game based on hair-raising speed and set in the future has not peeped out on our beloved PCs while console users amuse themselves with the beautiful (but not excellent) Wipeout Fusion and Quantum Redshift, for Playstation 2 and Xbox respectively, enjoying the thought of sinking their hands into the upcoming F-Zero, developed by Amusement Vision (Sega's internal team) for Nintendo Gamecube.", "date": "2002-12-24", "grade": null}
