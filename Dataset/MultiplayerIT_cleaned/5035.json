However, before talking about the laughable differences between the two versions, we want to take stock of the situation after the first week of launch, also trying to understand in which direction the title is moving. For Honor came out on Valentine's Day, and over the past seven days, the community has started to grow rapidly. The first groups dedicated to the game were born on Facebook and some clans came to life, so as to be able to better manage the four-on-four matches that For Honor offers, but it is mainly the sales figures that bode well for the future, with the production Ubisoft takes first place in the UK charts. Even on Xbox One, For Honor is a sight to behold and to play Cups and Goblets The first official Italian tournament organized by Ubisoft and Trust Gaming proposed the Dominion mode as the fulcrum of the gaming experience, going a bit in contrast with the initial idea that wanted Duel and Scrum as the main modes for competitions. The feared imbalance due to the micro-transactions present has therefore vanished in a very short time given that, unlike matches in matchmaking, the tournament rules easily allow you to disable skills and upgrades deriving from objects, for challenges that are always very balanced and based solely on skill . One-on-one combat once again takes the spotlight, resulting incredibly deep and creating a marked demarcation line between novices and those who, on the other hand, know their class deeply. Exactly as happens in the most successful fighting games to be precise. The boredom or lack of variety feared by the players therefore vanish in the face of a title that tries to offer exciting gameplay for clashes that are always very different from each other and which know how to exalt not only those who play but also those who observe the clashes, an excellent starting point for the e-sport. Feints, games of cunning, catches and throws or mere blind assaults are all part of a game system that manages to entertain and that projects a rosy future on production. It will not be easy, if we really want to be critical, to be able to make the public understand that For Honor is exclusively a competitive game, that that is its strength and that it is on what Ubisoft is aiming, having already announced support for everything next year through downloadable content, distributed completely free of charge. The in-game currency will be used to obtain the new classes, as it is already done now for the new aspects and special animations, a currency that is not very easy to find to tell the truth and which still requires a good number of hours of play to be accumulated. At the moment, the stimuli to continue playing come from the desire to level up with your characters, learn to use and customize them, but ranked games will absolutely be included in the short term to keep the competitive scene alive. Playing these days, a doubt arose regarding the combination of players, which at the moment works properly but could fail in the long run. In fact, matchmaking takes two players and pits them against each other assuming that the highest level class is the one that will then be used during the match. The system works for now, as players are focusing on learning a few classes at a time, but when it's time to switch warriors, you'll find yourself challenging skilled and equipped (in the case of domination) players while we take our first steps with a new character. A matchmaking after the class selection could therefore solve this problem but it would mean rewriting part of the current code. We are therefore very curious to see how the Montreal team will unravel this skein. Finally we come to the technical question, immediately placating spirits. There are no obvious differences between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Ubisoft has done a great job on both console versions managing to guarantee the stable 30 frames in the vast majority of situations and the 1080p resolution. The lighting system is excellent, as is the anti-aliasing, slightly less effective on the Microsoft home console. The gaming experience, however, turns out to be substantially identical to the PlayStation 4, thus leaving players the choice of which platform to war on. However, the community speech made in the PC review remains valid: on PlayStation 4 the numbers are much higher, with the result of finding more balanced clashes and a greater number of games, an element that could prove to be fundamental in the long run.", "date": "2017-02-21", "grade": "8.3"}
