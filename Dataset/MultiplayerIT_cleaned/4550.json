After the fantasy conflict in The Stick of Truth and the battle between superheroes in the more recent The But Whole, now it's up to another irreverent antics: cowboys against Indians. In reality, that's just the beginning: the first mobile title from Ubisoft inspired by South Park mimics Clash Royale and makes us once again take on the role of Newbie or Coglionazzo, who recently moved to the charming Colorado town, without know what he was getting into when he made ~friends~ with Cartman... All against all Our skill in using the mobile phone and apps will allow us to deploy the most famous characters of the series in the form of ~minions~ that accompany the sprite of the protagonist, customizable at the beginning of the game and then at any time with various costumes, along the streets of South Park: each mission is in fact a short scrolling stage in which we will have to face numerous enemies before a kind of mini-boss, using the ~cards~ at our disposal. Each card has a specific role and special abilities, for example Cartman Sheriff and a ~tank~ and can attract the attention of enemies, while Calamity Wendy deals a lot of damage but has very little life. Obviously, the player can build his own deck, based not only on the roles and abilities of the cards, but also on their cost. In fact, the indicator at the bottom of the screen gradually increases and is consumed every time we play a card by dragging it onto the battlefield, so to play the best cards, such as the deadly Fireball that inflicts area damage, you have to wait longer time. Unfortunately, the strategic component practically ends here. Since there are no ~lanes~ on which to deploy the cards, nor obstacles between us and our goal, the various stages of South Park soon become a pit of sprites who give each other a thrashing, arbitrarily choosing their targets. We cannot choose exactly where to make an ally appear and we can only actively intervene in the fight by touching the icon that activates the super moves of some characters when they become available. The rest is practically all automated and, although the themes of the various chapters change, the action soon becomes repetitive. In this sense, South Park does not differ much from most mobile games of the same genre: there is obviously a shop where you can buy new packs of cards using the dollars earned by playing or simply by swiping the real credit card and then it is possible to upgrade the cards by consuming the materials obtained at the end of the missions. Furthermore, there is also a PvP mode which, however, annoyingly creeps into the single player campaign. To continue we will sometimes have to challenge another human player in a PvP match and if the first games are balanced enough, given that the new players have more or less the same cards, as we go into the campaign we bump our heads against what the game itself ironically calls Great Paywall of China: it is not uncommon to come across opponents who, thanks to luck or their wallet, have enriched their decks of cards that are too strong for ours. In these moments, therefore, the full weight of in-app purchases is felt which in the rest of the experience is felt little or nothing, which is obviously a great shame because South Park: Phone Destroyer is a very well-finished title in every other respect. Unlike many other similar games, it tells a hilarious little story in a very original way, peppering it with cutscenes voiced by the historical cast and with funny jokes that will make fans of the cult cartoon by Matt Stone and Trey Parker smile more than a few times.", "date": "2017-11-15", "grade": "6.5"}
