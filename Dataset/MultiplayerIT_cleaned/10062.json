One fine day, however, his old friend Nia peeps in, an adventuress who immediately volunteers to help Robb pay off his debt. These are the premises of Star Wars: Cantina, a Universomo title where the only Force that matters is the one needed to serve drinks to customers as quickly as possible. Alcoholic aliens Star Wars: Cantina does nothing in particular to differentiate itself from the classic Diner Dash, an obvious source of inspiration for the THQ Wireless product: the player is therefore called upon to serve the tables by taking orders, delivering the right drinks and collecting tips and empty glasses , all to be done in a hurry in order not to test the patience of the patrons. Waiting times that are too long translate into leaner receipts in the best of cases, or into violent outbursts in the case of particularly irascible customers. Universomo has drawn from the very rich Star Wars universe to differentiate the public of Robb's inn, assigning to each race parameters relating to the quantity of drinks necessary to be satisfied, the value of the tip left at the end of the drink and the tolerance towards the services offered from Nia: we therefore pass from the human settlers, poor but calm, up to the quarrelsome Gamorreans, passing through the inevitable Stormtroopers and also arriving at special guests of the caliber of a very thirsty Hutt. Assuming therefore that the leitmotif of the game remains the speed in serving customers, it is necessary to apply a pinch of strategy to immediately identify the most problematic figures to satisfy them as soon as possible and allow them to leave the place with high morale and empty wallet. The career mode consists of only 15 levels lasting a few minutes each: in this limited time limit the user must maximize the takings and reach the set target, in order to move on to the next stage and unlock extra components for the venue useful for make Nia's job a little easier. The duration of Star Wars: Cantina is really too short, if compared to many other similar products such as the Turbo Subs reviewed on these pages, and the title Universomo also lacks in terms of variety: the setting is always the same, and after the first five levels you can say that you have already seen everything that the product has to offer. However, it must be said that the graphics sector is really of a good standard, for the sake of those who prefer a single scenario done well rather than many made in a mediocre way: Star Wars: Cantina has a tasty cartoonish graphic style, maximized by the use of lively and strong of a series of well-defined sprites and equipped with more than discreet animations. The sound is not bad either, with music inspired by original themes from the saga and convincing effects. On the other hand, some perplexity comes from the precision of the detection via touchscreen: by touching certain elements on the screen, Nia performs a context sensitive action, but the operation is not always successful and you are forced to tap several times to obtain the desired effect .
