Launched in haste to accompany the new animated series, Shards of Crystal for Nintendo 3DS and, above all, The Rise of Lyric for Wii U are now counted among the lowest points reached by the blue hedgehog. So, to prevent history from repeating itself, Sonic Boom: Fire & Ice, the third installment for Nintendo 3DS scheduled for 2015, has been delayed by a year to ensure better optimization. But will these additional months have been enough to allow the developers to come up with something good? Sonic Boom returns with Fire and Ice: will it be the final nail in the blue hedgehog's coffin? Hunting for magnets... First of all, it is certain that in recent months the guys from Sanzaru Games have not considered the plot one of their priorities. In Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice, the porcupine and his company are in fact called to thwart yet another evil plan of Eggman, who this time has set his sights on a precious source of energy, the so-called magnite. However, its extraction works are causing a series of climatic changes, accompanied by fissures from which rays of fire and ice come out. And it is while investigating these phenomena that the brigade of heroes obtains the power to control two elements, fire and ice to be precise. In the approximately six hours intended for the completion of the campaign, the story proceeds in small steps and with absolute linearity: it could so easily be summarized in the twenty minutes of one of those filler episodes that are so fashionable in animation for children. Even the tarallucci and wine ending is rather cloying, even from the point of view of a game (and a program) designed to teach the values of friendship and environmental protection (?) to a very young audience. There is no good news even from the characterization of the characters, with the usual concentration of clichs not too thorough. In the pile we felt especially sorry for poor Knuckles, portrayed as the classic brainless gymnast and relegated to the role of extra. Despite being among the playable characters, like Sonic, Tails, Amy and Sticks, Knuckles joins the party that has already begun and his ability proves useful only on a handful of occasions. The 3D effect The same considerations made for the predecessor apply: the effect itself is not bad, but the technical sector of Fire and Ice is at the limit and 3D negatively affects not only the frame rate, but also the cleanliness of the image. The ideal would therefore be to use it only in the interlude scenes, but - surprise! - movies are not in 3D. ...and an identity Yes, because in Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice each of the five characters has its own particular ability: Sonic has a sort of shot in the air, Amy his hammer, Tails can glide and Sticks can use his boomerang to activate mechanisms and reach distant objects . Knuckles, on the other hand, partially copies Sonic's ability, but is more clumsy in his movements and, without any combat component in which to make his size count, ends up having the same role as Sonic Colors' yellow wisp: drilling the ground . It goes without saying that this is a rarely exploitable possibility within the levels, which certainly do not shine for the genius of their level design. On the other hand, even the other skills don't offer a great variety of approaches and so, despite five characters, you'll find yourself giving up Sonic only when you can't do otherwise. The blue hedgehog is in fact the only one on the roster to guarantee a certain rhythm to the progression and his aerial shot even allows some rare virtuosity to overcome some sections with momentum. However, these are short bursts of fun within mostly flat and uninspired stages, where speed is mainly exploited in the connecting sections and even the powers of fire and ice are always declined in the same way. However, there is something good compared to the predecessor and it goes beyond an appreciable and problem-free technical sector (if one obviously excludes the excessive compression of the interlude films and an artistic direction that is not always inspired): the phases explorations for their own sake have been drastically reduced, as has the duration of the levels. Within these there is now just a handful of collectibles, which allow you to unlock some purely aesthetic customization to the material of Amy's hammer, a mysterious Sticks project and stickers that unlock nuwhere racing between robots. The latter are another pleasant pastime that breaks the monotony between one level and another, together with the races in the tunnels, which closely resemble the classic ones for obtaining the crystals of chaos. The return of Tails' submarine and the missions with the hovercraft are then real 2D shooters, which in some cases are almost challenging. Too bad that for the rest the absence of game over and the difficulty calibrated towards the ~six-year-old~ level also eliminate the slightest sense of challenge that would have made sense of the general flatness of the production, at least in the collection of objects. The boss fights don't have much to offer either and, although they have to be faced with two characters, the exchange between them is far too mechanical. Even here, then, death is not a big deal and the intermediate checkpoints are too permissive. In this context, the presence of a series of images, which can be unlocked with the fragments of magnite obtained in the levels or via StreetPass, becomes almost a source of pride: these are real gems - in low resolution and super compressed - which reveal new the scenes on the past of some characters, which we would have gladly done without discovering, and also give juicy previews on the highly anticipated second season of the series.", "date": "2016-09-27", "grade": "5.9"}
