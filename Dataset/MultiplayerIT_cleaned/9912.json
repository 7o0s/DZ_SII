Let's say that the graphics and sound effects are not the arrow on the bow of this effort by Ubisoft with the first offering rather bare fields, the latter of too often repeated phrases, but which at least help to recreate that air of football fields concrete and doors between the jackets. In Pure Football you are not immersed in Serie A championships, with spectators, sponsors and televisions, but everything is brought back to a more amateur dimension. Five against five and no referees. This is the most interesting aspect, with an arcade-style game system that doesn't reach the imaginative heights of Mario Striker and Soccer Slam, and remains rather faithful to the football we know. I play too There are at least three peculiarities of the Pure Football game system. The first is given by the shooting and crossing system. As in a game of Golf, while playing a shot, a circular colored icon will appear and a cursor will cross it clockwise. Leaving the button on green will make a good shot, the more you go to the right and the more effective it will be. If you exaggerate, however, you will get red, which means a shot over the door. Between the two is a small window of white. Hitting it will result in a Pure shot, which is a very powerful and well-placed shot that often means a goal. In any case, with each shot on goal the ~Pure~ indicator at the top will fill up and when it is completely full the next shot will be a Pure shot. If we're on the wing and have a teammate in a good position, we can use the same system to make a cross. By executing a Pure cross, the action will focus on the receiver who can finish with a Pure shot. At this juncture, the opponent can give a shoulder by stopping his indicator in the right area. Fouls are also ruled by a bar. We have said that there is no referee, so the game is never stopped, except when the ball goes out of bounds. For each illegal intervention a red bar will grow and if you continue to play incorrectly you will give your opponent a penalty. The last feature of the game is given by the snap, which unlike the usual run of similar games, allows you to make a short acceleration but which will soon run out. With regard to the snap and the control system, we can add that the movements of the players are not soft but work by steps in a similar way to that of Virtua Striker, but fortunately less marked. We won this too! Game modes include a career, four-man versus and online play. The career allows you to create a team and a captain and bring it to success by winning the various stages of the tournament. By fulfilling different objectives you will be able to unlock the players of the defeated teams and make them your own. At the end of the game, Pure points will be awarded, which depend on the result, how the game was played, fouls, and other parameters. These points can be spent to improve the characteristics of your captain. Captain who reached the end of his career can be put up for ~sale~ in the online football market. However, you can also play online, even if in this sense the test gave disappointing results. During our tests, the lag was already perceptible only in the response in the movements, and the serious problems arrive during the shots. Due to game delays it is practically impossible to hit Pure shots making the games more frustrating than fun. Football fans will be happy to read that the game has official licenses and therefore the various national teams have players with faithful names and appearances. If, as anticipated at the beginning, after a few games the game begins to show its potential, unfortunately it is already over after a few others. The campaign can be completed in an afternoon, and cannot be continued after the end, only restarted. And it's a shame because the game system isn't bad at all and will give some satisfaction at different times. If those who financed the game had believed in the project as much as those who developed it, perhaps we would speak of Pure Football with different tones. Those who have whole afternoons to fill with friends could think about it for thirty euros.", "date": "2010-07-09", "grade": null}
