But with the arrival of the series on DS - Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: The March of the Mini Marios - the traditional formula was completely overturned in favor of a gameplay that was vaguely inspired by Lemmings and which involved the intensive use of the touch screen and stylus. The third episode of the series abandons the sequential issue but does not intend to revolutionize anything: will it be enough for a new success? Everyone to the rides! So let's go and see this Lemmings-like concept, but not before having taken a brief look at the particularly moving narrative background. We are at the inauguration of Minilandia, an amusement park inspired by the deeds of Mario: for the occasion, the plumber and Pauline, the charming ~friend~ (as she is defined in the manual, we believe so as not to make poor Peach suspicious, and we will raise no doubts about it) co-protagonist of each Donkey Kong are at the entrance to reward the first 100 customers with nothing less than a Minipauline for each, that is to say a doll that reproduces the features of the graceful creature. Huge crowds, and perhaps a little perverted, Funghetti, and the dear gorilla, who has repeatedly tried to get his hands on the original, shows up, lo and behold, only 101st. It is precisely the introductory film that depicts the injustice of which DK is the victim, this time armed only with good intentions and a very healthy enthusiasm for the doll of his beloved, when he is faced with the evil gaze of Mario who, display of dull inflexibility, denies him the prize; so we all tend to cheer for the ape who rightly decides to go back to old habits and kidnap Pauline in the flesh. But video games, like life, are cruel, and from now on we are forced to take the side of the wicked plumber who tries to free the beauty, who, between us, could even be better off with Donkey Kong... thus the adventure, which unfolds along eight attractions each inspired by a particular Mario and/or Donkey Kong game (there is the historic series as well as, for example, Donkey Kong Country) and each divided, in turn, into eight levels, plus a boss fight, plus an unlockable mini-game. The plumber does not live only on platforms In addition to becoming bad beyond all measure, evidently Mario has also become lazy, since he doesn't even want to get his hands dirty anymore: in his stead, in pursuit of poor DK he sends the Mini Marios, wind-up toys inspired by his apparently innocent but actually almost as wicked as their creator. Unlike the second episode, the first on DS (but the novelty had already appeared in Mini Mario to the Rescue!, the expansion pack available only on DSiWare), the player can act on the Mini Marios only and exclusively to set them in motion, and to guide them at the goal door of each level you can only change the scenery. In fact, the movement of the dolls changes according to the obstacles and game elements they encounter along their way: in front of a wall, the Mini Marios change direction; a diagonally placed beam carries them to the higher platforms; going into one tube, they come out the other end and so on. The basic concept is grasped in no time at all already in the very first level, where it is explained to us that it is enough to draw an iron beam between two pins to ensure that the Mini Marios walk easily on a precipice where the most classic of videogame spikes would be waiting for them; but things are more complicated than they seem, because the player is not allowed to draw element after element at will: these are in fact counted, and therefore if you want to place a beam in a certain place, you must first cancel the one that is another part, or collect any ~pieces~ available in the scenario. In addition to the normal increase in complexity and difficulty from level to level, each new attraction corresponds to a new element to learn how to manage: thus we have the springs that ~shoot~ the dolls in a certain direction in the second world, the conveyor belts to which possible to change towards the third, and so on, and to complicate things even more we find immovable elements, enemies to eliminate having first collected the classic hammer (which starts the tune taken directly from Donkey Kong!) and, in certain levels, inhabitants of the Mushroom Kingdom imprisoned by the ape, who must first be freed and then guided to the door corresponding to their color. Put like this, the gameor it might seem like hell of a difficulty, which indeed is found in the later levels. In reality, however, limiting yourself to the bare essentials, and that is to lead all the Mini Marios to the final door within a limited time, requires only a little patience and ~trial and error~; things change if, and we don't see why you shouldn't, you want to collect all the bonuses present and thus really complete each level: in this case the patterns to follow become much more complicated, requiring maximum doses of both initial planning and mental and manual dexterity to change the elements of the scenario on the fly and in no time. But how much satisfaction in completing, perhaps on the first try, an already medium difficulty level! The merry construction site After the eight levels of each world, there is the clash with DK in hair and muscles, which combines the dynamics of the game with the structure of the first Donkey Kong: the Mini Marios you have saved in the previous levels must be guided up to the upper screen where you find the ape, who will hinder them in every way, and this time the initial planning is not possible as it starts already in motion and new dolls are introduced every now and then. The picture closes with the mini-game to be unlocked by collecting the letters that make up the word ~Mini Mario~ in each level, actually the least successful part of the game: dolls and Mushrooms fall down from the upper screen, to be conveyed into the right container at the base of the lower screen via the same dynamics of the canonical levels. The game is so addictive and pushes so much to the ~one more try and I'll give up~ syndrome that, even if you persist in getting the maximum scores in each level, the single player adventure does not last a lot, especially once you get involved in its mechanics. To increase longevity exponentially, the Construction site mode arrives, which essentially allows you to create new levels and share them with other players via direct transmission from DS to DS and Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection; this means that, in addition to testing yourself as a level designer, you can download (and evaluate) the hundreds of player-created levels already available online, the number of which is increasing significantly every day. As if that weren't enough, Nintendo regularly organizes themed contests to evaluate the best level and its creator. While the graphic style used for cutscenes and interludes seems a little ~strange~ for a Mario game (it tends very vaguely to ~realistic~), not so the in-game graphics, rich, fluid, colorful and decidedly insane in the representation of the characters ; but the feather in the cap of the technical department is definitely the sound, which shows off wonderful remakes of many historical music from the various games that inspired the attractions. Special mention for Pauline and her cries for help: whoever lent their own interpretation to give voice to the character must not have fully understood that it was a game recommended for ages 3 and up...", "date": "2011-02-15", "grade": "8.8"}
