In fact, after Taiko no Tatsujin, this second and important rhythm game passes again from Japanese arcades to the world of consoles, even if they arrive in Europe with its good months of delay. However, it was worth the wait, as you will read: to date Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix represents a complete package full of interesting content, perfect for novices and satisfying even for experts of the genre. The gameplay: how to play The game experience of Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix is presented on Nintendo Switch in a very compact, accessible and complete way: there are tons of things to do, tons of songs to listen to (101 in total, with the option to purchase DLC ), and virtually endless customization possibilities. But the real cornerstone of the title lies in the gameplay, which arrives on consoles without distorting its arcade identity. As you probably know Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix is one of those games that requires you to execute certain commands on the screen at equally certain and precise moments, all while following the playing melodies and enjoying (if you have multitasking) the videos playing on the background. The more accurate you are, the more points you earn; the more points you earn, the greater the chances of passing the current level with dignity (or at least of passing it). Naturally, each song is equivalent to a level: these rhythm games work like this, as you may have already understood at the time from the review of Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun!. But, and here's a far from secondary detail, Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix is very accessible, really perfect for players with diametrically different skills. The novice will learn to play through the tutorials, and still be able to enjoy every single song in easy mode; veterans will play them from ~hard~ up. In these cases the minimum score threshold necessary to pass a level rises, and the margin of error in the execution of the commands becomes much less permissive. Three different game modes and styles The gameplay of Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix, all in all basic and far from innovative, however, combines with some particularly interesting solutions on Nintendo Switch, leading to a total of three different game modes. The first is the Arcade Mode, that is the standard one: the game shows the commands to be performed, the player presses the right button at the right time, using the JoyCon separately or the Pro Controller for Nintendo Switch. Both solutions work almost perfectly, net of some minimal episodes of input lag (which in any case proves to be frustrating, because it can compromise the entire execution). Having tried them both, we advise you to use the Pro Controller: the keys are larger and more comfortable to use, and this is an important detail for a game of this type. Alongside this canonical game mode, there is the Mix Mode, designed specifically for Nintendo Switch. The player holds the JoyCon again separately, but this time using the motion sensors; completely changes the style of play in this case, because the objective is no longer to execute the commands at the right time, but to ~move~ the light bars on the screen with the motion control, trying to fit them with those that descend from above during the melody. Here too precision and timing are important, but everything is much more intuitive, even if initially the estrangement will be total because it really is an original solution. Finally, the touch screen mode, a sign that the developers have really worked hard to adapt Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix to the potential of Nintendo Switch: the player uses his thumbs to perform light pressure (even prolonged) on the screen at the right time. Each different game mode has its own difficulty levels and tutorials: we advise you to try them all and, why not, switch from one to the other when you get the chance. Contents, customization and technical sector We've already told you about the 101 songs featured on Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix, but the content doesn't stop there. The player can create his own playlists from scratch, thus further personalizing his gaming experience, and making it much easier to find his favorite songs. Maybe playing from home you won't need all of this, but imagine moving around the city and having barely a tipnumber of minutes available: it is very convenient to find a song immediately instead of having to search for it manually. Even better if all your favorite songs start one after the other. The customization of Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix explodes in a riot of colors when you go to customize Hatsune Miku or one of the other vocaloids present: it is possible to modify practically any detail of the avatar, even force him to wear a shirt created ad hoc by the player. The technical sector is also worthy of praise: apart from some slowdown in loading some songs (few), almost all the songs start with an average waiting time of about 7 seconds, and you quickly return to the main menu even if you interrupt a song in execution. The frame rate fluctuates between 60 fps in TV mode and 30 fps in portable mode, with occasional (often not easily explained) transitions from one to the other.", "date": "2020-05-18", "grade": "8.0"}
