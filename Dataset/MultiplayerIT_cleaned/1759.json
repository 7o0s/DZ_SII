{"name": "ToeJam & Earl 3: Mission to Earth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/toejam-earl-3-mission-to-earth.html", "text": "The return of DJ TJ The story of ToeJam & Earl III: Mission To Earth (TJ&E from now on), sequel to a series born in the 16bit era on MegaDrive, then takes shape on Funkotron and continues on Earth, where our heroes, helped by the new entry Latisha, they will have to complete their tasks through five game areas which are in turn divided into various levels and sub-levels. To help TJ, Earl and Latisha in this difficult mission we will be able to count on a rather original and varied gameplay, which will lead us to try to convert as many living beings as possible with Funk Fu shots. Funk Fu is a martial art that allows you to funkize the unfortunate person with a series of moves, who, once converted, will greet us with affection whenever we pass by him. Furthermore, at the time of the successful conversion, some people will have the hair of a real Truzzo-funkie from the 70s and not even the chickens will disdain a gesture of gratitude. Santa's Funkie Gifts To access the different levels, we will have to be able to find a certain number of keys scattered in the various game areas, but also the recovery of the microphones will be important, finding the latter will in fact allow us to face timed challenges useful for obtaining other bonuses. One of the fundamental elements of TJ&E is represented by the gifts that Santa Claus Funk, thanks to the intervention of the great mentor Lamont, alias Funkopotamous, will make available to us. Gadgets of various types can be hidden in these gift packages: from spring shoes to lures, from Icarus' wings to the hip hop radio that will make the earthlings unleash in crazy dances, and all will be used to better face the various game situations. It should also be said that there will be other very fun ways to funk earthlings, for example we will be able to find a ~funk rhythm~ icon, go over it, and start executing the key sequence that is asked of us without losing the rhythm, in this way those around us will inevitably be converted and we, based on the precision with which we have performed the key sequence, will get useful points to increase the level (from Loser to Stupid and so on ...) and belt ... Yes, you read that right  belt: Funk Fu is still a martial art, isn't it!? 16bit X 8? 128!!! As you may have guessed, the game is quite varied and stimulating even if it is not very deep, but it is undoubtedly the audio sector that takes the lion's share. Funkie hip-hop (actually a bit dated) at full throttle throughout the game and goodies like the chubby soul singers who introduce us to the game missions, with elaborate three-part choirs and goosebumps harmonies. Dialogues and song lyrics are fun and everything is even better if you share the experience with friends, perhaps taking advantage of the fun cooperative mode for 2 players. As mentioned in the title: 16 times 8 equals 128, and it shows! TJ&E in this 128bit version boasts well-kept levels with a very pleasant design, bright colors, full-throttle bump mapping, a fair variety of 'enemies' to convert. Without beating about the bush we are faced with a very good technical realization, which only sins in the small number of animations of the protagonists. On the other hand, the management of the cameras is essentially devoid of defects, with the right stick that allows us to rotate the shot by 360  and to zoom in on our character at any time. Comment Needless to get lost in words to point out how much this third episode of TJ&E doesn't differ much from its 16bit predecessors; also because many discover these bizarre characters for the first time, without having ever played the previous two games. The Visual Concept title is fun, has a decidedly good graphic sector and oozes 80s hip-hop funk from every polygon. All the good ideas taken from the two prequels have been expertly refined to make the game worthy of the 128bit it runs on. Basically TJ&E could prove to be a very pleasant surprise even for those who don't appreciate platformers very much, for all the others a definitely worth trying title. PS: As for the online mode, burly sandwich men are found here and there throughout the game levels sporting an ~Xbox Live~ logo sign. From 14 March onwards, some levels will in fact be available on the network which, once downloaded, can be played, hopefully also in 2 player mode; just go and talk to the men mentioned above and the game will be done. Furthermore, it is probable that we will be given the possibility of downloading power-ups, perhaps in the form of gifts, but to find out precisely we will have to wait for the month of March. PROS: Nice characters and funny dialogues Awesome soundtrackeven if a little dated Graphics and playability more than good CONS: For the more savvy it could be a bit repetitive and not too difficult to complete Shallow On the planet Funkotron, several light years from our solar system, the twelve sacred funk albums, dispensers of life energy, have been stolen and brought to Earth. Only fearless heroes can recover the precious vinyls and restore balance to Funkotron. In this regard, the great Funkopotamous has urgently summoned ToeJam and Earl to entrust them with the onerous task. But during the years of research, another mission will have to be completed: the terrestrial people are in fact experiencing a phase of musical decline never seen before, from ultra-commercial pop to toilet paper dance, everything needs to be redone, or rather to be treated! TJ&E will have to funkize all earthlings to birth a new era of hip-hop funk music that brings fortune and glory to our beloved blue planet. No, we didn't smoke the impossible, this is just the premise of one of the most original titles coming out on Xbox.", "date": "2003-02-12", "grade": null}
