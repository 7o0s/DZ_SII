{"name": "The Getaway: Black Monday", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-getaway-black-monday.html", "text": "A growth on the same basis Compared to what can happen in the PC market, in the console market patches and expansions translate into the need to produce a real new title, at full price and with a clearer demand for innovation and improvements. Black Monday is almost more of an expansion than a sequel, as it tries to improve the worst flaws of its predecessor by offering a slightly refined mechanics, much larger environments, more (and more accurate) streets of London and a completely new and with multiple playable and non-playable characters. The city remains the same, well mapped, huge and good on the viewer. And even the defects remain almost entirely those of the predecessor: namely the absolutely ungovernable camera system, the rather confusing and imprecise control of the character during the firing phase, the excessive perishability of the controlled machines and the inevitable feeling of linearity of the experience, although different actions and choices now lead to different outcomes in the plot. As for the events and situations that support its aesthetic identity, Black Monday presents itself with a well-constructed narrative, with great attention to the animations of the polygonal models and an even wider and more faithful reconstruction of London. The narration involves three characters (a policeman who has been suspended for two years for the involuntary killing of a boy, a boxer involved in a robbery that ended very badly and a girl named Sam), whose stories alternate and intertwine in completing the events described. The best news is that the actions performed during the missions and some choices at certain moments of the game, including general conduct in relation to non-playable characters and situations, actually activate narrative crossroads that narcotize or activate events of the subsequent plot. A pleasant novelty, but which in fact hardly alters the essentially linear structure of the game's missions. The potential to build something resembling a living environment full of possible actions and side play mechanics is thus precluded, and Black Monday also becomes a sort of guided tour of London through a plot that acts as a glue and pre-established routes. The strong point of the Grand Theft Auto saga, which obviously constitutes Black Monday's greatest source of inspiration together with stealth games and which also explains their commercial birth far beyond the artistic vocation, was precisely the ability to use the plot as a mere expedient. After all, in Rockstar Games' three-dimensional trilogy the narration was and remained pre-established, with the playability peaks reached through a rich, varied and well-implemented design, capable of opening up to the player a variety of potential rhizomatic, continuous and variable actions. unlock for territory expansion. All of this continues to be missing from The Getaway: Black Monday. Much of the game takes place in GTA-style driving, with the only indicator being vehicle arrows and occasionally character voices. The map of London is present, as well as an indicator of our location and arrival location. The vehicles have a pleasant and very differentiated control between them, the chases and the artificial intelligence of the opposing vehicles and that populate the missions has been improved and it is now possible to drive motorcycles. The streets of London are much more well-maintained and have been slightly widened to allow for greater traffic flow for vehicles. All in all, linearity aside, this remains the best aspect and the most pleasant component of the title, which assumes greater importance thanks to extra modes that allow you to exploit the map for Crazy Taxi-like sub-missions, races of various kinds and for wander around like simple tourists, finally without having to wait to finish the game (there is also a progressive unlocking system of the events with a menu, to be able to deal with them later at any time). Technically speaking... The appropriate cosmetic enrichment and expansion of the locations is even more evident in the other component of the game, the shooter/stealth one: the environments are much larger and more varied, well furnished and full of embellishments of various kinds such as good fogging effects, of light and objects endowed with physics. But the larger interior spaces, on closer inspection, are not enough to correct the number of problems that remained unresolved during the inspection. The movement of the camera is still marred by the impossibility of controlling its range in a logical way, with the result that the engine tends, as always, to prevent the player from having a correct view in front of him, and the consequent rhe ceases to vary the angles by relying on the not excellent automatic yield. A particularly serious thing for a game in which the stealth component is one of the cornerstones of the experience. The player can now roll over and handcuff enemies, as well as punch them when ammo is low and carry victims around. Weapons are collected simply by hovering over them as in the first episode and it is possible to hide more efficiently behind walls and objects, but there is still no way to coherently manage complementary actions such as hiding and going out to fire in a targeted manner (for then take cover behind the barriers again). Something that even seemingly minor titles like Kill: Switch did very well. Here, inevitably, it comes down to having to break through the resistance of the enemies sooner or later with a wall of fire which, however targeted it may be after hours of training, not only clashes with the concept of finesse in gameplay but makes the experience more frustrating than difficult. And speaking of the difficulty, as in the predecessor, medical kits are very rare, and in the absence of an energy bar you have to rely on observing the lamentations of the characters and the amount of blood they shed. Here too, it is often necessary to suspend the action to let the character rest and inexplicably self-heal, which happens much faster (and inexplicably) than before: a true paradox of the attempt at absolute realism. There are also some pseudo-bugs in the narrative system, such as the voices of the occupants of a now empty car who continue to be heard on the car despite the fact that the mission has moved the characters to a completely different place. In short, the effort made to correct the gameplay from some basic flaws appears completely marginal compared to the trumpeting of new and larger locations in which to set firefights, of major streets and side alleys that can be traveled on the London map, of more shop windows depicting real businesses, more vehicles to steal and use to move around the city. There is no shortage of innovations that can greatly improve the experience, but in general Black Monday fails to correct the major flaws of the original, nor can it claim to seem ambitious or original once again or demand an equally accommodating treatment in the face of a operation that appears even more forced. The illusionistic attempt to build a great London noir, badly mixing the mechanics of some of the best games of this generation and expecting the video game to mimic the film, works as badly today as it did yesterday but risks receiving much less sympathy. Black Monday, like the first Getaway, fails to create a good hybrid between stealth game and GTA model. It is a game full of positive ideas and with a considerable technological and artistic effort behind it, but the major defects remain a non-functional control and unmanageable cameras, which hinder control. Marginal improvements and interesting additions fail to limit structural defects that the programmers have practically glossed over, thinking that more roads, digitized showcases, vehicles and larger locations were enough, with a more developed plot and provided with rudimentary alternative events, to make the videogame a experience comparable to a movie. But even trying to make a game that lacks indicators and looks like a movie, in hindsight, is just plain clunky. The video game as a means of entertainment cannot and must not imitate the cinema: narration can be a qualifying element with valid game mechanics, but the true videogame art has to do with the interaction and the creation of other worlds, full of situations, controllable events, freedom, various and well-integrated mechanics overall. A destination conquered by the fictional and lively San Andreas, and light years away from the dull London of the title Soho: it quickly loses its charm, and becomes a set for forced tours of fluctuating interest. Pros London is more accurate and realistic Character control is slightly improved Extra modes allow for gameplay variation Good aesthetic and narrative work Cons Cameras remain dysfunctional Stealth action isn't quite the best Experience remains linear, London is ~dead~ ~ It suffers from the comparison with certain titles that inspire it The Getaway was a stealth/racing shooter made more famous than the average by the attempt at extreme realism and filmic immersion that set it in a real London mapped and reproduced: no interface, character energy bars or light indicators, only the arrows of the cars to indicate the journeys and cries of the wounded character. For many reasons, the LThe work of the Team Soho types has remained even more famous for the linear and forced gameplay, the feeling of bewilderment due to the lack of decent mapping and any sort of player status indicator and for the chaotic control of the character and the cameras. The quality of the narration and the realism of the settings were not enough. The extreme attempt at filmic illusion had resulted in a playful suicide, disguised as a great experiment and driven more by the commercial boom of stealth games and GTA than by artistic ambitions. The Getaway: Black Monday, rather than a real sequel, could be considered as an expansion of the controversial first chapter, given that the present improvements do not fill the basic defects of the predecessor. And they leave the sensation of a title released with little effort, which can no longer count on the effect of novelty, in the meantime clearly deflated, of ~realism~, nor rely on the mere fascination of the plot and the goodness of the aesthetic work to excite the players .
