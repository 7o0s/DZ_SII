Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. If any of you as a kid went to the cinema to see ~RoboCop~, remaining punctually traumatized during the long scene in which Alex Murphy's execution is represented, you will undoubtedly have found yourself wondering why, for some years now , Hollywood producers try to remake cult favorites instead of focusing on completely new stories. Are they driven by the charm of a franchise already known to the general public? Surely. The point is that when you don't have ~starpower~ or even a production with the so-called, the risk of making a hole in the water becomes more than concrete. From the trailers that have come out so far, RoboCop is honestly a candidate for exactly this end, and the reason is obvious: there were too many, too many elements of the original film that have remained etched in the memory of us elderly youngsters, too many things that seem to be been ~forgotten~ for this far from promising reboot, whose protagonist looks like an anonymous guy in an anonymous armor (complete with a meaningless ~human~ hand that Paul Verhoeven would have probably reduced to mush at the first opportunity, knowing him) instead of a robot. In short, the 1987 film was something else and we are quite sure that we will be disappointed with this new version, from which however an inevitable mobile tie-in developed by Glu has been taken. Available for free on the App Store and Google Play, RoboCop looks like a ~static~ shooter along the lines of EPOCH, therefore with the obligation to lurk behind cover, identify enemies and open fire at the right moment. Wait, wasn't bulletproof armor one of the character's quirks? Details, details. RoboCop turned out to be a solid, fun and accessible shooter, if a bit repetitive Dick, you're fired! Aversion to the film remake aside, the RoboCop video game takes very little to get going and immediately proves to be fairly rich. The list of available missions is in fact quite extensive, with the difficulty gradually increasing and prompting us to unlock new upgrades to cope with the opponents, working on the elements of a ~tree~ which lead to improvements in the order of 2-6% with respect to the characteristics of power, cooling (you can't shoot continuously), rate of fire, and accuracy of the equipped weapon, as well as the specific abilities of the cyborg, such as resistance to attacks. Bringing a virtually invulnerable RoboCop to the screen of our mobile devices, like the one in the movies, would clearly have been a difficult move to fit into the typical mechanics of a shooter; and so here is the traditional vital energy bar to pay attention to, framed by a functional and immediate touch interface, dynamic even in its static nature, since it allows you to adjust the view at will to better frame the targets and then open fire , trying to eliminate the opponents before the cover we are hiding behind is destroyed, which would expose us to their projectiles. One of the interesting things about the game is that enemy shelters can also be damaged and destroyed, more or less easily depending on the material (it's easier with wooden crates, more difficult with reinforced concrete reservations), which opens up to a series of unprecedented possibilities. At certain times it is also necessary to scan the area which highlights the weak points of the criminals, who can be neutralized much more quickly when hit. The freemium setting itself appears very permissive, in the sense that the inevitable ~action points~ are abundant and allow you to complete various missions before having to reload, while the only limits to the use of the experience are the premium weapons, which can only be purchased using hard currency . On the technical front, a good job has been done, even if there is a certain repetitiveness in the scenarios and a few too many edges as regards the polygonal models.", "date": "2014-01-18", "grade": "7.6"}
