{"name": "Miami Vice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/miami-vice.html", "text": "the possibility of alternating the use of the two cops was offered Sonny Crockett VS. Tommy Vercetti Initially announced as a GTA game in Miami in the 80s, the title then took on the shape of a third-person shooter  la Max Payne (perhaps so as not to run into a too strong similarity with the Rockstar title, which in turn was inspired by the series) but with the use of an absolutely scary camera that completely ruins the gaming experience. Once the initial menu has been loaded, you find yourself in front of a menu that takes up the initial theme song of the show, complete with ~Miami Vice Theme~ by composer Jan Hammer (creator of the original soundtrack), with the sea flowing and the nice appearance of some neon-like icons (neon is a Miami prerogative) that represent the key elements of the serial. From here we could well hope for a title that would make us relive the atmosphere of the series worthily but unfortunately this is not the case. After ten introductory seconds you'll be ready to shoot at the drug dealers; the character is seen with his back to Max but (horror!) the camera only moves left and right and not on the vertical axis! In practice, if you have someone in front of you, they will be hidden by your digital alter-ego, making everything more difficult. In fact, the aiming system is not as free as one might think but it forces the player to aim (automatically) with the right mouse button. Doing so Sonny or Rico will move to the right to show you the enemies and where you are shooting! The aiming system has never been so poorly implemented: in addition to not always hooking the opponents, the change of view worsens the controls and moving the camera with the mouse causes a seasickness effect that is difficult to reproduce. In short, an ordeal. Furthermore, in certain areas of the level the framing changes (perhaps to give a more cinematic style?) showing us other perspectives that risk disorienting even more. It's hard to say but this system literally forces you to play Miami Vice on easy mode. this system forces you to play Miami Vice on easy mode! Sonny Crockett VS. Tommy Vercetti The sudden changes of shot and the sudden appearance of enemies often lead to death without understanding where they are shooting from! A disaster also because it is not possible to save until the end of the level. There are no checkpoints of any kind but only an immense frustration in being mowed down without knowing in which direction to look The levels are not immense but they must be tackled carefully so as not to risk dying right at the end, and unfortunately there are no car sections: in the show the two protagonists unsheathed Ferraris like cars and launched into spectacular chases on the streets of Miami. Only a few glimpses of the city can be seen, given that the locations are often in anonymous places and indoors. [C] A thoughtful Tubbs Castillo always keeps his composure [/C] Hey Tubbs! I'm in trouble!~ As for the protagonists, the possibility of alternating the use of the two cops was offered as they have different characteristics: Crockett is faster and more agile but with little resistance to blows, Tubbs instead gets lead in quantity and can perform a dive - somersault to Max Payne; this is poorly done and useless to the game as it locks the direction of the shot and makes use of the usual auto-aim. Meh! The arsenal available includes various weapons even if the functional ones are no more than three or four, which vary according to the policeman used. Finally, Rico can also break down doors that the frail Sonny cannot open Speaking of Artificial Intelligence, things don't improve: the puppets controlled by the computer stay hidden or expose themselves to get caught, even shoot at the objects that cover them and then put the head out with an unloaded weapon! We are at the level of Bad Boys 2 Rico's sawed-off cane is the best choice. devastating! Your companion is partially saved, who can be controlled with four orders: go forward, follow me slowly, cover me and wait here. All in all it works and usually in shootouts the colleague will shoot enemies and knock some down. The negative remains the fact that although it is possible to arrest drug dealers (and it becomes mandatory in certain cases) they will surrender only when seriously injured and summoned by your ~stop~, all for a few seconds, after which they will start shooting again to be killed by your dude or from those behind who shoot haphazardly! For each mission you will be assigned main and secondary objectives: by solving the latter you will have access to secret bonuses which actually consist of a gallery of charactersof the game placed on a pedestal. The game also lacks any video tracks from the original series. Unlike the other Davilex Supercar title in which scenes from the show and sketches can be unlocked, in Miami Vice there will only be a movie-advertisement of the series which will be released on DVD in February (for now only in America unfortunately). Sea, Sun, Crime! The graphics are certainly not exciting but not bad either: the main characters are made and animated fairly well, and are dressed and armed as in the show (a pity that Crockett wears glasses even at night!). The resemblance to the actors is not much but they are still recognizable. The few facial animations (forget Half Life 2) are seen only during the short skits and certainly don't make them look their best. The situation is different for the environments: during the adventure you can see some glimpses of the city or of the Art Deco style that has always characterized it, such as Ocean Drive, the road of hotels that overlooks the beach (you can find it in GTA: Vice City) or the inside of the art gallery, full of colorful paintings. The quality of the construction is fluctuating: some buildings stand on discrete levels, other areas (such as the port) are disappointing; however in general the textures are of a good quality. On the other hand, some secondary characters and their animations (such as falling from balconies) are bad. Crockett's theme The audio is another set of ups and downs: the voices are the original ones (in English) of the actors, probably extrapolated from the episodes and endowed with a certain charisma especially in short sentences. All well done but few and repetitive, especially during the shootings, in which the protagonists indulge in more or less funny comments. The musical discourse, to which fundamental importance has always been given in the series, here disappoints widely: no dynamic music, no 80s songs, if not a few clips from the original soundtrack by Jan Hammer, who was the first to introduce electronic music in a TV show. The Crockett's theme, a beautiful track (dedicated to the character) that appeared in moments of particular emotional tension, is recycled here continuously in each skit and in the pause menu, in a sort of continuous rewind that gets tired in the long run. If you think that part of the budget of each episode went to the songwriters in royalties, the disappointment is great GTA Vice City is light years away. Crockett's theme forever! TV show or music video? Miami Vice aired from 1984 to 1989 for a total of 111 episodes which received millions of plays worldwide. The series, which focused heavily on drug dealing stories (real scourge of Miami) saw a strong characterization of the characters and the problems they had to face every day (criminal, work, love affairs). It is important that the episodes do not always end well (as all the TV series of those years taught us) but often with unsolved cases and sad implications (as unfortunately happens in reality). As already mentioned, peculiar characteristics were the high fashion and the music of that period, present in massive doses in the individual episodes: just think of the strong collaboration with Phil Collins and the songs of U2, Simply Red, Bryan Ferry, Peter Gabriel, The Doors and many others. The CD with the soundtrack remained first in the charts in Italy for several months. Multiplayer? Never! Obviously there is no possibility of playing in two. Too bad because it would not have been a bad idea to advance with the companion commanded by a friend, perhaps with the split-screen. But there is Bruce! The series, which starred Don Johnson (Crockett) and Philip Michael Thomas (Tubbs) has seen the participation and cameos of many celebrities, some when they were in the early stages of their careers. In the long list are to mention: Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts, Liam Neelson, Wesley Snipes, Bill Paxton, Melanie Griffith, Phil Collins, Benicio Del Toro, Ben Stiller and the list goes on... Comment The appearance of Miami Vice has been long awaited by fans, who unfortunately are faced with a product made with little care and below today's standards. A license that could have been exploited better is penalized by a practically unplayable control system and a certain basic repetitiveness (in the end it is a question of shooting bad guys, finding keys and objects) which rests on a plot created with a certain superficiality. Of course, the game is sold for only 20 euros, but houses like FX Interactive show us that great things can be done for a small price. Davilex continues to produce low quality titles by neglecting the two fundamental aspects of a title: playability and fun. Recommended only for true enthusiasts, who will see the iempathy with Crockett and Tubbs an ordeal rather than a happy comeback. The others stay away. ~Easy level~ strongly recommended. Pros: Characters and licenses faithful to the series Decent animations of the protagonists Budget price Cons: Amazing camera management Fluctuating graphics Poor artificial intelligence The story I know how to... After years and years of waiting, the two ~coolest~ police officers ever are back on our screens! Sonny Crockett and Ricardo (Rico) Tubbs resurrect in this new three-dimensional incarnation after only one appearance on the old Commodore 64. For those few who do not know the series, it is good to start by saying that this was a true mass phenomenon of the legendary 80s, so that many define it as the true symbol of that period. Created by Michael Mann (screenwriter and producer of many films, the latest being Collateral with Tom Cruise) proposed a pair of cops, one white and one black (which later became a ~must~ for films and TV series, just think of Arma Lethal or L.A. Heat) committed to fighting drug traffickers in the most fashionable city of the time: Miami. The series was distinguished from any other by the introduction of characters dressed in a very elegant and colorful way and by the excessive use of popular songs of the period within each episode.", "date": "2005-01-14", "grade": null}
