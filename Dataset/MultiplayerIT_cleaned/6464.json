The economic target to ensure the Wii U conversion comes well before the competition, which as things stand today will hardly ever host the title. It is not a given: once the collection of publisher royalties on sales and Kickstarter withholdings has been eliminated, there are not many mandatory expenditure items left, given that the development kits are often almost given away and the graphics engine in use - Unity , for a change - we already know its strengths and weaknesses in the field of console publishing. So why, after the PC, is Wii U the first platform chosen? Of course, the paying users of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are now so accustomed to receiving indies as a gift every month that the buying sentiment often changes in terms of expectation, moreover a rich and more inflated panorama of releases can easily check these quality small beads. Of all the answers we could provide, none are corroborated by numbers, so we'll just throw the stone in the pond. The only real data is the tangibility of this conversion: about ten months after its release on Steam, the eShop is enriched with a title that we liked at the time and which has earned the right to receive a separate discussion. albeit with dark spots. The indie The Fall finally arrives on Wii U: the product is there, the port a little less Gamepads In a word: off-screen play. With regard to GamePad support, Over The Moon's effort is the bare minimum to guarantee at least dignity to the port, unfortunately leaving touch management of points of interest within the game on the wish list. System errors We have already talked extensively about the entire narrative-artistic sector that revolves around The Fall. The canvas chosen by Over The Moon does not fail to interest thanks to the singularity of the protagonist, the ARID military suit, engaged in a rescue mission of her human host, injured in an elusive accident preceding the events. A choice that pleases, especially if placed in a dark sci-fi universe with grotesque hues that fully reflect a fabric of dialogues entrusted to cyborgs and machines. It must be said that the Canadians' proposal to date only includes the first part of the planned trilogy, so don't be surprised if the ending of the episode, although self-contained, is very open and cries out for a sequel. If the funding request for the Wii U and Linux versions differs by just $12,000 among a small team, it means that the time required for the port was relatively short. From a technical point of view, the result satisfies but not fully: although fluid and able to respond perfectly to the pad, we noticed a lack of optimization of some not too complex situations, with visible and inexplicable drops in frame rate to season here and there an otherwise smooth experience. Let's add to the list those we feel like noting as acoustic bugs in the finale: right at the moment of maximum tension, the climax is marred by sudden moments of total audio silence that leave us perplexed. The issues listed might seem minimal and nitpicky, but they weigh on what should at least be an experience clean of minor flaws. Zig Zag We conclude with a note on the speed of re-entry into the game: death will come knocking a few times, but on those occasions you will be able to witness a very long timescale, higher than what should be the legitimate expectation for software - in theory - as light as The Fall . But it's time to leave the technicalities aside and talk a little about the adaptation itself; if you look at the image on the right, you will notice how the idea behind the Over The Moon work was centered on off-screen play and the guys took it to the end, guaranteeing the possibility of reaching the end credits entirely with the television off. Sadly, it's also the only real implementation, which is a bit strange: as an action-packed point-and-click adventure, The Fall is a title that could have made good use of the touch features of the GamePad, but nothing at all this has been entered. Backbone and analog controls require more than one session to digest and still remain a cut behind mouse management. Even the change between torch and weapon by pressing the right stick is not exactly a happy choice, but we let you discover it without taking away too much the pleasure of continuing in thatwhich remains a beautiful adventure, albeit short.", "date": "2015-03-24", "grade": "7.5"}
