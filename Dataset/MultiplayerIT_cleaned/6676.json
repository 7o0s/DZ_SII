Consoles and PCs removed from the equation, fans of this winter discipline are left with only tablets and smartphones as tools to experience the thrill of snowboarding on the snow in a virtual way: today we're talking about the work of Ratrod Studios, which definitely aims high with the qui present Snowboard Party. Like the big ones At first glance, Snowboard Party seems to have nothing to envy to the products that were very popular on consoles until a few years ago, at least from a strictly content point of view. In fact, the main menu allows you to try your hand at four distinct modes, starting with the inevitable Freestyle which provides nine different mountainous scenarios peppered with bumps, ramps, tracks and everything necessary to allow the player to get to the finish line with as many points as possible in the bag; Halfpipe is self-explanatory, offering three classic couloirs in which to show off your best tricks to reach your goal; then there is Big Air, another well-known name in the sector, a specialty whose aim is identical to the previous one but with the difference of presenting three slopes characterized by much higher jumps; the roundup ends with a streamlined and functional multiplayer section that allows you to go online and challenge human opponents in the context of the modes just described. To further enrich the picture of a truly complete package, the 11 selectable characters (characterized by well-differentiated and customizable skills and attributes in terms of clothing) and the variety of boards that can be equipped, each with its own design and behavior on track. Completing any event also allows you to obtain a quantity proportional to the performance of experience points, which can be spent to unlock new content or improve the skills of the various athletes. In short, Snowboard Party is not lacking in ambition, while always keeping in mind its nature as a mobile product and thus offering quick loading, easily navigable menus and competitions that take no more than a few minutes to complete. Snowboard Party tries to be a ~serious~ title but only partially succeeds As we have seen, Snowboard Party proves to be very competent in terms of the playful offer, but when we move into the realm of pure gameplay, the Ratrod title inevitably ends up colliding with the limitations of touch devices, finding itself forced to have to simplify the experience excessively playful. From a certain point of view this is also a good thing, given that the developers have been able to create a lean and comfortable control system: a virtual analog stick on the left of the screen therefore allows you to move the character, while a set of four buttons on the other side it is used to jump, perform a front or back grab and slide with a grind on rails and rails respectively. Going down the virtual slopes offered by the game is therefore as easy as drinking a glass of water, but the downside is that performing tricks soon turns out to be too trivial an activity, devoid of the complexity that should make this practice exciting to learn. Given the limited inputs, the list of evolutions is rather narrow, and we find ourselves always making the same moves, assisted in this sense by an all too condescending level of challenge, both as regards the management of the landings (the athlete is standing even if it touches the ground in inappropriate positions) and for the scoring system, which does not take into great consideration the indiscriminate repetition of tricks. The lack of an incentive to improve then collides with a progression model that requires the user large quantities of experience points to unlock all the game's contents, paving the way for a series of identical races made only to increase the own loot. Too bad that Snowboard Party sins in terms of bite, because technically the Ratrod title has all the right elements: graphically the game showcases large scenarios, convincing animations and a solid frame rate, and even the rock musical accompaniment appears extremely spot on.", "date": "2014-12-18", "grade": "7.5"}
