{"name": ".hack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hack_a.html", "text": "Beyond the video game We have said that the world of .hack extends beyond the video game and the OAV, with an animated series and a comic. Well, it's official that hack//SIGNS, the animated series that is part of the .hack project, will also be distributed in Italy from May by Terminal Video. The 26 installments of the series will be divided into seven DVDs which will be released in 2004, and will tell the misadventures, prior to the four volumes for PlayStation 2, of a gamer of The World, Tsubasa, who mysteriously can no longer quit the game. On the other hand, the distribution agreement for the .hack//LEGEND OF TWILIGHT comic is still under discussion, an announcement of which is still expected shortly, and which tells of the events following the videogame series. timeline Indeed, it is not too difficult to get confused with the world of .hack (which for linguistic reasons - the bloody dot - will from now on be written exactly as it is pronounced: dotHack), of which, in this case, this Infection is none other than a minimal part. Confused? Don't worry, let's go in order, and let's try to clarify our ideas a bit... Basically, dotHack is first of all a cartoon, created during the production (Japanese, of course) of the video game and launched at the same time as this and a novel, dotHack//AI Buster, which precedes the anime itself. However, the anime is chronologically prior to the events of Infection, and is titled dotHack//Sign. Sign is an animated series that in 26 episodes introduces the (cataclysmatic) events that will fully develop later on during the videogame series: the protagonist and the characters, however, are only relatively in common in the two productions, so much so that playing one or seeing the other and vice versa is totally accessory. At the end of Sign, the storyline of the four video games begins to unfold: it begins with Infection (Infection Expansion, in Japan), continues with Mutation (Malignant Mutation, in Japan), then it's the turn of Outbreak (Erosion Pollution, in Japan) and concludes with Quarantine (Absolute Encirclement, in Japan). The four volumes that make up the saga (launched three months apart each in Japan, with the expectation of a similar American distribution) each have a striking bonus: a very high quality DVD with an OAV from the dotHack//Liminality series. The four OAVs are, in order, In the Case of Minase Mai, In the Case of Aihara Yuki, In the Case of Toho Kyoko and, finally, Trismegistus. The events of dotHack-videogame and dotHack//Liminality, however, are unrelated, and share only the world (or The World or vice versa, a little patience and everything will become clear) and the phenomena that occur within it, allowing us to understand at best some obscure spots. Let's be precise: Bandai plans to launch another series of video games at the end of the videogame saga; and to make matters worse after dotHack-video game takes off dotHack//Tasogare no Udewa Densetsu (literally, The Legend of the Twilight Bracelet), nicknamed dotHack//Dusk, another animated series. Phew, is everything clear? C:>_kite Okay, let's get to this dotHack, then. The story has an ideal beginning in 2009, when the world's most famous video game is The World, an MMORPG. For the uninitiated, an MMORPG (acronym for Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) is a game that allows you to venture into persistent worlds managed by any computerized servers, playing the role of a particular character and interacting with alter egos (or avatar) of other human players. Any examples in real life? Ultima Online, Everquest, Final Fantasy XI, Dark Age of Camelot, Ragnarok Online; Phantasy Star Online isn't exactly an MMORPG but it still gives a good idea. In any case, the protagonist of dotHack-video game is a neo-player (newbie, in jargon) of The World, and his alter ego in the virtual world is Kite; now, like any self-respecting MMORPG gamer, Kite also has playmates, and one of these is the much more expert Orca who, knowing the ~real~ Kite in reality, convinced him to play The World with he. The story begins right during Kite's first adventure together with Orca: the two come across an unknown creature that ~kills~ Orca: the death of a virtual character happens often, so it's nothing serious, of course... if were it not that to begin with Orca is one of the most powerful and famous players on the network and, above all, at the same time, in the real world ~Orca~ falls into a coma. At that point, Kite realizes that the solution to the mystery of Orca's coma (which is actually calledYasuhiko) and the strange phenomena that are taking place in The World, resides in the game itself; his research, however, leads him to meet a mysterious girl, Aura, who gives him deadly powers, initially intended for Orca, called Gate Hacking and Data Drain (the same one that lobotomized his friend), linked to the mysterious Book of Twilight, indeed a heavy burden: to save The World and, by extension, the world! The plot of dotHack thus proceeds through the four volumes that complete the work, between breathtaking twists and the entry of new, bizarre characters who will increase the thickness of the plot, which after an apparent drop in tension in Mutation reaches summits of excellence in Outbreak and Quarantine, where the idea of being entangled in something truly terrible becomes increasingly disturbing and oppressive, thanks to the realistic nature of the meta-game structure prepared by Bandai... The Italian localization Edited by ~Massimo Reina~ The localization of the final product is more than good, with the translation into Italian of all the menus and all the written dialogues. It must be acknowledged that Atari has done an excellent job in this regard, adapting where necessary certain phrases to our way of expressing ourselves, let's say more Western, but trying in principle to keep intact the prerogatives of a title that sees us impersonate expressly a Japanese boy. It should also be noted the wise, in our opinion, choice not to translate the names of all the characters' skills, effectively eliminating the problem that often afflicts other similar products, which present improper translations and not very suitable for the element itself. As far as speech is concerned, however, no dubbing in our language (and here the purists of the genre not inclined to the ~total~ localization of J-RPGs will rejoice). In fact, the basic setting of the American version has been maintained which provides for the possibility for the user to select the voices of the characters in English or in Japanese, which, in our humble opinion, turns out to be the better of the two. Playing The World Premise: what will be explained in this paragraph will always be reductive, because there is so much to say about The World and dotHack that two reviews would not be enough. But let's try to do what we can. To begin with, once you start the game, it turns into a real computer desktop. It is possible to change the background and the music (the various possibilities will increase with the achievement of certain statistics during the game, recorded in the eight mystical Ryu Books) and on the left we can access actual directories which offer us News from the world (totally invented, but so well crafted - even accompanied by real-life photos - to be absolutely believable (Did you know that Bandai will launch the Wonderhawk in 2009?), an E-mail system and, of course, the executable that launches The World. Once The World has started, we find ourselves in the MMORPG menu, which also offers us a dedicated forum, strictly false: if you haven't guessed it yet, the game is already simulating an internet connection. On the forum we see the exchange of messages between players, which are also very useful for better understanding the game system of The World; however, the forum is not a cold manual within the game, as it is possible to find topics simply by chatting, all seasoned with emoticons that give each message and each user a personality. However, from this menu it is possible to access The World. And now we get into the game. The World is an MMORPG, this means that the camera, fully controllable (even positionable in a questionable first person) will frame our alter-ego (Kite) by default from behind within various settings, both cities and dungeons. Let's talk about the cities: limited and small (except for the large Fort Ouph), they have a certain number of shops where you can make purchases of all kinds, as well as a save point and a personal deposit. Being cities, however, it is assumed that they are populated ... and so it is, in fact: dozens of players run and wander around the environment, occasionally stopping to shop. It is possible to interact with them, by talking to them (and one is surprised by the amount of jokes and dialogues that Bandai has prepared) or by exchanging objects: in the latter case, the exchanges take place in a very original way. Before explaining how, it is necessary to open a parenthesis: the classes. As in any MMORPG, even in The World there are game classes. Kite, no choice or variestion, is a Twinblade, a sort of warrior specialized in the use of knives and magic, very agile and fast. Then there are the Blademasters, the warriors/wizards. Heavyswordsman and Heavyaxeman are, of course, pure warriors: the former are clearly faster and less resistant than the latter. Finally, there are the Wavemasters, i.e. the wizards, slender but with boundless magical powers. Closed parenthesis, let's go back to trade: if we decide to trade an object with a Wavemaster, we must consider that an item dedicated to another class, such as a sword or heavy armor, will not be useful in any way. The AI, in fact, evaluates the usefulness of the proposed items and their value, so sometimes only one item is enough to make an exchange, other times, however, it is necessary to bleed to get your hands on an item or a piece of equipment . Obviously, objects are procured in dungeons, and here we are going to talk about the Gates: in essence, the player can assemble a maximum of three keywords, selecting them from a list, to generate the location he will want to visit. These keywords are indicative of the type of environment, its difficulty (ie the power of the enemies) and the natural element connected to it (in dotHack there are six: fire, water, earth, wood, lightning and darkness); as you progress in the game, it is possible to obtain keywords both from the forum of The World and by talking to the various players, and sometimes we are directly provided with the ~addresses~ of some locations to continue in the plot. This system offers a high degree of customization and control over the game, as it is possible to decide practically everything on the next dungeon we want to face without following the plot, but in the same way it limits its variety, given that the dungeons and environments, having matrixes common, they all tend to look a bit alike. Anyway... to explore a dungeon, a player needs a party to make his life easier, don't you think? And this is where our supporting actors come into play. dotHack makes available to the player, as the plot progresses, a great variety of characters, some necessary for the purposes of the script, others accessories and recoverable by solving subquests. Once you have obtained the Email of one of these characters, every time you connect to The World you can contact them and invite them to your party, forming a team of up to three characters (including Kite). At this point, if you are in the city, our small group will disassemble and our companions will go shopping on their own (and they really do it, stocking up on healing items and anything else that may come in handy!); if, on the other hand, you are in a dungeon, the two supporting characters will simply follow us in the exploration, until you enter combat. The clashes, moreover, are not random, but pre-set in certain points of a dungeon and fully visible: once they get too close, the enemies attack the group and you enter combat mode. In this phase, the player has full control over Kite, and the fight develops in real-time: by pressing the X key, it is possible to hit the enemy with physical attacks; by pressing Triangle, however, you have access to your own menu of skills and spells: the skills, in fact, are connected to the equipment, and once you have selected a spell or a special attack (the latter are linked exclusively to weapons), just select a visible target to unleash our primal instincts on it (provided you have the necessary Skill Points to execute it, of course, but which are recharged simply by walking) and if the elemental properties of the attack are opposite to those of the enemy, then an Elemental Hit will occur, i.e. double damage. During the fight, our companions are controlled by the console's prodigious AI, which directs their blows and uses their skills with precision and wit, really giving the impression of being connected to the network and playing with human beings; in any case, by pressing the Square key, it is possible to call up a menu that allows you to order the characters general combat tactics (attack with skills, heal and so on) and or to use a certain magic, skill or item. Let's spend another word on the characters and their characterization. Leaving aside the fact that it is possible to alter the affinity between Kite and his companions and their relationship by making gifts or responding in a certain way to the E-mails that are promptly sent to us, it must be said that Bandai has made a commendable documentation effort to create characters as close as possible", "date": "2004-03-29", "grade": null}
