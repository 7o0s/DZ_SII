{"name": "Football Manager Live - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/football-manager-live-recensione.html", "text": "The Football Manager brand has now become a real institution in the field of football management, to the point of not suffering in the slightest from the abandonment of the Championship Manager intellectual property by the developers of Sports Interactive which passed into the hands of the old publisher Eidos. But this is a well-known story, given that this year too we found ourselves singing the praises of Football Manager 2009, but now finding ourselves doubling the appointment with the Trapattoni in us thanks to Football Manager Live, the first real attempt by SIGames to also break through in the world of massive online games, as we will see by also sketching an attempt at a role-playing approach to the figure of the coach. To tell the truth, to say that FM has always had only a single component is an inaccuracy, given that as many fans will know, the game has always given the possibility to so many coaches to get together in a single game server to start a game , each controlling a different team and facing each other with the CPU or with each other on the occasion of direct clashes, offering a degree of involvement (and at times addiction) at absolutely high levels. The guys from SIGames have understood the situation well by churning out a completely online title, an evolution of the multiplayer component just mentioned where everyone can play against everyone, thus creating a completely persistent football world on the Internet, comparable even as we will see without forcing a real MMORPG . Season To give life to a game of FM Live, you need to create your own virtual alter-ego in a similar way to what we have seen in the various FMs, and then choose the type of game you intend to undertake, based mainly on the amount and time windows that we plan to devote to our team during the week. For example, it is possible to take part in the night league, in which most of the matches are played when the rest of the players are sleeping, to choose to spend one's time on FM Live only during the weekend, or simply when it happens (with certain limits ). All for what reason? Simply said: the season is made up of a week of pre-season and three of real competition, in which you obviously have to clash with all the other players, a situation in which it was necessary to find a way to make the matches take place, which in our case absence will be managed by the game's artificial intelligence. But be careful, because leaving too many games in the hands of the CPU could result in penalties, depending on how severe the league you participate in is. Once you have chosen your location, you get to the heart of the game: alive so to speak since you have to set up a team completely from scratch by rummaging through the players without a contract, offering them a one-day trial engagement (always solar, therefore 24 real hours) or for the entire season, all without exceeding the initial budget imposed by the company. To meet the more casual players who don't want to go crazy sifting through the statistics, SIGames has well thought of inserting an automatic wizard to rely on to compose the squad, only to eventually modify it in case we don't like some element. Going forward with the game and earning some money according to the successes obtained, it becomes possible to try some purchases by launching the transfer system studied by the developers, very similar to an eBay auction where each player can insert a kind of announcement to sell his own footballer. letting the others contend for it by dint of counter-offers: nothing that comes close to the negotiation system seen in classic FM, but to go Live some choices had to be made and this seems to us the best possible. Coaching is a matter of role Adapting to the world of MMOs where RPGs dominate, SIGames had the brilliant idea of including a small RPG component also within FM Live, making the coach's skills practically acquireable through experience. During the creation of our virtual counterpart we find ourselves having to choose one of the available skills: for example, it will be possible to choose to be a talent scout, a maniac of tactics or democratically a bit of everything, and then carry out the training of the remaining skills a little at a time in the rest of the season, also progressing in the various levels, each one capable of opening up the coach in us to new features. The choice made by the developers also in this case turns out to be guessed and contrary to what one might think for nothing outi place, prompting players to do so as to improve their knowledge within the game. The real game starts from the preparation, within which there is the usual system of tactics and positioning of the players seen in FM, with the limitations imposed by the role-playing components of the game mentioned above. Taking a step back for a moment, we see ourselves involved in the decision of the time and day in which to play the match, compatibly with the rules of the league in which one has chosen to participate: once the appointment has been defined in the event of the absence of one of the two players the match will be played for him by the game's artificial intelligence. Once on the pitch we have the opportunity to change some things about our team on the run, including substitutions, or take some time to reflect by taking advantage of the timeouts available. No 3D Contrary to FM 2009, FM Live is not equipped with the 3D game engine introduced this year by SIGames but with a two-dimensional one in all respects similar to the one seen in past editions of the game, with the necessary modifications to ensure playing games online. For example, changing the speed of the simulation becomes a request to be made, which will only become effective when our opponent also wants the same thing. Same story for the sound that has never been and never will be one of the main prerogatives of a game like FM. The last note relates to the subscription to be paid to play FM Live: as we are now used to with MMOGs, it is available in different price and length formulas, with the possibility of choosing between 3 months, 6 months or a whole year , respectively at the price of 29, 56 and 93: on balance nothing prohibitive even in the quarterly solution which involves a cost of barely 10 per month. The client of the game, which cannot be as small as possible, can be downloaded directly from the official site www.footballmanagerlive.com for both PC and Mac, thus making the possibility of diving headlong into the world of FM Live even more immediate. Comment Football Manager Live is the natural evolution that a mature brand like that of Sports Interactive could not fail to achieve in the current state of technology, presenting itself as interesting above all for those who intend to spend most of their day there, given that despite its size it does not escape to the classic rule of titles via the Internet for which it is necessary to devote a lot of time to them to obtain significant results. The revision of the various areas of the game does not involve great losses in terms of charm, although some may find an (inevitable) decrease in depth in some of its aspects, counterbalanced by the introduction of new features such as stadium management: on balance SIGames has fully achieved its objective, without forgetting the support that the team has always offered to its fans and which can only further improve this little jewel, at least to try to define themselves as true fans of Football Manager.Pro Exciting challenges with real coaches Despite the changes it has not lost its charm Affordable even for the less experienced Against As usual, it's addictive High availability of time required PC - System Requirements Minimum requirements Processor: 1.6GHz RAM: 256MB for Windows XP, 512MB for Windows Vista Home Basic, 1GB for other editions of Windows Vista Video card: 1024x768 32bit display Hard Disk: 500 MB of free space Internet connection Test configuration Processor: AMD Athlon X2 3800+ RAM: 2GB Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 7900 GT Operating system: Windows XP SP3", "date": "2009-02-09", "grade": null}
