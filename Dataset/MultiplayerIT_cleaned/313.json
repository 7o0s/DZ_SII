{"name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shin-megami-tensei-digital-devil-saga.html", "text": "Hell of a tale!! It is difficult to summarize the plot of Digital Devil Saga without tripping over the easy spoiler, given that for a good half of the first episode it remains absolutely obscure and when the various points begin to be clarified, there are repeated twists. However, the protagonist of this saga is Serph, head of a clan, the Embryons, who fights in the decaying wasteland known as the ~Junkyard~ against five other clans in an endless war that is continuously stalled. Until one day, during a clash with the Vanguard clan, an organic entity makes its appearance which somehow contaminates those present, transforming them into horrid demonic creatures, so ferocious that they begin to tear each other apart. And it is the voice of a mysterious girl, Sera, who will bring the mutated protagonists back to their senses: at that point, essentially, Serph and his battlemates will have to face the other clans in a mortal battle for possession of Sera and access to the Nirvana, a utopian place comparable to paradise to say the least. The problem is that absolutely nothing is what it seems in this story of blood, death and hope. If the plot is already impactful, with its visual and narrative violence, a truly grotesque taste for the horrid and an abundant ton of philosophical and theological quotations, the same can be said of the protagonists, anti-heroes rarely seen before. now in such a video game. Serph and his companions are not only eccentric from the point of view of character design (by Kazuma Kaneko) but also on a character and psychological level, and placed in this context and in this setting it is perhaps difficult to get used to but equally complicated not to appreciate them. noting their reactions to the mutation, decidedly different and realistic. Unfortunately, laying the foundations for the development of the complex plot, Digital Devil Saga lacks an almost necessary deepening of the various sub-plots and of the protagonists themselves, only vaguely outlined for a little too long: the narrative sequences act as an interlude to the very long dungeons , offering brilliant glimpses of the plot, but perhaps a little too rare and detached from each other, for a plot of this magnitude and quality. Digital Devil Saga leverages a not exactly traditional but highly enjoyable battle-system, based on a system of manipulable turns. Add a table place that there is one more demon... If the basic mechanics are very reminiscent of Final Fantasy (especially Final Fantasy X, of which Digital Devil Saga was practically a rival in Japan at its own launch)... the same could be said of the combat system. The immense dungeons are explored by directly controlling Serph, and between one puzzle and another one is - often unfortunately - involved in the classic random fights. Three characters on the battlefield against as many or more monsters, a command to attack, turns based on speed... anything new? Not really, in reality Digital Devil Saga leverages a battle-system that is not exactly traditional but highly enjoyable, based on a manipulable shift system: that is to say that if you perform the right actions according to the enemy you are facing (hitting him for example with a spell of the opposite element), it is possible to obtain an extra turn to attack or perform another action, building a chain which in the advanced stages of the adventure allows to annihilate all enemies in a handful of turns, sometimes without give them time to fight back. The quantity and variety of enemies and usable skills or spells allows you to experiment with many different offensive strategies, and in the end the high frequency of random fights does not even matter, considering that even the most common enemy can exploit the same system to manage their turns in order to reduce the player to meatballs: in short, strategy is the key to victory in every battle. If at the beginning this system is not used much due to the ease of the clashes, however, continuing in the game it becomes practically necessary to know how to master it with precision and cunning, in combination with another distinctive and well thought out element of Digital Devil Saga: the Mantra. Almost certainly inspired by the Sphere Grid of Final Fantasy X, the Mantra in Digital Devil Saga are basically the spells and abilities that each character can learn without any limits, buying them with the ~atma~ points earned in the fights: the better the performances, the more atma points you earn, and you can even devour your enemies to get even more. Obviously keeping an eye on the initial statistics of each character, such as elemental affinities, it is possible to build your own customized party in an even more customizable way than the aforementioned Sphere Grid allowed. It is neither necessary nor obligatory to transform Serph and associates into war machines to finish the game, but the most demanding players will have something to indulge themselves. Stylistic quirks Technically Digital Devil Saga looks like a product that doesn't show its almost three years old at all, thanks to a very high quality polygonal engine and a decidedly over the top attention to visual rendering. In particular, it is the style adopted that is striking for its darkness: the characters are almost grotesque, the demons into which the protagonists transform themselves are nothing short of repugnant, the whole world is decadent, decidedly post-apocalyptic, built in such a way as to make the idea of a desperate and violent environment. Almost everywhere, ideograms of theological origin, especially Indian and Eastern, catch the eye, and the visual mix between technology and spirituality is incredibly effective. On the other hand, the combat phases are graphically reminiscent of those of Final Fantasy X (him again!), only less spectacular and pyrotechnic, with some underlying graphic ingenuity. The cutscenes, on the other hand, are spectacular and have excellent direction. In short, the only graphic complaints we feel like making concern the free camera, sometimes unbearable, and perhaps precisely the fact that this noir and almost perverse style may not appeal to everyone, even if it should certainly be observed in the setting that Atlus has been able to build for it environment. The sound sector closes the canonical technical curtain: the musical tracks are discreet, mostly oriented towards a disturbing and dramatic trend, certainly to lower the player and the events even more in an occult and surreal atmosphere; the dubbing, on the other hand, is decidedly of a high standard, and most of the cutscenes deserve praise precisely for the intensity of the acting. Comment RPG enthusiasts talked about it a lot, now PAL market players can enjoy a PlayStation 2 title that would have been really criminal not to distribute in Europe: in addition to the grotesque style and the strong colors of the narration, Digital Devil Saga strikes above all for a very balanced game system that leverages exploration, customization and strategy. The battle-system is extremely valid, and the very high frequency of random fights is almost not felt. It is a pity that the subdivision of Digital Devil Saga into two episodes has dampened the plot, and this first chapter ends right on the most beautiful, leaving the player with many questions about the fate of the protagonists and the many truths that can only be guessed in the approximately thirty hours of gameplay needed to complete it. A must-buy for all fans of the genre, especially if you can come to terms with the visual extravaganzas and the depth of the plot. Pros: Excellent and original plot and characters Very good combat and customization system Graphically of excellent quality Cons: Inaccurate camera Difficulty at times not exactly calibrated The style may not appeal to everyone The Shin Megami Tensei saga until some time ago was completely unknown to the average Western gamer: for years it was in fact produced and distributed only in Japan, without ever leaving the Rising Sun for many reasons, such as the particularity of the product, the topics covered of the game system. The series has never had a real identity in terms of gameplay, often changing its characteristics according to the fashions of the moment, the host console and the target audience. Last year we were finally able to play the European version of Lucifer's Call and now, with a terrible delay compared to the American edition, we have Digital Devil Saga in our hands. Unlike Lucifer's Call, however, Digital Devil Saga not only offers a more classic approach to the RPG genre while retaining a number of noteworthy original elements, but it is also the first episode of a bilogy: later this year, in fact, Digital Devil Saga 2 will be released, which will conclude the story that began with this episode, perfecting almost every feature. But time to time: let's talk about this first chapter now.", "date": "2006-10-26", "grade": null}
