{"name": "Tchia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tchia-recensione.html", "text": "~Terre de parole, terre de partage~: ~land of the word, land of sharing~. This is the motto of New Caledonia, the French overseas collectivity and place of origin of the co-founders of Awaceb. It is an archipelago out of the ordinary, endowed with an astonishing biodiversity - many of the species that make up its flora and fauna are endemic, i.e. found only in that region - which separated from the supercontinent Gondwana about 85 million years ago. Since then, evolution has followed different paths than those of the rest of the world, and even today the islands of New Caledonia are a destination for scholars and scientists, as well as initiatives aimed at protecting the very particular forms of life that live in the archipelago We can say that Tchia also has a very similar goal: that of spreading knowledge of the culture, landscapes and human and non-human animals that populate New Caledonia. The barrier between animal species in Tchia is broken down by the mechanics of the Soul Leap, characteristic of the protagonist, a girl who discovers that she has magical powers that allow her to ~possess~ animals and objects found on islands and in the ocean . This allows you to always adopt new solutions for movement in this not very vast, but certainly varied open world, creating a lively sandbox system that proves to be very stimulating, even if not without flaws. We tell you about this adventure in a tropical open world in our Tchia review. A very special archipelago Freedom to explore is the salient feature of Tchia, and wandering around the archipelago is always pleasant and stimulating Starting Tchia, the player is greeted by a note from the developers explaining where New Caledonia is, the native land of the co-founders of Awaceb, who developed the video game as ~a sort of love letter addressed to this special place~ . Not surprisingly, images of the team's trip to New Caledonia are shown in the end credits: the developers met Tchia's musicians and voice actors, local people who gave voice and soul to the characters and their adventures, and explored the beaches, the coral reef, the forests of the archipelago. Regarding dubbing, Awaceb's preliminary note explains the choice to do it only in Drehu (one of the languages spoken by the indigenous people of New Caledonia) and French, the national language: it is a direction taken for cultural reasons, and we can say that, also thanks to the excellent subtitles and the Italian translation, we fully appreciated and understood this decision, supported by the excellent performance of the entire cast. The same goes for the island's musicians and choirs: Tchia's adventure is punctuated with moments of intense emotion, expressed in traditional songs and motifs, often performed in groups. The possibility of participating by playing the ukulele, but also castanets and dry fern leaves, is very welcome, even if completely optional. In fact, if you want to live in the moment without thinking about keeping time, you can press a special button, relax and not worry about the musical performance. The developer note concludes by stating that Tchia is a fictional game, and many names and cultural details have been changed out of respect. Fortunately, this is not the case with the forms of animal and vegetable life that can be admired in the Awaceb archipelago, inspired not only by the islands of New Caledonia, but also - and above all - by the living beings who inhabit them, above and below the surface of the ocean. As we mentioned at the beginning, the most characteristic power of Tchia is that of the Leap of the Soul, which allows the girl to take control of animals and objects. Many animals are endowed with particular abilities: for example, the kagou (endemic bird of New Caledonia and unfortunately at risk of extinction) manages to bark like a dog; cats, on the other hand, are endowed with the ability to see in the dark. These features don't always have a significant impact on gameplay, but they certainly help create variety and opportunities to play the role of beings that usually go unnoticed. Olti Tchia's musical sections are very well constructed and the use of Soul Melodies, played on the ukulele, grants the protagonist special powers The adventure opens with the story of an old woman to a group of children: the woman tells the story of our Tchia, starting from the day her father Joxu gives her a slingshot and a glider with which to glide. These will be two fundamental tools in the path of the little girl, who lives moments of initial light-heartedness playing and singing with her father and with Tre, the friend whohe takes their supplies to Uma, the remote islet in the archipelago where Joxu and Tchia live. The spell is soon broken by the mysterious Pwi Dua, a sorcerer who, with the help of two animated mannequins made of fabric, kidnaps Tchia's father, with whom he seems to have had a past. Desperate, the girl discovers that she has the power to enter animals and objects: having possessed the machete brandished by the evil Pwi Dua, she wounds him in the face, only to be thrown into the sea by the enraged sorcerer. Waking up in Tre's camp, Tchia leaves the next morning in search of her father, crossing the ocean on the boat given to her by trusty Tre. Even in this excited context, one word is often repeated and stands out from the others, revealing itself as Tchia's real leitmotif: ~olti~, ~thank you~ in the Drehu language. Tchia is a story of gratitude and openness, of sharing (that ~partage~ mentioned in the New Caledonian motto) and of self-discovery. Awaceb often does not go deeply into the torments of Tchia and his supporting actors, affected several times in the adventure by losses and suffering, but outlines a simple plot, not without surprises, and capable of leading the player by the hand in what for the team is more important: the discovery of the values, landscapes, ecosystems of New Caledonia. In this sense, the goal can be said to be fully achieved: in all the ten hours necessary to complete the adventure - we specify that we have allowed ourselves more than one digression before the finale, after which the exploration can be resumed, in an elegant way justified from a narrative point of view - we have always been amazed by the setting and its colours, by the alternation of day and night, by the colored clouds that emerge behind the mountains of the islands. In other words, Tchia is a triumph of beauty and it is impossible not to be enraptured by the spell of the Awaceb archipelago, also thanks to the particular mechanics put in place by the developers to ensure lively and participatory exploration. As the kagou Tchia can possess all the animals that populate the island, as well as many objects: each provides unique opportunities for exploration and, in some cases, combat It is known that ocular heterochromia often indicates, in the videogame world, the presence of magical powers in our protagonist. Tchia has one brown eye and one green, and in the first few bars of the adventure we discover with her that the latter guarantees her the possibility of performing the Soul Leap, that is, taking control of objects or animals present nearby until the eyes are emptied. 'Soul Indicator. There are over thirty animals that Tchia can control: they range from birds (such as the aforementioned kagou or the highly intelligent New Caledonian crow), to reptiles (the giant gecko), to mammals (the flying fox), to fish (including the majestic Napoleon fish). To these are added numerous objects, from lamps to stones, in which Tchia can enter, moving in the environment and interacting with it and with enemies in various ways: by controlling an object you can aim and throw it, abandoning possession and then, if you want , once again taking control of it, performing spectacular aerobatics and covering great distances in a very short time. It is also possible to move by waving the tops of trees and palms and thus hovering around the islands, all brilliantly characterized, with the presence of varied biomes (mangroves, forests, meadows...).The Soul Gauge can be upgraded by facing the challenges of the Totem Shrines, whose doors can only be opened by carrying a totem pole carved in the required manner, and eating the Soul Fruits contained within them. It is one of the many activities that animate Tchia and which are based on the traditions of New Caledonia: we have already talked about the possibility of playing instruments such as the ukulele (our inseparable travel companion), but there are other occupations, such as balancing rocks, aimed at unlocking new melodies that grant Tchia special abilities. In this regard, we must note how the possibility of summoning birds thanks to our ukulele involves a very strong facilitation of exploration, undoubtedly simplified (and, in the case of enemy fortresses, trivialized) by the possibility of hovering in flight at any moment, except for a brief cooldown for the related ability. Tchia is inspired by the biomes and colors of New Caledonia, which here gets an absolutely unforgettable videogame representation A very strong choice made by Awaceb is not to indicate the position of Tchia on the map: the location (and movement at sea) of the boat is visible, but there is no marker that highlights the placeexactly where the protagonist is. The map can be called up at any time in the lower left part of the screen, or you can use the compass; by pressing a key, Tchia will make a short comment about the surroundings (for example ~the village of Tingeling is not far away~) and a rather large area will be circled on the map, to give us a rough indication of where we are. This system is confusing at first, but we loved it after a few hours of play: just keep the map open and look around to learn your way around, having fun identifying landmarks and places of interest. Powder fire The design of the Maanos and the fights with them are soon marked by a strong monotony There is no doubt: the weakest part of all Tchia is linked to the fights against the Maano, the enchanted cloth mannequins controlled by Pwi Dua who dot the archipelago with their camps and strongholds. The goal is always the same: to set them on fire using lanterns, pieces of wood or by assuming control of the Mwaken, ancient spirits who usually do not interact with humans, but who guarantee their unconditional support to Tchia, and who have the ability to throw explosive projectiles. Tchia acquires the ability to summon a Mwaken with one of the ukulele melodies, but the Mwaken's poor movement skills make it useful only in contexts of limited size. The adventure is divided into chapters, and at a certain point we find ourselves face three large Maano-held fortresses in rapid succession. It is probable that the different exploratory capacities guaranteed by the Leap of the Soul have generated a certain confusion and difficulty in the design of the structures in Awaceb, which are developed in a not very organic way, with large sections without tools to attack the Maano that will soon surround us from all sides. There are no real stealth options - although controlling a locust can be a great option to go relatively undetected - and with low stamina levels you can struggle to deal with the Maano hordes throwing their stuff at Tchia, threatening to suffocate her. These sections, if part of the main adventure, can be skipped with a special menu option, but it is certainly a shame to see how they were managed in an overall clumsy and unfunny way. Tchia can scale any surface: as in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, keep an eye on his stamina meter Destroying the heaps of fabrics from which the Maanos originate reveals chests that contain cosmetics for Tchia and for customizing the boat. The variety of shirts, dresses, skirts, armor, hairstyles and jewels with which to adorn Tchia is simply immense, and the chests can be found in various places in the game world, not only in the Maano camps; while not offering upgrades, they are still an addition capable of inviting careful exploration of the game world, above and below the blue ocean of this videogame New Caledonia, which takes more or less twenty hours to reveal all its secrets to the player . Colors, sounds and magic of Tchia Day and night exploration is made more interesting by the infinite possibilities of Soul Leap Awaceb has been able to create a tropical setting that captures its beauty and playfulness, based as it is on quite realistic physics and truly stimulating sandbox mechanics, a bit like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Tchia stands out for the extraordinary colors of the archipelago: the very intense pink of sunrises and sunsets, the blue of the sky at noon, the emerald-colored ocean and the iridescent coral reefs that lie beneath its surface. In our test, we have observed the occasional pop-up phenomena of trees, animals and non-player characters in the setting, but nothing too intrusive or capable of affecting our immersion in the game world. Other small bugs were fixed in the launch update, but not everything has been fixed and hopefully the next few weeks will be resolved. Tchia's soundtrack is mostly diegetic and based on the sounds of New Caledonian birds and other animals; in some cases songs inspired by the traditional sounds of the archipelago come into play to enhance the salient moments of the exploration. Overall, we really appreciated Tchia's soundtrack for its variety and above all for its ability to amplify the emotional aspects of the story, which often touches on very delicate topics.", "date": "2023-03-20", "grade": "8.0"}
