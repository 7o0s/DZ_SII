{"name": "Beyond Good & Evil", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beyond-good-evil_a.html", "text": "Assault photojournalist. Jade and Pey'j, an anthropomorphic pig, live in a lighthouse that houses a community of orphans. They look after them and help them grow, defending them, when they can, from a world in constant conflict between the creatures called DomZ and the Alpha teams, the police force of the planet Hillys, who always seem to arrive an instant too late on the place of need. Jade works as a photojournalist for a living and is in charge of collecting snapshots of all life forms on the planet on behalf of a scientist, who wants to catalog them. But our heroine is also a curious and heartfelt girl, who will find herself involved in an intriguing story, made up of genetic manipulations, the sinister confusion between good and evil and the evolution of affections and personalities of characters to whom it is impossible don't get attached. A mature story, narrated with excellent style, which however only wants to entertain without lessons to be imparted and does so with the goodness of the design and animations that have made the fortune of this team of programmers. This time the imprint becomes more adult and the result is remarkable, freeing Michel Ancel and his friends from Rayman, a mascot as famous as it is cumbersome, and giving him infinite possibilities for the future as well. The donut hole is not perfect, in about fifteen hours it is possible to see every corner of the planet, finishing the game, and some of the ideas, which its structure would have allowed, remain just mentioned. The living world and the population that reacts to Jade's exploits, getting dragged into the revolt, help to recreate a first-rate general feeling, but surely there would have been room to create a truly unique work. The evolution of the game, apart from a few sub-quests, is a bit too linear and the idea of a completely free world available to the most curious remains only hinted at, while remaining the goodness of a narrative and cosmetic complex that involves throughout the duration of the game. Dynamic duo BG&E is an action adventure in which combat and stealth sessions alternate with puzzle solving and those where you will be called upon to pilot vehicles, initially a hovercraft, to explore the different locations on the planet. In dungeons there will always be two ways to solve adversity, a noisier one and a more painless, but dangerous one, which consists in overcoming guards and various creatures hidden in the shadows. There are no visibility indicators, a la Splinter Cell, but only the common sense to understand, aided by an always functional camera, in which direction the opponents are oriented so as to be able to overcome them unnoticed. These parts are sometimes predominant and those who don't like the genre may turn up their noses, but honestly it's hard to imagine someone abandoning BG&E for so little. The heart of the game certainly remains the possibility of interacting with a second character who assists Jade during fights and explorations. If you need a hand to operate two switches at the same time, to press one remotely, to unhinge a grate that is too robust for Jade with a single button, the problem can be solved thanks to the skills of the various supporting actors who will support our heroine. During the clashes the AI that manages these digital helpers is very good and only in rare cases gives problems, forcing the player to retrace his steps in search of the companion stuck in some element of the seabed. The management interface of the duo during the fights is simple to manage, given that with a button you activate the special shots of the other character, thanks to which spectacular and effective combos are created, and with another you feed him making him the power. The interaction between the two, in reality, ends in these few elements, since you will have to eliminate the enemies substantially by yourself, once you realize that your partner does nothing but get caught by the opponents and ask for help, not eliminating even one on his behalf. A further note of merit must be assigned to the camera, which during the fights switches to a third-person view slightly raised on Jade's head and which never loses the focus of the action. Gamecube version The Gamecube version of Beyond Good and Evil is substantially around the levels of the one for the Microsoft console. On the contrary, compared to Ps2 the differences are undoubtedly more marked, obviously in favor of Nintendo: extremely cleaner textures, markedly greater fluidity, clear reduction in slowdowns, faster loading, greater level of detailare the fundamental features that distinguish the two versions. Having the possibility to choose therefore, the almost identical Xbox and Gamecube editions are undoubtedly preferable, with on the contrary the one for the Sony monolith significantly less refined and enjoyable from a technical point of view. Andrea ~Sano~ Palmisano Hillys Dawn Beyond Good & Evil represents, as mentioned, the evolution of the style of Michel Ancel's team towards more adult registers, seasoned with the usual attention to character modeling, the quality of textures and animations. The result is truly remarkable and the Ubi Soft title should be marked as one of the best achievements of the perfect marriage between game and animated film that the video game industry has always been chasing. The lights that illuminate the interiors of the houses and the surface of the planet are beautiful, constantly changing between day and night, and with an original and effective rendering of the aquatic element. The frame rate boldly pushes towards the constant 60 fps and the uncertainties are as rare as they are negligible. What really makes the difference, and it should be emphasized, is the goodness of the animations and emotions that pass over the faces of the protagonists, which help create a truly curious emotional bond with the characters in this story. The dubbing in Italian, among the best of recent times, and a soundtrack literally sewn on complete an excellent cosmetic and audio picture in every part. Comment In video games there are stories written to give a vague sense to the alternating pressure of the keys of a joypad and those born to be played to the end. Beyond Good & Evil is one of these and you will not be able to get rid of Michel Ancel's creature before having lived it as much as possible. The only regret will be having to say goodbye too soon, given its relative brevity, and the impression is that part of the ideas that swarmed in the French game designer's mind have remained in the land of dead lines that wait for no one. After its debut on PlayStation 2, Jade arrives on Xbox in its best form and at the same incredible price, which makes the purchase of one of the most beautiful games of the last year highly recommended, especially on the Microsoft console, in whose line up is the master among the productions of this type. The above-average Italian dubbing and a design that brings the unmistakable style of Rayman's creators into the adult realm will put you in the middle of an interactive animated film that could almost have been perfect. Pros: An intriguing and engaging story A charismatic protagonist Excellent graphics Cons: Too short A bit linear in evolution During the last E3 in Los Angeles, we had the good fortune to speak with Michel Ancel, creator of the well-known Rayman, and to hear him talk about the birth of Beyond Good & Evil. In the words of the French game designer there was a vast world, fully explorable and full of secrets; there was a story full of intrigues, reflections and conspiracies, characters to become attached to and gameplay to remember. After almost a year, the Xbox version has finally come out and the passion of the team of French programmers has given life to this title which, if on the one hand fails to act as a touchstone for any of the genres to which it refers, from 'altra is one of the most enjoyable and well packaged games of the last year.", "date": "2004-03-02", "grade": null}
