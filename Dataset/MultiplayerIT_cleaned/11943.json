{"name": "World Rally Championship Mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-rally-championship-mobile.html", "text": "The WRC brand arrives on mobile for the first time after the notable successes of the public and critics of the three products for PS2 developed by Evolution Studios, as mentioned with the firm intention of giving the user something more than the usual arcade than with real rallying and just has very little to do. This setting is already evident from the design of the menus, created on the basis of the minimal and ~professional~ one already seen on the Sony console. In addition to a couple of secondary options, WRC Mobile features the two main modes Arcade and Championship, which differ in some basic elements. In the first, races are carried out in sequence against three opponents, with the obvious aim of crossing the finish line in first position; in the second, however (just like in reality), the various tracks must be tackled rigorously by fighting against the stopwatch, trying to get a better time than the other contenders and thus accumulating a greater number of points. The Championship mode differs from the Arcade mode also due to the presence of a car damage indicator (excessive parameters lead to the inevitable game over) and due to the fact that, at the end of each stage, the player receives a bonus which increases performance of your car: better grip, better acceleration and so on. Everything winds along eight tracks divided into typical rally locations: England, Norway, Mexico, Greece and company host different routes not only for setting but also for the characteristics of the track itself, which have a tangible influence on the behavior of the vehicle. Which, thanks to a wise decision by the developers, can be controlled easily with just the thumb: acceleration is in fact automatic, and all that remains is to manage the steering and press on the brake for the tightest curves. Despite this disarming simplicity, WRC's driving model is still convincing, thanks to responsive controls and the implementation of good physics routines. And it certainly doesn't hurt that the I-play product can also count on a remarkable graphic creation, kissed by a fluid and stable frame rate. The game is entirely 3D, and boasts quite elaborate polygonal models of cars and a fair amount - and quality - of elements of the scenario to surround the action. Of course, the Firemint work is not free from defects: WRC Mobile first of all lacks a rather narrow playful offer, with only two modes and eight tracks, numbers easily surpassed by other exponents of the genre. The sound is also to be rejected, limited to a techno-like musical accompaniment that immediately becomes boring and repetitive. PRO Simple and convincing control system Fun and more realistic than many others Good graphics AGAINST A bit low on content Sound to forget", "date": "2007-10-11", "grade": "S.V."}
