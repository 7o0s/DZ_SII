{"name": "Demon's Souls per PS5: recensione dell'atteso remake next-gen di Bluepoint Games", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/demons-souls-recensione.html", "text": "Writing the review of Demon's Souls in 2020 is quite alienating, not so much for the age of the work itself (and least of all for the disastrous connotation of a vintage like this), but for the very difficult work of modern contextualization of a title that changed the RPG landscape forever, effectively giving birth to a new sub-genre. Let's understand each other, Demon's Souls is not even considered a simple video game: it is a sort of miracle, born thanks to a perfect storm of factors that in the years of its development have allowed the good Hidetaka Miyazaki to have carte blanche. And Miyazaki, it should be emphasized, is a director to whom at that time leaving almost absolute decision-making freedom was an idea one step away from complete madness... but, faced with a project that practically failed in its initial role of ~response Asian to the Elder Scrolls~, the only solution to recover something was a new captain, and it didn't matter how reckless this was. So today we are here already fully aware of how From Software's bet has finally paid off (although giving life to a completely different title from their initial plans), offering us a gaming backbone. Only that it is not their work to be evaluated, but the talented Bluepoint Games, who have found themselves having to completely renovate this classic to make it a very atypical killer application for PlayStation 5. Given the evolution of the Souls between generations, it is more than ever essential to evaluate this remake not only for its brand new frame, but also for its ability to bear the weight of the years, especially considering the repeatedly reaffirmed will of the new team of don't go off the field. Introduction to pain The modernization of Demon's Souls in the form of a PS5 launch exclusive is a great opportunity to further expand the already impressive pool of soulslike fans. We've covered this elsewhere in the past, but the most striking feature of Miyazaki's original work was its ability to instill in players a modus operandi that was almost lost in those days: a direct and brutal approach to gameplay based on gradual learning and experimentation that most of the market had abandoned almost totally in favor of total accessibility and clarity of mechanics. The director's intent, it should be clarified, was not to create a difficult title, but something that would really surprise the players and lead them to discover every secret of the game world. In short, a video game capable of recapturing the feeling of the great classics in a completely new form, capable of being a topic of discussion in an era in which the sense of discovery had almost completely disappeared. This is not an easy philosophy to learn for those who have never strayed from the blockbuster market, and - as, moreover, too many testimonies demonstrated when Bloodborne appeared in the PlayStation Plus games list - it can be frighteningly frustrating for most, completely unaccustomed to games that require patience (a lot of patience), study of enemy patterns and the ability to orient yourself without any guidance. And Demon's, the prototype of what came later, does not go lightly when it comes to placing the player in front of concrete challenges and complex maps. Indeed, as an ~ancestor~ of souls it is crueler in certain elements, starting from the structuring of its maps, devoid of checkpoints in the form of bonfires of successors. However, the first bet has already been won right here, even if it was the easiest: the level design of the original - brought back without any distortion - remains of the highest quality, given that everything in Miyazaki's work had been calculated to allow sensible progression in the maps while deprived of saves here and there before the bosses. We are clearly not at the levels of finesse of the extraordinary interconnected map seen in Dark Souls, and there are some locations that are much less structurally brilliant than others, yet each area maintains a remarkable uniqueness, prompting us to discover every corner, elaborate every path, and open every possible shortcut to the inevitable final boss. Even the fairly free progress of the game has remained unchanged, with the Nexus acting as the main hub and all the other levels that can be tackled at will only after completing the first part of the Boletaria palace. This intro where the player is left to himself is an integral part of the charm of Demon's, and we are happy to see it intact, although it can create problems for many players due to the impossibility of powering up until the first boss is eliminated. Gameplay: classic, with uan extra gear Less deserving of a direct translation, however, was the gameplay. For heaven's sake, Demon's already possessed many of the characteristics that then conquered the modern souls fanbase, however if replayed now it shows the side in more elements, due to a limited dodge in four directions, a general woodiness of the clashes due to maneuvers narrower - no guard break kicks, jump attacks, or free-fall strikes here - and quite off balance. As far as the latter is concerned, we are certainly not saying that the others belonging to the genre are perfectly balanced (it would be crazy to think so), but From's subsequent works had dampened many of the flaws of their ancestor, limiting for example the overwhelming power of magic. Well, as far as the mechanics are concerned, there has been a more than worthy update, a pity that the same cannot be said of the mathematics that holds up the title. The dodging, to understand, is now free in all directions (while still remaining influenced by the weight of the equipment worn), and there has been a nice intervention on the animations, designed to make every movement more fluid and the fights more natural. Even the impacts seemed more controlled and precise, so we believe a fine job was done on certain hitboxes, but don't think that the interpenetrations have disappeared or that some ~curious~ phenomena related to the response of some weapons are now a rarity. On the other hand, those who adore mysticism and spells will be happy to know that starting Demon's Souls with a class with high magic and at least one offensive sorcery once again greatly facilitates the initial stages (as well as some of the more terrible late ones), remaining the most suitable for beginners who do not want to stay stuck in the various areas for too long. We also investigated whether some of the most used spells dealt damage that was decreased, however direct comparisons looked pretty much identical in most cases, so don't expect massive resistances to your soul beams from mobs and various bosses. The novelty that in any case really raises the experience is undoubtedly the performance mode at 60 FPS, which guarantees a worthy responsiveness to the commands, and practically by itself modernizes the game more than anything else. It is also possible to choose a cinematic mode that locks the frame rate at 30 and clearly improves particle effects and lighting (but no ray tracing), which in our opinion is not worth activating, and the developers themselves seem to advise against during a recent interview . Could more be done? Undoubtedly, yet Demon's remains a very remarkable experience even with such marginal modifications, a testament to the solidity of the original system. Changes yes. With the dropper Not that it's an easy thing, when you launch into a remake, to decide what to retouch and what not, and therefore Bluepoint's willingness to go easy on the remakes to avoid torches and pitchforks by the community of purists is more than justifiable. The team has effectively staked everything on a series of additions capable of improving the quality of life of the player, but has barely touched the fundamentals of the structure of the work, which anyone who remembers by heart can deal with in the same exact way with very few differences. Artificial intelligence, for example, is based on the original code, with all its limitations. No 360-degree attacks like those seen in Bloodborne or complex pathing capable of avoiding obstacles: here you will see enemies getting stuck in objects and throwing themselves without worries into bottomless pits for having performed a jump attack at the wrong time, exactly like 10 years ago. Such awkwardness does not spoil the experience - primarily due to the extreme aggressiveness of the opponents, their positioning, and their general danger - yet some of us would have liked to see some filings here and there. to keep the cunning of the enemies scarce, on the other hand we opted for some significant improvements to some of the worst-designed factors. The lizards, very annoying little creatures to eliminate and indispensable for obtaining important materials, have clearly been slowed down, and seem to respawn without having to eliminate bosses to make them reappear; during the creation of the character it is possible to select a starting ring which increases the drop percentage of some frighteningly rare objects (such as the Pure Bladestone, which often required hours of desperate farming); the weight limit of the items in the inventory (present only in Demon's) has been bypassed cofully allowing you to send excess ones directly to the chest; and even items and armor have been added that slightly increase the variety. Moreover, these are not forced extras, they are well calculated: the new armor has valid statistics but does not ~break~ the game, there is a new object that limits healing (clearly designed for PVP), and herbs now weigh much more to avoid that someone fills the inventory of the most effective ones becoming almost impossible to eliminate. On the other hand, the work done on various and possible glitches is less refined: some non-player characters sometimes become aggressive without being attacked (it happened to us a couple of times, but it rarely happened even in the original) and more than one bug seems to have remained , with lots of new additions. For example, we had to restart the game several times because at one point it no longer showed the collected items. If nothing else, many of the bugs that ~broke~ bosses and progression seem to have been limited or properly eliminated, such as the possibility of embedding the Flamelurker in his arena (eliminating it effortlessly) or that of multiplying objects. There was instead no way to experience the remake online for a very long time, but what we tested seemed stable, with no particular jumps either in the invasions or in the cooperative. The bosses' dilemma There are indeed other content gems capable of arousing interest: the Broken World and new features in the central statue of the Nexus, even if we expected something more from the first. In fact, this is a simple mirrored mode, which reverses left and right in the maps but does not seem to add differences in difficulty, so as to maintain the same progression of the basic campaign when activated. On the other hand, the possibility of modifying the appearance of one's alter ego in the main hub at will, by spending a few thousand souls, is highly appreciated. Overall, there was an almost religious respect for Miyazaki's little boy, leading Bluepoint to take no chances and even completely avoid the now strange 'sixth stone', a cut level that many hoped would appear in this remake. For heaven's sake, the team's desire not to create maps from scratch is justified: they are dealing with a much-loved title largely for the wickedness and intelligence of its maps, and a direct comparison would have been almost impossible to overcome without damage. While not hoping for a novelty of this magnitude, however, we find it was a mistake to keep the bosses completely unchanged, since they are undoubtedly the worst aged thing. The melancholic encounter with Astraea, the introduction of the Penetrator, and various other battles of the game remain undoubtedly iconic, and indeed their visual impact is even greater thanks to the orchestral music and the new technical sector; as far as gameplay is concerned, however, the same cannot be said, since at the time many of these clashes were experiments, rough sketches of what would arrive in subsequent souls, and proposing them now without variations means giving much easier bosses to the enthusiasts compared to what they are used to, or phases based on very simple mechanics with limited interactivity (the Dragon God above all). Too bad... additional patterns and a little more challenge (even maybe in a separate mode or only in the new game +) would have made this remake even more appreciable by those who already loved Demon's at launch. The most beautiful of souls? We could, to tell the truth, also discuss at length the management of the tendency: a changing state system of the explorable worlds in the game, often criticized for its variability (which can preclude some specific areas and objects). We, even in its imperfection, have always found it quite fascinating, and we approve of its maintenance. Moreover, the new interface is clearer thanks to the symbols that indicate the status of the various archstones more clearly than before, and this is a welcome change. ~Clarity~ also seems to be the team's watchword when it comes to graphics, since this remake is infinitely brighter than the original Demon's. In Miyazaki's work, darkness was the norm, so much so that it was very difficult to see certain platforms from a distance, or notice potentially deadly chasms. The remake, on the other hand, is crystal clear (although the dark tones of certain locations have been maintained) and you will hardly have to roll your eyes to find the right way. That's good: after all, it would have been a grave mistake to obscure so much goodness. The Bluepoints have in fact worked very hard in the technical field", "date": "2020-11-15", "grade": "8.8"}
