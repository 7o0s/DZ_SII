A reduction of the game for iPhone and iPod Touch could not be missing, the third chapter of a ~winning streak~ on the App Store which previously saw the dominance of the aforementioned Undercover and Shift. The structure of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit therefore takes up the one seen on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC, with a map on which events of various kinds are displayed: single chases, multiple chases and simple speed races. In this version, however, we only play the role of the policeman: to control the outlaw pilots you need to access the multiplayer mode, unfortunately only available locally. The modifications to the cars have also been eliminated, supplanted by an experience-based system, which sees us unlock new cars as we level up for a total of fifteen different models. The focus therefore shifts from upgrading one's own car to unlocking the fastest ones, which then allows us to try our hand again with the events that we have completed for the skin of our teeth, with the aim of obtaining the three stars or a fantastic performance . Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the ranking is also influenced by the simple ~quick races~ and not only by the challenges in the ~career~ mode. Chase H.Q. anyone? The dynamics that see us chasing a criminal and stopping his race by ramming his car are not very original and are found in the classic Chase H.Q. (Taito, 1988) their forerunner, however it is evident how they still manage to involve and entertain the player. In Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit the manhunt unfolds through four zones, for a total of twenty-four individual events which, as mentioned above, can present themselves as the pursuit of a single target or multiple targets, such as a simple speed racing with other police patrol cars or as a checkpoint based race. We can use three different aids to achieve our goal, which can be activated by pressing the relative icon at the bottom of the touch screen: order a checkpoint, release a trap for those who follow us or shoot an electric pulse. The first option often turns out to be ineffective, after all, the criminal just needs to stand in the middle of the road to pass unscathed, while perhaps we in tow will not be able to do the same. The trap, in this case a spiked strip (while the pilots have oil), is only used when the target is behind us, i.e. during speed runs. Finally, the electrical impulse can hit a car even at a distance and slow it down enough for us to hit it. To these elements is added the fundamental boost, which recharges over time and plays a leading role in the economy of the races. The control system is based by default on the accelerometer for steering, a solution which unfortunately did not seem precise enough to us (even by increasing its sensitivity to the maximum) and which requires a little practice to be mastered at its best. The acceleration is automatic and the brake is manual, while for the activation of the turbo and the drift it is necessary, respectively, to make a vertical slide with the finger on the right and on the left side of the screen. However, the drift is very complicated to obtain, and after a few unsuccessful attempts you will probably decide to do without it and wait for the boost to recharge itself instead of benefiting from the maneuver. Technically, Hot Pursuit looks like a cross between NFS Undercover and NFS Shift: better than the first, but in some ways worse than the second. The cars, although well made, do not astound for the level of detail while the scenarios are excellent in terms of quality and variety, but less rich in elements than the urban cross-sections of Shift.
