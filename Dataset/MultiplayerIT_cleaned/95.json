{"name": "Super Probotector", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-probotector.html", "text": "The Fair of ~Quotes~ The original protagonists of Contra were two soldiers very similar to the heroes of the 80s action movies, namely Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and they had to fight aliens of all shapes and sizes to free the planet from an invasion. In the European version of Contra 3, however, the two characters have been mysteriously replaced by robots... indeed very similar to the mechs seen in the Patlabor anime, which in the 90s was also quite fashionable in the USA. Apart from this change in graphics and in the title, which becomes ~Super Probotector~, the SNES game remains the same and represents an important chapter in the Konami saga. Playable in single or in pairs, this action game sees us driving a character capable of carrying two different weapons, which can possibly be collected along the way. The rest is pure shooting: you will find many aliens ready to kill you as well as a series of increasingly big and bad end-of-level bosses. To avoid enemy fire, it is absolutely necessary to master the jump and crouch timing, because Super Probotector is the kind of game that does not forgive mistakes: just take one hit to lose a life. The sections with a top view are very interesting, in which Mode 7 of the Super Nintendo is used to calculate zoom and various rotations: thanks to the back buttons we will be able to rotate the character and therefore direct its attack. In search of a lost vein To play Super Probotector on Wii you can use the GameCube controller, but the Classic Controller is highly recommended due to the layout of the controls (which is not customizable). Also in this case, we are faced with a product that at the beginning can displace due to its ruthless rules: one hit and it's over, even if it were the most tragic of current wargames. From this point of view, it is necessarily necessary to compromise with the control system and avoid making overly pretentious evolutions, on pain of inevitable frustration. Technically valid, equipped with an audio commentary that is not epochal but nonetheless of a certain quality, this new Virtual Console title should be taken into consideration by Contra nostalgics and by those who have the curiosity to try a chapter of the series, but in absolute terms it does not represent a essential purchase given the 800 Wii Points it costs. Among the series that have most characterized the history of Super Nintendo, Contra is certainly a leading name. It is in fact on this 16-bit console that the Konami-branded saga has given its best, making the best use of the technical capabilities available and inventing a genre of its own, which for simplicity we assume as that of the ~action game~. The saddest thing is that the series has not been able to enjoy an adequate transition to polygonal graphics, and therefore has effectively stopped at the time of 2D.", "date": "2007-02-13", "grade": null}
