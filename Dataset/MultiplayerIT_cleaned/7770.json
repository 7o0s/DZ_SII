{"name": "Knights of Pen & Paper +1 Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/120459-knights-of-pen-paper-1-edition-la-compagnia-del-dado-da-venti.html", "text": "Think how exotic a twenty-sided die can seem to someone who has never participated in a paper role-playing game in their life. For the others, on the other hand, it almost always brings back memories of endless afternoons and evenings, huddled with friends around a table impersonating clerics, wizards, thieves and warriors fighting against all sorts of enemies, from the lowest goblin to the sneaky mimic. All for the gold, experience points and glory that only a powerful weapon can give its owner. But above all for the sake of telling a story together with the narrator, that holy woman or holy man who wasted hours preparing an adventure for a group of players who, as soon as he saw a village, thought only of how to plunder it and set it on fire, munching on chips in moments of pathos, commenting on Sunday's goals during the game and in general playing a version of oneself who redeemed the frustrations of a not very exciting school life on innocent villagers. Think back to those moments, or try to imagine them, and then open your eyes to Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition, which puts us right in the shoes of players who, together with the narrator, are participating in a paper RPG session. A meta role-playing game therefore, because the players are also the characters of the adventure, and while playing them they make comments on the game itself, entering and exiting their role. This is the great find of Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition, which thus releases all its irony. Before choosing the classes of our characters we must in fact choose the type of player, which goes from the grandmother to the alien monster, passing through the daughter of the father, the metalhead, the younger brother and many other types that everyone has met in their life. These not only offer particular bonuses but also make irresistible comments typical of their way of being. Paris, the beauty of the school with an overflowing bank account, begins for example by saying that in life she has tried everything but never a nerd's game and during the game she rejoices when she pockets gold coins. Now imagine five different people interacting with jokes and comments on the game in progress, alternating with the painful considerations of the narrator, and you will understand how much fun it can be for a role-playing game enthusiast to relive those moments from the outside with a detached eye. many pleasant hours. The best aspect of Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition is all in the taste of seeing the wall of the room disappear, which gives way to the game environment, as if the image suggested by the narrator's words took shape in front of us , while non-player characters and enemies appear from time to time behind him. Only the table and the players remain on stage and, without many frills, their story begins in the Whatever Village. Knights of Pen & Paper has style and irony, but it has to gain experience if it wants to play among the greats Roll a die for initiative The +1 refers to the fact that this is a revised and expanded edition of the game previously released for iOS. After the success on mobile phones, the developers have decided to sell it on PC as well. However, the game is the same and, among other things, this version will also be released for iOS and Android. What immediately strikes you is the amount of content: resources are collected, there is a blacksmith, many extra classes to unlock, new people to invite to the table and above all very funny objects that do not concern the game world. In fact, we can buy drinks and snacks, new narrators with extravagant features, mascots, bizarre objects, carpets, game tables of different materials, furnishings for the room and much more. All these extras provide a particular bonus to the players and enrich the gaming experience. Of course then there are all the potions and items that exist only in the fictional world of the game, but those are classic and uninspired. It's just a pity that to accumulate enough gold to buy these extras we have to kill ourselves with grinding and this, in addition to being mortally boring, is also useless, because the game is very easy and you level up so quickly that you don't understand why we should forge ahead just to fill our pockets and then find ourselves faced with an adventure that is all too simple to overcome. It actually becomes clearer when we realize that Knights of Pen and Paper has a micro transaction system. Nothing bad per se - we ignored it nicely - but it reveals even more that this is an iOS App, a great App to be honest, but it loses a lot of its raison d'etre on PC. Indeed the micro transactions, the monotonous grinding and above all the casual nature of the combosttimenti are good for an occasional and fragmented use typical of the game with mobile phones. In that case detaching from WhatsApp to kill two monsters doesn't bother anyone. On the contrary, opening Steam, launching the game, giving up titles of a much different caliber, killing monsters in trivial battles and even spending real money is an unattractive prospect. Mind you though: if taken in small doses this game is still intriguing, but only for the sake of knowing what the players will say in front of yet another trip to the same city, or for the curiosity of making unlikely combinations of personalities sit together at the table. For the rest there are only enemies to kill. On the official website, the game promises to let us also take the place of the narrator, but this is half the truth. In reality we can only decide whether to follow missions with the star or travel in search of other types of missions. The difference? The ones with the star let us continue with the main story, the others don't, but in both cases we always and only have to kill monsters. Among other things, we decide how many we want to face all together, so as to choose the level of challenges for ourselves, which remains low anyway. On the other hand, the fluidity of the game and the variety of enemies and special objects makes all sessions under fifteen minutes tasty. In small doses, Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition always leaves a smile. If, on the other hand, you ask yourself how the fights are, it is easy to say. Each player has one passive and three active skills to spend experience points on. Battles take place in turns. When it's the turn of one of our players we can choose whether to stay defensive, attack with a skill or use an object. If the difficulty level were high there would be room for a lot of strategy, while we almost always got away with pressing the same buttons over and over again. Towards the end of the game we defeated enemies level thirty and above with an average level twenty-five group (Paris the bard joined later and was level 18 - you can tell she had to dry her hair first). Yet despite the flaws, we didn't regret our time with this game. Thanks to everything around us and which, in this case, is the real substance of the game. All thanks to the 90s? The graphic style of Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition immediately catches the eye, a retro riot of pixels that also make a good impression on the PC screen. The effect, for those who love this graphic style, is splendid. Monsters and characters are lovingly detailed and are happy to cause a smile. On the other hand, the developers have never made a secret of having been inspired by the electronic role-playing games of the 90s, a tribute that is also recognizable in the insistent music with the typical sounds of the time and in the old-school gameplay. But even more than the graphics can affect the hearts of the nerdest players and over the years the citation of the game, which makes us meet the ninja turtles in an underground sewer of the city or allows us to choose Yoda as an alternative narrator. And in perfect harmony with the scenography explode fireworks of irony that are the best aspect of the game. The unsettling jokes and the players' comments about themselves playing are always an excellent reason to pick up the game again which, even with all its limitations, also offers moments of healthy turn-based combat - you hit first, then I answer - like it was used once. If you have a mobile phone with iOS or Android there's no need to even talk about it: buy it for that format and add half a point to the vote. Otherwise evaluate if a brilliant distraction a few minutes a day can be worth it for you.", "date": "2013-06-27", "grade": "7.3"}
