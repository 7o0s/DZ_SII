This new Happy Street by Godzilab fits perfectly into this trend, differentiating itself from the others by presenting a look and a social component that could be said to be inherited from Animal Crossing. Far from being a mere Animal Crossing clone, Happy Street is a well-crafted free to play Linear expansionism As the title suggests, in Happy Street the user has to take care of a street, starting from absolutely nothing to fill it with houses, shops and obviously inhabitants: these are very sweet little animals suffering from a serious addiction from shopping that forces them to spend their entire existence spending money, to the full advantage of the player who can exploit this induced to build new structures and expand existing ones. These are just the foundations of a gameplay that - while faithfully remaining in the ranks of casual gaming as regards depth and difficulty - offers good fun, the intensity of which varies depending on whether or not you are willing to put your hand to the game. credit card. In fact, Happy Street belongs to the free to play category, thus being free to download but also characterized by a whole series of in-app purchases which - although not mandatory - make the expansion process much faster. The crux of the matter is made up of the so-called Flooz, purple gems essential for buying new building land and also useful for speeding up various aspects of gameplay deliberately made lengthy by the developers: accumulating them during construction can take a long time (although the procurement methods are quite varied), and therefore the temptation to buy the packages offered by the software can be irresistible, even if we must give credit to Godzilab for absolutely not exceeding with on-screen messages inciting us to do so. Above all, the developers have taken care to guarantee a minimum of activity even to those who do not want to spend real money to buy the Floozes: therefore, taken in these terms, Happy Street becomes a pleasant pastime to which frequent but brief moments can be dedicated during the course. of the day, enough to ensure that one's shops are stocked, that the inhabitants are happy and that the stocks of raw materials are satisfactory. Beyond the management aspect - however managed with skill and equipped with all the necessary elements such as bonuses, level-ups and so on - this is precisely the greatest strength of Godzilab production: every time you access the application there is something to do, whether it's the nice mini-games cleverly inserted by the developers or other small gestures that can steal only a few seconds but which still keep the contact with the game world alive. Which, moreover, is decidedly well characterized: the characters are nice and made with a captivating style, as are the buildings and the three settings available for the moment, all inserted in the context of a simple but still very colorful and always pleasant. The sound is also of a good standard, which can count on a couple of well-chosen music and the nice gibberish of the little animals. On the whole of such a positive picture, however, it is sad to note how the developers have not endowed their product with a more consistent rpg nuance which would certainly have benefited it: therefore, the quests that are provided by the characters soon turn out to be very repetitive , not to mention that there is no real interaction with the inhabitants of one's street, where an aspect like this would certainly have made the gameplay more interesting without weighing down the structure too much. Even the social component is just sketched, since it is only possible to exchange objects with friends of the Game Center and visit their agglomerations without being able to do much. Some small flaws also on the interface front, with windows that are not always clear, and on the control system, which did not appear very precise, especially when observing the scenario with the zoom set to minimum.", "date": "2012-08-07", "grade": "8.6"}
