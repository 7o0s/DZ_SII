However, the success of Steam in recent years has also allowed the arrival of products previously precluded from the world of gaming on PC, a change of course that allows us to get our hands on various goodies... The plot begins a few hours after the end of the FC, the completion of which is for this reason ~mandatory~ A bit of history In his native Japan, the Legend of Heroes saga has its roots even in the first half of the eighties, when Dragon Slayer was released, a precursor of action RPGs in Japanese sauce; from one of its ribs, in 1989, the epic of Legend of Heroes was created which was distinguished by a more tactical game system based on the timeless scheme of turn-based combat. Trails In The Sky is itself a subseries that consists of three games titled, very originally, First, Second and Third Chapters. The first saw the light in 2004 for Windows (but was only released in Japan) and was subsequently revised and corrected, a couple of years later, for porting to PSP; only in 2014 did it appear on Steam. The second was born in 2006 and was converted for the Sony portable console in 2007: the release we are testing is a direct descendant. If that weren't enough, know that an HD version was released for PlayStation 3 a couple of years ago, while on December 10 in Japan the so-called Evolution made its debut, destined for PlayStation Vita, with a renewed character design and high resolution graphics. definition. Finally, if you hope to be able to conclude the epics of Joshua and Estelle by putting your clutches on the third chapter, you will still have to remain dry-mouthed, because the ~release date~ on the Steam digital platform has not yet been communicated. Trails in the Sky SC will still require many hours with which to while away the wait even if, we say it immediately, although it is a stand-alone title and that it is conceptually playable even on its own, it loses a large part of its meaning without the predecessor, from which it inherits practically everything. Anime style After the usual (for Nihon Falcom) introductory sequence in perfect anime style, we return to the role of Estelle Bright who wakes up in her room after a night of which she only remembers a few frames: what she immediately realizes however is that at the At his side is no longer his beloved half-brother Joshua, who mysteriously escaped from the royal palace. Thus starts, exactly where we left off, the adventure of the Bracer, a guild in charge of preserving peace in the world. After more than an hour spent exclusively to understand the reasons why the male protagonist fled to hunt down the Ouroboros, members of a criminal organization, we can take the first steps only to discover that the nature of the game has remained essentially unchanged . The characters, unfortunately represented by two-dimensional sprites with a low level of detail, move robotically in three-dimensional worlds which in turn betray the weight of the years. Although even the highest resolutions are supported, the textures are very poor and washed out, as is the number of polygons which is clearly unsatisfactory for a title dated 2015. The skill of the designers takes care of making up for the technical deficiencies, with very inspired landscapes and in some situations even evocative thanks to certain ~heavenly~ locations and a remarkable variety of bestiary to be killed. That the technical work of XSEED, publisher of the Rising Sun software house, was limited (for the ~real~ one, refer to the box below) to the transfer of UMD data to Steam digital packages is unfortunately also betrayed by the control system: although it is theoretically possible to use the mistreated keyboard / mouse pair, the title is in fact usable only through a joypad. It could also have been an opportunity to fix some flaws such as the pedantic inventory, in which it is not easy to navigate nor above all to understand which objects are being equipped, or even improve the camera system which sometimes makes it bizarre to reach certain points, perhaps simply by adding a minimap, but as mentioned from a content point of view, the release does not differ from the one for PSP. We then move by exploring the huge and highly detailed kingdom of Liberl, following the evolution of the story that develops in ten chapters. There is no shortage of missionssecondary games and even mini-games that further extend the longevity of the title. A sad story between the lines XSEED commissioned little Carpe Fulgur with the task of localizing Trails in the Sky SC into English, after the same company had dealt with the translation of other Japanese productions such as Recettear and Chantelise. It took four years to make the abnormal amount of text of Legend of Heroes intelligible even to English speakers: we are talking about three million kanji, the Japanese ideograms. Such a job would have put anyone on the corner, but it was about to have grave consequences for Andrew Dice, the founder of Carpe Fulgur. Always afflicted by depressive symptoms, the good ~Space Drake~ found himself facing an apparently insurmountable obstacle: an email from XSEED dated February 2014 and addressed (for the first time) also to his friend and co-founder Robin Light-Will in which the publisher threatened the cancellation of the Second Chapter conversion. Thus, in March of the same year, after slipping a check with the company's share of the money under the partner's door, Andrew shut himself up in his Portland apartment and lay down on the bed, knife in hand, ready to end it. Luckily for him, a few moments before making the final gesture, the ringing of the bell interrupted him. It was Robin who had rushed to save him, having guessed his intentions. To Carpe Fulgur we owe the translation of Trails in the Sky: Second Chapter, but only 51% of the text had been implemented in the game, because XSEED stopped collaborating with the studio in the summer of last year. The remaining part of the work was completed by poor Jessica Chavez, a freelancer who had already taken care of the translation of the First Chapter and who spent six months of hell just to meet the impossible deadlines of the publisher who too optimistically announced the availability of the game for September 2014. The complete result speaks of over 716,000 words: just to make a comparison The Lord of the Rings trilogy has about 455,000 (in English). A practical term that also serves to give an idea of the material time required to complete the title. Japanese tradition The reflections elaborated up to now also apply to the combat system: positioned on an isometrically framed grid, the heroes have movement points that can be used to move or to attack. The magical crystals left by the monsters can be set in a bracelet, in a very similar way to what happens in Final Fantasy VII with matter, and there is also what in the Cloud Strife game is called Limit Break, i.e. a critical point which is reached by hitting (or being hit) and which unlocks particularly effective attacks. Another jewel that embellishes the combat system is given by the possibility of ~connecting~ the attack points of the heroes on the field (there can be a maximum of four) to deliver a single extremely effective blow. Too bad, however, that the level of challenge is not extremely high and that many clashes are able to be completed without particular use of gray matter. Unlike the Square Enix brand, in Nihon Falcom's one the enemies are visible and it is (almost) always possible to avoid clashes, just as escaping from an ongoing battle does not involve any penalty. These are very specific choices that betray a general approach devoted to reading the dialogues and exploring the world: from this point of view, Trails in the Sky has no rivals, given that almost every character, however irrelevant to the main plot , comes with its own story that deserves to be read and explored. However, the narrative structure, held up by the masterful characterization of the characters, takes several hours to fuel and ignite the spark of curiosity for the non-enthusiast, and the risk is that of being tempted to abandon the game before it has fully expressed its potential. The robust soundtrack created by an internal wing of the developer (the JDK group) comes in handy, which knows how to adapt well to different circumstances and avoids getting bored, despite the mathusalemmic longevity, thanks to the over forty tracks present.", "date": "2015-12-22", "grade": "8.0"}
