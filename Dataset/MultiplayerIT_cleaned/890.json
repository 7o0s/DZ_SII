{"name": "Ys: The Ark of Napishtim", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ys-the-ark-of-napishtim.html", "text": "The sixth episode of the series, ~The Ark of Napishtim~, is set in the world of Estreria, to be exact in the Canaan archipelago, a remote agglomeration of semi-unknown islets. The game picks up right where Ys V left off and sees as protagonist once again the likeable red-haired swordsman, Adol Christin, who, with his inseparable friend Dogi, finds himself involved in a new exciting adventure. Having embarked on board the pirate ship of their friend Terra and her father to escape capture by some soldiers who had surprised them in a tavern, the two cronies decide to head in the direction of the so-called ~Whirlpool of Canaan~, to steal the secrets and find new treasures. Unfortunately for them, however, once they arrive on the spot, the boat that hosts them on board is attacked by a ship of the Romun empire. During the ensuing battle, poor Adol is thrown into the sea by the recoil of a cannonball that hits the hull, and ends up being sucked into the huge marine Maelstrom. Our red-haired friend will be found days later passed out on the beach of an island by two sisters, Isha and Olha, belonging to a humanoid race called Rehda, whose appearance is characterized by long ears and the presence of a tail. The Rehda tribe bases its existence on an agricultural society that lives in perfect harmony with nature, away from the civilized world and human beings. The Rehda, in fact, fear men, whom they renamed ~Eresians~, due to the problems they had with some violent soldiers of the Romun Empire who had arrived on the island some time before through the vortex. Adol then has to earn the trust of the villagers and especially the local chief, Chief Ord. Even before finding a way back to his ~world~. Neverland... The game system of Ys VI does not differ from its predecessors at all: under the ~guide~ of Adol, you move around a not very large map, with a pseudo-isometric view, exploring areas that are certainly not huge, which however, given the structure of the game, do not compromise too much the degree of general interaction, in search of Items and quests to perform. Furthermore, as in the old Zelda titles, there are locations to be revisited several times as they need new special objects to allow Adol to reach initially inaccessible areas. And numerous dungeons. In The Ark of Napishtim they are the ones who dominate. In addition to allowing for some variety in the gameplay during the exploration phase, dungeons can in many cases offer some of the most enjoyable battles in the entire game. At the end of each of them, in fact, there is a level boss to face, and this phase, despite the limits imposed by the very structure of the Nihon Falcom title, which causes the enemies to attack according to predefined patterns, is characterized by a degree of difficulty and fun that shouldn't be underestimated. Obviously, as in any self-respecting old-school Action-RPG, even in Ys VI there are areas to overcome in perfect platform style, complete with jumps to the limit of the impossible or Alundra-style mini-games. In addition to the canonical battles. The battle system The first thing that immediately catches the eye once you enter the heart of the battle are the changes made by the programmers to the ~Battle System~, let's call it that, and to the control of the character during this phase. The old real-time combat system is almost the same as the original, but now Adol has a new approach to enemies. If in the past it was usually enough for our red-haired hero to simply go towards the opponents to deliver his sword blows, without pressing any button by the gamer, now it is the latter who decides which attacks to carry out by fiddling on the joypad. In this way, in addition to assuming more total control over the character, it is possible to deliver devastating blows to say the least. In fact, Ys VI has implemented a series of combos to be performed with the continuous or alternating pressure of the various controller keys. For example, by pressing the ~attack~ key immediately after the ~jump~ key, in fact, Adol can perform two types of aerial shots: if the attack is performed while the Pg is making the jump upwards, we will have an ~rotating~, while if it is performed after the leap (therefore in the descending phase, let's say so) we will have a downward ~cutting~ blow. Instead, by repeatedly pressing the ~attack~ button from the ground, it is possible to perform a sequence of three/five chained shots, depending on the elemental power of the sword in our possession. Growth of the lostnay In the game, in fact, there are three different types of swords, each of which is linked to a specific element that characterizes them (wind, lightning and fire), called ~Emelas Swords~. These weapons, in addition to allowing the execution of spectacular and effective magic, can be upgraded thanks to a level-up system which is based on the collection of the same elements that make up the swords on the battlefield. Each enemy killed leaves Emelas in place as well as other Items, and once the right amount of useful material has been recovered, it becomes possible to upgrade them. And this is another of the most interesting novelties of this sixth episode of the series. It goes without saying that depending on the enemy we are facing, a sword linked to a certain element can be more effective than another with different ~parameters~. The character growth system has remained unchanged. By defeating the enemies that you come across during the adventure, you get experience points that are useful for increasing your HP level as well as that of Attack and Defense. This last parameter can in turn be enhanced through the purchase of new armor and shields. subject to adequate availability of money, which can also be recovered from killed opponents. Graphic restyling As far as the technical aspect is concerned, nothing to complain about. Konami has done very well by perfectly recreating the style of the original while replacing some two-dimensional elements of the PC version. An example? Instead of the traditional 2D characters we now have polygonal models with a slightly more adult look but which nevertheless integrate well with the context in which they move. The result is a pleasant and very colorful graphic, as well as a sure visual impact within the limits allowed by the Old style which, as mentioned, characterizes Ys. The settings are very detailed and the two cities in the game are discreetly cared for in many details. The same thing can also be highlighted for Adol and associates (the artwork characterizing the various characters and appearing in the dialogue boxes is splendid), as well as for the enemies and bosses at the end of the dungeon. The audio sector fits perfectly, and Konami deserves credit for having listened, which is unfortunately very rare in this environment, to the requests of Ys fans, who are against any re-edition of the soundtrack. as initially proposed by the Metal Gear sofcto. who therefore decided to keep the original music of the PC version that had so fascinated Asian users with its very ~16 Bit~ tunes. Conversely, a voice dubbing was instead created for all the characters present in the game, including the secondary NPCs, obviously in English (there are only the texts of Italian in the game). Here we notice an excellent job done by the voice actors, really very good at carrying out their task, even if some accents created to highlight the belonging to different races of some PCs appear a little forced. Conclusions Ys: The Ark of Napishtim represents in some ways what Alundra was for Psx in its time: a breath of ~fresh air~ from the ... past. In an era where if a game does not have a three-dimensional engine that moves millions of polygons on the screen and a sophisticated gameplay, it is looked at askance by the masses, a title that focuses entirely on immediacy, on the spirit of ~fun without frills~ typical of many old 16Bit games, paradoxically it can't fail to turn out to be almost a pleasant novelty. Despite a plot that is certainly not complex or engaging (but is it or isn't it an Action-RPG?), and a longevity limited to only fifteen-eighteen hours of play, Ys VI manages to conquer the gamer thanks to a playability, such as said, simple and fun, and its characters all in all fairly characterized and very likeable. In short, the latest Konami production proves to be a pleasant variant to the ~usual~ sophisticated new generation 3D Rpg. Advised. Pros: Very fun to play. Very nice characters. Localization in Italian. The old style always has its charm. Cons: The old-style graphics may not appeal to everyone. Short lived. Ys has always been considered one of the best Action-Gdr sagas in the gaming field and can boast a huge circle of fans practically throughout Asia, where the title in question is considered an authentic ~guarantee~ brand almost like a FF, and in the USA. Born on PC way back in 1986, the series, with the conversion of the very first episode, Ancient Ys: Vanished Omens on the main consoles of the time (Nes, SEGA Master System and PC Engine), has grown year after year, enjoying ever greater success , moving from one platform to another up to the daysours and to this last chapter that we are about to review for the Ps2.", "date": "2005-07-05", "grade": null}
