What follows is the first, therefore each judgment remains partial and could also vary a lot with the release of the following chapters. Dreamfall Chapters picks up the story that was left unfinished many years ago at the end of Dreamfall, the sequel to The Longest Journey. And here a watershed opens: if you have played the previous adventures, a flow of emotions will probably warm your heart and you will immediately feel at home. If, on the other hand, you are among the newcomers, the complex world imagined by Ragnar Trnquist will appear difficult to decipher and you may wonder on more than one occasion what is happening, especially during the first two sections of the game. This is not serious, also because it adds mystery to a story already in itself imbued with magic and visionary connections between worlds. Dreamfall Chapters is in fact an atlas of stories that meet or coexist on different spatial and temporal levels, and it is normal not to immediately understand how it works. Fortunately, at one point in the game, a long diary is accessed which partially sheds light on the puzzle of past events. For now, it is enough for us to know that Zo Castillo is capable of traveling to dimensions inaccessible to mere mortals, and that her spirit is in one of those dimensions, while her body waits in a coma in a futuristic version of our world. Thus begins the story of the first book and our review. Dreamfall: Book One captivates us with its story, but the fragility of the game sometimes breaks the spell Nothing happens by chance The world of Dreamfall Chapters adjusts to our decisions. Compared to the model proposed by Telltale, the time factor is missing, which filled every choice with tension, but introduces a significant variant. By selecting one of the possible choices we can in fact listen to the reflections of the character regarding that decision. The result is that every choice offers valid reasons, made explicit by the interior monologue. From this point of view Dreamfall Chapters does nothing but exploit one of its strengths, the splendid writing of the dialogues, which make the hearts and minds of the characters speak with enviable finesse and naturalness. Unfortunately, at least in this first chapter, the weight of what is at stake behind every choice is not perceived. The game takes great pains to emphasize that our choices matter, both with visual effects and a summary screen that seems eager to reassure us about the future repercussions of our decisions, but the truth is that, at least for the moment, there are no major conflicts. And where there is no conflict, there is no tension. However, it may also be that the developers have deliberately created a long introduction to the game world and then explode the clash in the following chapters. For the moment we are left with the pleasant impression left by those sentences suspended in the minds of the characters and the desire to see them fight for what they believe in. Mixed emotions, therefore, such as those aroused by the contrast between narration and game system, which we will discuss in the next paragraph. Narrative tapestry In the first phase of the game we experience Zo's powers through a modern but somewhat cumbersome interface. We don't have much freedom of movement and the feeling of being in a Telltale adventure is strong, even if the similarities end in the following sections. After a few sensible puzzles, the Guardian tells us that we must return to our bodies, or things will turn ugly. It is difficult to feel emotionally involved in Zo's choice without having experienced her torments first, but the quality of the writing and the vagueness of the context are enough to stimulate our curiosity. However, we unexpectedly find ourselves in the role of Kian, locked in a cell and sentenced to death in a world called Arcadia, where magic is a common and accepted fact. Kian's escape, which takes place during a riot, highlights the limits of production. In fact, we have to walk flights of stairs with circular floors all equal to each other. A couple of puzzles slow down our ascent, but the solution is at hand. Once again it is the dialogues and the characterization of the characters that dominate our interest, and we almost wish that the game would not slow us down with futile requests. However, Kian's presence on the screen is fleeting, and after less than an hour we are back in Zo's shoes. This time however we find ourselves in Europolis, a typical cyberpunk metropolis populated by people who wander aimlessly through its streets, but with enough cultural diversity to make it a lively and inspiring place. With Europolis begins the longest and most articulated part of the game,the one that best showcases the qualities of the narrative. In this section we can appreciate the lively irony of the game, which manages to make even Shitbot, a ramshackle automaton, one of the most memorable characters of the first chapter. The story now alternates between two levels, that of daily details, with Zo having to buy food for her boyfriend and go to work, and the macroscopic one of political intrigue, with thriller tones that portend storms on the horizon. Again, the most satisfying moments are those of interaction with the characters. Between one meeting and another, however, we have to run from one part of the city to another to solve basic puzzles in which the most difficult passage is to find our way around the streets of Europolis, so much so that amusing talking signs have been placed here and there to help us find the right direction. Unfortunately, the desire to press a key and teleport to your destination is stronger than the pleasure of walking the streets of Europolis. At the end of the five hours of play, however, the complexity of the story, the melancholic atmosphere full of forebodings and the characters with a strong character, who oppose the forces of destiny despite their fragility, win over the superficiality and the sense of emptiness that convey the moments of exploration and puzzle solving. If in doubt, look forward to the next chapter.", "date": "2014-10-29", "grade": "7.3"}
