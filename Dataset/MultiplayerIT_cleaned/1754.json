{"name": "Mortal Kombat : Deadly Alliance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mortal-kombat-deadly-alliance_b.html", "text": "Mortal Kombat: the turning point What can an introductory film make you think where in the first three minutes the protagonist of a saga dies, in a not too dignified way which, despite never having reached the levels of the more famous ones, carries on almost ten years of history on its shoulders and four episodes and a disproportionate number of spin-offs ? Definitely a change of course, or rather a turning point. Liu-Kang greets us, but his companions of long battles will unite once again to oppose the deadly alliance between Shang Tsung and Quan-chi, always intent on enlarging the extent of their Outworld. Twenty-three selectable characters, old evergreen glories such as Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Johnny Cage, Sonia are joined by new entries such as Mavado, Kenshi, Frost and others whose identity we will not reveal to leave you the pleasure of discovery. But the turning point mentioned above is not reduced to the story-board, but rather to the entire realization. Are we really dealing with a Midway game? Strange to say, the answer is YES! Starting to play you can see how the developers have really achieved something commendable. The characters, not only their 3D models, the stages, the animations, the background on which the story develops, the extras present really make the idea of the hard work behind the creation of a video game. But let's go in order. A realization of the characters both conceptually and on paper (visible through the numerous extras) is accompanied by a truly remarkable 3D one: although not on the same levels as Virtua Fighter 4, the models have detailed textures with effects of absolute importance in a fighting game, such as bump mapping. However, small masterpieces such as Scorpion and Mavado are joined by others that are decidedly subdued, and this is perhaps one of the most obvious flaws of MK: DA: a fluctuating realization that ranges from semi-perfection to the most naive imperfection. The same goes for the backdrops, some truly evocative and seasoned with splendid effects such as reflections on the ice or water, pylons or shatterable columns; others, on the other hand, are frighteningly flat and bare, devoid of detail or noteworthy aspects. On the animations, truly impeccable, one can instead criticize the recycling of some moves between different characters, inexplicable in my opinion noting the variety of fighting styles included. The similarities are understandable, but the equalities really aren't. Which version to choose? PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube? Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance performs just fine on all three next generation consoles and can easily be taken as an example of a perfectly successful cross platform project. The differences between the three versions are nil from a playful point of view, the control system is always excellent and the extras unchanged, and minimal from a technical point of view. The polygonal detail and the fluidity of the game, the frame rate splits the sixtieth of a second, are identical on all three platforms, while a slight advantage goes to the GameCube and Xbox versions as regards image cleanliness, the quality of textures and graphic effects. Thanks to Dolby Digital support, positional audio cleaning is better on the Microsoft home console. Verdict If you want a slightly better technical sector, orient yourself towards the Xbox or GameCube versions. For the rest, the three editions are all on the same level. Deadly Styles The biggest innovation of this chapter lies precisely in the gameplay. Each character has three different fighting styles, two with bare hands and one with weapons. The styles can be switched between them at any time by pressing the L1 key, and range from the most common Karate, Aikido, Jeet Kune Do, Tai Chi up to getting lost in semi-unknown but truly fascinating styles such as Hapkido, Pi-Gua, Crab, Drunken Fist, for a total of over 50 different fighting techniques. This not only adds a lot of variety to the fights, but also a healthy dose of strategy, to the point that changing style implies a different approach to one's attacks and those of the opponent. To explain better let's examine the character of Scorpion. As a primary style he has Hapkido, which allows you to perform successions of fast attacks with punches that end with well-aimed kicks, often trying to send the opponent into the air in order to thus perform deadly juggles. We can then select the Pi-Gua, slow style, with a few connected shots, which however serve to confuse the opponent being very fast and sudden, as well as, what is really important, incredibly harmful. With a little masteryand by learning in which situation one or the other style is better, the player can make this yellow ninja a real war machine, thanks also to the lethal techniques associated with the use of his ninja sword. Also noteworthy is the fact of being able to use string combos that switch from one style to another automatically reaching a very high number of hits in succession (even 18 and counting): learning these techniques is not easy, but their complete mastery gives immense satisfaction to the player. The use of weapons differs significantly from the previous chapter and is closer to the mechanics of Soul Calibur. Their use brings with it advantages and disadvantages: you will hurt more and often you will increase the range of your attacks, but on the other hand you will suffer more damage. There are four keys to launch attacks: two for punches and two for kicks; to these are added the parry using R2, the change of style already mentioned with L1 and finally with the R1 key we will take advantage of additional moves. These may vary from character to character, but mostly they are: Taunt, Counter, Power-up, dodging and Impaler, a very bad move that sticks its weapon into the opponent's body for the whole round, with consequent loss of blood and energy continue in the unfortunate. Note the movement on the axes when pressing the directional pad up and down as in the Namco fighting game; to jump and crouch you will have to press in the diagonals. There is no shortage of Trademark moves from the series, such as Scorpion's harpoon, Sub-Zero's freezing ball, Kung Lao's blade hat, which are the icing on the cake for truly enjoyable gameplay. The now famous Fatalities conclude the whole thing, of an unheard-of wickedness, but in certain situations not very inspired: many can be identified as remakes of those already seen in the previous episodes, while others are completely new. Friendship, Animality are still absent, and finishing moves have been reduced to only one per character. Their technical realization is impressive once again, not so much for inspiration, but more for the effects and animations used, and their scenographic function is always very high. Secrets from the krypt The game modes are the canonical Arcade and Versus, to which is added the pleasant Konquest, a sort of guided tutorial to learn the basics of the game mechanics for each character. Not only that, as you progress you will obtain a variable number of Koins of different invoices (Gold, Ruby, Platinum etc ...), thanks to which you can open the tombs in the Krypt to thus unlock the many extras present. These extras include unlockable characters, new costumes, original artwork, an entire issue of an MK comic book, hilarious cutscenes, photos and new game modes. All elements that significantly increase the longevity of the title. Comment MK:DA turns out to be a very pleasant surprise. Immense playability, pure fun, seasoned with a respectable technical achievement and decidedly above average on more than one occasion: excellent graphics, textures and particle effects, fluid and realistic animations thanks to the use of motion-capture and professional actors. Definitely a breath of fresh air in the 128-bit fighting game panorama, which despite being defeated in various sectors by the cornerstones of the genre (graphically from Tekken 4 or Dead Or Alive 3, for gameplay depth from Virtua Fighter 4), will make players happy thanks to the particular setting, to the peculiar playability and variety. To top it all off a massive dose of extras and the healthy and homely violence that has always characterized this saga. Warmly recommended to every lover of the genre, also in recognition of the efforts made by the programmers to create this product, which I remind you ... is branded Midway. Pros: It's Mortal Kombat Excellent playability, deep and technical enough. Truckloads of Extras. Cons: It's still Mortal Kombat. Sporadic graphical inaccuracies. Some aspects could have been improved upon. With each release of a new chapter in the Midway fighting game saga, I believe that the majority of the public is pervaded by a double complementary sensation. On the one hand, exaltation and enthusiasm, which hides the intrinsic desire to be able to vent one's anger by ~really~ hurting one's virtual opponent, subjecting him to torture and death inflicted in the most disparate ways. On the other hand, the disappointment that pervades one is strong when thinking about the previous chapters, what they could have been technically, how they should have been conceptually ... at least until now.", "date": "2003-02-14", "grade": null}
