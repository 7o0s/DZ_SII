The success was such as to give birth to a new sub-genre called souls-like. Death's Gambit by the White Rabbit team, whose review you are reading, falls precisely into this ~category~ of video games. Indeed, to be honest, it seems to want to trace the spirit (and something more) of Miyazaki's works in a two-dimensional environment, to the point of paying homage to them right from the start with a series of ideas that seem to want to point out, if ever there were a need, the vicinity. Released on the market last year only in digital format, the game now arrives in a retail edition that offers no news whatsoever, if not all the updates released by the development team to eliminate various bugs, and we took the opportunity to review it. Arm in arm with Death Death's Gambit is a platformer with a strong RPG component whose protagonist is the tormented Sorun, brought back to life after having made a pact with Death, to complete a mission, that is to recover a relic for the Lady in black capable of giving immortality. Torn in the soul by the desire for revenge against the enemies who massacred him and his companions, and by the desire to atone for what for him is a ~fault~, being ~survived~ just to them, the man leaves to the city of Caer Siorai, where the artifact resides. But the journey is immediately fraught with enormous difficulties and more than once the brave Sorun will be forced to fall back into oblivion and return from the realm of the dead to resume his journey. In Death's Gambit, a bit like in the From Software titles, one dies easily, but not due to the mere cruelty of the developers, but due to the latter's willingness to push the player to think. In short, the combat must be approached paying particular attention to an infinite number of aspects, including the scenario, which in itself can be a valid ally to get to the bottom of the clash, but also a dangerous obstacle if it is exploited to one's advantage by the antagonists , which are certainly not stupid and each represent an obstacle that is far from easy to overcome. Especially the bosses, many of which are really huge, able to stand up to the protagonist at least until he finds a solution to the ~problem~, using the experience and tools acquired to improve, even if in this sense there is little variety in the 'equipment level weapons and armor. The title, in fact, punishes the inattentive player, the one who always makes the same mistakes, while rewarding those who have patience, those who ~study~ the paths, upgrades and behavioral routines of the enemies, with an eye on the life bar, which decreases very quickly, and the other to that of stamina, which is consumed with each attack. To tell the truth, there is a third one, that of the Energy of the Soul, which allows you to carry out special attacks largely linked to the weapon used, but that, if anything, should be sipped and exploited as it should be in the key moments of a clash with particular bosses. Class issue In any case, despite the difficulty of each fight, the player can count on a good control system and therefore on the good reactivity of the protagonist, who can sneak in all directions, crawl on the ground, jump and somersault. Naturally, the weight of each weapon supplied should not be underestimated, which has direct repercussions on Sorun's maneuverability and on each clash: choose whether to be slower but with heavy attacks, or vice versa fast to hit and flee several times, until exhaustion of the life bar of the nemesis on duty, it will depend a lot on how each user chooses to face the action and the class adopted for their character. The latter are seven, and each one offers different characteristics not only related to the initial distribution of stat values, to the equipped weapon or to particular skills, but also to the development of the character. He levels up by defeating enemies and spending collected items and points to improve his abilities. By killing the enemies scattered on the screen, for example, the protagonist obtains elements called Fragments, which are used to enhance one of the six basic stats, which range, as usual for the genre, from resistance to strength, up to vitality, dexterity, strength, and so on. These fragments must be spent dahead of the statues depicting Death, which in the game cover a function not unlike that of the bonfires in Dark Souls. Other similarities with the bivouacs of this series can be found in the Feathers of the legendary Phoenix, healing objects which, like the Estus Flasks, recharge at each checkpoint, and which are lost when the protagonist is killed. The dropped Feather can still be recovered by going back, as is done in Dark Souls with souls, or by paying a substantial sum in terms of fragments. Pixel art But given ~the costs~, nine times out of ten the best option becomes to risk and fight the revived enemies, redoing the path to recover the ~abandoned~ one on the field. Still on the subject of improvements related to the protagonist's performance, a series of active or passive skills can be unlocked within a talent tree made up of three growth branches which then develop allowing access to various new special features. In this case, the Talent Points that are obtained by defeating the Immortal Guardians of each end level are necessary. Others are unlocked instead by progressing in the game, and it is also possible to use particular objects to obtain temporary or long-term bonuses. In short, while not featuring a particularly complex progression system or many weapons, the character can be customized enough to obtain the combination that best suits the user's tastes and style. Closed the discourse relating to playability, let's take a look at the technical part. From this point of view Death's Gambit rests its foundations on an inspired artistic direction which at 1080p on PlayStation 4 offers extremely accurate pixel art-style graphics, capable of returning very evocative scenarios and with a discreet variety in the settings, just as large and nice to explore in search of secrets and upgrades. In the same way, the White Rabbit title has good interlude skits made of static screens that serve to tell some of the key passages of the story, and of the characters in line with the dark fantasy context of the game. But above all we have a bestiary that is certainly not original, given that it draws hands down on Western and Asian fantasy imaginary, but nonetheless quite fascinating. In this sense, the bosses at the end of the area are very successful, several of which are really huge and well designed. Finally, it should be noted that Death's Gambit is devoid of most of those freezes and glitches that had afflicted its first release, which took place digitally last year. This is thanks to the inclusion in the physical edition of all the patches released in the past months (the latest being the recent 1.08). Therefore the main flaws of the production are to be found in the precision of the blows, which are not always registered properly, creating many difficulties when executing a combo and finding yourself lend your side to an unexpected counterattack because the opponent has not ~heard~ them ~ everyone and had time to recover and react, and in the animations, which especially in some enemies are really reduced to the minimum wage, to the point of clashing within an artistic context, as written before, of all respect for his type. It goes better with the soundtrack, practically impeccable and which has nothing to envy for quality and epicness to other more famous fantasy productions. The tracks are pressing and well blended with the dynamic rhythm of the various levels, ready to underline each phase of the adventure.", "date": "2019-06-26", "grade": "7.5"}
