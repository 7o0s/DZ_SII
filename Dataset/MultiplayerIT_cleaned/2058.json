A game that catches the eye, as often happens for exponents of the genre, thanks to the care of the settings and above all to the animations of the protagonist, the owner Kaze. In the fourteen hours required to complete the game 100%, we took a real plunge into the 90s, smiling in the face of the bizarreness of both simple enemies and bosses, except for gnashing our enervated teeth when we soon realized that nice they just looked: for the rest, although not particularly demanding if played with the sole purpose of reaching the end (things get complicated if you are a perfectionist), it was an extremely pleasant adventure. We tell you about it in our review of Kaze and the Wild Masks. A tribute to the 90s The story behind Kaze's adventures is quite simple and falls within the narrative spectrum of most, if not all, of the platformers in circulation: the fearless bunny must free the Crystal Islands from the curse that afflicts them ... and that she herself helped to unleash. In short, she must make amends for having allowed her curiosity to get the better of her caution when she enters a temple attracted by the legend of a mysterious and powerful relic. Touching her has not only brought misery everywhere but it has also cost, in a sense, the life of his best friend Hogo, transformed into a spirit and forced inside a ring that Kaze wears in his ear. With these premises, we will go through twenty-seven levels (plus some bonuses) to repair the damage caused, making use of the power of the sages enclosed in those masks which are the main pivot of the game. We can do it in casual mode, with more lives and checkpoints available, or in original mode, recommended by the developers to enjoy the experience as it was designed: we wrote it, this last difficulty has some occasional complexity peaks and only if you insist on completing each level perfectly; if you play for the sake of simply getting to the end, without delving into the story or collecting the elements that will enrich the ending, the adventure is not only shorter but also much easier despite everything. Kaze and the Wild Masks: Kaze and Hogo find the mysterious relic If at the beginning Kaze and the Wild Masks may seem like any platformer, one of those that goes a little quiet beyond a very pleasant artistic direction, you will soon discover that it is a game in continuous growth. Once you have passed the initial levels useful for stretching your fingers and learning to familiarize yourself with the additional objectives, you will slowly come into contact with the infamous masks: each of these depicts a specific animal and allows Kaze to inherit its abilities for a short period of time. Similar to the Quantum Masks of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, these will tend to be available in specific situations within the levels but it is also possible, in rarer cases, to exploit them from start to finish: wearing them opens up new approaches and forces us to adapt our style of play to get the most out of their respective abilities. The diversity that distinguishes them from one another is in favor of the gameplay, adding further dynamism to what Kaze demonstrates step by step even without the use of particular powers. Of course, becoming one with the elements has its undeniable charm but the developers have also taken care of the phases in which Kaze has to rely only on herself and which, overall, make up the majority of the game. Beyond the jump and the turn, we can glide using its long ears, which also act as a handhold along the taut ropes, crash into the ground to hit enemies or increase the range of the rebound, grab the very few objects present (again thanks to the ears) and throw them to eliminate troublesome fruit or vegetables; all increasingly linked as we proceed until we reach that temple from which we were thrown away after freeing those who should have remained a prisoner. Kaze and the Wild Masks: wearing the mask of the dragon means surrendering to its fury Like any self-respecting platformer, there is no shortage of secrets and additional elements that will be the cross and delight of perfectionists: if you collect the golden letters that make up thename of Kaze or the gems requires a little mental flexibility in reading the individual levels and their structure, there are two bonus trials for each one to find and face to get the halves of gems which in the right amount will unlock a more challenging bonus level compared to those in the main story. These challenges, all timed, are the second prominent element after the masks because, despite their basic repetitiveness (kill enemies, collect gems or reach the end) they manage from time to time to rework the elements of the common levels for complicate your life. Just finding them sometimes requires you to think outside the box and explore where it would not occur to you to look, once inside you will have to put to use everything learned up to that moment. There is a genuine satisfaction in collecting the various items or completing the trials and it is that extra touch that made Kaze's entire adventure enjoyable from start to finish. For each island we visit with the aim of freeing it from the yoke of the chief vegetable on duty, the developers have undertaken to create very different biomes and situations and this helps to lighten the feeling of repetitiveness that makes its way at a certain point in the second half of the game. Although we find ourselves in visually different situations, some mechanics are reused especially as regards the chases but overall there is still the effort to vary the structure of the levels in question so as not to weigh too much. It is not a real flaw but rather a flaw because, even in its being rather simple for veterans of the genre, Kaze and the Wild Masks is a small yet absolutely pleasant platformer that starts quietly to grow more and more. It may not be the challenge that the most seasoned are looking for, but that doesn't stop us from recommending it to you: finally, the 16-bit aesthetic is enhanced both on the small Switch screen and on the TV, while the drawings do an excellent job of telling the story without words.
