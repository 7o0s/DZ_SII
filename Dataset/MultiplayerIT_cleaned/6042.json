Not only is it the first true canonical video game since Disney wiped out all the stories of the Expanded Universe (Disney Infinity 3.0, with its soups and ~what if~, does not count as canonical), but it is also and above all the first to tell the events following Return of the Jedi, joining the books Star Wars: Aftermath and Star Wars: Lost Stars in the journey that will ferry fans towards the arrival of the long-awaited Episode VII at the cinema. Precisely for this reason, it is curious to note that the development has been entrusted to the Californian Kabam RPG. Having granted this responsibility to a studio with a semi-unknown name and with only one relevant active game (the recent Spirit Lords), in fact represented a big gamble and a strong demonstration of trust on the part of Lucasfilm. The first Star Wars canon video game is Uprising, a small RPG for mobile devices Imperial propaganda Taking up much of the design of Spirit Lords, Star Wars: Insurrection is an RPG with an isometric view not too different from the many ~Diablo-like~ games that populate the App Store and Google Play. You can therefore create a character by choosing from four races [see box], you can equip him with different types of weapons and armor, and by completing the various missions you get experience points that allow you to level up and unlock active skills and passive. Despite being light years away from the depth of a Knights of the Old Republic, Kabam deserves credit for having been able to intelligently exploit the interface of smartphones and tablets. To move, just touch the point to reach, while the special attacks must be activated through simple and intuitive inputs. But forget about wielding a lightsaber and traveling the galaxy as a Jedi Master. Star Wars: Uprising features a handful of smugglers who get by doing odd jobs for the underworld in the Anoat Sector. In this area, however, the Empire has established an Iron Blockade, isolating the inhabitants of the various systems and ensuring that no one learns of Emperor Palpatine's death. Through a strong propaganda campaign aimed at suppressing any attempt at rebellion, the Empire has made the planets of Anoat believe that they have won the battle of Endor and permanently eliminated the Rebel Alliance. Yet, the events of the game intertwine with those told in Aftermath, and the Imperials are forced to send special units to eliminate anyone who knows the truth about Endor and the Second Death Star. It is a very interesting incipit with undoubted potential, on which Daniel Erickson (former creative director of Star Wars: The Old Republic), Alex Freed (writer of several Star Wars comics published by Dark Horse) and Danny Keller (director of several episodes of the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars). The narrative premise effectively inserts new characters into an already consolidated universe, but unfortunately these characters are completely lacking in depth, resulting in several cases of uncharismatic puppets. Also, the missions have the big flaw of being almost all the same: you arrive in a scenario, you take out waves of droids / imperial / criminals, and it continues until the end. Every now and then a boss pops up and sometimes there is an object to collect, but the narrative cues almost never materialize in exciting missions or particularly inspired dialogues. However, the developers have put a lot of meat on the fire: it is in fact possible to create cartels between players, communicate with other users through a text chat, play certain levels in a cooperative, choose to face daily challenges or side missions, or send some characters complete tasks similar to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. There are also special events called Sector Battles, in which players can embark on unique missions and contribute to the expansion of an area, obtaining quite rare loot but in some cases also more or less important plot pieces. It's a real shame that the game constantly needs to be connected online - the missions are short enough to be able to complete in short breaks or while on the road, but on several occasions we were unable to precisely because of the lack of connection. Even with its limitations, however, Star Wars: Uprising remains a game with its own personality, able to live up to thefranchise right from the opening titles, replicating the feeling of the saga through the familiarity of the art style, settings and soundtrack. Race Wars Rather simple and without too many customization options, the character editor allows you to create a male or female alter-ego, belonging to one of four different races (human, Twi'lek, Zabrak and Mirialani). The choice is purely aesthetic and does not particularly affect the plot or the growth of one's character. However, Riley, the protagonist's sister, will have a different avatar (and, of course, a suitable last name) based on your profile.", "date": "2015-09-14", "grade": "7.7"}
