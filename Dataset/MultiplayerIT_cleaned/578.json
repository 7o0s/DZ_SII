{"name": "Swords of Destiny", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/swords-of-destiny.html", "text": "Ominous fate Swords of Destiny immediately betrays a very clear inspiration towards Devil May Cry: frenetic fights against demons, great emphasis on combos, mission structure and white-haired protagonist speak volumes about the source on which the developers have drawn. Unfortunately for Atari (but above all for the user) the similarities with the Capcom jewel end right where they begin, that is on paper. Yes, because once the formalities of the initial menu have been overcome and a decidedly mediocre introduction has been syruped, Swords of Destiny shows itself in all its sad qualitative paucity. To open the dances of this tragic show we think of a creepy (horror) cosmetics, which even reaches the ridiculous if we mention the Atari website which in the game sheet talks about ~spectacular settings that push the PS2 hardware to the maximum levels~. The oxymoron appears evident right from the start, thanks to graphics characterized by bad definition, low polygon count, woody animations, prevailing aliasing and, as if that weren't enough, hands-in-the-hair design. Swords of Destiny amazes for technical poverty like few other titles we have seen lately: characters with a very questionable look move awkwardly on a background made up of scenarios with an incredibly poor and elementary structure, devoid of any charm and even repetitive in their slavish repetition in blocks. In light of the absolute inability on the part of the developers to meet the basic cosmetic criteria, it is not even shocking to see how badly the side elements are made: therefore the menus are as ugly to look at as they are impractical , and the virtual camera can easily be among the worst ever seen in a video game, with the shot continuously doing its best to disorient the user. From a technical point of view Swords of Destiny is, in a word, disastrous: and the sound sector certainly does not improve the situation, offering trivial and repetitive music, sound effects that it is euphemistic to define as minimalist and, last but not least, a literally ridiculous English dubbing . It certainly can't get worse than this... or maybe it can? So many swords... to make Harakiri As mentioned in the introduction, Swords of Destiny is in all respects a sort of very shy Devil May Cry clone mixed with some element taken from Otogi. Therefore, the user runs through the various levels slicing demons and collecting weapons and objects, or rather tries to do so: yes, because Swords of Destiny adds a whole series of gaps in terms of gameplay to the aforementioned flaws in the audiovisual field . Starting from a level design of rare flatness, the Atari product is guilty of real videogame crimes, mainly concerning a very woody control system and an incredibly banal and repetitive game structure. Thanks to the aforementioned stage design, a monotonous fighting system and an AI of the opponents that borders on zero, Swords of Destiny wearily drags on alternating with some terrible platform flashes a continuous and very tedious succession of groups of enemies to be defeated with your eyes closed using a decidedly limited variety of attacks. Not even the different swords available during the game manage to raise the incredible repetitiveness of the Atari product, given that whatever weapon is used, killing opponents requires an absolutely laughable effort. In short, Swords of Destiny is certainly one of the most unfortunate expressions of the modern action game: to give an example of the inconsistency of the developers' work, it is enough to know that not even an elementary process such as switching from one lock-on to another works in decent way. Badly conceived, badly made and totally detached from the concept of ~fun~, Swords of Destiny is not even very long-lived (but this from a certain point of view can be considered a fortune), with a standard number of stages that the low level of difficulty makes it extremely simple to complete. But it really takes courage to do it... Comment Swords of Destiny is, in no uncertain terms, an extremely unsuccessful title in all respects. Starting from an embarrassing audiovisual sector, the Atari product continues its descent towards the videogame abyss, offering the user a gameplay which, while stealing the essence of two names such as Devil May Cry and Otogi, proves to be nothing short of approximate and scarcely fun, also penalized by defects such as a truly scandalous camera control and management system. In short, Swords of Destiny is an action game from which it is better to keep well away. Pros 48 different swords Cons Bad technical level Bad gameplay in every aspect Terrible design When a franchise is successful, the production by more or less titled software houses of a whole series of games that are more or less indirectly inspired by its winning characteristics is inevitable. Hence, a title such as Devil May Cry, the true creator of the much loved/hated stylish gaming, was soon plundered by several parts of its essential elements, poured into more or less serious contenders for its leadership. And this Swords of Destiny is definitely part of the latter category ...", "date": "2006-03-17", "grade": null}
