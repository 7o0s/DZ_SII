The mouse pointer takes on different forms, in order to communicate the only possible action in each particular context, while by accessing the inventory you have the possibility to view and analyze the objects collected, to consult the notepad (important source of suggestions) and wallets (container of documents) and to use the map (aid to be conquered during the game). As far as playability and user interface are concerned, I can't help but be rather lapidary, coming from much more interactive experiences in the field of Graphic Adventures, I first of all find the idea of having to move from scene to scene in a sequential and rigid way through a click of the mouse and not being able to freely roam around the rooms. Man-machine interaction Forget about being able to ~grope~ all the objects you encounter, because if they don't have sufficient significance for the investigator, you won't even be able to dust them off, furthermore the game precludes certain paths based on your level of ~success~, i.e. it is not possible to cross certain thresholds or use certain objects if you have not reached pre-established milestones within the story (often very helpful even if highly frustrating, ed). Cameron will have to solve more or less complex problems to proceed with the investigation (or at least to survive in that gloomy land), which makes the course of events more exciting and dynamic, especially considering that some of them have increasingly pressing time constraints. Graphics and movies Loch Ness presumably uses the same graphic engine (even rather dated, ed) of its predecessor ~The Messenger~, moreover it emerges from the first closed environment (a hall of the estate) that the engine does not render the models at each shift of the subject's focus, but it simply recreates the perspective by distorting the image of the room. Although the open spaces are conceived with great accuracy, the graphic realization of the scenarios certainly leaves something to be desired, in a nutshell, a clinical eye is not needed to distinctly notice the vertices of the pixels in the entire succession of shots. Music and dialogues The entire audio section does not seem treated to the smallest detail, the background music is not very present and of insufficient accompaniment to the game and the sound effects are not worthy of note. Dialogues are only present in the form of video animations that interrupt the flow of the game to provide important information to the investigator, while occasional comments from the latter are audible to emphasize certain situations. Installation The package includes two CDs and a rather meager manual, containing the bare essentials to start playing, the minimum configuration required is as follows: Pentium 166MHz (200MHz recommended) Win 95, 98, Me or XP 16 MB Ram One thousand color video card (no 3D acceleration requirement?) 16 bit sound card 16x CD-Rom (24x recommended) Conclusion Loch Ness is undoubtedly a game with the potential to intrigue you through mysterious situations, as well as tease you with constant puzzles to solve, as long as you are not hindered by the heavy limitations imposed by the graphics engine and control mechanisms. Given the absence of different game levels, a decent graphic adventure or RPG player will certainly find this game not too demanding, for those who still have experience, I recommend saving often and looking for help in the notepad. Good investigation. Intro Chicago, 1932: a telegram copiously shakes the (not too exciting) investigative activity of Alan Parker Cameron, who is invited to personally ascertain the countless supernatural apparitions that have been disturbing the castle of Devil's Ridge (Scotland) for some time now. The investigator collects the request for help from the famous doctor Alistair McFairley, as well as the owner of the estate, and immerses himself in the ~unreal~ Scottish reality of the 1930s (lake and monster included, ed) but ... the surprises seemrare to be on the agenda... first of all the news that welcomes Cameron: the scientist has disappeared. To fill any ambiguities, and to create as many mysterious and intriguing situations, the link between McFairley and Cameron is immediately clarified, the latter in fact, in addition to boasting distant roots in the land of ~Loch Ness~, appears to be united with the scientist by an obscure jewel given to him by his father I created some confusion in your minds well just play it.", "date": "2002-01-21", "grade": null}
