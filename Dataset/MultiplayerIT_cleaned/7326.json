{"name": "Il deserto dei tartari", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/128276-rekoil-il-deserto-dei-tartari.html", "text": "Developed by Plastic Piranha and available on Steam for several days, Rekoil is a multiplayer shooter inspired by the classics of the genre, offering a range of traditional modes, some variations on the theme in terms of classes and focusing on accessibility, also and above all from the technical point of view. However, the game suffered at launch from some rather serious problems: respawning of characters in the middle of the action, resulting in unwanted deaths; heavy drops in frame rate even on medium-high-end configurations, despite graphics that are anything but complex; questionable weapon balancing; people walking around the locations completely invisible. We therefore wanted to wait a bit before judging it, giving the team the opportunity to release corrective patches, which fortunately occurred on time. Except that, in the meantime, those few players who were there have disappeared into thin air, leaving the numerous servers available completely deserted. In short, at present, Rekoil is unusable and we had to sweat a lot to find some active sessions with a minimum of participants, so as to test their maps and methods. It's a pity, because the numbers of the 505 Games production are more than fair: ten good-sized maps, which alternate between open and closed spaces; seven modes that include traditional deathmatches but also territorial and classic ~capture the flag~ variations; six freely customizable classes with more than forty weapons; modding tools included in the package; support for eSports applications, complete with spectator mode. While user appeals for a transition to the free to play model are wasted on Steam, which would at least allow saving the project and bringing new people to the servers, let's see what the situation is right now. Rekoil is a multiplayer shooter currently with no players online, technically dated and bland All mine the city Once you've selected a server and logged in, Rekoil's gameplay feels pretty traditional straight away. The game does not support the controller and the layout of the controls is the usual, but the sensitivity of the mouse must initially be doubled to obtain the reactivity necessary to be able to score some kills. As mentioned earlier, there are six different classes: Assault, the service rifleman initially equipped with an AK47; Recon, the light machine gun support unit; Shotgunner, ideal for short-range fights thanks to the shotgun; Heavy Gunner, armed with heavy machine guns; Sniper, lethal from a distance thanks to the sniper rifle; and finally Rocketeer, a unit that goes around the map carrying a rocket launcher. Each class can be customized in terms of equipment, but in this sense a reward system is completely missing that allows us to unlock new objects based on the experience gained. The approach chosen by the developers is in fact that of ~everything and immediately~, to the detriment of the sense of progression and thickness, but even here the alarm siren that inevitably rang out in the Plastic Piranha offices when the launch c 'there were something like sixty players online in all and a ton of technical problems to sort out. The inconsistent gunplay is probably also the result of unfortunate choices, dictated by the haste to fix a balance that was very questionable at the beginning, which made weapons such as the AK47 difficult to use. Well, after the treatment this weapon has actually become quite lethal even from long range, but the inexplicable thing is that it turns out to be much more accurate with the normal reticle instead of resorting to the iron sight. Mission Impossible The picture that emerges after a few games with Rekoil is that of an ~average~ shooter, which has certainly solved some of the problems that characterized its launch but which at the moment appears far from perfect; which means that several updates will still be needed to make the situation acceptable, especially in terms of gunplay and balancing. The inclusion of some classes that are different from the usual is interesting, see the Rocketeer or the Heavy Gunner, which open up new possibilities with a view to a group battle. However, immediate access to all equipment seemed a questionable choice if we consider the long-term interest, and should be changed in favor of a more traditional approach, with points and experience levels that stimulate users to obtain good results . The impact detection isn't bad, and together with a good variety of maps and modes, it makes it possible to enjoyall in all a pleasant experience, although completely devoid of acute notes and cues of particular interest. However, it is the technical sector that really brings down the title of Plastic Piranha, given that it seems to be faced with an FPS that is at least ten years old in terms of polygonal modeling, animations, details and effects. The design of the maps is probably the only thing that can be saved from a technical point of view, proposing a certain alternation of situations between open and closed spaces, with possible firefights from a distance but also close exchanges. The developers have fixed the problem of frame rate drops, and in fact on the test configuration we easily obtained 80 constant frames per second, but evident interpenetrations and other defects of this type remain, frankly unacceptable in a ~finished~ and marketed product . To make things even worse, the sound takes care of it, with decidedly tacky and unrealistic effects for weapons.", "date": "2014-02-10", "grade": "4.0"}
