In fact, the game designer of The Church in the Darkness boasts in his curriculum the participation in a good number of projects of a certain thickness, from old games such as The Suffering (and beyond) to the more recent Sunset Overdrive, Quantum Break and CastleStorm in Microsoft Game Studios. It is precisely the narrative vein with which Richard Rouse III has always been endowed with the source of the birth of The Church in the Darkness, combined with the game designer's desire to explore the nature of cults. In particular, Richard Rouse III said he was interested in the way in which certain forms of worship arise, often dictated by good intentions, eventually eventually changing and in any case having a strong influence on those who belong to it. A rather edgy topic, also considering past events such as those of Jonestown, which The Church in the Darkness tries to address after being presented in 2016 on the occasion of the GDC of that year. The game has finally arrived these days on practically all platforms: both consoles (Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) and PC. After trying several times to shed light on the situation proposed to us by the guys from Paranoid Productions, here is the verdict of our review. Plot and modality The Church in the Darkness is set in 1977, the year in which a religious sect accused of extremism decides to move from the United States to the middle of the South American jungle. The protagonist we control is called Vic, commissioned by his relatives to get in touch with the members of the cult, infiltrating the so-called Freedom Town to understand if the nephew of whom we no longer hear is there voluntarily, or if there is something going on. that does not work. Without having particular information at the start, it is therefore necessary to investigate the place itself on the nature of the cult and its leaders, to then decide whether to take the boy away or leave him where he is. It is up to the player to choose how to tackle the mission: in perfect stealth style, thus sneaking among the guards without a shot being fired, knocking out those present without resorting to lethal methods, or finally making their way to the sound of lead. Even if the player's behavior affects the way community members react towards him, proving more or less willing to forgive him and give him a sort of second chance, we can say for simplicity that the game ends the moment you are discovered and captured, and then return to repeat the adventure from scratch. The roguelite dynamics mean that with each new run you can choose some objects from a set of those discovered during previous attempts, and then start from a random place on the map to go in search of your nephew Alex. The real peculiarity of The Church in the Darkness lies in the fact that it is not only the position of the boy that changes, but also the very nature of the cult: in a game, for example, it can happen that the nephew is actually held back by force and therefore wants to run away, while in another it may happen that nothing bad is happening. Similar speech for the leaders Isaac and Rebecca, with different personalities depending on the run we are in. These elements allow the game to offer nineteen different endings, which therefore contribute to creating a situation in which each game played in The Church in the Darkness is potentially different from the previous one. At least in theory. Gameplay If on paper the game looks like we have just described, in reality after some time spent in the company of The Church in the Darkness the practice proves to be a little less attractive. In fact, we do not deny that the first attempts to reach Alex are quite fascinating and engaging, until the moment in which the novelty effect wanes and too repetitive mechanics are identified for what are the characteristics of The Church in the Darkness. If it is true that the location of the nephew is randomly generated with each new run, the path to take is always established in the same way through the meeting with two other members of Freedom Town willing to help us, placed instead in predictable places. The exploration phase is probably the most convincing of the entire game: as we venture through the various community structures, the loudspeakers acquaint us with Isaac and Rebecca's ideas, allowing us to get to the truth together with clippings and notes scattered around, plus other clues that the entire community is littered with. The attThe activity of investigation therefore really allows us to get an idea (right or wrong) of what is the real nature of the cult, drawing our conclusions until we eventually get to face the two leaders. Unfortunately, the rest of the game dynamics proves to be limping, starting from the stealth component: the only way to be identified by enemies is to end up in their visual cone, with no possibility of them hearing us. It is therefore possible to pass by anyone even when running, without them noticing our presence in the slightest. The stones that we can throw to distract the guards only go in the direction we are facing, thus making their use rather complicated. Fortunately, the use of firearms allows you to aim, but the system is still quite laborious overall, especially when we need to shoot someone in an excited phase. Much better to run away and hide to wait for things to calm down, instead of taking part in a fight in which more often than not you end up succumbing. Graphics and sound The indie nature of The Church in the Darkness certainly does not make it greedy in terms of system resources, effectively allowing any PC equipped with a Dual Core CPU to run it without problems. The view from above offers a good overview of the surrounding environment, obviously composed mainly of jungle vegetation. Exploration is made pleasant by the care placed by Paranoid Productions in the details of Freedom Town, where it is possible to come across structures of various types including playgrounds for children, places of prayer, shooting ranges and so on. The color range is made up of rather dark shades, which could perhaps make someone turn up their noses but which seems to us to be part of a coherent choice with the serious tones of the theme to which the game is dedicated. Small note on the audio: even if set to a normal level, the volume sometimes reaches peaks that are a little too high, making the speakers present in Freedom Town a little too annoying especially if you play with headphones.", "date": "2019-08-07", "grade": "6.0"}
