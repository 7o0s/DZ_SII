The sun was high in the sky when I approached for the third time the fissure in the ground that led underground. bottom of the crevasse, did not contribute to instilling security while I was about to descend again into the wound of the earth. Several times I had gone down to investigate the strange symbols, in the shape of a hand, painted on the walls of houses. Or at least in my opinion they were houses, a kind of small village. I can't say I share the choice of living in such a place, but apparently someone didn't have the same idea as me. D'ni, as the inhabitants of this area were called. A rather interesting population , guardian of ancient secrets. Just rummaging in the midst of the remains of one of the houses I found a manuscript that convinced me to return several times to this place and to conduct in-depth investigations on what remains of an underground river that flows at the bottom of the fissure. Of course, having discussed it with a crazy old man who lives right here, at the foot of the volcano, didn't help much. Probably even if I had lived under the scorching sun for years, now I wouldn't be so right with my head. But those few words exchanged with that mysterious desert dweller had already helped me once. If it weren't for him, I might never have gone back down there.~ Uru: Ages Beyond Myst begins like this, without providing us with a real plot from the beginning and without revealing anything about who we are and what we are doing at the foot of a volcano in New Mexico. The character that we move on the screen is our alter ego in the world of Uru. We can customize it from the beginning to make it similar to us, or completely different. The choices are varied and it is possible to create your own avatar by modifying a series of parameters and choosing from the various models presented at the beginning of the game.The story will be revealed to us slowly as a reward for our infused efforts in unraveling the mysteries of the D'ni civilization. URU technology Uru: Ages Beyond Myst is a particularly controversial title regarding the technology used. Surely the visual rendering is excellent, thanks to the use of models with a high number of polygons and particularly detailed textures. On the other hand, however, the 3D rendering engine is not particularly fluid and requires at least a sufficiently powerful computer to be able to play without excessive slowdowns. It is also true that, not being an action game, it is not essential that it is particularly fast, but sometimes the slowdowns become really annoying. Another weakness is the control system. At Cyan Worlds they have adopted a movement system based on that of FPS, which although it is functional in the first person, it is not at all if you play in the third person view. It is possible to reset the keys and assign the functions to the mouse that are normally performed with the keyboard, thus guaranteeing a certain flexibility in setting the commands. Finding the optimal combination takes a bit of experimentation, but in the long run you'll get satisfying results. A particularly positive note goes instead to the audio which takes full advantage of the three-dimensionality by projecting us into the game eras and immersing us in the sounds and noises that characterize them. The game environment The game environment is certainly the focus of Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. It begins in the present, in a real and plausible environment, but soon finds itself catapulted into completely different and surreal worlds. These worlds, called ~eras~ within the game, are linked to each other and characterized by the presence of machinery, houses, writings of various kinds. Acting as a bridge between the various eras is a small house on a pillar of grassy land, in the middle of nowhere, where our memories are kept and from which it is possible to travel to different worlds. Inside the house our memories are kept in the form of books. Whenever we solve particularly important puzzles in an era, new volumes automatically appear in our library. This, which is a bit the symbol of our memory, allows us to directly access areas of an era without having to retrace our steps every time we want to go back (this detail recalls the Stephen King novel ~Dreamcatcher~ , n.d. Pucci). The main objective, as already mentioned, is the classic one of an adventure ggraphic: explore the different eras and solve puzzles, which are sometimes particularly complex and which require a more than in-depth analysis of the environment around us. Keeping faith with what was the mold of Myst, Uru: Ages Beyond Myst is also stingy with clues and aids and being able to unravel the story is a real feat that stimulates the desire to move forward and find out what awaits us behind to the solution of yet another riddle. If Myst had been one of the driving games in 1994 thanks to the pioneering exploitation of the CD-ROM format and pre-rendered 3D graphics, today Uru: Ages Beyond Myst fully exploits the potential of the personal computers of the moment. Pre-rendered graphics have been abandoned in favor of polygonal rendered in real time and the artistic production has been taken to sublime levels, with breathtaking environments, photorealistic textures and models that use a large number of polygons (it must be said that, since there a large number of ~moving~ characters on the screen, the computing power that is normally destined for artificial intelligence is instead lavished on drawing a greater number of polygons that make up the game environment). Particular care has also been poured into the music which is as fascinating as the graphics of Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. Also noteworthy is the presence of a song by Peter Gabriel in the soundtrack of this title. Multiplayer When Rand Miller is said to be an innovator, it's not a waste of breath. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst is the first adventure in the most classic sense of the term, which can also be played in multiplayer. The multiplayer version is called Uru: Live and the launch was expected to coincide with the release of the title on the shelves, but this was not the case. Uru: Live is, in fact, still in beta testing and only a lucky few can experience this game mode. It must be said that we at Multiplayer had been lucky enough to see Uru: Live during E3 in Los Angeles. The concept is very simple. If in Uru: Ages Beyond Myst we are alone in solving the puzzles, in the live version we can form groups and venture together to discover new areas of the game world and rack our brains to solve the most complex quizzes. Furthermore, we also have our home in the online world: a place where our memories and discoveries are stored and where we can invite other players to visit us. We will talk about Uru: Live soon, as soon as it is available to the public. Comment Uru: Ages Beyond Myst is a game that revives the fortunes of a genre, that of graphic adventures, which has seen a rather heavy collapse in recent years. If you're used to the most extreme shooters and RPGs in vogue at the moment, this probably isn't a title for you. But if you feel like taking on a challenge worthy of your intelligence, then Uru: Ages Beyond Myst could be your game: an adventure that never ceases to amaze and that behind every effort we put into solving puzzles knows how to reward us with a storyline and a level of immersion that stimulates our desire to return to the world of Uru over and over again. Furthermore, the cinematographic production, the obsessive attention to detail and the great soundtrack are certainly good reasons to immerse yourself in the world of Uru: Ages Beyond Myst, a place capable of making us live experiences comparable to those of reading a great adventure book. Pros: Great storyline Spectacular settings Movie soundtrack Cons: Inadequate control system Quite high hardware requirements Multiplayer not yet available Background Last May, in Los Angeles, during a chat Rand Miller, president of Cyan Worlds, told us about Uru and showed us a preliminary version of the forthcoming title. In his dissertation on the peculiarities of Uru, he had wasted no time praising the simplicity of the game concept which is the same as the first Myst, a set of exploration and puzzle solving based on intelligence and observation of the world around us. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst is in fact an old-fashioned adventure, which relies on a style, that of graphic adventures, which is as run-in as it is in crisis at the moment.", "date": "2004-01-05", "grade": null}
