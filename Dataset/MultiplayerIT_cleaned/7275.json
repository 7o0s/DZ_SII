Made by the expert hands of Climax Studios, a team that has already authored two excellent episodes of Silent Hill (Origins and Shattered Memories), as well as the PC version of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2, Dead Nation: Apocalypse Edition can be downloaded for free by registered users of PlayStation Plus and represents an excellent opportunity to relive the atmospheres of one of the titles that most characterized 2010 on the PlayStation Network, trying their hand again with its mechanics - far from trivial - or picking it up for the first time. The plot of the game closely resembles that of the film ~I am legend~, with the traditional ~patient zero~ immune to the virus, who is in the midst of a zombie apocalypse that has wiped out society as we know it but does not give up . We can choose to face the adventure in the role of Jack McReady or Scarlet Blake, but the gender of our avatar does not change the connotation of the ten levels that make up the single player campaign, which at the normal level of difficulty can be completed within four hours and a half but can give moments of great intensity, especially in the final parts. However, it is a pity that the developers did not take the opportunity to insert extra missions and thus increase the duration of the story. Dead Nation: Apocalypse Edition marks the debut of the series on PlayStation 4 in the best way Let's refresh our memory ~Aim and shoot~, the gameplay of Dead Nation: Apocalypse Edition could be summarized thus, but in reality the experience offered by the Housemarque shooter is not reduced to this. In fact, we have a particular focus on scoring and an excellent weapon management and upgrade system, improved on PlayStation 4 thanks to the introduction of a quick selection that allows you to switch from the default assault rifle in an instant (the only one equipped with unlimited ammunition) to the SMG machine gun, from the devastating shotgun to the blade cannon, capable of decapitating dozens of zombies with a single shot. That's not all, in the arsenal there is also a lethal flamethrower, ideal for roasting numerous hordes of undead, perhaps after having attracted them to a point on the map thanks to a signal flare, an electric rifle capable of blowing up what remains of the brains of our targets and a missile launcher, which proves to be really useful when we want to quickly eliminate mini-bosses. Yes, because the almost infinite hordes of undead crowding the stages, despite their numerous variants, are not the only threat we will have to face during the campaign, which certainly makes it better if played in cooperative multiplayer mode together with a friend. At regular intervals we will find ourselves fighting ~jumpers~, mutants capable of leaping in an attempt to crush us under their weight; ~howlers~, able to call large groups of minions ready to attack us; and then again toxic ~Bombies~, which explode after a few hits, and ~cutters~, horrible creatures covered with a protective layer that run in our direction to slice us with their blades. The visual spectacle offered by the game is emphasized on PlayStation 4 thanks to the 1080p resolution, a frame rate anchored to 30 frames per second even in the most crowded situations, as well as the improvement of textures and effects, especially as regards the lights, fog and explosions. Playstation 4 trophies There are a total of 41 Trophies available for Dead Nation: Apocalypse Edition, including Platinum. To get them, just complete the campaign and the individual missions at various difficulty levels, as well as carry out ~numerical~ actions: kill a certain amount of zombies, perform a certain amount of melee attacks, collect all the components for the armor and so on. Street. Fresh meat In addition to the purely technical ones, what are the novelties of the PlayStation 4 version of Dead Nation? Firstly, the Apocalypse Edition natively includes the Road to Devastation expansion, which adds substance to the experience thanks to the addition of two extra modes: Arcade and Endless. It is basically two sides of the same coin, which consist of six rounds to be faced by choosing from time to time paths based on the collection of money, weapons, armor parts or on obtaining a high score, within new locations that they propose respectable challenges and present an element of variation constituted by fitta vegetation, which more often than not hides more zombies ready to attack us. The Endless variant proposes the same stages, but with a peculiarity: you have to complete them without being able to count on additional lives or checkpoints. Still from the point of view of the playful offer, an unprecedented Challenge mode has been inserted on the new Sony console, which allows us to compare our score with that of a friend or any other PSN user and challenge him, in fact, to do better of us in a given mission. Starting from the official release of the game, on March 5th, a very interesting feature will also be available, which definitively puts a patch on what were instead the ~social~ shortcomings of the original version of Dead Nation for PlayStation 3, which at the time of The release didn't even have a voice chat feature. This is the Broadcast + mode, which allows you to broadcast your game online and therefore to show it to all the other players, who however will not limit themselves to passively assisting but will be able to influence its progress through a voting mechanism for the introduction of thirty different modifiers, ranging from the appearance of additional zombies to the deactivation of maneuvers such as the quick dash, passing through the supply of extra ammo. Users who vote to make life harder for you will then appear in the game as the living dead and you can then tear them apart to take revenge for their decisions.", "date": "2014-03-04", "grade": "8.0"}
