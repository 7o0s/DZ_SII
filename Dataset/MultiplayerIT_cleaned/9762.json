Classical iconography usually sees a group of heroes at work who have to save the planet from spectacular floods, earthquakes or dangerous meteorites, with more or less positive results. And just the next fall of unwanted celestial bodies starts the adventure of W.I.P., an acronym for Work In Progress, a nice title on the App Store where the heroes this time will be teams of technicians and workers, engaged in intense aero-naval construction works. Work ennobles the robot In a context of imminent drama, the entire population of the planet Mytral decides to face the foreseen cataclysm with the only attitude that one might expect from a community of robots, namely rational industriousness. Building the numerous rockets necessary to escape in a hurry from the threatened planet will therefore become the main objective for all the teams of engineers and robotic workers scattered around the world, engaged in the various construction sites; it will be up to the player to help the metallic inhabitants by managing the crucial transport system, the nodal point for the optimization and use of ~robotic~ resources. In fact, in each construction site, access to the structures will take place via numbered platforms, where workers and technicians will have to be transported by special single-seat bus-buses addressed by the user's finger. The player's only task will be to trace with his finger the trajectories that the small transport ships will have to take to pick up and drop off the workers on the various platforms; apparently, this operation seems all too simple, in reality there are many variables involved in calculating the routes, such as to make everything almost frustrating at times. The obstacles that the shuttles may encounter along the way to the platforms are in fact numerous and of different nature: in particular, it is possible to come across physical structures that will prevent the passage of the vehicle, forcing a detour, or much more dangerous meteor showers , small in size but capable of destroying the ship if hit in full; moreover, continuing in the levels (24) the transport shuttles present at the same time will increase, forcing the player to avoid even accidental collisions between the same vehicles. The icing on the (indigestible) cake, other types of aircraft will randomly ply the scenarios, leading to further mandatory detours. To understand the gameplay structure of W.I.P. just refer to Firemint's best seller for iPhone/iPod Touch, Flight Control: the trajectory tracing system is almost the same, except for the perspective (horizontal on Flight Control, vertical in this case) and obviously for the context. It should be noted that as already mentioned the place on the single anti-gravity bus, consequently it will be necessary to transport only one worker at a time but many times, all within a fairly tight time limit; for each worker transported to the evacuation platform, at the end of his shift, the timer will increase by thirty seconds. The low time limit combined with the management of the technicians' shifts basically represent the main problem of the game: in fact, it will often happen that a series of workers will perform an excessive number of operations before being able to be evacuated, being transported from one numbered platform to another too many times; once the time has expired, the game over will inevitably arrive, despite the fact that a recent update of the game has increased the speed of the means of transport. However, it will be enough to start the level again and mysteriously the work shifts will be halved, thus managing to save everyone and finish the internship. Given the interest in the project that young developers are putting, we are confident in a future update that will solve this annoying flaw. Finally, little to say about the technical sector: W.I.P. it's a title that's all about gameplay, and it shows. The scenarios are sketchy and certainly don't do justice to the Retina Display of the test iPhone 4, as well as the small robots and transport ships. In short, everything is minimal, perhaps decidedly too much; the same goes for the sound, on which it is not worth spending more characters. Also absent is support for Game Center or alternative achievement systems. Price: 0.79 The tested version is 1.1 Apple Store Links", "date": "2010-10-05", "grade": "6.8"}
