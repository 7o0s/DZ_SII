{"name": "The Partners", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-partners.html", "text": "To take control? Or lose it? The first thing you can appreciate about The Partners is the management system. Simple and intuitive. Through the interface or a click with the left mouse button you select one of our lawyers. Right-click to select the object or person to interact with. The system automatically proposes the possible choices, also providing possible indications on the outcome and the probability of success. In this way, transforming our office into a tantric Eden of an exaggerated career will be extremely simple. The aim of the game is in fact, in line with most of the real life simulators, to make the various characters coexist in a more than peaceful way, trying in an exquisitely utopian way to make them progress both from the point of view of the career and from that personal, in perfect happiness and harmony. It must be said that, given the number of parameters and the possibilities for interaction, the task is fairly complex, especially when the objectives of each single mission are added to this main objective. In fact, the game is managed in a very similar way to a TV show, and each level will have a main purpose and a series of secondary objectives, to be completed while keeping our rampant offspring as serene and happy as possible. Be productive The artificial intelligence, albeit with some shortcomings, seems to be able to manage the characters in a plausible way. Generally automatic actions follow a good level of complexity. A nice example is the character of the libertine, who, in order to get some chance of withdrawing, will not hesitate to go to gymnastics together with his colleagues (and many know how realistic this situation is), or the career-obsessed character who will start arguing with less productive colleagues. As far as the graphic aspect is concerned, The Partners is powered by an adequate 3D engine, even if facilitated by the limited space. During the game it is possible to freely zoom, rotate the camera and move, using the arrow keys or the mouse with equal comfort. The character models are made with an adequate level of detail (after all, it is a management game) and the objects show a good variety of designs and functions. The possibilities for interaction are good, and show an excellent design of the game environment. Common places Unfortunately The partners suffers from a series of graphics problems, which significantly reduce its appreciability. It is not at all uncommon for characters to mistakenly collide with objects or with each other. This problem becomes even more serious if you perform actions outside the box or if you assign similar tasks or different characters. This defect is very curious, because it clashes with the fluidity of the engine, which allows even sudden movements without giving signs of yielding. Another aspect that could leave you dumbfounded is the soundtrack, which under the pretext of emulating that of the most famous TV series of this genre, is more like a flat background noise than a real sound commentary. Furthermore, once again the problem of dualism arises. Alongside a good quality game design, even if very academic, there are some ingenuities that almost give an impression of neglect, such as the introductory movie made with a montage of simple in-game filmed sequences, or some system messages provided in plain text, or the scarcity of options (it is not possible to change the video resolution for example). To say that the game is not particularly burdensome, even on low-end machines, and this undoubtedly works in its favor. Winners and losers The partners is undoubtedly a game dedicated to casual gamers, as demonstrated by the simplicity of the controls and the lack of hotkeys. Indeed, the attempt to contextualize a videogame in an original environment is appreciable, which in many respects is at the antipodes of traditional settings. Indeed, the setting is the tastiest part of the game. Glossy and fake as only the best American TV series can be. Exquisitely surreal, delightfully alienated, utterly out of touch with the real world. In our office it will be possible to set up giant screens, billiard tables, karaoke systems, gyms. Maybe that's how it works in the New Continent, maybe the need to fantasize affects even those who can't imaginedragons or borg. A splendid Hollywood fairy tale, which has little to envy of the Brothers Grimm or Andersen. Does the new little mermaid have a law degree? Concluding... The Partners is a game dedicated to authentic sit-com and/or sim-life fanatics. Lovers of the cathode ray tube will be able to find some interesting ideas, while others may, especially in the medium/long term, find it excessively limiting in terms of the number and variety of situations. Pros Recalls an environment with a strong media impact Interesting simulation engine ~Realistic~ character behaviors Cons Few too many graphical bugs Poverty of configuration options Limited spectrum of actions Lifestyles Do you stay up late at night to enjoy ~sex and the city~ or have you asked for esoteric work hours to follow Ally Mc Beal's schedule changes? Then The Partners is the game for you. What would you say to a sim-life entirely set in a law firm? In fact, the idea behind The Partners is precisely this and it must be said that in a certain sense it is an interesting experiment. The life of our characters takes place entirely in the workplace, which in full Manhattan tradition is destined to quickly transform into a sort of second home.", "date": "2003-02-19", "grade": null}
