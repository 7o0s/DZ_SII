Sometimes the experiment is successful, giving us a result that is anything but original but enjoyable, but the point comes where it becomes really difficult to find that variation on the theme capable of giving a minimum of meaning to one's project. With Ski Safari the guys from Defiant Development have tried to change perspective, focusing on a vertical development (or rather, let's say ~oblique~) of the action rather than horizontal. To put this intention into practice, it was enough to set the game on a boundless mountain, providing a rather clear incipit: an avalanche takes an expert skier by surprise, sweeping away his beautiful wooden house, and so the character finds himself having to at full speed on the snow so as not to end up buried too. The movement of the little man takes place automatically, following the laws of gravity, but the path we must follow to avoid the avalanche is full of dangerous obstacles, in this case protruding rocks of various sizes, ice sheets and ledges that we can exploit to ring some acrobatic maneuvers and increase our speed, provided we make a soft landing at the end of the jump. At the top of the screen there is a score multiplier which stores our aerial evolutions but which, however, resets as soon as we make a mistake. Who doesn't ski in company... The gameplay of Ski Safari follows the logic of the traditional ~survival~ formula that has always characterized running games, i.e. each game makes its own story and you have to try to get as far as possible from time to time. However, a certain type of work has been done in terms of balancing, in fact one immediately realizes that the descent at first is anything but difficult and the player is therefore given some time to ~warm up~ before facing him the most complex situations. Furthermore, to increase the variety, some objects have been inserted with which the character can interact to gain inspiration or increase his resistance to shocks: penguins that slide on the belly, yetis to ~ride~, snowmobiles and even birds that can make us glide very quickly towards the foot of the mountain. Each of these ~vehicles~ can take a couple of hits before dropping us off our skis again, and it's important to note that a head landing or hitting an obstacle in Ski Safari doesn't automatically translate into game over - it all depends from the distance at which we are from the avalanche, because with quick touches of the touch screen we will still be able to get up and continue running. So let's analyze the control system, which comes in an incredibly simple guise and works through a single touch on the screen, which activates the momentum for the jump and, by holding it down, allows us to perform the aerial rotations we were talking about in precedence. The responsiveness and precision are excellent and it really never happens to get something wrong due to the controls, which are supported by a very pleasant technical sector and perfectly functional to the action, thanks to the beautiful graphics and a very nice musical theme.", "date": "2012-05-10", "grade": "8.0"}
