{"name": "Sword Coast Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/158458-sword-coast-legends-leggende-dimenticabili.html", "text": "For a year now, PC role-playing games have made a comeback, with sequels of old glories and new intellectual properties. However, the lack of the RPG par excellence was felt, the one that in practice generated fantasy literature starting from the works of Tolkien. We are obviously talking about Dungeons & Dragons whose latest video game transpositions, leaving out the Enhanced Editions of the immortals Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, have been nothing short of interdictory: Daggerdale (in 2011) and Neverwinter (2013), while dealing with completely different genres, they turned out to be just enough. Wizards of the Coast has entrusted Digital Extremes and n-Space with the very risky task of bringing the fifth edition of the D&D rules to screens, and Sword Coast Legends is the result of a few months of work. Announced no later than March, it has already been available in Valve's digital delivery (later it will also be available in Sony and Microsoft's digital platforms) for a few days. The spotlight had immediately turned on the project also because the production was entrusted to Dan Tudge, already responsible for Dragon Age Origins: the premises for a return to the Forgotten Realms in the ~old way~ seemed to exist, as well as the quality of the people involved . Unfortunately, however, the result is not as exciting as hoped. A better use of the Dungeons & Dragons license was expected after the recent disappointments Junior Dungen Master(chef) The first thing to do, once the approximately 12 Gbytes of data has been downloaded from Steam, is to register on the game's official site, a practice that we didn't like very much (it would have been much more intuitive to use the client credentials), but which is somehow necessary to allow players to compete in multiplayer. One of the most talked about aspects of Sword Coast Legends is in fact the possibility of tackling the game cooperatively with other players or even of taking on the role of the Dungeon Master, a ~mythological~ figure introduced with some success by the first Neverwinter Nights, a true source of inspiration for the guys from n-Space. Unmissable stop at the Luskan tavern, full of quest givers. Let's face the thorny issue immediately: this very ambitious feature is probably also the most critical of the entire production of the developers stationed in Florida. The user can only set some parameters while the game automatically creates the dungeons. Those who expected to be able to make an up-to-date version of Eye of the Beholder, as was done at the time with BioWare's RPG, will be extremely disappointed to know that it is not possible to intervene, if not in a very marginal way, even on the story development: players can simply accept or decline a quest and nothing more. The Dungeon Master is left with only the possibility of placing traps and/or enemies (naturally also during the game in progress), possibly taking control of some non-player character. It's a simplistic approach that works quite well, even if it lacks a greater variety of tools that could come later via (paid?) expansions. The multiplayer department is then completed by the possibility of tackling the campaign in cooperative mode, both by joining other games and simply by leaving slots free during personal explorations; you can then choose to face adventures created by other users or even to enter a randomly generated level with the sole purpose of slicing as many monsters as possible in the company of three other players. Safe streets The story begins with a tribute to Pillars of Eternity (there are many more or less veiled quotes): the protagonist, following a caravan, is awakened by a nightmare, the same one that unites him to other warriors of the guild of 'Alba Ardente, founded years earlier by two brothers in search of the Lunar Stone, a mysterious elven artifact capable of bringing peace and serenity. In a rapid precipitation of events these premonitions will soon become reality and ours, together with a large group of heroes, will have to go in search of the dark presence that threatens the lands of Faerun. Character creation is oversimplified. The plot presents weaknesses that are evident even to the less shrewd eye, such as an excessive use of caricatured characters and little credible motivations in the actions of the enemy, who seems to be moved only by the desire to break our eggs in the basket. However the ~softer~ characters are the most successful and manage to elicit a smile in more than a few conversations; what is missing instead is the pathos and the feeling of participating in onean expedition that should take on epic tones and which instead is trivial and not very convincing. You start with choosing your avatar, selecting it from among five races (human, dwarf, elf, half-elf and halfling) and six classes (thief, wizard, paladin, warrior, cleric and ranger); from this point the first question marks begin to appear because there are no professions not properly devoted to combat such as that of the bard and the druid, just as it is not possible to create multiclass characters. We then proceed with customizing its appearance and complete the creation process by distributing the points in the six fundamental skills (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma). Although it is theoretically a very delicate and fundamental process for the development of the character, an annoyingly light-hearted approach is perceived from this stage that permeates the entire production. The hope that the first sensations are unfounded is unfortunately disappointed after a few minutes of the game, when the more sinister action side shows itself in all its ignorance. Cafone in the soul The view is typical of isometric RPGs, with the ability to rotate the camera or bring it closer as you like until you see the somatic features of the warriors. A combat phase in a co-op game Practically everything is controlled with the mouse: the left button is used to move the units and attack the highlighted monsters, while the right button manages the camera, on which it is necessary to intervene frequently as it is subject to ~schizophrenic~ behavior: when it is centered on the highlighted character, it follows him with a certain precision, but it often happens that it loses the action and forces the user to continuous repositioning (speeded up by pressing the wheel). At the bottom of the screen is a bar for quickly calling up spells and using potions. The player controls a party of four, which he can freely take control of. The artificial intelligence that governs the unselected members is really brilliant even if sometimes a bit too ~intrusive~, in the sense that it tends to override the actions requested by the player; the behavior of the enemies is not bad either, who know how to coordinate group actions decently (with mages and archers who position themselves well outside the fray) and do not disdain evasive actions. The development of the action is extremely linear and, despite the numerous sidequests suggesting a sandbox setting, in practice we will limit ourselves to facing one dungeon after another sequentially, thanks to the fact that the monsters ~level~ with the player, so that it will never happen to have to set aside the clashes at better times. Unfortunately, morality is also missing, although it is possible to initially choose which alignment to adopt. There are crossroads that unlock certain paths and close others, but this does not impact how companions or other non-player characters interact with the hero, so it will be possible to kill a helpless enemy or rob a chest in front of the hero's eyes. homeowner without anyone batting an eye. The game structure is, as mentioned, decidedly focused on fighting, as a logical consequence of some choices that will certainly leave the most hardcore players dumbfounded. We're talking about those sometimes ~useless~, but often engaging actions that break the pace of the game. In particular, there are no books to read, there are few ~textual~ quests and also the level of exploration is not the best, but above all the concept of time is completely eliminated. What a cute and friendly expression! There is no need to rest to recover physical and mental energies, which instead recharge automatically at the end of each battle; mages can therefore cast spells almost without interruption and warriors don't have to worry about reaching the last enemy bloodless, so a few moments will be enough to return to the charge. And if someone were to leave our pens, there will be no need to worry: any character, even a very ignorant pissed off dwarf, will be able to revive the comrades who fell in battle in no time at all, even during a furious melee. However Sword Coast Legends avoids the risk of taking Diablo's hack & slash road thanks to a good balance of difficulty, which invites you to use the tactical pause (which can be called up with the legendary space bar) to take advantage of the characters' abilities in the most crowded situations. The inventory is nothing short of bizarre What follows is a somewhat atypical and somewhat pleasant result, but which clashes strongly with the heritagege of Dungeons & Dragons, from which many other levels of tactics and depth are expected. n-Space and Digital Extremes have instead decided to play it safe, staying in a ~comfort zone~ in which to fish even in a pool of non-enthusiasts and neophytes of the fantasy genre. The inventory interface is bad, in which it is cumbersome to say the least to manage the equipment; then the skill menu is really ramshackle and doesn't help to give the general picture of the hero's characteristics; even the diary is dispersive and not very intuitive. In classic RPGs this is one of the most important aspects, as a lot of time is spent examining statistics and loot, but in the ignorant Sword Coast Legends such a Marchian flaw does not seem to penalize the game structure excessively, so much so that it will be used, as well as to equip the few weapons dropped by the enemies, basically to grow the character. Here of course another front of disappointment opens up because the rules tool has been ~bent~ to the needs of the video game. Regardless of race/class, all characters acquire three skill points at each level; the latter are then simply focused on combat or on identifying traps because, as written, they do not find space for those subtleties to which much more tactical productions have accustomed us. Bugs and more bugs Shifting attention to the technical aspect, it certainly cannot be said that Sword Coast Legends drives you crazy. The proprietary engine seems to be a reinterpretation of that of Neverwinter Nights: low quality textures dominate in every shot, nevertheless in the external settings there are annoying drops in frame rates that are difficult to justify. Legends? Not so The characters are hardly recognizable due to the low number of polygons which contributes to making the animations lack naturalness. On the other hand, the work done on the spells is discreet and overall both the settings and the variety of ~bad guys~ are convincing, faithful to the dictates of the Forgattem Realms. Unassailable is the work done by Inon Zur, the now famous composer who had also dealt with the soundtracks of blockbusters such as Fallout 3 and Dragon Age: Origins, as well as the first Baldur's Gate: the musical accompaniment is top notch and also the voice actors they fit the part well. The only drawback is the lack of variety of responses of the character created by the player, who responds to requests by alternating only four sentences, thus quickly becoming talkative. The list of bugs is unfortunately very long and, although the latest updates have tried to remedy the most serious flaws, annoying errors continue to occur. In more than one circumstance one of the party members got stuck in the scenario, perhaps blocked by a chest or a stone: the only solution in these cases was to restart the game. Terrible the rescue system that does not always implement the last quick save and risks losing several minutes of exploration. Problems also in online mode with lobbies that are difficult to reach or even not displayed and sporadic disconnections. The single player campaign in the initial proclamations should have been only complementary to the Dungeon Master mode, but, as we have seen, it represents the real highlight of Digital Extremes' production, it is generous in size, with a number of hours required for the completion that well exceeds thirty. Replayability is also guaranteed by the cooperative modes: for those who have a good mouth and are passionate about Sword Coast Legends it can be a good filler, even if the price of around 40 euros honestly seems over the top.", "date": "2015-11-02", "grade": "5.5"}
