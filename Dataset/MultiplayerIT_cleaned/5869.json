{"name": "Orrore o ribrezzo?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/159712-dispatcher-orrore-o-ribrezzo.html", "text": "Dispatcher's problems are well described by the story of the very first game we did. Created a character (a scientist, but if you want there are five other selectable classes), we started the single player mode finding ourselves in a small room full of objects of which we knew absolutely nothing. Without any tutorials to help us, we shopped around collecting everything. We found some health pills, credits and batteries to recharge the classic flashlight which is part of our standard equipment, probably bought second hand from some scammer, given the consumption. Finally we found a kind of tablet with an annotation inside, which introduced us to the story that the game purports to tell. We open the inventory, select the note and while we are there reading the long text, suddenly we were killed by a passing monster. How many minutes had passed since the start of the match? Maybe less than one. Above all: what was a monster doing in the initial area? What's the point of wasting its first appearance like this? The above was repeated with the second game, in which, however, we found ourselves in a closet. Even there we found some items to collect, while immediately outside the room was the monster waiting for us. This time we ducked and hid in a corner and waited for it to disappear before moving. The beginning, different from that of the first game, also made us understand that the maps are procedurally generated as in a roguelike. In reality, not all elements are random, but the idea is to offer different maps for each game. The memory of failed titles from the recent past that made a similar design choice gave us the creeps more than the monster. However, still lacking much of the information needed to fully understand the game, we set about exploring a bit, until we came across a glowing orb looming in the middle of a corridor. We got close and... died instantly. Alright, we're amateurs, but here someone just wasted the appearance of two of the four creatures that populate the game in how much? Less than five minutes? Poor gameplay Dispatcher does not have a proper single player campaign. At the beginning you can choose which of the three available levels to face and stop. The goal is always the same: to reach the escape pod on the other side of the spaceship we are on. To do this, you need to find access cards for internal areas and avoid enemies. There's not much more to tell, except that the protagonist has characteristics that can be permanently increased by finishing a level. This should make later games easier and help us select a higher difficulty. Too bad nothing works like the developers thought. But let's get back to us. After the second game that went badly, there was a third, a fourth, a fifth and so on. With each further attempt we learned something more about the game mechanics, but also about the immense limits that Dispatcher carries with it. Within an hour we managed to get to the end of the first maze, but frankly it is difficult to attribute the result to our skill. CivilSavages game is hard, but in the wrong way. Enemies can be avoided by staying hidden in the shadows or by entering a hiding place (cracks, lockers, etc.). Unfortunately, once you're spotted, it's nearly impossible to escape. Theoretically, you can save yourself by reaching a hiding place, but these are rare and often far from where you are at the time of the encounter. To say, in the first two hours of the game we managed to save ourselves twice, despite the good experience made with other horror titles which theoretically should have made us escape specialists. So the only solution is to avoid monsters? Yes, but here too there are design problems, because it is really difficult to understand where they are, despite the noise of their movements being clearly audible. We often end up being killed suddenly, because we were deceived by the very sounds that should direct us. In short, reaching the end of a level is possible, as already mentioned, but the satisfaction that is obtained by succeeding is minimal, because it is difficult to make sense of what has been done. Someone may be wondering if once you learn how to play, the procedural nature favors replayability. No, in the sense that it is difficult to get caught up in gameplay like this, poor in every respect and overall very limited. Interest in Dispatcher runs out after a very short timeme hours and it's really hard to find valid reasons to go back to playing. Don't hope to be helped by the plot, told through long texts of little value and overall really poor. We can summarize it as: something happened to the spaceship, you're left alone on board, run away. Strong stuff, no doubt about it. We reviewed the horror Dispatcher. Find out if it's worth letting yourself be scared. We are the monsters Dispatcher also has a multiplayer mode, unfortunately for us. It's not really clear how the developers pretend this works. Basically you play in the same maps as the single player mode, only the monsters are other players. The problem is that the forces involved also remain the same. Thus we have the monsters that roam omnipotent massacring the poor humans with their lethal attacks, without the latter being able to do anything to defend themselves, except try to escape. We played several games online, all with the same results: the monsters wiped out the humans inexorably. We have also noticed that as the days have gone by since launch it has become increasingly difficult to find anyone on the servers. In fact, how can you put up with multiplayer like this? Legends tell that by growing the character it becomes possible to survive the monsters. We honestly don't find it hard to believe, but it's hard to imagine someone who wants to spend so many hours with Dispatcher that his character is strong enough to play online, against who knows who, since we imagine that he will soon be completely abandoned. Ah, we almost forgot. In single player there is also the Funny Hunt mode, in which you take on the role of a monster who has to kill luminous bots. Entertaining for three minutes, until you realize that bots offer no challenge and that killing them serves no purpose. No, not even the beautiful graphics save it from the oblivion it deserves. The Unreal Engine 4 has allowed an excellent rendering of metallic surfaces, even if a little plasticky. At least initially going around to see the play of light and the reflections on the walls is a good reason to keep playing. Even the creatures are well done, despite having a very banal design. Too bad there isn't a lot to see and that the environments are all very similar.", "date": "2015-11-26", "grade": "4.2"}
