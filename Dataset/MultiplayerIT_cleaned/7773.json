It was therefore quite natural to observe that a series came to life from that sensational hit, which after Where's my Perry? from last year expands further this season by raising the bar even higher. Long live Mickey Yes, because for the third iteration of the franchise, the Studios have decided to bother him, the character on which the Disney empire was born and founded; we are obviously talking about Mickey Mouse, the anthropomorphic mouse protagonist of cartoons, comics, and not infrequently also of video games. Specifically, in Where's My Mickey Mouse? an artistic connection was created between the style adopted in the game and that chosen for a new series of television shorts, characterized by clear references to the older but perhaps more amusing Mickey Mouse. In addition to the fascinatingly retro aesthetic, in fact, it is also the character of the protagonist that is more sparkling, gascon and clever, fortunately far from that boy scout good-naturedness that has flattened his personality in recent years. In Where's My Mickey? the hero is in fact engaged not in catechizing the pranks of his companions, but in more amusing tasks that go from producing doses of lemonade for an infinite series of thirsty patrons, to extinguishing a flame before it reaches a case of dynamite, to facing a competition of gardening by watering your plants to reach space with a water-powered spacecraft. References to the TV series are also resolved in short animated sequences that introduce the different worlds and fill the interludes between one level and another. The aesthetic result therefore, although often simplistic and almost stylized, appeared to us spot on and pleasant; the characterization of such an important protagonist as Mickey Mouse evidently required a great deal of attention, and the mission can be considered accomplished in this respect. Much more conventional is instead the work done on the gameplay, which follows in an almost intact way what has already been seen in the two previous chapters of the series. A statement that in fact should already mark a watershed in the potential buyers of this Where's my Mickey Mouse?; in fact, those who loved Aqua and Perry and did not get tired of their mechanics will find a welcome more of the same, while on the contrary those who did not appreciate their predecessors will be very unlikely to change their minds. The basic concept is in fact always that of a puzzle game in which the goal is to bring a sufficient amount of water (or similar liquid) from one point of the level to another, creating paths in the sand and interacting with different elements. The major novelty introduced on this occasion are the clouds, which can be loaded and unloaded with water and moved from their position by the wind. For the rest, however, everything is very, very familiar, with the pros and cons that this can mean in relation to a series that has reached its third episode without concrete changes of any kind. Of course, one could complain about the fact that the eighty levels are finished quickly (but in the past new ones have been released through free updates), or that the two worlds of Goofy have to be bought with an additional in-app purchase, but for the price at which it is offered Where's My Mickey? (from 0.76 to 1.79 depending on the version) we certainly can't complain too much. Where is my Mickey Mouse? continues on the path well traced by the previous episodes of the series", "date": "2013-06-25", "grade": "8.0"}
