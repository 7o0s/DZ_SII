NeocoreGames didn't miss the opportunity with Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr which confronts us with a universe full of systems and missions to be tackled in the desired order, provided you have enough firepower to do so. And this is precisely the gist of the Early Access version of a title which, unfortunately, has not yet kept its most intriguing promises. For now, in fact, the multiplayer is limited to the cooperative and a simple domination mode while the campaign and the sandbox mode are still absent. Furthermore, the third character, the Psyker, is not available leaving us with only two characters available. But we must also consider that we are talking about an alpha version that was probably released to forfeit the funds necessary to achieve what is an ambitious goal. A goal that approaches with the implementation of some story element in some missions, appetizer of the first two chapters of the campaign that should arrive during the Early Access phase. A walk in the Caligari sector Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr is a classic action RPG in form and particular in mechanics starting from overheating and reloading weapons to get to the cover system. The latter, although limited to specific structures, represents a significant addition to the classic action RPG recipe and fits well with the suppression which reduces the character's operability when he is overwhelmed by a shower of bullets and grenades . However, it contributes to slowing down a gameplay that despite the speed modifiers and the greater agility of the Assassin, also equipped with dodging, is rather slow, even gigantic in the case of the Crusader. But the choice is deliberate and perhaps even forced given the nature of the characters, also differentiated by the resource used and part of the equipment, who are armored soldiers who are not subtle, pieces of a gameplay based on calculating the power of enemy fire, your own resistance, retreat, take into account positioning and dose resources. The variables, therefore, abound and include the equipment that can be obtained as game loot, found in the inevitable chests, built with crafting or obtained directly from the classic merchant placed in the hub, who as usual gives us junk at exorbitant prices . Equipment slots include timed bonuses related to the health kit, two loadouts for weapons, one piece for armor, three implants, two miscellaneous slots and two slots for Signums that grant specific bonuses such as damage increase to enemies of a certain size. Furthermore, each armor guarantees a powerful special ability and each weapon has, in addition to a different range, different fire modes that represent game skills in all respects. The shotgun, for example, allows you to make short bursts, causes huge area damage and allows you to knock down an enemy, which is very useful with particularly bad ones. The laser, on the other hand, allows you to emit a continuous beam that damages enemies in the same line, while the repeating weapons allow you to shoot backwards. Then there are shields, stun devices and grenades for an arsenal that is quite varied, with fans of hand-to-hand combat I can count on both the assassin's Infiltrator specialization and the inevitable Juggernaut, a variant of the Crusader, who punishes the guilty with sword and shield. And the growth of the characters also passes through a skill tree, based on the leveling up of the account, with twelve branches that allow you to further specialize the characters. The shadow of the great promise The set of variables determines a value that represents the potential of our character and helps us understand whether or not he is able to face a mission. However, there is a pinch of leeway to tackle more demanding missions, which among other things can be created with the Tarot system, and this is a point in favor of gameplay balance. A balance that also passes through missions with limited lives, paid modifiers, gigantic creatures and a rapidly growing difficulty level which, despite the low intelligence of the opponents, promises hours of combat against three enemy factions, to whichFour more will be added between October and the final release, all with mechanics and features consistent with the setting. For this reason, the choice of weapons is important and even more so in the case of the bosses who represent the strong point of the game, if only in terms of design. Titanic tanks, famous personalities and hordes of rather well animated enemies undoubtedly raise the technical tenor of a title that also gives us good dynamic lighting, destructible barriers and elements of the scenario, spectacular explosions and convincing collapses. Unfortunately, the weight of the still too rough code weighs everything on the frame rate which collapses even with a GTX 1080 despite the polygonal and complexity being rather limited. But we must remember that we are in the alpha full of bugs, often even capable of blocking a mission, of a game that is linked to the servers, and therefore to the permanent connection, with all the problems involved. For this reason, the imprecisions in the control and the maps which, partly procedurally generated, are not very inspired and often monotonous, are of greater concern. The settings, however, are suggestive and the new missions set in snowy areas are not bad. Finally, most of the time the cooperative works adequately and PvP is not lacking, although it is limited to a spartan and little played Domination mode. However, the greatest promises are missing, namely complex PvP modes such as the defense of fortresses and the much coveted sandbox mode, for now only marginally shown, which everyone is waiting for. For this and for the lack of a large part of systems, factions and missions we find it difficult to recommend the NeocoreGames title at this juncture, although it is undoubtedly an interesting product, full of potential and destined to evolve.", "date": "2017-09-03", "grade": null}
