It is certainly not new for Ubisoft to release additional content focused on characters other than the protagonist, see Freedom Cry for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, but T-Bone's adventure had been widely publicized, so much so that it was known of its existence before of the main game's release. Let's say that the only surprise is the presence of Raymond Kenney, the real name of the eccentric hacker with dreadlocks who had already helped Aiden Pearce in his work of revenge. The scenario is still Chicago, some time has passed since the conclusion of the main story and the good T-Bone is still snooping where he shouldn't, in this case the Blume offices. Having narrowly escaped the wrath of the guards, our long-haired man is preparing to leave the city for good when an old colleague forces him to take on a new series of missions. Pearce limits himself on this occasion to a very brief cameo and nothing more. Watch Dogs: Bad Blood offers a ~more of the same~ to those who loved the main adventure You can't go away with a deca This sort of tutorial introduction introduces us to the new narrative micro-universe set up by Ubisoft for the ten missions we are facing. The map is the same one we loved in Watch Dogs, but Bad Blood lets us experience it from a different point of view and in the role of a character very far from the impassive Aiden Pearce. T-Bone is equipped with new resources, in addition to those we already know, including the miraculous mobile phone ~that does everything with a single button~, we are talking about a very effective taser gun and a radio-controlled model named Eugene, used in various missions as a drone for patrol, but also as a remote controlled explosive. The idea is taken from the Ghost Recon series in a self-referential jubilation, a habit that the French house often indulges in, but we must say that it works quite well, adding a little freshness to the well-established structure of the missions. That said, let's not expect incredible upheavals on the gameplay side, we are talking about additional content prepared exclusively for those who want to extend their stay in the Ubisoft title code, looking for new challenges. And rightly so, it will be the task of the continuation to present the biggest news. Bad Blood also adds the inevitable bonus investigations, but above all new secondary missions called Street Sweep, to be played both alone and in co-op, in which we can go wild by massacring a series of criminal gangs, but also the hateful fixers. A decidedly appreciable addition that brings various bonuses capable of facilitating Raymond's adventure, the missions are also always different thanks to random enemies and environments, considerably increasing the rather short campaign, between 4 and six hours. Playstation 4 trophies Watch Dogs: Bad Blood adds ten new trophies related to the three acts of the main story, but above all to the various side missions, including those Street Swap alone or in co-op. One of the coolest requires you to kill four enemies at once using the Eugene radio-controlled car. Good luck! Immersed in the Ubisoft universe The main campaign has its ups and downs. As mentioned, the backbone of the gameplay is the one we are used to, essentially taking the best of Watch Dogs, with some appreciable innovations such as the possibility of locking up the guards in a room, controlling the doors with the mobile phone. We liked some recycling of settings from the main game less, considering the not exactly sensational duration, we could have opted for completely new interiors, given that we already have to deal with a city we know by heart. On the other hand, the protagonist is appreciable, who does not disappoint after the excellent figure as Aiden's sidekick in the main adventure, proving to be charismatic in his mix of genius and nonconformism. Let's not hide that our distrust towards this DLC was great at the beginning, the suspicion of having a collection of missions linked by a simple narrative pretext, and with a new character, was strong, but in the end, while not deviating too much from this description, Watch Dogs: Bad Blood proves to be an enjoyable content, working in its parts and being very pleasant when it mentions other products of the French company, such as the aforementioned Ghost Recon, but also Splinter Cell and Far Cry. Eugene is an addition that gives strategic variety to the formula, while the Street Sweep missions are the most successful part and able to offer the greatest longevity. Watch Dogs: Bad Blood certainly doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does what it's supposed to do, offering a ~more of the same~ to those who loved the main adventure, but also those who didn't manage to fully digest Aiden Pearce, from whom T-Bone distances himself in an almost antithetical way. Those who didn't particularly love the game base is unlikely to change his mind with this add-on.", "date": "2014-09-30", "grade": null}
