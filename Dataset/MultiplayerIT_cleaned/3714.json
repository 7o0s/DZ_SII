{"name": "Cuphead", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cuphead-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Cuphead is a bad game. But be careful with the meaning of the adjective: ~bad~ means the level of general difficulty of the work, its forcing the player to try, try again and again try certain levels before finally being able to complete them. But Cuphead is ~bad~ also because it sells the Mug Brothers as protagonists, while in reality all attention is focused very soon on the almost thirty bosses present (19 of which are main, the remaining secondary extras). It therefore happens that you remember in a very general way having played Cuphead, while some of these rascals have remained well etched in your memory: how many times did you have to repeat the level of Botanical Panic before knocking out that cursed overgrown carrot? And the wretched witch who could take on the shape and powers of the major zodiac signs? When a video game manages to leave mixed but particularly vivid feelings in the players, it usually means that it is a valid game. Cuphead undoubtedly is, and it is one of the most brilliant productions of recent years. And now that it's finally available on Nintendo Switch, a console that continues to sell millions of units, many players who missed it on PC and Xbox One will be able to realize it. Reading this review of Cuphead for Nintendo Switch will convince you. Italian translation: a comeback in style A year and a half ago Simone Tagliaferri reviewed Cuphead on PC, giving it a very high rating. Probably most of the players who have tried Cuphead over time, even without being able to complete it, will agree with that vote that we feel like re-proposing on Nintendo Switch. The reasons are the most diverse: a very inspired and visually, technically and graphically very valid artistic direction; a memorable audio sector, with accompanying melodies in battles that enter the head and never leave, associating very specific feelings with them; charisma, in virtually every aspect; a valid, fun gameplay, which sometimes leads to apparently prohibitive levels of difficulty but (with due care) always approachable. And let's add that the conversion for Nintendo Switch is one of the best in the short history of the most recent Nintendo console, enriched by an excellent, fitting and equally inspired translation into Italian. Let's spend a few words on these innovations related to the conversion on Nintendo Switch: too often we complain that the most beautiful titles that arrive on the market are not translated into Italian; so once in a while a developer takes the trouble to adapt it, one has to look closely at how it was done. Translation between two different languages is never easy: it doesn't matter that the dialogues and descriptions are many rather than few; the correspondence between two languages, at all levels, is never perfectly identical. Think, for example, of the Italian proverb ~it rains in cats~: how do you translate it into English, so that it represents exactly the same concept? You can't, unless you decide to use something very similar (but never identical): ~It's raining cats and dogs~. The bowls are lost. Those who have played Cuphead before in English and will return to it in Italian will notice exactly these two things: the first is that there is no direct match in the translation. This is normal, because just as shown in the previous example some English expressions and puns cannot be rendered in the Italian language in the same way. The second thing you'll notice, however, is how well the translation makes sense of the original language. Botanic Panic has become, for example, Panic Botanico: an excellent translation, somehow the original pun has remained. The level of the genius, however, presented a boss called Djimmi The Great (Djimmi the Great), where Jinn wanted to recall the oriental term that indicates the figure of the genius, a creature in antiquity considered most often malevolent. In Italian, the bad guy has become Eugenio the Genius: okay, Eugenio is a proper name that doesn't make Jinn, but at least some of the initial fantasy effect has been recovered with the identical ending between the terms (EuGENIO the GENIUS). This attention to translation and fidelity to the original work and language are commendable elements, which must be emphasized and which the attentive player must realize. Performance on Nintendo Switch Let's get to the thorny point of the matter: how Cuphead is doing on Nintendo Switch, dal performance point of view? The answer is: very well. The MDHR Studio title reaches 1080p and 60 FPS in TV (or docked) mode, practically never abandoning them; two slowdowns will have occurred on hours and hours of play. In portable mode, the graphics sector must give something to the resolution: it goes to 720p, but always accompanied by 60 FPS. A mandatory fluidity in order not to lose any of the liveliness of the situations, the pressing speed both in the clashes against the dangerous bosses and in the more sporadic (but equally lethal) run & gun levels. Nothing is missing, obviously, not even from the point of view of content: nothing has been cut out of the need for capacity on Nintendo Switch; simply Cuphead really seems to have been born for the Nintendo console, from the beginning. On the other hand, some details show that this is not the case, especially when playing in tabletop or portable mode. First of all the Joy-Con, peripherals as far away as possible from the controllers needed for a similar game, simply because they are uncomfortable. You get used to everything logically, but if you have a Pro Controller at your disposal we strongly advise you to opt for that from the beginning, and trust us: the difference is the same as between day and night. Furthermore, the smaller screen in portable mode does not help to orientate well in the game levels, especially in the run & gun ones: everything is so frantic and fast that not distinguishing one element from the other can lead to immediate death. This is not a problem with the game itself, but a consequence of the reduced and condensed screen in portable mode. Probably, even in this second case, it is possible to get used to it: however, if you have a nice TV at hand (and the Pro Controller, don't forget the Pro Controller) play with that. As for the gameplay, as you can easily imagine, Cuphead is not a game that ages easily: a year and a half later, not only has its charisma remained unchanged, but its fame has even grown. Enthusiasts who immediately saw its potential continue to praise it; all the other crowd of onlookers that has accumulated and clamored for its conversion to the other missing consoles has now been (partially) satisfied. We have no doubt that sooner or later MDHR will present Cuphead 2 to the world, but it will certainly still take a long time: first, because a sequel to a title like this requires care and time to gather ideas; second, because a full-bodied DLC is on its way which, among other things, will introduce a new playable character, this time female. Yes, the DLC will also come to the Nintendo Switch. In all of this, and recalling the important and accurate conversion work, to point out that the introductory price has remained the same as a year and a half ago seems almost derisory. Buy Cuphead and play with it.", "date": "2019-04-18", "grade": "9.2"}
