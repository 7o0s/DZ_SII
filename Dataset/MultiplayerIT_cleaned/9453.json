This was the welcome that the States guaranteed to the practically unknown - in Europe - WayForward Technologies product entitled Shantae: Risky's Revenge, a result that makes even more noise if we consider that we are talking about a title for DSi, distributed only through the DSiWare digital delivery store; an environment, the latter, born under good auspices but in reality which has almost never proved capable of offering a sufficient level of quality or a sparkling development environment. But obviously there is always the exception that proves the rule... I want my Super Nintendo back Shantae: Risky's Revenge is the sequel to an excellent game released in 2002 on Game Boy Color, which however for a whole series of reasons never left the North American borders; if therefore for the Yankee fans of the historic Nintendo portable Shantae it has become a sort of small cult classic to be found on online auction sites, in the rest of the world there are very few who have heard of the product in question. After almost 10 years WayForward has therefore decided that it was time to give a succession to this pleasant debut, and Shantae: Risky's Revenge is the result of such a long wait; following the foundations laid by the predecessor, also in this case it is a ~metroidvania~-style 2D platformer, with a graphic style that cheekily but beautifully recalls the golden age of 16-bit. ~Obviously~ the debut on the European DSiWare had to wait over 4 months compared to the American release, without real reasons given the digital distribution and the absence of any translation, but so be it; also under this aspect evidently we wanted to maintain the tradition of the good old days of cartridges. But let's move on to the game: the protagonist is Shantae, a half-genius girl, engaged as often happens in a solitary mission against the arch-enemy of the moment (in this case arch-enemy, the pirate Risky Boots) to thus keep the peaceful life of the placid Sequin land. The main weapon in the heroine's possession is her prodigious hair, thanks to which she can unleash something similar to whips to eliminate enemies scattered throughout the levels. The latter will thus be able to eventually release hearts to recover energy, potions for the magic bar or gems to spend in shops; the purchase is basically based around 3 skills (fireball, rotating sphere and lightning bolt cloud) which can be upgraded with two further levels. Finally, as the adventure progresses, you will also have the ability to transform into 3 creatures (monkey, elephant and mermaid) so as to be able to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Basically nothing new under the sun then, but it would be unintelligent to expect innovations in a product that is so obviously inspired by the clichs of the classics of the genre of the glorious two-dimensional past. Obviously, the difference is made by the realization, and in this case, however, together with many lights, there are also some shadows. Belly dance As a mandatory premise, it is necessary to decide on which basis to evaluate Shantae: Risky's Revenge; if we want to consider it within the confines of DSiWare, and taking into account the price at which it is sold (1200 points, therefore 12 euros) there is not much difficulty in promoting the effort of WayForward across the board, which imposes itself without too many difficulty as the best title available on the Nintendo portable online platform. It is in fact a solid product, with more than sufficient longevity (5-6 hours to complete it, with the further chance of extending its duration to reach 100%) and graced by a graphic component of great value with many details, different levels of parallax, excellent animations and a particularly pleasant and colorful style. However, going to observe the game with a broader perspective, judging its absolute values without filters and premises, Shantae: Risky's Revenge reveals some defects that simply prevent the adventure from approaching the classics of the genre it is inspired by. The most important is certainly the level design, fluctuating in quality and often too linear; solutions such as the change of plane in depth, although imperfect in practical implementation, could have been applied more frequently, since in their absence most of the movements take place trivially with a monochord progression that is only rarely interrupted by some short platform passages . To see something more complex you have to face the dungeons, efeffectively more pleasant and rewarding at a playful level; in this case, however, it is a pity that the map, positioned on the lower screen, turns out to be so superficial and unable to give concrete support to the exploratory phase. Even the combat system, not particularly gratifying, in some cases becomes a source of irritation in the face of the inevitable respawn of enemies added to the very frequent need for backtracking imposed by the game structure. One last note on the lack of translation, which is even more annoying given the 4-month wait for the European release; we are not talking about an Rpg, and given the indications provided during the often important dialogues to know where to go, perhaps an extra effort could have been made to favor European players less familiar with English.", "date": "2011-02-23", "grade": "7.8"}
