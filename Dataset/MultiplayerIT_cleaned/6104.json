Thinking about how many things have changed in such a long period is creepy, yet today there are still millions of people around the world who are playing Tohru Iwatani's masterpiece. The reason is simple: it is a product suspended in time, immortal, everlasting, which not by chance has entered mass culture, transcending the limits of the world of video games. From 1980 to today, the brand has inevitably been used to create direct sequels, platforms, 3D adventures and so on, with often questionable, if not downright bankruptcy, results. Yet Namco has never given up on the idea of exploiting its popularity, which is why the latest attempt in this direction has taken on the features of a freemium endless game for mobile platforms. Before yelling at the sacrilege by tearing your clothes off, we advise you to continue reading at least a little longer... Pac-Man 256 is a great way to celebrate 35 years of a true video game icon Happy pac day The first lesson that Namco seems to have learned is that the name alone is not enough. We need a team behind it that knows its stuff, with valid ideas and concrete skills. This description fits perfectly on Hipster Whale, an Australian team made up of only 4 people who have behind them the gigantic success of Crossy Road, a reinterpretation of Frogger's idea which has earned something like 10 million dollars in the first 90 days of publication. From the collaboration (also with the support of 3 Sprockets) this Pac-Man 256 was born, a game that already from the title knows how to make itself loved: 256 is in fact a reference to the elusive level linked to a historical bug of the very first Pac-Man, which caused random symbols to appear on the right side of the screen making it almost impossible to continue. However, the homage is not only in the title, but on the contrary it extends to the very foundations of the gameplay designed by Hipster Whale in support of the endless formula: in practice, the infinite labyrinth must be faced without hesitation and slowdowns precisely because behind the yellow protagonist it is destined to appear just the bug 256, from which we must inevitably try to escape for as long as possible. All this through scrolling from the bottom up but with an inclined 3D perspective that clearly recalls the one adopted in Crossy Road (and also the interface is practically identical). The result is a gameplay that, although it certainly cannot be defined fresh or innovative, appears fully successful: the need for survival is accompanied by that of the search for the highest score, which passes through the collection of pills (possibly without interruptions to increase the multiplier) , fruit and the eventual elimination of ghosts. The latter maintain the role of absolute importance that they also had in the original, representing a constant threat to the player. The color of each of them determines its behavior, a factor that will soon be well memorized in order to aspire to stay alive as long as possible. The final score can then be shared in the online rankings, so as to compare it with that of your friends. Where Pac-Man 256 offers the greatest element of detachment from the progenitor, however, is in the presence of power ups, which translate into a series of timed power-ups that can be collected, and therefore activated, simply by passing over them. These can be a laser that pulverizes any unfortunate ghost that comes across it, or a freeze capable of slowing down its movements, or even a tornado, a bomb, a giant Pac-Man, a streak of fire, invisibility and so on: all objects that increase the variety and strategic aspect of the game, thus making it interesting even over long distances and at least partially mitigating the inevitable repetitiveness. As for the freemium component, now a real cross of mobile gaming, it must be said that even in this case Namco and Hipster Whale have made choices that are all in all acceptable and not too intrusive. In practice, if you agree not to use power-ups, Pac-Man 256 offers no limit to its use. To activate these advantages, however, it is necessary to spend one credit of the 6 available, which should be understood more or less as tokens in a coin-op; each credit is recovered over the course of 10 minutes, or you have to dig into your wallet at the price of 0.99 for 12 ~tokens~ or 7.99 for unlimited tokens. Then there are the coins, to be collected scattered throughout the levels or through the achievement of certain objectives, or by watching advertising videos; these allow you to improve the pupgrades, amplifying their duration and effectiveness.", "date": "2015-08-25", "grade": "8.8"}
