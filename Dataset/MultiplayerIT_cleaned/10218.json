In short, certainly not what can be defined as the standard with regard to Wii productions, and consequently a clear sign of how it would not have been a simple sop to be fed to fans of the series. So let's see what came of it. Story of a dude From the outset, it is clear that Square Enix's watchword with this Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles - The Crystal Bearers has been ~renewal~: will that already materialize in the storyline and in the setting that form the backdrop to the events of game. The setting was placed a hundred years after the events narrated in the original Crystal Chronicles on GameCube, in a world in which the Yuke tribe was completely exterminated, causing an almost total disappearance of magic, supplanted by technology controlled by the dominant faction , the Lilties. In such a scenario, the user is called upon to take on the role of Layle, a young mercenary belonging to the despised category of crystal bearers: people born with fragments of magical crystal implanted in their bodies, capable of casting spells and for this very reason feared and relegated to the margins of society. In light of these facts, our hero is not exactly the prototype of sympathy and altruism, an aspect that could cause many to struggle considerably to forge an emotional bond with the protagonist. In any case, the plot underlying Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles - The Crystal Bearers turns out to be good all in all, even without ever reaching the heights of epicness typical of the main saga: Square Enix's commitment in this sense, however, c it is and it can be seen, and to prove it, it is enough to mention the considerable amount of cutscenes with which the product is stuffed, most of which are also characterized by a high-level direction. As a counterweight, it must be said that these sequences sometimes take up excessive space in the game economy, often resulting in preponderance compared to the actual playful part: consequently, those who want to get closer to the title must plan to spend a good part of the 20-30 hours needed to complete the adventure with arms crossed, in what can be considered a strength or a weakness depending on the user's tastes. On the other hand, it is difficult to find something good in the English dubbing, so caricatured as to be annoying and which can boast the inglorious distinction of relying on some of the most shrill voices that the history of video games remembers. Fortunately, Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles - The Crystal Bearers does not disappoint from a graphic point of view, and indeed proves to be one of the best things done on the Wii in this area: the polygonal models of the characters are excellent, also as regards the facial animations that are emphasized by the aforementioned cutscenes, all of more than good workmanship. The care taken in the creation of the scenarios is also decidedly remarkable, never too extensive but detailed and rich in side elements, while the icing on the cake is represented by the light effects that abound especially during the battles. A hundred energy things Moving on to the more strictly playful front, the clear intention of the developers to offer something new in the panorama of the series also shines through here, even if the results are not exactly those hoped for. So here is that Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles - The Crystal Bearers looks like a third-person action game, seasoned with just a splash of RPG elements and a really massive amount of mini-games. A courageous choice, but which risks not finding a precise place within the Wii catchment area: if therefore the hard core of hardcore could turn up its nose in front of a gameplay so far from the traditional role-playing components, on the other hand it is difficult to imagine that a large number of casual gamers can spontaneously approach a brand like that of Final Fantasy. Leaving aside similar conjectures, the reality is that of a hybrid title, which tries to do a lot of different things by alternating good intuitions with very unsuccessful elements. A strong emphasis is placed on the control system, which uses the Nunchuck + Remote combo: the analog stick is assigned to Layle's movement,while with the on-screen pointer it is possible to lock-on certain targets (be these objects or NPCs) and move the controller in one of the four directions to throw them, move them or interact with them in a contextual way. A practice, this, which fulfills multiple purposes, proving to be indispensable for collecting items, solving simple environmental puzzles, hanging from ledges and above all to fight the enemies who will find themselves in their path: in fact, all the battles revolve around this skill of Layle, which can hurl enemies against elements of the scenario or vice versa, bearing in mind that every opponent - especially if it is a boss - has weaknesses that must be discovered and exploited properly. An experience remotely comparable to that of Star Wars: the Force Unleashed, even if not everything works perfectly here, on the contrary: the game often confuses the orders given by the player, preventing you from launching your targets in the desired direction, and in principle the fights denote a basic repetitiveness mitigated only in part by the variables brought into play in certain situations. Different speech as regards the numerous and varied mini-games that you will face during the adventure: perfectly integrated into the fabric of the game, these divertissements alternate some spectacular moments (see the Sin & Punishment-style shooter immediately following the introduction ) to many others decidedly subdued, to the point that one can come to consider them more of a nuisance than a plus to the playful variety. Again, the camera management system leaves much to be desired, the absence of a properly made map often forces you to wander aimlessly and the lack of serious interactions with NPCs makes the cities of - albeit beautiful - empty containers. All aspects which, added to those previously described and combined with the many structural ingenuities that are found on their paths, can only bury the global quality of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles - The Crystal Bearers. And it is a pity, because the Square Enix product certainly does not lack happy intuitions, one above all the possibility of using combinations of raw materials to create new items of equipment and accessories: but the feeling is that the Japanese developers wanted to throw too many elements sketched in the cauldron, with the result of offering users a title full of facets but all fundamentally raw.", "date": "2010-02-02", "grade": "6.3"}
