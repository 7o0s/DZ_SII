{"name": "Piccoli infami", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/99464-little-deviants-piccoli-infami.html", "text": "In the launch line-up of each console there is always that slightly less ambitious game whose only role is to demonstrate, in the clearest and most direct way possible, the capabilities of the machine in question, especially if these capabilities are less traditional than the usual. The quality of the game itself is relatively important, its task is to intrigue console buyers, especially if they don't know the device well, and to suggest the potential of its features, having fun just enough. It's a great preview, accessible to all, understandable by anyone, and if the game is of high quality, all the better. Little Deviants is obviously just such a game, designed to immediately demonstrate, within a few seconds, the peculiar characteristics of PlayStation Vita, probably more explicitly than any other launch game. The problem is that it doesn't do it so well and, in some cases, it even risks being counterproductive advertising. Playstation 3 trophies To unlock 45 bronze, 8 silver, 1 gold and 1 platinum Trophies, the player will have to arm himself with a lot of patience and unlock each region and each minigame, earning lots of points, collecting all the various stars and bonus icons, sometimes even performing particular actions at the within a level such as completing it within a certain time limit or by interacting in a certain order with the elements of the scenario. Checcarini! The deviants are a band of aliens who crashed on our planet and are forced to rebuild their spaceship while also escaping the clutches of evil robots who want to capture them. Despite the presence of a ~story mode~, there is very little narrative in Little Deviants and the cutscenes that introduce the various stages are sometimes incomprehensible, but this is certainly not the goal of the game and therefore it is quite useless to make fussy about the narrative gaps of what wants to be, to all intents and purposes, a simple container of minigames. Not for this BigBig Studios has rested on its laurels without worrying about offering a product that is at least technically pleasant, and in fact Little Deviants enjoys a cosmetic that certainly does not make one cry for a miracle, considering that it is sold together with Uncharted: The Golden Abyss and Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3, but which manages to stand out for the captivating and stylized style of the cute deviants and a garish color palette, enhanced by the PlayStation Vita OLED screen. The deviants, which in some ways remind us a bit of pokmon, live their adventures in a polygonal world which perhaps does not fully show the muscles of the console, but which is subject to the laws of physics with which the new Sony handheld can interact through the various control systems implemented in its circuits. And in fact it is on what Little Deviants presses his hand from the very first screen: absolutely no buttons and analog sticks or the directional cross are needed to play, everything is controlled with the front or back touch-screen, with the motion sensor , even with the microphone. Apart from the sporadic use of the back keys in a handful of mini-games, the use of conventional keys is completely abolished in favor of intuitive touch-screen menu navigation and various control methods imposed from time to time by the turn minigame. On paper the idea is great, but the execution leaves something to be desired... Checc@##0! Little Deviants offers about thirty mini-games divided into six ~regions~: at the beginning of the game, needless to say, we can access only one region and mini-game and only by reaching a certain score is it possible to unlock the next mini-game. In addition, completing one successfully, regardless of the score achieved, we will receive a piece of the spaceship of the deviants and once all the pieces have been collected in a region, the next one will be unlocked together with a new mini-game and the cycle will repeat until the last region and the completion of the ~story~. Little Deviants seems to put the emphasis above all on the scores achieved in each minigame, on which the total replayability of the title should be based, so much so that it is possible to compare them online with those of our friends who own their console and a copy of the game. From this point of view, therefore, Little Deviants certainly offers a more than fair amount and variety of mini-games based on the particular characteristics of the machine, the problem is not only the fact that they are not all accessible from the start, and it also seems right to us, but more than anything that some of them are really frustrating and not very fun, especially for the questionable implementation of the aforementioned features. In one of the most successful, clearly inspired by the classic ~whack-a-mole~, dovremo observe a farm and hit the robots that will appear in front of doors and windows by touching the front or rear touch-screen depending on the point they are facing, avoiding hitting deviants and humans in the heat. This section works really well and is very enjoyable but the next one, in which we will have to use the motion sensor to align a free-falling deviant with a series of rings suspended in mid-air, is a real drama due to the imprecise answer to player inputs. These are just two examples of the fluctuating quality of the various mini-games included in the package, which therefore go from being really fun and satisfying (especially those based on augmented reality, it must be said) to becoming real exercises of frustration, moreover difficult to use in environments where which all in all it might be inappropriate to wriggle like mad to hit imaginary robots in the room. And for a portable console designed to play everywhere, this is certainly not a small problem.", "date": "2012-02-21", "grade": "6.0"}
