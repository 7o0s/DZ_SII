Editor's note), this is the full name of the game, as reported a few lines above, it exploits the 'combat' system between cards studied by Upper Deck - a well-known manufacturer of playing cards - called 'vs. battle System', a system that despite not having the depth of a Magic or the immediacy of games like Pokemon, has been able to create a large group of followers over the years. As you will surely understand, the title is nothing more than a card game based on the Marvel universe, a decidedly boundless universe full of characters, supporting actors, settings and elements that are absolutely exploitable for a game with this type of structure. The game begins with Professor Xavier who introduces the player to his institute for gifted young people, a place where you will be subjected to a very long and decidedly detailed tutorial which explains in detail (but in a decidedly too confusing way for reasons that we will see in below) what are the rules and the possibilities offered to the player during the games. The story, like any good Marvel story, has two different points of view: the one on the side of the 'villains' (the bad guys) and the one on the side of the 'heroes' (the good guys), both factions are characterized by an unmemorable story divided in 12 chapters that take the player by the hand in a crescendo of special powers and spectacular card battles. The battle of numbers The real battle is divided into different phases in which the opponents prepare their battle table by strategically positioning the cards which are divided into hero, accessory and stage cards. While the first ones are those that represent Marvel characters in all respects and are designed to attack the opponent, the other two are both defensive and offensive support cards for the player, especially useful in the intermediate stages of combat, those in which the player is forced to make decisions to repel the opponent's attack or to launch a decisive one. Unfortunately, the calibration of the difficulty does not shine in its own light, leaving the outcome of the battles more than to the player's tactical intelligence, to the posthumous construction of one's deck and luck in drawing the right cards at the right time. Less as you progress through the story it is possible to come into possession of new and more powerful and complete cards. Reaching the final stages of the story mode is in fact the only way to unlock the most powerful cards in the game, and find the right balance of your deck, thus avoiding that in the middle of a nerve-racking fight the very weak card that we would never want to come out fish. The battle of numbers However, MTCG is a card game and nothing more, and if on the one hand the possibility of finding practically all the characters that have ever appeared in Marvel albums can be a call for all fans, on the other it represents a game that is decidedly sparse and with a graphic layout that leaves a lot of room for the player's imagination and very little for the actual representation of the scenes, heroes and super villains. Although the initial tutorial is long and detailed, it can do little in front of the impetuous graphic representation of the game, with cards that are too small and tiny texts, which do nothing but create problems for the player both in the phase of choosing the cards and in the effective understanding of what are the powers of the same. The sound realization unfortunately does not even remotely reach the sufficiency with very few songs that at first listening want to recall the marvel atmospheres of cartoons, films and video games of the past but which only manage to cause great headaches due to the excessive repetitiveness, especially in relation to the fact that often matches can last up to an hour. Marvel Trading Card Game is not a bad game, it just has the great misfortune of being absolutely niche and very very complex for those who are not used to card games of this type. If on the one hand you will be able to find characters and situations from the entire Marvel universe, on the other if you don't know how to use them they will be of little use, transforming what is usually fun into frustration. However, the biggest flaw remains that of the game's graphic layout (really prohibitive in the long run), and it does little to solve the possibility offered by the DS compared to the PSP to view the game in book mode. Pros: Hundreds of cards present Vs. battle System Definitely long-lived Cons: Infinitely difficult and very very niche Graphic setting to forget Sound at times (long) annoying One of the most Florentine fashions everi of the last few years is undoubtedly that of playing cards. Magic was the historic forerunner of this movement, consolidated over the years by important brands such as Pokemon and Yu-Gi Oh!. All these names have also had a more or less successful transposition into digital over the years, thanks above all to the advent of portable consoles, which have often and willingly become real portable 'decks' for all fans of the world. A separate story has always been made by Marvel, which, by initially leaving out the world of cards and throwing itself more vigorously into heroclixes (a cross between cards and miniature action figures) has taken the step towards the media-video game a few years late. But given that the saying reads 'better late than never' it is with this spirit that 1st Playable Production (the fathers of the recent Puzzle Quest phenomenon, and studio detached from Vicarious Visions) has thrown itself into the boundless Marvel universe, taking advantage of the Upper card license Decks.", "date": "2007-09-06", "grade": null}
