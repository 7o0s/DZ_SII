{"name": "Star Wars: Il Potere della Forza - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-il-potere-della-forza-recensione_a.html", "text": "The power of commands The title is presented in the premises identical to the counterparts dedicated to other home consoles, placing itself between the third and fourth chapter of the saga and putting the user, after a short but appreciated session in which Darth Vader is controlled, in the role of a young student of the latter, battle name Starkiller, following its long journey and developing a plot that is easily identifiable as one of the best elements of the entire production, endowed as it is with an intense and coherent writing, certainly superior to other recent releases of the Star Wars trademark, even cinematic  any reference to The Clone Wars is absolutely intentional. The gameplay asks you to clean up a series of levels of increasing complexity, increase your powers and enjoy the many clashes, whether they are trivially scattered throughout the levels or more complex and often fun with the bosses; in general and due to an artificial intelligence that is not perfect and a design of the patterns that is sometimes too flat, there is a certain discontinuity in the quality of the situations proposed which however does not preclude the sense of fun and satisfaction that the many different performable shots manage to ensure, by making the approximately seven to eight hours required to complete the adventure be a good opportunity for recreation for fans of action games, a genre not exactly enhanced by the current offer of the Wii soft library. The power of commands The commands are a mixture of good things and other less exciting ones but, in the opinion of the writer, overall they manage to win by behaving dutifully. Anyone who expects, even rightly, some kind of realism in the use of the lightsaber will be disappointed by the simple request to launch blows without the need to direct them or decide their strength and indeed, even if sporadically, with a few blows that are not registered and gets lost in the frenzy of movement; we will talk about it again in the presence of the notorious Wii Motion Plus. The parade is good, which gives some hints of identification by asking to tilt the Wiimote as if to mimic its gesture, the use of the nunchuck is very good, which is responsible for the operations of using telekinesis, raising either by snatching objects and enemies from their supports and then hurling them in the desired direction, or by lifting the unfortunates to then strangle them. With the addition of powers and possibilities, the initial order is not lost and, although perhaps not immediately understandable, the chosen scheme will hardly put anyone in crisis. The average challenge rate is low and what initially appears to be a smooth learning curve soon turns out to be a constant that could diminish the interest of the most savvy players. Finally, only on Wii have a series of extras been introduced which, starting from some alternative costumes which are unlikely to delight even the most avid fan, arrive at a Duel mode which should represent an attraction of a certain weight: in a nutshell it is to challenge each other in a series of one-on-one in the company of a friend, impersonating the characters encountered along the adventure and exploiting the peculiarities of each of them. An addition that demonstrates goodwill and commitment but which in the long run highlights the best exploitation of the game mechanics in an action guise rather than a fighting game. Special effects and little more Graphically Star Wars: The Force Unleashed in the Wii version is not as powerful or strong as it would have been nice to expect, giving an unflattering overall picture. The thumb must absolutely remain raised for the effects and their use: the explosions, the use of lights and other subtleties such as a good use of the blur are really pleasing, especially on the Nintendo console where this type of attention is lacking in the majority of cases . Unfortunately the exciting paragraphs are reduced exclusively to those listed, with in particular some settings, the larger ones, really poorly defined in the surfaces as in the quantity of elements present in the background, often giving an unpleasant sensation of emptiness; closed or small-sized environments are better, which in any case are afflicted by a rather marked aliasing and are populated by characters with discontinuous qualities, with animations that are not always perfect and models with discreet modeling. Finally, the camera often loses the focus of the action forcing manual adjustments that won't ruin anyone's day but are also not pleasant. Still on the technical front, the physics performs well, which is positively highlighted both during the launch of objects and enemies through the use of the powers acquired during the adventure, and for the interaction with the parts of the seabed thatthey predict it. Finally, the sound enjoys a sampling of the effects and music that is really more than good, able to give a very welcome extra touch of identification. One game many engines The Force Unleashed in the PS3 and Xbox 360 version is in all respects a title developed by Lucas Arts, which can however count on a series of external middleware that goes alongside Ronin, the internally developed graphics engine: Euphoria manages the artificial intelligence of enemies, Havok for rigid body physics and Digital Molecular Matter for dynamics and interaction with the seabed. The Wii incarnation, developed by Krome Studios, instead focuses on the physics engine made internally by the Australian developer. Comment Star Wars: The Force Unleashed does not represent the state of the videogame art even on Nintendo Wii, where, however, you can find a series of interesting ideas and a control system that is decidedly appropriate to the peculiarities of the consoles, even if not perfect. The experience therefore offers a good narration and immediate fun even if not excessively profound, however lacking on the longevity front and presenting a graphic sector capable of shining in very few situations. The purchase is to be recommended to fans of the saga and to all those who need action titles to get through the day, for all the others it is not essential. Pros Strong storytelling Effective but not perfect controls Light and fun Cons Little depth and fluctuating level design Poor graphics Limited longevity", "date": "2008-09-30", "grade": null}
