A horde of monsters marches on cities, invades forests and infests the basements of a collapsing country. The player has the task of restoring order and restoring peace to the citizens, obviously accumulating hundreds and hundreds of kills and completing the three acts of an adventure that deviates from the most recent innovations in the field of hack and slash to choose a setting that seems conservative, old school one might say. In short, Neocore Games has chosen to play it safe for the return of its most successful title, that first chapter that came out of nowhere but capable of satisfying users less accustomed to the news - but also to the excesses, in some situations especially at the exit - of Diablo III. So what to expect from The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II? More than a sequel, a sort of stand-alone expansion, which only partially reshuffles the cards, expanding the scope of a level experience which however lends itself to some problems, especially technical ones. Here comes the sequel to the popular Van Helsing: is it better or worse than its predecessor? Run-in formula Van Helsing II is a title that draws from such a well-established tradition that hardly anyone will feel intimidated by the approach to gameplay: the six classes available respond to the stylistic features of the genre, sink their hands into that mix of magic and melee, stats and skills that have been in hack ans slash forever; in the same way the flow of the action is a hypnotic succession of enemies that explode into a thousand pieces leaving precious objects on the ground and giving us coveted experience points useful for growing and continuing a loop that lasts up to the sixtieth level. Here the ~magic~ touch of Neocore Games is guaranteed first of all by the setting, between fantasy and steampunk, and by a script that stands out especially when there is an ironic joke to be inserted or the many quotations that will certainly be appreciated by the public of geeks addressed. Alongside standard classes, almost trivial like the necessary reinterpretations of the figure of the Magician, there are less obvious ones, such as the Contraptionist with its turrets, mines and heavy armor. The path from rookie to mighty fighter is punctuated by the usual skill trees, but the presence of the Rage gauge, which allows you to upgrade individual powers at will, adds an extra dash of strategy to builds. The sense of familiarity returned by the character selection menu and the difficulty (which has five levels, plus the Hardcore option with permanent death) continues launched the first act: Van Helsing II uses a classic game system based on the intensive use of potions, on the free allocation of the points earned between a number of parameters that improve the character's statistics and on a level of difficulty which, not only in the battles with the bosses at the end of the chapter, can also give some headaches to expert players. The loot is regulated by the division of objects by rarity and by the presence of sets that guarantee extra bonuses if several pieces of the same are equipped at the same time. Furthermore, by combining weapons and essences, new and powerful combinations become available and enrich a truly vast, even if at times a little anonymous, arsenal of choices. Overall, all these elements work but the sense of what has already been seen is strong. For this Neocore Games has chosen to add some less traditional ideas: in some cases, such as the presence of levels characterized by rather intense scripting, these are novelties better blended with the mechanics that make up the heart of the gameplay; in others, such as the armies and the powerful Chimera to be sent on a mission in a sort of management sub-game, or in the tower defense schemes, which come back enhanced, they are more extemporaneous elements. In any case, they are additions that serve the purpose of increasing variety and length of an adventure that will probably occupy you for a dozen hours but which has several elements that make it replayable. Starting with the double possibility of starting a level 1 or 30 character, the previous level cap, and of importing those already used in the first chapter. In general we can be said to be satisfied with the level design, albeit linear and enormously more focused on combat than on exploration, and by the amount of different opponents, far superior to those of the first chapter. A rich side dish? Playing The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II from start to finish, maybe a couple of times, is a pleasant adventure that highlights production values justified by the price of fifteen euros. On the sidelines (but not too much) of the experiencesolitary through the three acts of the campaign, other methods and options have been studied aimed at increasing an already very good quality-price ratio. The four-player cooperative does not need major introductions and is accompanied by the Nightmare Mode, with its scenarios to always be played in company but designed for the end game and available once level 57 is reached. Less usual for this kind of title is the mode PvP, which puts aside the hordes of monsters to pit eight players against each other: a variant that perhaps has no who knows what perspective and which is certainly not easy to implement, as the failures of Diablo III in this sense demonstrate, but which in any case can bring a few hours of extra fun as a dowry. The total of four different multiplayer matches - the fourth has not yet been unlocked - offers a fair number of options to customize the experience, such as the decision whether to make the match public or private, integration with the Steam friends list and the level of the participants. Unfortunately, although we wanted to wait for the release to verify the presence and stability of the servers in an ideal situation, there are still technical aspects related to the net code and the presence of numerous bugs that make it difficult to enjoy multiplayer at its best. There are also numerous crashes and drops in performance even on important configurations. A great shame too as the original had also come out with similar problems, at least on the online front, and it was hoped that the extra time and funds available had made a different result possible. That said, there's always time for patches and tweaks along the way, so let's hope things improve as time goes on. Some progress has already been seen in recent days. The beauty of darkness The visual and technical realization of Van Helsing II needs to be analyzed by clearly separating the individual aspects that characterize it. The overall design is good and the monster hunter excuse once again paved the way for the developers to have a variety of different enemies and situations. Forests whitened by a thick blanket of snow populated by wolves and fantastic creatures take the place of cities besieged by robots and giant mechanical spiders, sewers and caves take turns with remarkable frequency and manage not to get bored. The effects are also pleasant, just as the making of weapons and armor sets is satisfying. On the other hand, the modeling of characters and enemies in itself is certainly not comparable to that of the best exponents of the genre, while the levels alternate detailed glimpses with other decidedly bare ones, even if never completely anonymous. On the other hand, it is difficult to appreciate in an absolute sense the choice not to make the enemies appear progressively but to load them all at the beginning of the level: the result is that often, glimpsing the areas that we will face shortly thereafter, we observe dozens of motionless opponents waiting for us. The glance is bad. All the menus and screens of the character seem to come out of an action RPG from ten years ago, with the merits and defects of the case. Where some hack and slash sold at a budget price aim at a specific visual style that covers certain limits, like Torchlight II, or at a solid technology, like Grim Dawn, perhaps here we observe the immaturity of Hungarian artists and programmers a little, which, however, once again managed fairly well.", "date": "2014-05-23", "grade": "7.8"}
