{"name": "Il cavaliere Oscuro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94485-batman-arkham-city-il-cavaliere-oscuro.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360 Batman: Arkham Asylum was one of the biggest hits of recent years. And it could not be otherwise given the nature of the production: like the old Batman Return, the splendid beat'em up from 1993 for Super Nintendo, it proved to be, with the due distinctions of the case, the only game dedicated to the popular DC Comics superhero worthy of representing its universe and charm. Two seasons later, the development team behind that project, Rocksteady Studios, returns offering us a direct sequel that decisively expands the game world, bringing the action outside the walls of the Arkham asylum. We are obviously talking about the long-awaited, told and anticipated through dozens of articles and news, Batman: Arkham City. Months after the events of Asylum, the new mayor of Gotham City, Quincy Sharp, decides to transfer the criminals locked up at the Blackgate Penitentiary and those from the Arkham criminal asylum in a limited and theoretically well protected and supervised area inside of the city. This area, renamed Arkham City, is placed under the direct control of Professor Hugo Strange. But why did Mayor Sharp do this? What is actually behind this decision? And really Strange has devised a new cure for the correction of mental illness? To Batman, and to the player in his role, the difficult answer. This, in summary, is the plot of the title which will then unfold along a game that at a structural level we could almost define as conceptually divided into three sections: in fact, we have the main story, with the related missions that follow the story, the optional secondary quests that can be obtained delving into the play area and sifting through all the contents present, useful for varying the gameplay and for stimulating the player to rack his brains through riddles and puzzles. And finally the challenges, that package of schemes proposed both inside and outside the main campaign to expand the videogame offer, as well as to help users master the game mechanics in the best possible way. I am Batman! Batman: Arkham City, like its predecessor, has a progression marked by a sort of levels, but also has a large open area that can be freely explored. It is an environment four or five times larger than the island that housed Gotham's criminal asylum, and while not a huge space when compared to truly free roaming products, it manages to give the positive feeling of being in a real city, on patrol, ready to intervene from above at any moment, thanks to a certain atmosphere perfectly rendered by the developers. This is the first big change in the game compared to Asylum. Of the predecessor, however, it maintains all those typical elements that characterized it such as action, adventure, stealth and fighting games. A large part of the gameplay is concentrated on the latter. In fact, even two years later, the combat system appears at first similar to that of Arkham Asylum, with a key used to hit, one to dodge and a third to stun, but the differences soon show themselves. In fact, the title offers more variations to the clashes than the classic punches, kicks and counterattacks, with the implementation and optimization of new features: there are blows used to stun enemies, even the biggest ones, and counterattacks that damage even three criminals at a time. You can dodge the blows of bladed weapons, disarming those who wield them when possible, call a flock of bats to distract enemies or catch blunt objects thrown at Batman on the fly and then send them back to the sender. Furthermore, after a certain number of successful attacks, two special moves are available that can be activated by pressing X or A, depending on the console used, in combination with another button used for the purpose. By holding down the left trigger and combining it with the use of a front button, gadgets are activated instead, and old and new attack objects (improved in efficiency and speed of management) can be used, such as smoke bombs, grappling hooks, batarangs , explosive gels and so on. Fun and choreographic like few others, these phases are richer in possibilities and in some situations even challenging to master. The result is nothing short of excellent, with a Batman in dazzling form who locks and punches one enemy after another in a fluid and convincing way like never before. Among other things, the opponents now attack in a more logical way and with more varied patterns, making better use of their skills or weapons, consequently offering a higher level of challengecompared to the past. Of course, there are still some flaws in their artificial intelligence in some cases, but you can't have everything. The same can be applied to the bosses, who are less simple to deal with than their predecessor, but they certainly don't constitute the kind of obstacle that one would expect from them. Xbox 360 goals There are fifty Achievements available in Batman: Arkham City, for a grand total of 1000g. To obtain them you have to satisfy the game's requests, as always starting from the simplest ones such as completing a combat challenge without taking damage or collecting all Batman's gadgets and Batman's upgrades, gradually up to the more difficult ones, which perhaps include the rescue all hostages in the Riddler's hand or get all 108 medals from the main campaign. Up to the coveted two 75G objectives unlockable respectively by fully completing the game and the new game + (New Game Plus). The Riddler All the Bat Man's skills can be improved thanks to special experience points, which are also useful for unlocking new trinkets such as the disarming batclaw. Going instead to describe the part of the game linked to exploration, among the novelties of the product we note a greater interaction with the suspended elements: in fact, compared to the one that preceded it, the title also develops more upwards, vertically, with dozens of buildings and handholds on which to climb, jump or glide. To make the movements more fluid, in this case, the planing has been heavily revised: with the grappling hook you can still cling to the architectural elements, but by pressing a second time and holding down the relative button, you use the momentum of the ascent to continue the flight. In addition, with the right trigger you dive towards the ground, releasing your grip and pulling back on the analog stick at the right moment to take advantage of the speed acquired and quickly regain altitude. Still on the subject of accessories available to the masked hero of Gotham City, there are still new ones also for the exploratory phases. There is even a decryptor useful for intercepting police radio frequencies, Gotham radio and so on. All these objects will be essential to discover new portions of the city: advancing in the adventure, just to give a concrete example, Batman gets his hands on a particular rifle that is capable of firing electromagnetic pulses, which makes it very useful in certain circumstances , perhaps to start electric motors that have broken down. We also talk about the detective function which obviously returns in the sequel. This time it takes on an even more important role given that among many things it also serves to gather information on the challenges that the Riddler poses to the player, and which this time are around four hundred. Going into detail, the themed clues must be collected by interrogating some non-player characters (during fights with Edward Nygma's henchmen, for example, identifying a potential informant within a gang of criminals, one must be careful to spare him), exploring the city and completing some puzzles whose difficulty level is slightly higher than in the past. In addition, this time there are also hostages to free. By virtue of what has just been described, it is clear that the title offers a certain longevity to the user, especially if we add the fact that within the adventure there are even twelve secondary missions not strictly related to the main story, in the sense that it is not mandatory to face them, and the possibility once the game is over to start it again with the classic Game + in which you start again with all the gadgets and suit upgrades collected and with the toughest and best armed enemies. We are talking about 10 hours if you limit yourself to playing only the main story which can easily double if the player decides to invest his time in collecting and completing all the secondary objectives. The Catwoman issue As many of you know, unlike other games in Batman: Arkham City the online pass available through the code contained in the original product packaging, or to be purchased separately in the case of a used game, does not serve to unlock multiplayer or some element related to this type of mode, but instead gives access to the DLC containing Catwoman. This additional content, about 250MB in size, not only offers an extra character to be used possibly only on the sidelines of the main game, but integrates perfectly with it by adding a lot of content. Let's talk about secondary missions, four, specifically designedand for the cat woman and with an average duration of fifteen to twenty minutes each (except for the first, which is shorter), which add variety and break up the rhythm of the basic adventure, thanks to an extremely fast character, equipped with her own moves and capable of actions completely different from those of Batman. But also specific trophies of the Riddler and interesting implications to the main plot to the point of partially modifying even the beginning itself, if you play this DLC before the adventure of the Bat Man. Even if the title can still be completed without the sexy kitten, in our opinion having it linked to the online pass represents a serious limitation since it deprives all those players who, due to budget or choice problems, decide to buy the second-hand product , of an interesting part of the adventure, providing him with a game that is not 100% complete. Unless you spend 800 Microsoft points or 9.99 depending on the platform, to get yourself this real mini-expansion. In all cases, the advice we can give to our readers is to weigh the choice well, and if possible, try to turn a blind eye to the ~annoyance~ that the choice made by developers and publishers, by obtaining the DLC, can cause. Having said that, and returning to talk about the purely videogame part, the cat woman can then also be exploited in the canonical challenges, divided as always into Fight and Stealth. A feast for the eyes and ears The aforementioned mode is a content-rich package of maps and schemes (even mini-campaigns, those of the Riddler), complete with online rankings and strong gameplay behind it capable of broadening its perspectives compared to what was already done at the time for the original chapter. There are many things to do in this section of the game considering the fact that it will be possible to use Nightwing and Robin here in the future through two DLCs that will be available on Xbox Live at a cost of 560 Microsoft Points and via PSN for around 6.99, the first and November 22nd. It is also possible to activate special modifiers that increase the difficulty, such as preventing the use of gadgets or making certain targets unattachable for a certain amount of time. There are therefore challenges in which you have to use brute force by eliminating waves of increasingly large enemies in terms of number, characteristics and strategies, others more tactical with Batman who must take out his opponents silently and in the shortest possible time, moving in the shadows. The score, as in the past, is not only linked to single kills, but also to the possibility of chaining dozens of shots while increasing the multiplier and therefore the bonuses that influence the final score. In this way there is in some ways an instantaneous indicator of the player's skill. Finally, to support such a valid playability there is an exceptional technical sector, characterized by spectacular graphics, with extraordinarily reproduced characters, well-finished and well-represented scenarios, designed to make the most of the imagination of Rocksteady Studios artists. The textures are high school, the animations have increased dramatically compared to the predecessor, and there are many details on the screen. Everything runs quite smoothly, except for some sporadic pop-ups, and is enhanced by excellent 3D support. In short, Batman: Arkham City carves out its own important space in a hypothetical ranking of the most visually impressive games of this generation of consoles. Not least is the audio sector which can count on a splendid dubbing in Italian (apart from a couple of voices perhaps not very suitable for certain characters), the quality of which can easily be comparable to that of the localization of a cinematographic film. The audio effects are always varied and effective and the soundtrack is sometimes impressive in its gait alongside the actions performed by the Bat Man.", "date": "2011-10-18", "grade": "9.3"}
