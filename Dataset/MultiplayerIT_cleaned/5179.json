{"name": "Sims in the city... again!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/176196-the-sims-4-vita-in-citta-sims-in-the-city-again.html", "text": "With the release of the latest expansion pack for The Sims 4, City Living, the developers once again confirm their willingness to offer less canonical content than the classics seen in the expansions of the previous chapters, such as those dedicated to holidays or pets, and increasingly parallel to everyday life... in pure Sims style, of course! We have tried the new expansion and, after a few hours of play, we are ready to express our opinion on this long-awaited content. Let's see what's new in City Living, the latest expansion for The Sims 4 Cosmopolitan city We will never get tired of saying it but the more we go on the more we realize that the expansions of The Sims 4 draw heavily from the previous console chapters, going to improve mechanics already seen but still in an embryonic state at the time. The title of Vit in citt speaks for itself and introduces apartments and neighborhoods of different entities; it is not the first time that we see our ~Sims in the city~ and Living in the city clearly represents an evolution of what we have seen in The Urbz, much more credible, rich and detailed. Within the new San Myshuno scenario we will find four different neighborhoods: the uptown, the fashion district, the arts and the spice market, where each one has its own precise identity and hosts different festivals respectively. Festivals are new social events that take place in neighborhood squares where our Sims can participate, interacting with friends and completing new actions depending on the festival: at the flea market you can buy unobtainable objects while at an event like the Smanet Show you can challenge other friends in hacking challenges. An idea also taken up here by the Urbs, where each neighborhood had its own identity, social interactions and different jobs... like raising ferrets on the roofs of the Solarium! However, we are talking about a console game that is quite old and disadvantaged by the limitations of time: the sensation was that of not living in the same city but of visiting many small neighborhoods detached from the context while San Myshuno is a vibrant and cosmopolitan place, where its inhabitants interact each other and visit the various places according to taste and moment. Festivals are therefore a moment where you can see the unique flow of the city and feel its activity you can almost smell it! Because there is no element that makes a place more unique and recognizable than its street food: in the districts of San Myshuno it is possible to stop and taste delicious delicacies at kiosks and food tracks for a total of 27 new dishes. On the other hand, the ~vegetarian~ personality trait has been introduced but don't worry because the menus offer a wide choice of both meat-based and completely vegetarian dishes... be careful, however, not to let your vegetarian or vegetarian Sim eat meat. this will feel bad and become sad. This home has personality Let's continue the analysis of the game by narrowing the focus and passing from the macro to the micro, or rather the housing dimension. A new aspect of Living in the city is the revolution of the domestic dimension and the square and rectangular lots of lawn become apartments and lofts, all respectively equipped with a lift, mailbox and waste chute. As far as the personalization of the apartments is concerned, it is possible to change the floor plan at will as long as the property limits are respected: in fact, some apartments share a lift and landing with others, therefore it is impossible to make changes to the owned area abroad, obviously the problem does not arise if you own a penthouse where you can build real houses on top of skyscrapers, complete with a garden, swimming pool and indoor basketball court. What struck us the most, however, is that some apartments have characteristics, just like the character traits of our Sims: it will be up to us to choose the right home for our friends and match their attitudes with the traits of the house, such as example choose an apartment near public schools in case our family includes small Simmini. It is also said that old houses have their own personality, a truth also confirmed in The Sims. In fact, the most run-down houses can have various problems such as rickety electrical panels or naughty pipes, not to mention nice extra tenants such as bugs, mice and ghosts! It will therefore be necessary to roll up one's sleeves and acquire good technical skills to carry out the repairs, thus saving a little Simoleon; alternatively if you don't want to get your hands dirty you can contact the condominium administrator and ask him for help but remember that notyou can make similar requests if you are not a good tenant who pays the rent. Neighborhood and telecommuting Speaking of tenants... as we said, in Vit in the city there are many housing solutions and you can choose whether to live the good life in a loft or make do in a ramshackle studio apartment but you will never have to do it alone if you don't want to. Obviously, even here there is the possibility of living in an apartment with roommates, whether it's your best friend to whom you gave the key to your house or a stranger who helps you pay the rent. Each apartment then affects the mood of the Sims and their coexistence so it is necessary to keep the shared spaces tidy and clean, otherwise the quarrel is around the corner. It really wouldn't be The Sims if there wasn't something crazy, like your sexy neighbor who flirts with you in her bathrobe under the guise of bugging you for a hot shower! However, it is important to maintain good neighborly relations, especially if you share the landing with other Sims. Another novelty between single and group actions is singing: many Sims love to sing, training alone at home or singing with other friends during a party. City Living introduces new items to enhance your Sims' singing talent, like the karaoke machine, but singing isn't an activity for its own sake. Sure, your Sims will get better and sing great in the shower, but they can also perform publicly on the streets of the city, romantically serenade their partner, or license lyrics written for instruments like guitar and piano. Remaining in the personal sphere of the Sims, the possibility of working from home should be noted, an unprecedented option that can be used for careers as a politician, social media and critic. This allows you to earn experience points and progress in career advancement without having to leave the house, so don't play with the Sim during working hours or go to a shop, police station or hospital if you have the Sim. expansion ~At Work!~ Once the profession has been selected, half an hour before the starting time of work, an alarm will sound above our Sim's miniature: at that point we will be able to choose whether to go to work, work from home or take a day off. It is also possible to plan a working day through our Sim's smartphone in case we already know that we have a commitment or a place to visit. If we decide to work from home, two tasks will be offered to us and we will decide in which order to complete them; by completing the tasks before the end of the next working day we will acquire experience points and the pay will be debited from our account. It is also possible that our Sim for work reasons must necessarily leave the house but without going to the office, perhaps to participate in a protest or visit an exhibition. An undoubtedly interesting way to push players to visit the squares of San Myshuno.", "date": "2016-11-09", "grade": "8.0"}
