Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Some of you will certainly have tried the first Frontline Commando. Released at the end of 2011 and recently reached version 3.0, the shooter developed by Glu put us in the role of a ~one man army~ determined to face an entire hostile army alone. The game mechanics were simple and were based on the concept of ambush, with the ability to move from one cover to another (especially when one was destroyed and left us uncovered) and lean out to eliminate enemies in missions of various types , from those that simply involved killing all the opponents to those in which we had to protect the escape of some hostages with our shots, up to levels that required an extra effort as there were more resistant bosses to face expected. The glue of the experience consisted of a very precise and well organized touch control system, with a button for the quick change of the equipped weapon, one for sheltering and contextually reloading, one for using the viewfinder for precision shots and two arrows on the sides of the screen to change the stakeout location. You could touch the touch screen in practically any area to move the aiming reticle and then act on the fire button located on the right side of the interface, obtaining different results depending on the weapon: short bursts in the case of machine guns, dry shots in the case of assault or sniper rifles, and so on. A solid and effective system, which has clearly been maintained for Frontline Commando: D-Day but combined with a much more dynamic and, perhaps, less strategic experience. Back to the past Until a few years ago the setting of the Second World War was considered too inflated, with the various episodes of Call of Duty and Medal of Honor that had exploited every possibility. Time has passed and the situation has ~cooled down~ a bit from this point of view, therefore finding ourselves in the middle of the Normandy landing does not produce particular crises of rejection and indeed the action flows in a pleasant way, thanks to an unprecedented structure rewards that unlock new scenarios based on the number of stars obtained in missions, a factor that depends on the achievement of specific objectives for each stage. The control system has remained unchanged compared to the first Frontline Commando, but the philosophy behind the gameplay appears to have changed, given that now our character does not simply move from one shelter to another until he has eliminated all the enemies present in the location, but goes from one firefight to the next by running and sometimes giving us the opportunity to jump over obstacles and dodge mines. On the one hand, the elements introduced represent an important advantage in terms of variety and dynamism, on the other, unfortunately, we end up losing the strategic factor that drove us to often change cover, perhaps in search of new ammunition. Some important steps forward have certainly been made in terms of technical implementation, with settings very rich in elements (although the re-presentation of certain areas is often noted) and a good level of detail. On the other hand, the polygonal models are a bit disappointing, which often and willingly have a bit too many edges and a fairly woody set of animations. The music is excellent, even if at a certain point it ends up being repetitive.", "date": "2013-05-11", "grade": "8.0"}
