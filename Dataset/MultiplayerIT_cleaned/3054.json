Yet, thanks to the Command & Conquer Remastered Collection, we were able to pick up both titles, discovering them inexorably beautiful, but at the same time different from how we remembered them. We have grown older and they are with us. The effect sought from such an operation is inevitably nostalgic. We understood it practically immediately, that is, since the Westwood Studios logo appeared in high resolution, which made us sick. After all, aren't the remastered practically a declaration of surrender? It's as if publishers were saying to seasoned players: we can no longer give you what you're looking for with new titles, so replay the old ones. The importance of Command & Conquer It was 1991 when Sensible Software's Mega Lo Mania effectively invented real-time strategy as we know it. Few give him credit for having done it, because they prefer to attribute it to Westwood Studios' Dune 2 (1992), in any case much more accomplished and, therefore, capable of dictating the canons of the entire genre. However, it was Command & Conquer that consecrated the RTS to the attention of the general public, with its excellent graphics and its much more streamlined mechanics than those of its predecessor. Those were the years in which the CD-Rom was establishing itself, with developers who found themselves having to manage the extremely limited floppy disks and cartridges of a few MB, to having an immense data storage space available, to be filled in some way. It was then that video games began to be peppered with computer graphics videos, or videos made with amateur or third-rate actors, which very often ended up making even the most dramatic moments comical. Command & Conquer was no different. Probably if we remember it so distinctly it is also because Westwood had given it a very rich outline, creating an elementary but interesting story, told through films visible between missions, quite unprecedented for a strategic one. C&C was therefore a concentrate of modernity, between killer movies, by the standards of the time, and highly refined game mechanics. It was what we can define as the purest expression of a new way of understanding video games, which was establishing itself in those years. Command & Conquer: Red Alert was released the year after Command & Conquer, i.e. in 1996. Ideally it was supposed to be a prequel to Tiberian Dawn, but it managed to win its own space in the hearts of the public, so much so that Westwood decided to make it standalone and do become the progenitor of a miniseries. Thus were born the two great sagas of Command & Conquer, the Tiberium and the Red Alert. Now those two historic titles are re-proposed with completely renewed graphics and capable of supporting wider resolutions, such as 4K, in a package that includes the original campaigns, all the official supplementary missions published for both, plus the missions that were made specifically for console conversions (including movies). If we want, it is the definitive package of the first Command & Conquer, in which the movies have also been remastered in high definition and all the game systems have been revised, including the multiplayer modes, now usable again without too much effort. Tiberium and the Russian advance For those who don't know what we're talking about, Command & Conquer are classic real-time strategy games, in every sense, in which the formula ~build the base - collect resources - amass troops - set off to destroy the enemy~ finds its maximum cantor. The setting of Command & Conquer is that of an alternate future in which a mysterious alien substance called Tiberium has developed on Earth, the desire to possess which causes a worldwide war to break out between the GDI (Global Defense Initiative), which head of the United Nations, and the Brotherhood of Nod, a kind of terrorist sect led by Kane, a charismatic and mysterious leader. Command & Conquer: Red Alert instead tells of an alternative future in which the Soviet Union was able to expand undisturbed towards Europe, after Einstein killed Hitler by going back with a time machine of his own invention. From here a world-wide war broke out that sees the newborn Russian empire on one side and a coalition formed by the USA, Great Britain and other nations on the other. Both titles can be played with both factions of the respective titles, for a total of more than one hundred missions from the canonical campaigns alone. Museum operation Boththe games should be known to most, so they are settled in the RTS genre. Judging them today doesn't make much sense, unless you take the useless question ~how have they aged?~ out of the hat, which is fine for bar discussions, but not for a serious analysis of the historical role played by two titles so important (especially the first one). However, what we can do is evaluate the remastering work, as well as its meaning, which in this case should be defined more as a museum display of both titles, for the already expressed reason of the completeness of the offer. If you look at it from this point of view, Command & Conquer Remastered Collection is practically perfect, because it deeply respects the original games, including them in the package, but at the same time allows for a less angular use by pursuing more modern standards with a complete overhaul of the control system (can be deactivated) and a more defined and digestible visual aspect (even if we swear that playing the old all-pixel version is not bad at all), with all the units and structures redesigned and enriched with new animations. It is certainly a product for nostalgics, in the sense that it is unlikely that non-enthusiasts of the genre, or those who do not know the originals, will deign to look at it (perhaps the few curious people left in this world), and many of the new entries point precisely in the direction to magnify the memory of the original experience, rather than to modernize it. At least we believe this is what motivated the inclusion of rich galleries with unreleased material and the search for the revival of the feeling of the time down to the smallest details, including the soundtrack (also remastered). In this sense we are faced with a practically perfect operation. Of course, the bitterness remains in seeing that certain experiences no longer have any sequel and that enthusiasts must increasingly turn to the nostalgia market to still be considered by the big publishers, with Electronic Arts which for years has not been able to offer a new Command & Conquer that isn't a sleazy mobile monkey game riddled with microtransactions.", "date": "2020-06-05", "grade": "8.9"}
