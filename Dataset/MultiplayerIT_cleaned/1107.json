The main management screen immediately makes it clear how the game is going: dozens of parameters which in turn are divided into further possibilities, for a very strong initial feeling of bewilderment. Unfortunately there are no assistants whatsoever to navigate the menus and careful memorization of the main buttons is required; during the game it will be possible to leave the decision of various choices to the cpu but in any case there are no on-screen aids (they would have been ideal for those who try a managerial game of this type for the first time). The main bar is located at the bottom and has a series of five basic buttons which, when pressed, load a further five screens for each. Then there is a ~forward~ button to quickly continue through the days. The most annoying thing that immediately catches the eye is the obligation to have to respond to the e-mails we will receive (mainly from other clubs) about player requests and more. It is practically impossible to move forward if for each email we do not give an answer, generally ~yes~ or ~no~. So far there would be no problem but if we are asked for a player you can be sure that at least three other offers on the same will be proposed to us and therefore the cumbersome operation will be repeated. Form 5-5-5! But... Mister, can we play in 15? There are an infinite number of general parameters, the advice is to carefully evaluate everything and to follow the indicator of required tasks, so as not to get lost too much at least up to a primitive start of the company. Email management is useful for important alerts such as the appearance of key players on the transfer market or expiring contracts. Then there are a whole series of minor warnings but almost never of little importance. For a not too troubled start it is good not to immediately jump into marginal issues such as the construction of a mega stadium or promotional products but keep an eye on the team and perhaps hire fundamental elements such as assistants and doctors (each character offers particular improvements in their field) . The game is based on a sophisticated experience-point system for all the parameters present, from the player's skills to the possibilities offered by each single structure. These, if expanded in the correct way and little by little, lead to benefits (financial or athletic) in the scores. It is possible to admire the surroundings of the sports facilities and their subsequent modifications through an explorable and rotatable 3D map! The possibility makes the game look like Command & Conquer Generals and in fact the engine looks a lot like we don't know if attacks from the ELG are foreseen!! Really well done! [C] Command &amp; Conquer? Not exactly... A poor facility... [/C] The moral voice proves to be important: promotions and encouragements increase its value, vice versa actions such as warnings or punishments lead to depression and negative values which over time generate various problems. Even the so-called ~heroes~ are foreseen, i.e. those players who, by presenting a high level of Leadership and ~teamman~ lead to a general improvement of the whole group (they are divided into three categories: bronze, silver, gold). Entering the game you can issue various keyboard commands, from simulating the screams of a coach, even if the system works in a fluctuating way. It is therefore better to pause and change tactics, make substitutions, give orders and change roles as well as throw cheers that will boost morale (after the first half you can say something to the team like ~keep it up~ or ~you are superior~ ). Compared to the predecessor, there are more actions that can be performed and it is possible to decide how to act for each individual player, perhaps leading him to increase the pressing; there are also some bars that allow a general adjustment for those who don't want to go into too much depth (such as that of defense or total attack). The duration in minutes is adjustable and it is possible to watch all the matches in progress (they can be skipped if desired) or watch only the salient actions. The passage of the scrolling text showing the progress of the other competitions with the goals scored and the main actions during the match being observed was a good choice. In the end, the scoreboard even contains a description of the key moments with the protagonist players! Beautiful! Fu-si-o-ne! As in the previous game, there is the ~Fusion~ option that allows you to export matches to Fifa 2005 and then play them in first person! The idea works and adds that extra touch that makes the gaming experience complete. This option is especially appreciated by those who also like to ~take the field~ but requirenecessarily an additional outlay of money. A package including both games has just been released at a price of around 79 euros. A purchase to evaluate if you want to fully enjoy a total football experience! But it's Fifa! No Total Club! Spectacular! The graphic sector is divided into two parts: the two-dimensional one (the menus) and the three-dimensional one (the visualization of the matches). For the first we have a setting that is pleasant to see in all details but rather confusing due to the enormous amount of elements available on the video. The programmers' attempt not to force the user to take very long journeys between dozens of screens (typical of these games) is commendable, however, all at the expense of visual comprehensibility. The first navigations in the menus are disorienting and it is hard to find the exit button! As already mentioned, an office model assistant would certainly have helped not to get lost. Everything else appears colorful, from the images of the shirts (you can even put your own photo as a coach) to the team logos. The static screen of the Gazzetta dello Sport is wonderful: after the matches the newspaper appears with various articles (all readable by moving the pointer over them) relating to our results and the transfer market with possible interviews! Simply exceptional given the huge amount of data entered. For the 3D part we have the visualization of the matches with the Fifa engine (it is not exactly clear whether it is 2004 or 2005), with excellently made players and more than discreet animations. The usual low resolution textures and the lack of sponsors that do not appear on the shirts (stone above the audience worse than usual) leave a bitter taste in the mouth. A praise to the attempt to recreate the stadiums of the teams, which tend to also represent those of the B series. As the clubs evolve, it is possible to enlarge them and modify an enormous number of details, discussing the project with various architects and engineers. Be careful not to give certain grandstands poor visibility or the public will not be happy! The matches can be viewed from five cameras plus the one from above (which is not a little reminiscent of the legendary Sensible Soccer) and overall we never get tired of observing our men on the pitch (obviously you can choose the duration). The replay menu is also good which allows you to review the action from every angle by rotating directly on the ball. We can define Total Club Manager 2005 as the most graphically refined manager in 3D, if we then add that you can use football fusion with Fifa... I would like to speak to Mara Can! Even the audio in the game is divided according to the graphics: the menus are accompanied by a list of adequate instrumental music but limited to just over ten tracks, considering that navigation between the various screens takes a long time, the possibility of listen to your own Mp3s in order to offer more variety. A great idea! The three-dimensional sector offers us the excellent ambient audio of Fifa with noises from the public, shouts from the players and the excellent comments by Bruno Longhi and Giovanni Galli, with the flaw of not being able to hear them at the same time as the sounds. It is mandatory to choose between the two options (very strange since in Fifa you can have everything together ... well!) However, nothing to complain about indeed! Multi coach Multiplayer is presented to us in the form of a hot chair mode. In practice it will be possible to participate up to a maximum of four players alternating in the management and challenging each other in matches. This game method is recommended for those who really have a large number of hours to devote because if you play the complete simulation before starting it will take a long time There are no other possibilities than to go and compare your results with the other virtual managers on EA website. Cinematography... The captions used in the article are inspired by the old film ~The coach in the ball~ in which a reckless coach, played by Lino Banfi, is put in charge of the Lombard team, a winning team that the president wants to demote due to management costs . The appearance of some characters related to the world of football and the proliferation of situations inherent in this complicated football universe, seen in an amusing way, makes it a must-see for fans of gazettes and footballs! Comment Total Club Manager 2005 makes significant progress compared to its predecessor, offering us a myriad of options to manage a club in all its parts and above all a huge football database, complete with championships (finally also the Dutch one) and real names (although the official sponsors of each team are absent given the possibility of scheere and receive offers from different brands). All supported by the Fifa engine to worthily observe the commitment of our men. The sore point is the attempt to reduce the screens that can be visited to have everything within reach, with an interface that is confusing especially in the first approaches, where a little clarity would not have hurt (especially newbies will have to sweat). However, it remains a must for budding coaches, who will be able to navigate the millions of questions necessary for a club to triumph. Casual gamers be warned: a lot of patience and devotion are required to master a title that, if taken right, can offer hours and hours of entertainment... (add Fifa 2005 to it and you'll never know what it is free time...) Pros: 20 leagues all with official license Huge and updated players database Fifa engine to visualize matches Cons: Menus full of buttons No interactive assistance on screen At times frustrating Those who football ... Simply outstanding! Also this year EA offers us a title that is aimed at fans of management and football (especially!), following the previous one from 2004. The older brother brings a series of substantial changes and additions that the competitors were already able to provide last year. From the start-of-game menu it is necessary to face a series of screens ranging from the difficulty (from incompetent to super coach) to the choice of the team which may also include a national team to train, from the number of players (it is possible to play up to 4) to the sponsor ( there are several existing brands that will offer more or less high contracts). Then there are the areas of expertise, according to which you can have hands everywhere or only in a certain field (eg only coach), and also negotiations with teams interested in our ~professionalism~. It is also possible to choose whether to be a permanent manager or at risk of being fired, an option not recommended for beginners, who could find having to start over with another team very frustrating. The creation of a team deserves a separate discussion: by selecting a country, the relative geographical map will appear with a lot of latitude / longitude and from here it will be possible to choose a city (or invent it) and therefore give birth to a team by creating everything! Your name, nickname, logo (lots of examples are available and images can be imported) and then passed on to the players. You can create a super team with which to beat your opponents and also use it in ~fusion~ mode (see the appropriate box). A note of merit also to the perfect Italian translation which sees thousands of texts and words without errors of any kind, truly a mammoth and excellently cared for job.", "date": "2004-12-02", "grade": null}
