Precisely through the last of the mini-events that the Kyoto house has long since chosen as a means of communication with users, in fact, President Iwata was able to announce the existence of a completely new Wii U game, up to unknown at that time, and above all immediately available for download via the e-Shop. NES Remix, this is the name of the product in question developed by Indies Zero, certainly cannot be categorized as a leading exponent in the Nintendo catalog. Yet in fact it is a real Christmas surprise for home console owners; especially for those who, thanks to several years of experience with the pad in hand, can fully fall into the nostalgia effect that NES Remix tries to exploit to their advantage. Ah, the good times We talked about a Christmas ~surprise~ and not a ~gift~, because NES Remix costs 9.99. A modest figure but not so much as to push the impulse purchase, requiring a minimum of reflection; but you know, Nintendo has never wanted to sell off its history, and the confirmation lies in the prices of the games that make up the Virtual Console. A connection, this, which appears natural once it is discovered that the title in question is based on pure retrogaming, more specifically drawing liberally from some of the most important first-party franchises of the 8-bit era. The turning point, the key chosen for NES Remix, however, lies in the approach chosen by the programmers, who wanted to literally ~disassemble~ the contents of the original games, extrapolating sections in such a way as to propose within them short sequences from a few seconds each. The simplest way to explain the result is to imagine a mix between precisely those NES titles and Wario Ware: although the duration of the challenges is generally longer than in the latter's microgames, the appealing elements are particularly evident (see the jingles at the beginning of the stages), just as the type of approach is similar. What is somehow surprising is just how thirty-year-old titles manage to adapt to a new use compared to the one for which they were conceived, working (almost always) in a convincing way. It goes without saying how much weight is held by the very charm that these milestones in the history of video games possess, capable of giving an extra boost to a product that is still valid. And so you find yourself having to collect a certain number of coins in Super Mario Bros., or complete a lap without ever falling in Excitebike, or detach all the fruit in a level of Donkey Kong Jr., or destroy all the walls in Wrecking Crew , or shoot down enemies in Baloon Fight, or buy an item in Zelda and so on. Let me be clear, this is only a small part of the challenges that you can find yourself facing in NES Remix: for each game there is a certain number of levels, with objectives that manage to guarantee a fair variety. The remix levels are also interesting, within which the programmers were able to leave more room for creativity and imagination. In practice, these are challenges in which some elements are modified or added, thus giving rise to unpredictable and unprecedented situations. NES Remix is an interesting and enjoyable experiment that lacks the spark So so However, where the product plays its best cards is in the challenge factor: by passing the individual stages you get a rating of one to three stars (outlined by a rainbow for the best), which is determined by the time taken. Collecting stars unlocks other levels and also new NES games - for a total of 16 - with relative set of challenges, generating a particularly stimulating reward mechanism. It is a pity that, precisely during the journey of (re)discovery of the milestones of that period, one also comes across titles that are not exactly attributable to the list of Nintendo masterpieces: Ice Climber, Pinball or Golf, for example, have suffered more than others of the passage of time, or simply did not possess from the beginning that ~quid~ capable of making them immortal. The fact is that even within NES Remix they appear as the sources of the least successful and enjoyable minigames. The level of difficulty is questionable, too fluctuating; it is not uncommon to go from very simple levels to other particularly frustrating ones. By overcoming the challenges you also get points through which you can fill a special bar: for each completion of the same you earn a stamp - obviously 8-bit - to be used to personalize messages in the Miiverse. The latter is particularly integrated with theinside the game, with messages from friends and strangers that appear next to the individual levels and which may perhaps contain useful information for obtaining the best results within them. One last note on the use of the GamePad, which replicates exactly what appears on the TV screen; an extremely basic functioning therefore which, however, thanks to the nature of the game, facilitates and favors off screen sessions.", "date": "2013-12-24", "grade": "7.5"}
