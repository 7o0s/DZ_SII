{"name": "Teppen", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/teppen-recensione.html", "text": "Teppen has a tough challenge ahead. The card game genre is experiencing a moment of fatigue in terms of new ideas; not that there is a lack of players, but by now the economic model that is the background is strongly consolidated and game designers are struggling to find solutions that they do not already know. Capcom and GungHo Online have tried to have their say on the subject by launching Teppen, a card game with Capcom characters as protagonists, which takes a bit from Hearthstone and a bit from Clash Royale to try to emerge. Game mechanics The game mechanics of Teppen are simple to explain: the player has a certain number of cards randomly extracted from his deck, which are played on a plank divided into three rows. Once a unit card has been placed on one of the rows, it will start attacking the opponent, causing damage if it finds no defense or confronting the values of the opponent's card if one has been played on the same row. Each unit card has attack and defense values that determine how much it can withstand hits received and how much damage it can cause per hit. Depending on the total value of the card, it will also take more or less time for it to be playable after being drawn from the deck or after playing another card. The action cards and the characters' special techniques make the game more interesting: the action cards are played on one's own cards, against the opponent's cards or on the entire board and produce different effects. For example, they can increase the defense of a unit card, or they can give it a strong boost for one turn at the cost of destroying the card itself after the attack. The powers of the characters, which must be loaded by accumulating the AP points obtained by playing the other cards, are also different and can be active, i.e. they can directly hit the opponent, or passive, i.e. giving bonuses to one's own cards on the board. Whoever resets the opponent's energy to zero, the value of which is always clearly visible on the screen, wins the game. The characters, eight for now, are not all usable right away, but must be unlocked together with their basic decks, playing dedicated mini-campaigns in single player mode. Let's say that if you don't mind seeing Chun-Li fighting Mega Man or Albert Wesker fighting Rathalos, or Dante taking on Morrigan, chances are it will be a pleasant couple of hours, also excellent for practice. Once all the characters have been unlocked, however, the main mode of Teppen becomes that of challenges against other players in the flesh, obviously online, which is also the only way to verify the goodness of the deck you have. In fact, most of the playing time is spent in the deck customization menu, where it is possible to create cards, exchange them and do all the typical operations of the genre. It is also here that the economic system is introduced, based on the classic packages. Definitely pay-to-win We specify: playing for many, many hours it is possible to obtain gold and tickets with which to buy card packs without spending real money, but if you want to become competitive as soon as possible it is inevitable that you resort to microtransactions, i.e. the purchase of jewels that can be spent in aforementioned packages or in the Season Pass, the latter heralding various advantages such as a faster accumulation of experience points and access to special cards, which can only be unlocked by everyone at a later time. In short, we are faced with a typical economic model for the card game genre, decidedly pay-to-win given that it benefits the spenders, and not a little, but which has demonstrated on several occasions that it is the only one that really works . Unfortunately it is (also) from this that what is currently the main problem of Teppen derives, namely the strong imbalances of the decks. In the genre of card games it is obvious that better or worse ones can be created, but in this case, despite the game being launched a few days ago, solutions adopted as standard by many players have already established themselves, which make it essentially superfluous the rich variety of cards present and cut out all those who are still building their deck at a slower pace. In short, in a certain sense, either you adapt or winning becomes impossible, also because the extremely rigid game mechanics inevitably favor some choices over others. The essence is that the deck construction phase is reduced to trying to get the cards needed to have the most used decks, whose codes are already full on the network (it is the game itself that allows you to create and share them).From a technical point of view, Teppen is excellent, including special effects and character models taken from the original Capcom titles. Stylistically he is a bit confusing and at certain moments it has the effect of a Chinese trinket shop, with flames and lights popping up everywhere, but that can be seen given the genre and seen who developed it. The soundtrack is also in line with the technical side and is formed by the sound effects and the most iconic songs from the series of origin of the characters. In short, what would Ryu be without Ryu's theme?", "date": "2019-07-11", "grade": "6.0"}
