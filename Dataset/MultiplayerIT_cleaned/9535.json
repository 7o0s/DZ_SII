Now that we have experienced a after all the misadventures of the motorcyclist Chuck Greene, it's time for the epilogue, distributed in the same way. It is a curious experiment, not only for the welcome return that characterizes it, the legendary Frank West of the first episode, but also for some changes made to the gameplay. First of all, and as already announced by the producer Kenji Inafune, it is a totally co-op adventure. The story is faithfully linked to one of the endings of DR2, in this case that A. Chuck and Frank, having left Fortune City, head towards the Phenotrans plant, the pharmaceutical company responsible for the infamous antidote Zombrex, and it is inside it that the whole adventure will take place. Obviously if things went well we wouldn't be talking about Dead Rising, and in fact the situation falls tragically, with the entire establishment soon found to be invaded by a fresh army of undead. Following the long-known structure, we find ourselves following a new investigation in the area, complete with twists and characters recovered even from the first chapter, for the last shocking ending. On the other hand, with Frank's return, it was a highly desirable eventuality... Xbox 360 goals Dead Rising 2: Case West also features the usual 200 achievement points typical of Live Arcade titles. Some are pretty ordinary, like defeating a certain number of soldiers or armored troops, or beating the game. But there are more specific ones, such as killing 1000 zombies in a single game, destroying security cameras or photographing certain stickers in the scenario. Nothing prohibitive, considering the lack of challenge offered by the game... Fantastic! Making four-handed zombie stews is a profoundly different experience. In the case of the single player, we still play the role of Chuck, while the CPU takes care of controlling Frank (in the multi it represents the guest). The peculiarity that most intrigues are precisely the changes relating to this setting, Frank's remarkable artificial intelligence, in addition to being invulnerable, greatly facilitates our task. Starting from the almost impossibility of the enemies to grab us, as we will be promptly helped, but the cases in which our own companion eliminates the most annoying opponents are not uncommon. The result is a rather lacking title in terms of challenge, if we exclude the challenging final boss, which however can be eradicated by studying the customized weapons included in this episode. As if that weren't enough, the scenario where the action takes place is not among the most inspired of the saga, as it is essentially a series of laboratories and warehouses that are very similar to each other. The duration of the whole is also short, a span of three hours (of play) is what is necessary to see the end credits, but if in Case Zero replayability was the strong point, it does not prove to be as exciting to retrace the interiors of the Phenotrans. The new human forces opposed to our heroes are appreciable, essentially soldiers and armored troops, which however overshadow the zombie threat (a bit the symbol of the series), reduced to a mere hindrance. Yet Blue Castle has not rested on its laurels with this dlc, demonstrating a sincere commitment to improving certain historic shortcomings of the franchise. Starting with the loads, now much more streamlined, but above all the ability of the inevitable survivors to manage themselves independently, without the need to be escorted to a safe place. Frankly, these peculiarities would have been much more welcome in the packaged game, while in this digital appendix they appear as an excessively late occasion. But better than ever. The implementation of the photographs turns out to be weak and somewhat specious, unfortunately far from the progenitor. In Case West we limit ourselves to photographing certain warm areas for the achievement of the usual objective, and little more. Even Frank himself seems to have lost the air that characterized him in the past, limiting himself to a few jokes and a faithful, albeit sweetened, company.", "date": "2011-01-05", "grade": "7.8"}
