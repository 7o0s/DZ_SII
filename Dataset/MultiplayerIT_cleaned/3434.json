Not even the time to celebrate the renewed quality of games based on the Warhammer universe, that two painful and unexpected missteps arrive: the first is that of Darktide which has already been talked about abundantly, while the second sees the latest effort as the protagonist of the French Cyanide. As you will discover by continuing to read the Blood Bowl 3 review, there would be some interesting news even if they had only given the developers time to complete them  Where were we? Blood Bowl 3: The new graphics do not disappoint, even if they are sometimes not very readable Quick summary of the previous episodes. Blood Bowl is a strategic game signed by Game Workshop where the different races of Warhammer fantasy face each other in a kind of grotesque and violent American football. Orcs against elves, skaven against chaos warriors and of course a lot of hobby with miniatures and stadiums to assemble and color. After working on the Chaos League video game, clearly inspired by the Games Workshop board game, the French of Cyanide propose to the British company to transform it into an officially licensed product. The agreement is found and in 2009 Blood Bowl, the video game (the second in history: the first was developed by SSI in 1995 on DOS) was released. The peculiarity of Cyanide's first Blood Bowl is that it is playable both in real-time mode, therefore in a sort of mix between FIFA and Madden, and in turn-based mode, where an almost perfect transposition of the board game is practically offered. The public responds positively, but hates the action mode which is in fact completely canceled in 2015's Blood Bowl 2. Blood Bowl 2 debuts in a rather troubled way, but Cyanide manages to keep up with the requests of the users and within a year he finds himself in his hands a more than discreet game, capable of making inroads even in the most passionate and selective public. Today Blood Bowl 2 has a lot of content, a well-tested gameplay, it costs little and also almost all the bugs have been fixed and archived. The only problem with Blood Bowl 2 is age: seven years, for a game that has never been able to rely on who knows what funding, are really a lot. It was therefore right that Cyanide tried again, and right now, with a Blood Bowl 3 richer, meaner and more modern than the previous one. Furthermore, everything seemed to herald a return in style: the team now has some experience, the Games Workshop name is finally gaining prestige also in the field of video games and investors already had a vague idea of how much it could sell. Yet here we are, damning ourselves in front of a sequel that is appetizing on the outside, but dangerously raw on the inside. False start Blood Bowl: it is possible to rename each player, but if you want to exaggerate we recommend playing offline Playing Blood Bowl 3 you immediately feel that the people who developed it went out of their way to make the best Blood Bowl possible. The care placed in the modeling of the different units, the ability to customize each member of the team in detail, the ideas to make the gaming experience more dynamic, fast and fun despite the dilated times of the base game, are all elements that demonstrate that the good will was not lacking. However, something must have happened if after about eight years you release such a shabby sequel in stores: the bugs are too many, the crashes and disconnections with the server too, even the graphics would need that extra coat of paint in certain circumstances. Even the graphical interface is confusing: during the game you don't know what and where to click, important messages arrive through anonymous black windows, special events are unclear and completely devoid of the illustrations and descriptions present in the previous game. There is no cure, no precision. Is everything missing? Blood Bowl 3: the match is about to begin, the tension is palpable It's hard to get to the statistics, hard to read them, we haven't found an easy and intuitive way to even look at the tournament and league standings. There is still no possibility to save in the middle of the game and, considering their length, it would have been very useful. With the introduction of microtransactions and the season pass, the progression system is now linked to the online game; fortunately it is still possible to play offline, but the teams created in one mode cannot in any way be used in the other, also to avoid cheats. The new economic model seems clear: the DLCs of the old games have been replaced by the same subdivision into seasons seen in many other titles, especially free to play. At the moment, however, we do not know how it will be andthe offer is balanced, and the doubts increase if we look at the prices and limitations of the store and the lack (from what we have been able to guess total) of elements that can be unlocked by playing. Nice to be able to choose among other things which is the official stadium of our team, a pity that in the special menu there are no others to choose from or information on how to unlock them. A bitter match Blood Bowl 3: stadiums will gradually become covered in blood as more deaths and injuries increase Blood Bowl 3 is bitter because it is blatantly poorly managed, bitter because you know that in a year's time it will probably be a great game, perhaps even the best of the three. But now it's just an open construction site on servers that hopefully have found their stability. And if you manage to play it, you get even more annoyed because underneath there is a great game, faster, more responsive and potentially much more varied and spectacular than ever before. The truth is that despite years of delays, Blood Bowl 3 simply isn't ready yet - it's a good early access at the beginning of its run. What will make it fail or succeed is not what the game offers today, but what it will be able to do from now on, starting with the first season pass which, even for free, will necessarily have to grant something to its users and fill in the many empty boxes . The classic Blood Bowl 3: It is also possible to commit intentional fouls to increase the chance of injuring players already on the ground Blood Bowl, also Blood Bowl 3 of course, is pure strategy. You have to understand how to position yourself on the field, what are the strengths of each player and its game system allows you to challenge your luck even brazenly, offering us hilarious and daring actions in exchange. Players can die definitively after a tackle, or get injured for one, two or more games, and they can also leave due to old age: therefore it is necessary that the team created is renewed after each tournament. All actions are decided by the game's special, and now iconic, dice. Want to jump a downed opponent? Roll the dice and see if you succeed, the same thing if you want to pick up the ball from the ground, pass it to your teammates, face a quarterback, or launch yourself on the wing trying to make three more risky steps than those allowed by the standard movement points. In case you haven't figured it out yet, the action proceeds in turns: first one team/player and then the other. But it is useless to bore you with regulations that you can find everywhere, and certainly in a better form. How much do you bet? Blood Bowl 3: what a wasted opportunity, but the last word has not yet been said Blood Bowl is a complex game but not that difficult to learn, if you are a novice the tutorial included in the campaign will give you a hand. It offers a slow and cerebral style of play, but with its good adrenaline moments and is perfect for relaxing after a particularly intense day or bought in bulk to organize the Wednesday evening tournament with friends. The campaign offers many different matches that will introduce you to the different teams included which are currently twelve and will certainly multiply in number along the way, also in this case it would be nice to know exactly how and at what price. Of course there is plenty online, with casual, official and seasonal tournaments. If you feel like trying it, immersing yourself in these dice rolls that can be worth a touchdown or a lethal injury, rationally it would be better to take the second game at a bargain price and in the future, if it's worth it and you feel like it, do the upgrade. But we are aware that the appeal of the novelty is strong, not to mention the new graphics, the new animated stadiums, the short-term support. The game is there, everything else is a bet.", "date": "2023-02-25", "grade": "7.0"}
