The first inkling of poor quality comes from reading the game's requirements: with an old Pentium 3 800 you'll be able to enjoy these feeble chariot fights; the further confirmation comes when you start the first game, where you will be immediately catapulted into the action, without a minimum of tutorial or introduction: not that this is necessary, given that for all the 10 hours that make up this game you won't have to other than using the four movement keys and the two of the mouse, taking care not to stay still for too long in the same point. Essentially all the missions will consist of heading towards a place A, mowing down everything you cross and moving to place B: if, during your wanderings in the desert, you see something moving, do not hesitate to shoot it down, since on the map you will only and exclusively cross units enemies, except for the other three tanks on your team. It also becomes useless to talk about Artificial Intelligence, considering that your opponents will do nothing but shoot as soon as you come within range, they remain nailed to their positions even when you start bombarding them with shots: your men will refuse to take advantage of the shelters offered by the buildings or from other natural barriers, transforming the clashes into a sort of unsuccessful deathmatch, where whoever collects the best comes out victorious. The excessively arcade imprint also transpires from the fact that the ammunition of the secondary weapon, which is absolutely useless, is infinite, while that of the cannon is so abundant that you won't have to worry about your lack of accuracy in the slightest. Game you go, engine you find If Dunes of War fails completely in terms of playability, it is certainly not saved by the graphics department, already outdated at the time of the first Panzer Elite Action: although the model of your tank is of sufficient quality, everything around you is not only poor of polygons, but also covered with low quality textures. Example of excessive motion blur: we lost 3 diopters from just one simple mouse movement The enemy tanks are especially striking: rather than looking like 30-ton lumps of metal and bolts, ruined by the storms of the desert and by the blows of the enemies, they closely resemble large plastic boxes painted with a single uniform colour, that move with the grace of a dragonfly on the desert dunes, as if they were completely empty inside. ZootFly, evidently determined to make the situation worse, has opted to fill these gaps by peppering the title with many particle effects, all summarily created and which certainly fail to convey the idea of a furious clash between tanks: first of all, the columns emerge of smoke that arise from the wreckage of your enemies (for a few seconds, then disappear into thin air) or generated by your smoke bombs, absolutely static and with a broad reference to the sprites of the beginning of the millennium; immediately following is a vain attempt by the developers to improve involvement, by inserting a motion blur effect which, unfortunately, is too accentuated and which will force you to strain your eyesight every time you move the mouse, due to excessive blurring . Fortunately, however, the graphics are not everything, and it would be simplistic to evaluate a title only for the aesthetic aspect: in terms of sound, unfortunately, Dunes of War fails to convince, presenting sound effects that are not very clear and defined, and in some cases details, of poor quality: the noise of your machine gun resembles, too closely, that of an M16 rifle. Conclusions Summing up, we do not feel like recommending Dunes of War to any player: Deep Silver's work is a triumph of carelessness, an indistinguishable sign of an economic and hasty realization, not up to what this house normally produces. If you are looking for a valid, or at least entertaining title, undoubtedly aim elsewhere and leave this probable last chapter of Panzer Elite Action gathering dust, not in the desert, but on the shelves. Pros Derisory system requirements It is sold at a budget price Cons Boring Superficial Technically poor Well yes, we fell for it again Who would have ever expected, after the first insignificant Panzer Elite Action, to go back to installing its sequel on our hard drives? Dunes of War is a title that has no connection with any war game released in the last five years: while developers from all over the world tended to achieve a minimum sense of realism, Deep Silver has instead well thought of an unexpected return to the most as well, churning out a complet gamearcade style. But the reasons why this genre has fallen out of favor is quite simple: players are no longer satisfied with walking and shooting without a minimum of logic or tension, but they must provide an adequate level of challenge and, probably, the biggest challenge you will be called the accomplishment is not to uninstall this game after a few minutes.", "date": "2007-02-06", "grade": null}
