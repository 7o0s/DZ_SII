Three years have passed since that first attempt, all the companies have gained experience with controls via stylus and Overlord in fact, unlike the initial experiments on DS, does not contemplate alternative solutions to the use of the touch screen. Nostalgia Button It is undeniable that Phantom Hourglass played - predictably - the watershed role in the evolution of control systems on Nintendo DS: after Link's little adventure on the Nintendo laptop, any other game, even if only vaguely associated conceptually, had a of the same type, completely basing the interaction on the use of the touch screen. Although the EAD game responded almost perfectly to the commands, some critics had to laugh at the absence of a more traditional alternative control: gratuitously conservative and somewhat inappropriate comments, given that many of the actions included in the adventure would have been poorer - sometimes even irreplicable - if done without a stylus. All this preamble to underline that the use of the touch screen alone represents a courageous choice (less now than then) and difficult to metabolise for both players and journalists, even when it leads to exclusive content and is perfectly implemented: in Overlord, on the contrary , it is applied on top of a traditional game design, it adds nothing compared to what could have been done through the buttons and, far more serious, the inputs are often not received at all. Such a rough interaction would be harmful for any game, and Overlord with better controls would not have been a masterpiece anyway, but in this way the whole more purely action phase - from the fights to the simple movement of the characters from one area to another - is too cumbersome, and creates difficulties where there shouldn't have been any. If the movement of the protagonists is approximate in most cases, the biggest problems arise in the interaction with objects, which require a fast and precise touch: very often it is misinterpreted by the game, or not interpreted at all, so activate switches, throwing stones or moving blocks, in addition to destroying the rhythm of the game, becomes excessively complicated. Puzzle Games Overlord still manages to save himself, at least partially, because the most important component of the gameplay lies in the puzzle solving, which is only partially affected by the frustrating problems of the control system. The stages are divided into various rooms, each of which is characterized by a more or less complex series of puzzles: at the beginning it is simply a question of activating a switch, but as the adventure progresses the puzzles gradually become more complex , until they intersect each other, creating intricate logical interweaving. There are four protagonists of Overlord, four demons who closely resemble the henchmen of Hades in the Disney Hercules, although less visually and characterically treated: each of them has, as is customary in the world of video games, unique abilities that differentiate it from the others . The entire game design is based on cooperation between the various elements of the team: to advance it is often necessary to make them move and attack together, make them perform combined moves, but above all knowing how to separate them at the right time, in order to unlock otherwise inaccessible paths. The difficulty of the puzzles often goes hand in hand with the number of characters employed in solving them: the more different paths one is forced to follow at the same time, the more articulated the possible implications of the single moves become and, therefore, the more bizarre the maze from which one must go out. There are few truly original solutions encountered in Overlord, however the levels are structured with skill and competence. For once in a game ~for everyone~ like this you play the bad guys, who are not really bad guys, but that's enough to create a nice reversal of perspective, which probably would have been even more significant if the developers had made them less monstrous - and more humane - the enemies. Despite this, the grotesque setting is well recreated, although it is not courageous in any of its choices: it simply fits into an already widely codified aesthetic context, but it does it with dignity, without making excessive missteps. The only onehighly questionable visual choice is the narration between one level and another, delegated to a sequence of static illustrations which, moreover, are frequently repeated: in all probability an ugly but natural consequence of the low budget. The settings differ more in content than in the atmosphere, grotesque and jokingly dark from start to finish, evoked almost exclusively through images: the sound accompaniment in fact remains anonymous throughout the course of the adventure.", "date": "2009-07-16", "grade": "5.9"}
