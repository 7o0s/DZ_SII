{"name": "Rayman M - Multiplayer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-m-multiplayer-si-diventa.html", "text": "Race&Battle, two games for the price of one? If you thought you were facing a product in the wake of the various Mario Kart 64 and various clones, you are off track. RaymanM offers two different, absolutely distinct game modes: by opting for the Race option, you will be able to participate, in the role of one of the available characters, in various championships, whose tracks are nothing more than full-blown platform levels (to be covered naturally at feet), which include climbing, aerial passages on the classic platforms suspended in the air, shortcuts and so on. The goal will naturally be to cross the finish line first, making the competitors controlled by the CPU eat the dust, who will be able to try to hinder you by activating the countless traps scattered around the track. On the contrary, the Battle mode offers a radically different gameplay: instead of the tracks we will have maps often similar to real deathmatch arenas, where RaymanM's characters can beat each other up using the vast and original weapons pool available. The entire setting of the game is therefore revolutionized, starting from the camera (closer although still in third person) up to the control system, which in this PC conversion has been made even more similar to that of FPS, allowing the classic pairing of the mouse +keyboard. The game is divided into various ~Championships~ of increasing difficulty, each of which corresponds to a set of tracks/arenas that can be played in the six overall sub-modes offered by the Race and Battle options. By progressing and achieving good results, the advanced tracks and secret characters will gradually be unlocked, with some extra bonuses, such as skins to customize your favorite competitor. The gratification of the senses I must admit that the graphics of the game are really a feast for the eyes and despite the not exaggerated number of polygons, the locations boast an excellent level of detail, also thanks to the use of extremely accurate textures, like those of the characters. About them I would like to say a few words in favor of the work done by the animators: each of the 8 competitors (including the secret ones) has a wide range of hilarious gags that cheer the player at the opening and closing of each match and which together with the hilarious ~ metalanguage made of grunts and vocal distortions, help to create a precise characterization for each of them. Returning to more purely technical issues, I must say that the PC version seemed to me generally more performing than the one for Ps2, sometimes afflicted by annoying and inexplicable slowdowns. The game isn't particularly greedy for resources, but I still suggest you to use a 500 Mhz processor and a nice GeForce, in order not to risk having to sacrifice something of the splendid graphics. On the sound front, we are once again at levels of excellence: the accompanying music is catchy and fully interprets the light-hearted setting of the game, with sustained but at the same time pleasant rhythms. The same goes for the sound effects and the ~voices~ of the characters I mentioned earlier: the care placed in every detail only confirms the importance of this title, which aims to be the new multi-platform hit from Ubisoft . But why Rayman M? Paradoxical as it may seem (and indeed it is) Rayman M(ultiplayer) cannot be played on the Internet. Already because the present here is a conversion from the original title released for Ps2, whose multi-user ambitions are limited to the purchase of a multitap and some healthy 4-player sessions (it is no coincidence that even in singleplayer, the ~bots~ if so we want to call them, never more than three). Mind you, I was able to personally see how much fun this mode is, both in Race and in Battle, but the concept of ~multiplayer~ on PC is certainly not this and since, moreover, in the PC conversion phase it was decided to limit the splitscreen to only 2 players (despite the box stating the opposite), the wording multiplayer that stands out proudly under the title of the game leaves us a bit dumbfounded. From what I was able to ascertain during a pleasant visit to the Ubisoft offices in Milan (I remember that the game was developed hand in hand by the Italian and French teams) within a very short time a new version of RaymanM with support for network play should appear on store shelves. But why Rayman M? Even buyers of the ~original~ game (released on December 13, it should be emphasized) will be able to painlessly replace it with the new one.va version, without additional costs (even if the modality of this ~exchange~ is not yet clear ... that it is enough to go to the trusted dealer with the box of the old RaymanM in hand?). Needless to say, the impression is that of having wanted to release the game at all costs in time for the greedy Christmas market, despite the fact that RaymanM is above all a console title, which will see its incarnation for Xbox and Gamecube in late 2002. In any case, we hope that this bizarre policy goes well, also because both game modes are too simple to complete alone and in particular the Battle option, however frenetic and fun, exhausts all attractions in a few hours Final judgement? Not yet! In conclusion, RaymanM for PC is certainly a great game, technically very valid and original in its contents, with a lot of nice gimmicks and pleasant details, which at first won't fail to make you cry in appreciation. Unfortunately, if you don't have a brother or a friend to play with, you'll get bored very soon: taken as a single-player experience, the game is short and repetitive, and in any case, playing it in two, you won't get to appreciate half of the potential it has. able to voice its counterpart for Ps2. In short, the party-game formula has been ascertained that it doesn't seem to work on PC, but if the ~enhanced~ version is really made available, the game will really be able to give its best! Rayman was undoubtedly the herald of the platform genre on PC, the charismatic character who managed to break through despite the genre historically more suited to console pads than to our severe keyboards. Although with the death of the 16-bit consoles the 2D platformers also disappeared, the most popular characters soon reappeared in their flamboyant polygonal incarnation, starting the new trend of 3D platformers, which Ubisoft itself also proposed to PC users , with the arrival Rayman2: The Great Escape. Now, with more than five years of honorable videogame militancy behind him, Rayman, following a now consolidated process, is preparing to transform himself into a racing and fighting game, bringing with him the entire clique of crazy characters who accompanied him in the game. over the years.
