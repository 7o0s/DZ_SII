{"name": "Divertiti con l'Inglese", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/divertiti-con-linglese.html", "text": "While deviating from the various ~brain trainers~ for the topic covered, titles such as Have fun with English leverage more or less on the same points: they offer a series of exercises that combine skill and knowledge, mixing the two to arrive at a tangible result, in this case an effective improvement in the understanding of English. A short while ago we had a similar product at hand developed by Kit Maker, or English Trainer, which however was aimed above all at beginners. The Gameloft counterpart immediately gives the idea of targeting those who already know English and want to deepen it. Let's see how... The start screen of Enjoy English shows us three possible choices: Test, Practice and Results. The first item is very similar to the main mode present in the various software for exercising the mind, in the sense that a series of tests is faced and in the end the sums of what are the player's abilities in terms of vocabulary are summed up , grammar, understanding and expression of English. All this is translated into a numerical score, the test can be repeated several times a day and of course there is a graph that shows us our possible progress over time (always accessible from the Results item). The Practice mode, on the other hand, is used to train with the exercises that are ~drafted~ for the test, exercises divided into three categories (school, real life, entertainment) for a total of twelve different applications. There is a bit of everything: in some cases you have to complete sentences by inserting the right word or verb, in others you have to understand the meaning of some cartoons and select the most suitable sentence to describe them, or be able to understand the meaning of some slang terms. The selection is quite wide and varied, there are certainly some exercises that are more complicated than others for ~systematic~ reasons (for example that of the cartoons...) but the number of different questions is not very high and already after a few games you will run into into something already seen. Furthermore, the player's skill is never called into question, often all one does is move on predefined squares and the most important thing is to make one's choices quickly. Technically, Have fun with English can only be essential and functional to what is done on the screen. The graphics try to be lively with a good use of colors, but where it is most needed (the cartoons) it is rather dark. The menus are intuitive and navigating between them is quick and nimble, but there is a slowdown when you enable audio. As for the latter, there's a catchy and well-crafted theme song accompanied by some convincing effects, but nothing memorable. The control system is very simple and immediate, just use the joystick to move between the various answers and press 5 to confirm your choice.
