For centuries the population has made immense sacrifices to prepare an expedition to another planet, made up mostly of water, where they can move to rebuild their civilization, provided that conditions prove to be favourable. Mei, the protagonist of the adventure, is a scout, that is one of the people selected for the vital mission. For years she has been trained to survive in the most adverse conditions, receiving all the knowledge necessary to face the challenge. Naturally she won't be alone: with her there will be a whole team of highly trained people, including technicians, doctors and operations directors. On the day of departure, ours leaves her home, says goodbye to her family and makes one last trip to her planet, before being asleep for a thousand years in a state of cryogenic sleep on the spaceship that will take her to what could become her new home. Or the grave of its people's hopes. This in a nutshell is the premise of this title born from a collaboration between Superbrothers and Pine Scented: here is the review of JETT: The Far Shore. Speeding through the JETT Mei, the protagonist of JETT: The Far Shore As the introduction should have made you understand, JETT: The Far Shore is focused on the exploration of what we can consider a real promised land, on which the inhabitants of the planet of Mei have been attracted by the hymnwave, a kind of intergalactic call that guaranteed his salvation. The game begins with a long tutorial in which you are invited to familiarize yourself with the controls of the JETT, the ultra-technological vehicle that will support us for the entire game. Considering the time that we will spend on it, it is better to keep in mind what is explained to us by our talkative travel companion, who has the task of giving us explanations on anything ... anything, even several times on the same thing within a few seconds. It can be really nerve-wracking at times, especially when you've figured out exactly what to do and he keeps repeating it, but in the early stages it's quite useful. Our JETT can accelerate, turn sharply, leap forward, leap into the sky, scan fauna and flora, throw harpoons to collect objects, animate or inanimate, illuminate the night with powerful searchlights and protect us in various ways with shields and other items that can be added to the base equipment as the missions progress. Don't expect fierce shootings or who knows what other form of extreme violence because our scouts were educated to respect the planet they want to move to and not to destroy its natural beauty. At most, the occasional attackers can be frightened off with a leap from the JETT, or distracted with some ruse related to knowledge of the planet, but that's all. In this regard, it is interesting to note how the environment itself was designed to appear as a large ecosystem, in which all the elements are somehow related to each other, even if only conceptually. You can rest assured that for every predator that will come after you, be it small, large or mammoth, there will surely be a natural compensating element somewhere that will put it out of action if exploited correctly. In addition to speeding on the JETT, from time to time Mei will or will have to go ashore, either to rest, or to carry out tasks. In reality, the sections on foot, strictly in first person, serve above all to allow the player to deepen Mei's relationship with the other characters, with whom she can speak through a dialogue system based on the choice of topics, and to progress the story with purely narrative moments, even if they were simple connecting sequences between the missions. Gameplay Speeding with the JETT can be very beautiful JETT: The Far Shore works when you're in your vehicle and hurtling through the game world at full speed, avoiding obstacles and exploring the environment. Running on the water trying not to overheat the engines, or jumping on the dense vegetation of a forest, or even darting through a vast desert area, are all moments that have their own intrinsic value due to the artistic and stylistic choices that characterize the game, which they enhance the moments of detachment and abandonment to the flow of the gameplay itself. Too bad there is always someone to tell us what to do, or to remind us. It is also a pity that, especially in the more intricate areas (those with more luxuriant vegetation), you often end up stuck somewhere and that sometimes it takes more than a few minutes to get out of the way. The typical mission of JETT: The Far Shore is: aadd the indicated area and explore it. In reality there are no real quests: the game is divided into macro missions, all structured in sub-sections with different tasks to perform. For example, you can go to the discovery of a new biome and on the way you can stop to collect a particular object or to examine something that has been discovered while travelling. Artistically excellent, it fails to involve narratively From this point of view, the authors have done everything to give the idea of being faced with organic situations, i.e. determined by the natural course of events, in order to avoid the fetch quest effect of similar titles. It's a pity that sometimes they didn't regulate certain situations well, creating particularly annoying dead moments. For example in some cases we will be asked to examine an area by scanning everything present and we will be given a time limit to do so. Well, even if you manage to find everything before the timer expires, you will still have to wait for it to run out before you can continue, with holes sometimes lasting several minutes to fill by going around doing practically nothing. The walking phases, on the other hand, can be described as simple walking simulators. Mei can at most shoot, to speed up her movements, and interact with fixed hot spots but, as already mentioned, we are faced with purely narrative moments, in which the deepest and mystical nature of the game emerges. Superficial construction Some mechanics leave the time they find The main problem with Jett the Far Shore is that it doesn't really know what it wants to be and doesn't do much of what it sets out to do well. On the one hand there is the narrative game, which occupies an immense but not exclusive space on the scene, on the other there are various mechanics which essentially seem like tinsel put there just to justify the fact of being in front of a video game and which turn out to be really superficial, especially in a title where to be honest there isn't much to do, apart from JETT. Sometimes it seems as if they were added in the running just to have something more to offer to the player, without having a decisive impact on the gameplay. In the long run, not only do they prove superficial in execution and almost completely superfluous, but they often end up being counterproductive for the rhythm, because they distract from the narrative and have no relevant specificity, except that of making us waste some time and making longer than the missions that could have been completed in a much more agile way. Paradoxically, if the developers had limited themselves to letting us drive the Jett at full speed, without having to worry about scans or carrying out missions that are often more time consuming than exciting, the story would have benefited from it, which instead turns out to be fragmented and less compelling. so much so that it drags itself towards the end in a tired and predictable way. The base of operations on the new planet The Superbrothers are masters in creating great atmospheres through a refined narrative style, which is sublimated by an aesthetic vision of the original and, at times, unsettling game world. Unfortunately in this case they have sinned very much in the ability to give their work a wider scope. For instance, Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP, their previous title, worked well because it never tried to transcend the experience it aimed to offer, sticking to its vision throughout the adventure. Here we perceive greater performance anxiety, which ends up leaving us dumbfounded on more than one occasion. Moreover, despite being in front of an open world, JETT: The Far Shore is stained by a castrating linearity. But let's try to explain: after finishing the game the first time, we restarted a game with the knowledge already acquired. Our goal was to crack the system to see if we could change anything or, at least, get ahead of the times. The result left us dumbfounded. You pass the tutorial, which as such can only be didactic and carved in stone, but from the second mission onwards we tried to do things differently from the first game, without obtaining results. For example, we knew we had to get an attacker's attention in a certain way, but we couldn't do it until the game gave us permission. Artistic side Graphically it is very simple, but creates beautiful landscapes Strangely, JETT: The Far Shore is also controversial from an artistic point of view. On the one hand there is the aesthetic part, not very rich, but composed in such a way as to be fascinating, thanks to the melancholy colors that permeate theentire game, to the simple but highly expressive 3D models, to the delicate and never overwhelming soundtrack and to a direction of the interlude sequences that greatly enhances the minimalism of the staging. On the other hand, however, there is a narrative made up of not exactly exciting dialogues and characters that are anything but memorable, so it is difficult to feel the slightest empathy, so much so that when the ending arrives you end up feeling almost no emotion , despite the upheaval it entails. Probably the general coldness is desired, but it becomes counterproductive when the characters begin to express feelings and require participation on the part of the user. Attention, because the game is undoubtedly fascinating as an aesthetic experience, so much so that we can consider it one of its strengths, but at the same time it always seems to want to keep its distance, to the point that, once the adventure is over, what remains is the impression of having made a long journey on the JETT in a world of unspeakable beauty, which however, on closer inspection, has left us only a few postcards to send to relatives as a testament of its existence.", "date": "2021-10-04", "grade": "5.0"}
