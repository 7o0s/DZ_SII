{"name": "Rpublique Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/145846-republique-remastered-speranze-nascoste.html", "text": "Successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2012, through a campaign capable of raising over 500,000 dollars, Rpublique is the debut title of a team made up of developers who boast a respectable curriculum, having worked on projects such as Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, Halo 4 and F.E.A.R. The creation of a PC version of the game was part of the plans from the beginning, although the times have dilated considerably compared to the time window that the authors imagined; so much so that even on Steam the package only includes the first three episodes of the five that make up the adventure, with the fourth and fifth arriving ~soon~ (free, mind you), let's assume in conjunction with the publication on the App Store and Google Play. However, let's try to understand what we are talking about, even more so if you have not read the reviews (one, two and three) relating to the mobile edition. Inspired by the famous novel ~1984~, Rpublique projects us into a dystopian society, in the role of a mysterious ~big brother~ who has the task of helping young Hope escape from her re-education program. On smartphones, the narration can boast a greater sense of identification, given that we find ourselves acting as if we were ourselves the mysterious person who provides support to the protagonist, hacking the cameras to suggest when to move and when to hide. with a view to solid stealth-based gameplay and, above all, very well directed. A touch of class that has obviously been lost on the PC, compensated however by the excellent work done by the developers on the technical front, able to make the product visually convincing and current even on the Windows platform. Rpublique Remastered is an immersive, solid and very well narrated stealth-based adventure Video game voyeur As mentioned at the beginning, Rpublique Remastered uses a very interesting interface, which starts from the camera of the smartphone found (by chance?) by Hope and therefore allows you to freely control the many surveillance cameras Metamorphosis, the huge underground structure, is equipped with from which we must try to escape. If you have played with Watch Dogs, you will quickly understand how the system works, which however brings with it some quite annoying limitations, for example it is sometimes difficult to direct the girl towards the desired direction or door, unless you have the right shot . On mobile devices everything worked via touch screen, but the transition to PC appears immediately well organized, with the mouse / keyboard combination that allows you to control the shots with great precision (on the usual WASDs) and Hope's movements, which reacts to mouse click reaching the areas that we indicate and moving along the walls automatically if this maneuver can serve to not be noticed by a passing guard. Finally, pressing the space bar activates the OMNIView mode, which firstly allows you to jump from one camera to another, secondly to ~collect~ a large number of clues that add facets to the excellent plot, and which we can then ~sell~ to a mysterious entity whose monitors are found in the containment cells where we will be confined every time we make a mistake, making us get caught by enemies. Also from the tactical view you can access the map of the area, in order to identify the place to reach, hang up the view on Hope if we had gone too far in our jumps from one electronic eye to another and finally interact with a whole series of devices, even and above all with a view to creating useful diversions. The goodies By purchasing the Deluxe edition of Rpublique Remastered on Steam, at the price of 31.99 euros (25.59 in promotion), you can download an interesting extra package for free, which includes the original soundtrack, a six-part documentary illustrating the development of the game and two nice ~prototypes~ from which Camouflaj started to create the final version of her adventure: Human Condition and Vertical Slice. Untapped potential? The experience of Rpublique Remastered is not particularly punitive, given that with each failed attempt Hope is taken to a nearby cell, from which she can escape in a matter of seconds thanks to our intervention on the switches, and where she can possibly recharge the battery of her terminal OMNI. The latter is the device with which we can interface during the adventure, and which allows the girl to lock or unlock doors and safety deposit boxes, activate mechanisms and so on. Actions that must be used judiciously, given that each of them withsumas a ~notch~ of the charge indicator, with the risk of being left without help in the critical phases. For the reasons described at the beginning of the paragraph, however, this design choice does not involve particular problems: even if you end up in the hands of a guard, it will be enough to repeat the last section starting from a cell and take advantage of the experience gained to adopt a strategy more effective. There are also tools, such as the taser or pepper spray, that allow you to avoid arrest and momentarily knock out an enemy, so you have time to get away. Of course, by completing the first three episodes, one realizes that some of the game's potential is unexpressed: the weapons themselves, but also the environmental puzzles (there are just a couple) and the expedient of closing the doors, which in the intentions of the developers should perhaps have played a bigger role in the gameplay economy. The final result, with all the characteristics typical of stealth games (therefore also frequent moments of waiting where one has to study the path of a guard), still succeeds in the difficult task of balancing difficulty and concreteness in the best possible way, without ever giving the sensation of a too simple or inconsistent experience, but at the same time avoiding the possible frustration episodes of a well-planned action that fails because of a trivial mistake. The goodness of the Camouflaj-branded product, however, lies above all in its presentation, in the punctual and stylish direction (some sequences are really, really beautiful), in the excellent performance of the voice actors (too bad it's all in English, texts included) and, as mentioned , in a technical sector that substantially improves the graphics seen on iOS and Android, adding details, sharp textures, shaders and valuable light effects thanks to the transition from Unity 4 to Unity 5.", "date": "2015-02-26", "grade": "S.V."}
