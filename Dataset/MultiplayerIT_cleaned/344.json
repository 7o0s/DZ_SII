The first great adventure that managed to fully join that myth that responds to the name of Monkey Island. An important title, capable of attracting a huge number of fans eager to see George and Nico, the first adventure couple, back in action. But this also leads to extremely high expectations. After the criticisms rained down on The Sleeping Dragon due to the too ~console oriented~ interface and longshoreman sections (those, to be clear, in which one did nothing but push around crates, boxes or similar objects) so frequent as to arrive ad nauseum, enthusiasts expect, and dare I say rightly, dutiful steps forward. And progress has been made. Already BS3 wanted to be an innovation in the field of graphic adventures, a breath of renewal in a genre that at that moment seemed to be given up for dead. BS4 follows in his footsteps and goes further, deviating even more than its predecessor from the generic point-and-click adventure canons to marry a more cinematic style, made up of changes of pace, tension, action and important puzzles in perfect Indiana style Jones. it is therefore a hybrid adventure that makes many aspects of three genres its own A heavy legacy However, however admirable the attempt to modernize the hackneyed clich of the graphic adventure by adding other components, each of them remains almost isolated and in its own right. A clear subdivision, which appears even more marked when you notice how the loads within the same location occur systematically every time there is a change in the style of play. This simple (sometimes not so...) puzzle game introduces you to the main puzzles of BS4. Their number is not large, and moreover they are accurately placed in the most important stages of the story. At first sight they look like the many small puzzles that have spread in almost all graphic adventures in recent years, with a subjective view of the source of the problem to be solved, but their resolution is very atypical compared to normal point and click adventures and more akin to first-person ones like Myst and Riven. In fact, instead of having all the elements to solve them already at hand, we will only be faced with the mechanism to activate. The clues necessary to understand how to reach the solution will be found elsewhere, among the information downloaded with difficulty with the PDA or hidden in manuscripts in the form of drawings or cryptic sentences to interpret. These tests (because such they are for the purposes of the plot) can be roughly divided into two groups: the logical puzzles (almost enigmatic), and the real puzzles that require a real analysis of the information available, a bit like the three rehearsals of ~Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade~. Finally, there are the livelier parts. True to his reputation as a reckless reckless, George (but not only him as you will see) will not hesitate to embark on dangerous climbs, walks along the ledges and daring routes hanging from gutters, cables or pipes. And equally faithful to his nature of incurable nosy, he will take advantage of every opportunity to sneak under the noses of very incompetent guards to be able to infiltrate buildings that, in theory, should be impregnable. Introduced on a trial basis in BS2, the stealth and action sequences with the passing of the editions have become increasingly long, complex and frequent up to occupying a good quarter of the game time. Together with them, the boxes to be moved also make their reappearance, so frequent in BS3 as to get on the nerves, but which, this time, have been reduced to a minimum, even if the first chapter would suggest the opposite. The purpose of these phases is to break up the rhythm of the game, giving the player something different from the usual to do, and for this reason they are not complex at all. Play, jump, think... possibly all together Apparently it seems difficult to make a point and click adventure original. In the end, the things to do are always the same: take an object, use an object on something/someone, occasionally combine them, talk to the characters... Yet BS4 succeeds. The secret is all in inventory management. For years we have been used to thinking that in adventure games objects are disposable. You use them and then they disappear. Occasionally there are some special cases that are reused a few more times, but these are mostly exceptions to the rule. Also, all too often, items found in a clearing are only for use within itto. This definitely keeps the inventory slim, but at the same time makes the game far too predictable and mundane. BS4 is completely different. George never throws anything away, not even handkerchiefs, empty bottles and tourist brochures. And it's only good, because almost all of them will come in handy several times later (even 3 or 4, one even a dozen) and often in completely different places from the original one. The more time passes, therefore, the more the inventory will become full, and the more, consequently, it will be long and cumbersome to go by trial and error, in favor of a more reasoned and motivated approach. A second, pleasant novelty is represented by teamwork. Often George will be accompanied by another character (several will take turns throughout the story), to whom he can turn for physical help or to implement a diversion. To receive his collaboration we can simply ask him, or select his image in the inventory and use it with any other object. Considering that George will almost always be accompanied by fascinating exponents of the fairer sex, it can really be said that the term ~woman object~ has thus reached a new frontier... It is only a pity that some of the occasions in which teamwork is necessary are a a little too obvious (two levers to be moved together, two buttons to be pressed at the same time and so on), almost as if all the builders of catacombs and undergrounds had agreed to make it completely impossible for just one person to continue. Play, jump, think... possibly all together Among the many work tools that George will make extensive use of (including a telescopic putter of his own invention, of which he is particularly proud), the PDA (Personal Digital Assistant, or simply palmtop) must be absolutely mentioned. An object that alone contains three: telephone, notepad and minicomputer. Thanks to it and the help of a colleague with... let's say... particular skills... we will be able to crack servers, networks or individual computers to obtain information or activate tools and mechanisms. Every time we find ourselves trying to break a system, we will have to solve a puzzle game which consists in making a ray, which represents our connection, follow a certain path by making it bounce against small bars that work like mirrors. In the more advanced stages, the game becomes more and more difficult, above all when, without the slightest warning, pieces aesthetically identical to the previous ones, but with different characteristics (I won't tell you anything else, otherwise I'll reveal the trick). The information thus obtained will all end up in the notebook of the PDA, and we will be able to access it through thematic links in the same style as Wikipedia. This information will be useful not only to us, but also to George, who, rightly so, will be able to reach conclusions only after we have gone through every single row of the data collected. Another touch of realism particularly appreciated. Graphics, animation and interface BS4 is entirely in 3D. A risky choice, which leads him to a direct comparison with one of the greatest masterpieces ever created: Fahrenheit (albeit atypical as an adventure). And BS4 comes out with broken bones. If from a distance it still seems to settle on good levels, as soon as the camera approaches the characters all the defects are noticed, or rather the edges of the polygons. The faces, especially the female ones, are well cared for, with the exception of the protruding dentures with which all the characters seem to have. On the contrary, the bodies leave much to be desired. Furthermore, mimicry, both facial and body, is almost completely non-existent, except on rare occasions, to the point that on some occasions we witness almost grotesque scenes (a character enthroned over another who is fainting instead of bending over to help him and see how he is). If the main characters, more or less, are saved, the same is not true for the secondary ones and the mobile components of the environment. Animations reduced to a bare minimum, often sparse and unconvincing, like the dog of one of the sentinels that seems stuffed and moves like one of those electric dogs you see in commercials. Apparently, it seems that the graphics engine completely lacks all the algorithms for interacting with three-dimensional objects. Characters never touch each other during gameplay, and rarely do during frequent cutscenes (created with the same engine as the game). Just as rarely they actually take the items, more often they just disappear. Graphics, animation and interface At the time, BS3 was criticized for its interface, which was too tied to console controls. In particular, one of the featuresWhat was most contested was the choice of linking the movement controls to the screen (therefore to the point of view of the player and not to the character), unlike the equally contested Monkey Island 4 in which the movements were referred to the protagonist (that is to say his point of view and not that of the player). The defect of the screen-centric setting (forgive the neologism) is that, every time you change screen, the character changes its direction based on the new references with the screen. We still remember an action scene in which it was necessary to escape from the collapse of a cave, which proved extremely difficult as shortly after the start of the escape the view was reversed and, consequently, George suddenly went back ending up systematically buried. In BS4 the console setting has disappeared and the dear mouse is back (very welcome return). We therefore have a hybrid interface, in which the mouse still maintains the pointing function, while the keyboard is almost indispensable when you need to move quickly. The optimal situation would be to combine the two controls, ie using the keyboard to move and the mouse to target hot spots. With practice and experience it is possible to adapt to this interface, but it takes time, time that you would not want to waste in an adventure in which, unlike other genres such as FPS for example, the controls should only be simple and direct. Graphics, animation and interface The subtitles in Italian deserve a brief note. The translation is not always faithful, or at least correct, and this can create some problems in understanding some clues regarding the main puzzles. In some cases, we even found ourselves forced to pay attention exclusively to spoken English (extremely clean and easy to understand even when people with a heavy accent are speaking) to understand the correct meaning. Finally a technical warning: BS4 is an extremely dark game and, unfortunately, it lacks gamma and brightness controls, moreover (and this is serious), it does not keep the relative settings of the video card. So be careful if you have a monitor with a few years too old on your shoulders, because you may find yourself not seeing a few years from your nose. Use the screenshots for reference. The fine line between long-lived and watered down BS4 is a long adventure. An undoubtedly positive feature, which adventure games too often lack. However, it is good to go and see how it obtains its duration. Here too it is good to divide the game into its three primary components, since they are so dissimilar from each other. the density of the actions to be carried out is not particularly high, many locations could be completed quickly, but the structure of the game itself does not allow to do so The fine line between long-lived and watered down There is no way to skip dialogues, nor cutscenes. Furthermore, it is not possible to speed up the movements as was the case in the past with a double click on the edge of the location. This is due to the entirely 3D graphics engine which forces you to always move manually. And the awkwardness of the interface certainly doesn't help, especially at the beginning. This is maximized by the continuous comings and goings that one is forced almost continuously to find an object or talk to someone. This, undeniably, increases the duration of the game, but also the frustration of the player who would like to skip unnecessary parts (the walk from one place to another) or parts of the dialogue that he has already witnessed. Likewise, most of the climbing and stealth sequences seem totally free and not at all functional for the purposes of the plot. The same puzzle games to break the systems end up boring after a while. The plot itself, at certain points, clashes, and some having seem to be stuck by force only to bring the character in a certain condition. Final comment Broken Sword: The Angel of Death is a very controversial and difficult to evaluate game. The final impression is that it has added nothing to the Broken Sword saga, indeed, it has taken something away from it. What was missing was the push to play, to go forward and see how the story unfolded. fluctuating, absolutely not ugly, but which leaves no trace, and which alternates flashes of class with moments of tiredness. Much, too much, in a game of this type, depends exclusively on the personal taste of the individual player, what he is looking for, what he can't stand and how much he is willing to let go. If you are looking for a complete, varied and durable adventure, this is it. without a doubt, a good choice. And if you don't scare stealth sequences and don't find long sequ boring", "date": "2006-10-10", "grade": null}
