{"name": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna ~ The Golden Country", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/xenoblade-chronicles-2-torna-the-golden-country-la-recensione.html", "text": "We assume that talking about without mentioning some crucial points in the history of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is practically impossible, so if you have not yet played the latest Monolith Soft blockbuster, we advise you to read the next few lines with caution: you may come across some previews and find out some details ahead of time. Come back ~ The Golden Country is in fact a sort of prequel: in Tetsuya Takahashi's intentions, it should have been a playable flashback about three-quarters of the way through the adventure, but then, due to time constraints, the team had to put it aside until the success of the title convinced Nintendo to authorize the development of new content for an expansion pass. The latter, therefore, unlocks a generous amount of side missions that the Japanese developer has published during 2018, plus the expansion itself, a long campaign that tells a fundamental moment in the mythology of Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Go back ~ The Golden Country therefore takes place five hundred years before the events narrated in the main campaign and ideally should be played as a kind of intermission between chapters seven and eight that delves into some aspects of the story, better delineating the personalities and motivations of some characters . The absolute protagonists are in fact Jin, the Gladius, and Lora, his Driver, but the DLC also and above all focuses on Mythra, establishing tasty parallels with the original title. Among old acquaintances and new faces, Addam undoubtedly stands out, the practically legendary figure who is always talked about in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and who, in this expansion, finally shows himself with his hood down, revealing one of the most interesting and mature protagonists in the long and complicated Alrest story. The inevitability of fate The main themes of Torna ~ The Golden Country are once again the value of memory, the importance of personal identity, hope for a better life and faith in the future, but in the expansion Takahashi completely reverses the players' perspective , betting everything on the fact that every gesture becomes futile, every word insignificant, every desire completely in vain: we already know the sad fate of Omrantha and all its inhabitants. The expansion then sculpts a tale of the inevitability and injustice of war through the eyes of Jin and Lora, two individuals who have found each other and who struggle to carve out a peaceful corner in a future that will never be. Come back ~ The Golden Country is a heartbreaking fairy tale in virtually every respect. It is the story of a hero who turns his back on good out of loneliness and desperation, the story of a sense of guilt as heavy as a boulder in front of which one can do nothing but hide, the story of one, ten, a hundred very ordinary people who one fine day cease to exist without even knowing why. In the short time available, Takahashi sacrifices the characterization of some new characters - Hugo and Haze above all - to devote himself completely to Jin, Lora, Mythra and Addam. In the end, one can't help but look at Xenoblade Chronicles 2 with different eyes, even a tad wet. The dialogues of the Japanese writer tend to be a little too dense and verbose, but when Takahashi wants to strike at the heart he does it without half measures even in a mere DLC, using words and music artfully. The latter is one of the high points of Torna ~ The Golden Country: the new tracks by Yasunori Mitsuda are excellent even when they adopt the jazz rhythms that can alienate at first but end up convincing within a few minutes. Thanks also to the small remixes of the music already heard, the world of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 takes on new features even as we explore the plains of Gormott again, the other titan we will visit during the adventure. There are two, in particular, the new dynamics that have the greatest impact on the narrative. The first is made up of the camps, a novelty that allows players to rest during their journeys and make the various heroes chat: the dialogues convey something more about them and help to better outline their personalities. Camps also allow you to make amulets and cook dishes that give temporary bonuses, but their usefulness is relative, even if they come in handy in fights with tougher enemies. Prestige, on the other hand, is an ingenious mechanic that has a dual function. It is very reminiscent of the social diagram seen in the first Xenoblade Chronicles, albeit clearer and more orderly: every time we meet an inhabitant, we discover something about him and this helps to draw a huge networkrelationship issue that unlocks more and more secondary tasks, solving which increases the level of Prestige in and of itself. It's a strange mechanic that at some point even becomes mandatory if you want to complete the campaign. Takahashi, however, being a great smartass, manipulates this aspect of the gameplay - which all in all serves specifically to prolong its longevity - transforming it into a deadly narrative twist. The new combat system Let's say that knowing and helping dozens of secondary characters, even knowing that our actions will not change their tragic destiny, is already sad in itself, but seeing the end of a civilization with our own eyes, after having shared its small joys and sorrows, is absolutely heartbreaking. In this sense, the Prestige diagram assumes a decidedly different importance, but still relies on an exorbitant number of secondary missions which, unfortunately, are not always very inspired. Fortunately, most of the time is spent fighting in the suggestive scenarios of Alrest, and especially on the back of the new titan, but for the occasion Monolith Soft has made a series of interesting changes to the combat system assimilated in the main campaign, even managing to justify some changes with some narrative trick. I'm not satisfied with having improved the engine, giving us much cleaner images than a few months ago, the Japanese developer has also worked on the dynamism of the already excellent combat system, finally allowing us to directly control the Gladius as well. It is now possible to switch the place of Gladius and Driver by pressing a button and this results in a surprise attack that can throw the enemy off balance, guaranteeing the possibility of ringing strategic combos. Obviously it is not possible to abuse this mechanic, given that you have to wait for a short recharge period, but it makes the fights much more frenetic and at the same time reasoned, thanks also to the fact that each character has vanguard and rearguard attack techniques that the player can upgrade by spending the appropriate points earned by winning battles. To these is also added a new and risky personal technique, different for each character, which guarantees an important positive effect at the cost of life points or other disadvantages, and which therefore must be used with some caution. The customization system is the sufficiently rich one of Xenoblade Chronicles 2: we can therefore improve weapons and skills, equip accessories and talismans, unlock nodes in the understanding diagrams that give new powers and bonuses to Gladius and Driver. However, the ~lottery~ of core crystals is absent, given that the Gladius are only those that history imposes on us, but we doubt that anyone will miss one of the most controversial aspects of Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Lacking that dynamic of the gameplay, Monolith Soft therefore had to operate on a general streamlining of the combat mechanics, and so redesigned the chain of Gladius combos in a simpler and more linear version based on a sequence of special attacks with increasing power. Although apparently simplified, the combat system in Torna ~ The Golden Country seemed to us to evolve in a more intuitive and enjoyable direction that still guarantees satisfactory control of the battlefield through strategies that mix interactivity and planning. This is particularly noticeable in the final stages of the adventure, when the enemies become much more challenging and the bosses require some preparation to be defeated. In this sense, Torna ~ The Golden Country behaves almost like a full-fledged RPG, complete with secret side-quests and very powerful optional bosses. To complete the campaign, completing the minimum union of side missions that increase the level of Prestige, it takes about twenty abundant hours that can touch thirty if you decide to sift through every corner and defeat every enemy. Being a DLC, it is clearly a commendable duration that underlines all the passion and dedication of the developer towards his creation and the fans who have enjoyed it.", "date": "2018-09-23", "grade": null}
