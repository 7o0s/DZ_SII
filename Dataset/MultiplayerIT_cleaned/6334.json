It is likely that that particular mix of action, combat, design and very oriental settings has managed to fascinate, cloaked in that halo of a rough gem in the making. With this sequel, the developer Wanin International tries to take up what was told and throw it a few meters ahead in a rather large fray of competitors. If it is true that the world of action was captured by a sort of storm from the soulslike genre many years ago, it cannot be said that there isn't a hard core of the public, even quite numerous, who over the years have always shown that they appreciate a bit of healthy and frenetic finger exercise on the pad. Follow us in our review of Dusk Diver 2 to understand if this is the action you've been waiting for. You need to know the story A cityscape from Dusk Diver 2 They also told us at school: those who don't know history don't understand where they are living. Dusk Diver 2 has somewhat the same intransigent approach of the elderly homegrown teachers: right from the first lines of the complicated world of characters, factions, powers and enemies that surrounds a fictitious Taipei, it is clear that if you have not played the first episode, you he will have a really hard life following the many lines on the screen, obviously only in English. The developer doesn't want to take prisoners: either you know what and who you're talking about, or you should put a punching bag inside the house and let off steam with it. In any case, the events are one year after the end of the first episode, with the protagonist Yumo alternating between the ordinary dimension and that of the Chaos Beasts, with powers that we will let you discover, in an alternation between normal girlish life and relentless fury in dungeons filled with monsters. Provided we go beyond this initial bewilderment, the action / role-playing game structure of Dusk Diver 2 has its own reason, thanks to a quest system that draws from the past but is at least enriched by an aesthetic key very similar to the Shin Megami, especially Persona and Tokyo Mirage Session. This time, as anticipated, no Tokyo but the Ximending district of Taipei: we are therefore still in the East, but in a nation that somehow has its own exotic and stylistic features different from the canons to which we may have become accustomed over the years. For once, an oriental metropolis different from the usual. We were saying, Yumo: when she and her team meet a mysterious boy and also an unknown pursuer of his, a fight starts between factions attracted by the power of the Dragon Vein. And now ready to fight. Punching and kicking everyone A fight from Dusk Diver 2 The focus of Dusk Diver 2 is clearly its dungeon action structure, with a splash of role-playing and sometimes musou. However, unlike other more elegant titles, the amount of text, keys, actions and operations available is initially overwhelming: even in the hands of expert players of similar titles, the way in which the game throws at the player everything there is to learn to take the first steps in the initial dungeon. After this first phase, you enter the combat system, certainly more stratified than the first but visibly a little immature, limited, not very incisive: we are still, for the umpteenth time, faced with a not very rewarding system, in which as soon as you understands which is the character of the team that does the most damage, that one is used for hours and hours, without great incentives for change, despite the fact that the protagonists are freely interchangeable in battles. The graphics in Dusk Diver 2 have a certain style Let's also assume that the way in which many enemies are drawn pushes towards a sometimes boring approach to combat, made up of long but not very galvanizing life bars, predictable enemy attacks and only a lot, a lot of time to lose in the fights and here is the element that was supposed to shine under the hood turns out to be something only passable. The interlude of growth or equipment management is predictable, quite inserted in the classic dictates already seen and revised. Even the quest system, or enhancement through eating, in general the design of the dungeons, is not bad, it simply doesn't really add anything at all: it is pure execution of things already seen a thousand other times before, this time however in Taipei instead that Tokyo. A few words on the technical sector on Switch: the title runs well, with some small hesitation of frames, but of little importance. The character design is certainly good, minus the polygonal transposition of the characters, rather poor and almost the daughter of a generation ago. It is probablythe price to pay for making the 30 frames as stable as possible, but we've seen much more substantial titles run better than this.", "date": "2022-08-24", "grade": "6.2"}
