{"name": "Teneri orsetti da massacrare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71191-battle-bears-teneri-orsetti-da-massacrare.html", "text": "~I'll hug you until I suffocate you~: this is more or less the motto of the tender teddy bears who in Battle Bears represent the enemy to be killed. At the head of an assault team also made up of talking bears, in this case however very little inclined to tenderness, the player must therefore face a series of stages in which he must literally shoot everything that moves. Our character is barricaded behind some sandbags that can only temporarily protect him from the violent effusions of his opponents, who arrive en masse and don't stop until they are torn to pieces. The operation of such a simple mechanic on the iPhone is even more intuitive: with the right thumb we adjust the movement of the sight, with the left one we open fire with the weapon equipped. It is possible to bring an extra weapon into battle in addition to the default machine gun: we must choose it during the break between one level and another and press the relative icon on the screen to equip it. The extra weapons increase as we complete the stages, and offer us alternative and interesting functions: the ~bearzooka~, for example, is a classic rocket launcher (loaded in this case with the remains of already killed bears) with great firepower, capable of wiping out entire groups of enemies with a single blow; the crossbow instead offers a more precise but lethal type of attack: one shot is enough to take a teddy bear out of the way; the megaphone does not look like a real weapon, but with vulgar blows it can ~scandalize~ enemies to the point of stunning them for a few moments. You can also spend your points to harden the protective sandbags, so they'll last longer when the pressure builds. The main game mode is also the only one available, unfortunately, therefore the even small expense of 79 cents to purchase the SkyVu Pictures product appears a bit disproportionate to the offer, at least compared to many other titles at the same price but definitely more ~ full-bodied~. What a cute little bear, almost crushing him... The strength of Battle Bears certainly lies in the amusing interlude sequences between one stage and another (unfortunately not localized in Italian), which advance the ~plot~ and introduce new locations and new weapons. The game itself, however, quickly becomes repetitive and devoid of particular bite: in the end it is nothing more than a sort of ~survival~ in which the opponents gradually become more numerous and you have to dose the fire in the best way so as not to find yourself in the task of reloading the weapon just when the bears are upon us. The standard enemies are sometimes joined by other bigger and more resistant ones, which fortunately constitute a minority and appear only at certain times: knocking them down is not easy and takes a lot of time. The control system is really simple and assimilates in an instant, but suffers from annoying ~blocks~ that prevent us from managing the viewfinder always fluidly, sometimes forcing us to renew the ~grip~ on the touch screen. As for the technical realization, the above sequences are really nice to see due to the excellent drawing style, even if the animation itself is not very present. The actual graphics appear functional to the action but nothing more: the enemies are always the same and they all move in the same way, they can be torn to pieces with machine gun shots but the effect of the gushing blood is predictable and creates good little ~amazement~ compared to what is the ~tender~ context desired by the developers. The sound effects are mediocre and ~soft~, accompanied by repetitive music at most (even loops lasting a few seconds...). The tested version is 1.1", "date": "2009-10-21", "grade": "5.0"}
