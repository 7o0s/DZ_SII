If football is spreading more all over the world, one might think that dedicated games are more and more and of an ever-increasing quality, in reality this is not the case and indeed the Madden NFL series is currently the only one that represents this sport stars and stripes. From our point of view, but not only that, we can certainly admit that the version of Madden NFL 25, the one celebrating twenty-five years of the EA franchise, and also released last year for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, hasn't been able to hit the mark, yes it is treated exclusively of a slightly improved re-edition of what came out on the previous generation consoles, in a nutshell, a significant disappointment for those who were waiting for it. We therefore expect a lot from Madden NFL 2015, it must be the chapter of the turning point and of the definitive consecration on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (remembering that in any case it is also out for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360). The great American football finally at its best on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Immediately bomb Madden NFL 15's roaring start is one of those things that make you envy Americans and their ability to make everything into a truly spectacular show. In fact, in a few moments you are catapulted onto the playing field in the match between the New Orleans Saints and the Seattle Seahawks in the last moments of the game. Being in attack in short, it is necessary to understand the scheme to use to start earning downs and trying to score points. Even for the less accustomed to the game in question, the coach's suggestions are perfect and only after many games did we realize that a different strategy could be just as valid. Then chosen the pattern from the playbook, ball in hand in a riot of flashes, with the stadium cheering, off to the first launch and under to conquer as much ground as possible. All seasoned with the right mix of simplicity in control, with a few buttons for team management, and the depth guaranteed by the numerous tactics available. Once this initial challenge has been completed, you can start thinking about what the rich dish offered by Electronic Arts offers. Many steps forward Right from the start, compared to what has been seen in the past, the differences are almost sensational, we will talk about the technical sector in detail later but it is simply the gameplay that has been perfected a lot. In this regard, the EA developers have invested many resources in trying to make the defensive phase more fun to play and manage and above all more useful for the purpose for which it was created. Let's take a step back just to remind you that in American football there are two main phases, characterized by a continuous alternation between the two teams and characterized by the fact that within the same team there are two different teams dedicated to attack and defense. The attack phase has always been the most interesting and fun to manage, you choose the schemes from the playbook, you give the ball to the pitcher and off you go with throws and long runs to score points by breaking through the opposing defenses. Defense management, on the other hand, has always been somewhat neglected and moreover has never been made fun to face, resulting at times (depending on the versions of Madden of the past few years) almost useless, given that nothing opposed the runs towards the goal. Instead, we can say without fear of contradiction that now the context has definitely changed and the defense represents a fundamental phase during the match in a more realistic way. What you already begin to appreciate after a few challenges is certainly the fact that in this new incarnation of Madden it is clear at all times which command to use to make the players react, which powerful shot to sink in order to ~sack~ the opposing quarterback. Same thing in the snap counter (the pass of the ball from the player in the center of the attack towards the quarterback) since now through a mini-game with the keys of the joypad it is possible to react almost instantaneously. Therefore, the defensive phase in Madden NFL 15 regains its importance and gives the franchise the right amount of realism. What makes the nose turn up a bit, but which could perhaps be slightly corrected by the developers through an update, is the speed of the defenders, perhaps a little exaggerated and which clashes in a decidedly well-reconstructed context. Clear that at this point it's the whole phase balance thatshould be partially re-discussed by programmers. We were also pleasantly satisfied with the attention to some details such as the possibility now to rotate the camera during defense in order to control one's deployment. If you know the previous episodes you will remember well that the offensive line was sometimes heavily obscured or that it was practically impossible to see your linebacker in certain situations. Attack has always been the best defense The attack is instead the usual ~pleasure~ in the management of the schemes and above all in everything that happens after the snap. In fact, once the quarterback has the ball in hand, following the instructions provided to the team, the launch can be started or a run can be started. The launch can vary according to the pressure given to the button (the reference indicators appear above the heads of the runners) between lob and real missiles that the receivers do not always know how to manage, but which are certainly more difficult to intercept from the of opposing defenses. The management of the playbook is really well done, as we have anticipated it is normal and right to listen to the advice provided by the artificial intelligence since they take into consideration the many statistics of the opposing defenses and the percentages of realization. We personally had a great time listening to the suggestions then it's clear that by increasing the number of games played it becomes almost a duty to try alternative ways to get to the goal. Many players from the old continent have always used Madden to learn more about this sport which is very popular in the United States, it is therefore evident that the developers to bring this simulation to us must also think of users who may not be fully comfortable with the choice of schemes , rules, team management etc... We therefore really appreciated the tips introduced between one loading screen and another, in order to deal with game rules and advice, damn useful for all of us. In these indications, provided exclusively in English, there are real explanations of why it is better to use that scheme rather than another in a given situation. Playstation 4 trophies There are 39 trophies available, divided into 25 bronze, 9 silver, 4 gold and platinum. Never as on this occasion will it take many hours to be able to get them all and above all it will be necessary to invest all the resources on the different methods. In fact, a moment passes from the creation of a player, coach or owner who manages to reach a high level to master the MUT mode to perfection. From perfecting tutorial challenges to winning online races. Challenges not to laugh at, worthy of a champion. Lots of irons in the fire From the point of view of the offer, obviously there is only the embarrassment of choice, the Career is the real heart of the game and now it can be faced without particular distinctions between online and offline both in the role of coach, player and president of the franchise. It is clear that online competitive challenges have always been the most satisfying but to our taste, given the great passion that we personally have for FIFA's Ultimate Team mode, we cannot overlook the corresponding version in Madden NFL 15, of course that for us Italians a less than really chewing on the NFL it's all a lot more complicated to manage. Progressing in the MUT (Madden Ultimate Team) we realized that the real problem, in addition to the canonical lack of an Italian translation which would never have been useful as in this mode, is that the progression of one's team is decidedly slow and this strongly affects on the competitiveness of your team. The other options know how to fill every desire, from the possibility offered by the Gauntlet mode, which offers some challenges that improve skills with lots of duels with real Bosses, to the one we prefer called ~Never Say Never~ which allows you to relive the moments most important in NFL history. We truly consider this a potentially devastating option also because it would allow us to paint a beautiful historical picture of one of the most famous leagues in the stars and stripes sport. We use the conditional because we are confident and believe that the historical challenges will gradually be increasingly supported by the developers, given that for the moment only those that concern the near past are available. We can't forget that Madden NFL 15 was born with the aim of being strongly supported by the community and therefore it is possible to share the most spectacular statuses and photos on social networks or get recommendations on the playbook schemes from users. A really promising start to quello that we believe could be one of the strengths of the brand, especially in the American territory where clearly users easily exchange and more and more will exchange opinions about the game and its use. Technically there is little to say, the work done in Electronic Arts can be clearly seen and the gap with the previous year is everything. Madden NFL 15 is a real feast for the eyes and perfectly restores the Hollywood show style of American league games. The stadiums are perfectly recreated and the context is very adrenaline filled with cheering spectators, the chants of the fans and the movements of the players who challenge each other on the pitch. The athletes are reproduced with care and the polygonal models betray very few uncertainties. The application of the Ignite Engine physics engine guarantees a good dose of realism to the clashes and the movement of the ball, even if sometimes the physics ~goes crazy~ giving quite improbable situations and the bodies of the athletes react in an unreal way. Strangely on occasion we have noticed a ~skating~ effect on the turf by some players which is definitely worth reviewing. Fortunately, these that we have highlighted are still negligible problems and that do not affect the quality of the work done by the programmers.", "date": "2014-10-06", "grade": "8.5"}
