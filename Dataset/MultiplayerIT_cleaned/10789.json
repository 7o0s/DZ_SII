The first step of this revival wave is as phoned as possible: a mobile strategy set to the settings and characters created by J.R.R. Tolkien, modeled on the film version of Peter Jackson and obviously distributed as free-to-play, in order to quickly reach the widest possible audience. As can easily be expected, this is not a strategy belonging to the more classic tradition of the genre, but a representative of the new mobile category, characterized by strategic breaks, prize boxes and other rather questionable elements, but which are now part of this videogame panorama. Once the sub-genre to which it belongs has been clarified, it can also be said that The Lord of the Rings: War is among the most refined and profound titles seen in this particular segment, but to play it you still have to accept various compromises, mainly focused on the dosage of expectations, on the chance that governs the conquest of the commanders and on the inevitable in-app purchases, in addition to the inevitable pay-to-win trend that characterizes PvP that emerges towards the endgame, even if with some interesting findings that limit it the destructive potential. Beyond the introduction of a more narrative nature, a sort of long tutorial with Gandalf who accompanies us in the early stages to understand the many facets of the game, later everything follows on a series of objectives to be completed, slavishly following the numerous indications that fill the complex interface. In addition to the individual quests to be completed, everything is set according to a sort of battle pass, which offers goals to be achieved in sequence within the various seasons. It all starts with the ring Lord of the Rings: War kicks off with an extensive tutorial led by Gandalf, no less There is a considerable variety in terms of the faction to choose, obviously all drawn from the lore of The Lord of the Rings and each characterized by its own bonuses and units. The gameplay has the basic elements of turn-based strategy, with some variations focused on what is the main feature of the game, namely its foundation on time management: as befits a free-to-play, each action takes time, from moving troops around the map to constructing and expanding buildings, as the importance and breadth of the desired achievement increases, there is a longer and longer pause. Some of these can be compressed with the expense of gems that can also be purchased with real money, but the developers must be recognized for their attempt not to abuse this mechanic, given that some expectations cannot be avoided. The usual ~trap~ that lies behind the complex free-to-play mobile strategy mechanism is thus somewhat mitigated, but the impression remains that the Machiavellian fragmentation of the game action and the randomness of some elements push forced way to purchases, unless you have plenty of time and patience. For the rest, the structure is really very deep and complex, at times even a little too cumbersome: there are commanders to enlist, to associate with squadrons of the army, each of which can be evolved and upgraded by applying ever stronger units. Lord of the Rings: Rise to War, an image of the map with the territories to conquer The commanders can also grow and obtain new equipment, as well as obviously it is possible to expand and enrich your fortified city which acts as the nerve center of the strategic action. The main purpose is to conquer territories, expanding one's sphere of influence as much as possible in the surrounding area and beyond: each conquered territory yields a certain amount of resources per minute, therefore the increase in power as the kingdom expands is exponential. The experience accumulated goes to increase the power of the ring, which develops with a real skill tree allowing you to enlist new commanders and expand the city-fortress. A complex mechanism Lord of the Rings: War, a battle scene The huge amount of menus and sub-menus takes quite some time to assimilate, so much so that some facets are quite obscure even after hours of play. Being a strategic one, the complexity and depth of management certainly cannot be considered a svanment, but the impression remains that the whole system is based exclusively on the constant progression given simply by the dedication to the game rather than on the actual skill in the strategic management of resources and units. Combat, on the other hand, is also a purely numerical matter, with the results simply deriving from the initial situation of the units deployed in the field. For this reason, the risk of pay to win is particularly real in a game like this. Without doubts, it must still be said that the production behind The Lord of the Rings: War is certainly of value, as demonstrated by its mammoth structure and also from the technical realization, which is remarkable even in the typical stylization of turn-based strategy games. To enrich everything there is obviously the official characterization of The Lord of the Rings, perfect for a strategic fantasy and well cared for in this case as a construction of the story and placement of characters, peoples, factions and families. On the other hand, the user interface could be improved, which seems poorly calibrated for small screens, with often microscopic icons and text.", "date": "2021-10-01", "grade": "6.9"}
