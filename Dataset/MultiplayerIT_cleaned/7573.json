In the meantime, however, Sony was plotting behind the scenes, nurturing and pampering its exclusive developers in order to give their console an enviable longevity and extremely high quality to this day, with the new generation of consoles just around the corner. In fact, the Sony monolith still has several cartridges to shoot, and Beyond: Two Souls (how much effort do we have to write the Italian translation...) is among the most important, the result of the experience gained by Quantic Dream with Heavy Rain and the testament of a way of making videogames different from the usual, more and more cinematographic. This inclination can be seen right from the cover, where the names of Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe are on display as main actors  which they really are  and obviously looking at all the previous works of the French developer. Between Heavy Rain and Beyond, however, there was The Last of Us, which although belonging to a different videogame genre, raised the bar in terms of narrative exposition, encroaching on a field that Quantic Dream had previously made its own. In any case, experience counts, and Beyond moves on decidedly broader canons than in the past, demonstrating a certain degree of maturation in both a videogame and graphic key, and positioning itself as one of the most engaging and beautiful titles to look at in this console generation. Quantic Dream comes full circle with a great story that we have thoroughly analyzed Playstation 3 trophies Beyond: Two Souls offers 46 trophies, of which 43 are hidden because they are related to the plot or particular actions within it. For obvious reasons, therefore, let's avoid talking about it, except to say that we completed the title for the first time with 42% of the trophies unlocked. The life of Jodie Holmes Ellen Page is Jodie Holmes and Jodie Holmes is Ellen Page, never as in this case has a video game been tailored around an actor in the flesh: it is no coincidence that David Cage immediately thought of the beautiful Canadian actress as the main actor. Jodie is the absolute protagonist with a very large margin, since she was a child she has been linked to an otherworldly entity named Aiden and for this reason she cannot live a normal life, among people interested in studying her ~gift~ and events that will endanger her or they will ask for your help. Each chapter of the game represents a precise phase of his life; Quantic Dream has decided to tell it without a temporal continuity solution, but ~jumping~ from one point to another and perhaps going back in time, obviously with a cinematic cut to give greater variety and gradually discover different character aspects of the main protagonist. Once the game is completed, you have access to all the chapters that you can possibly face in chronological order; we must say, however, that the choice made by the French developer is the most appropriate and allows you to better reconnect certain past behaviors, after analyzing future ones. Quantic Dreams therefore abandoned the investigative story of Heavy Rain by embracing a grander theme: Jodie's evolution and growth will have to do with problems that will involve many people up to humanity itself. The troubled life of the main protagonist will lead her to face completely different phases, both in terms of social status and settings: hunted and pursued, poor and rich, dangerous and in danger, Jodie fights with her feelings and her continuous loneliness . His relationship with his parents and that with Aiden, first loves and training at the CIA, the awareness of his powers; Beyond manages to perfectly delve into the character in its many facets and to generate empathy in the player: once the title was completed, we felt very connected to the protagonist and very torn in choosing her destiny. In good Quantic Dream tradition, in fact, the game presents alternative endings and allows you to tackle each sequence in the most disparate way. It wasn't enough for us to finish the game once, after about 11 hours; we spoke with other journalists to understand how they had dealt with the same situations and we replayed some sequences to understand the underlying variety. Compared to Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls it seemed to us more piloted and linear in terms of general plot: the sequences must all be tackled; the premise is identical and the final outcome will always be one, without prejudice to the alternative endings and what will happen afterwards to the main protagonist. How toWhen it arrives, however, it's a whole different story: Jodie's character is ~forged~ by the player's choices, her fate after the ending equally; within the same sequences it is possible to make several different choices, and it is enough to deal with just one other person to realize this. Trying to reveal as little as possible of the plot, in the scene in which Jodie tries to leave the base to attend a party, it is possible to be discovered in the attempt and therefore suffer a lecture by Nathan Dawkins (aka Willem Dafoe, doctor who took her into custody to study her abilities) or succeed, by taking possession of a person and hiding in the hood or in the back seats of his car. Arriving at the place of the party, it can happen that you risk being raped, avoid this scene altogether, scare the tormentors or have them killed by Aiden. Based on this scene, the memory of the attempted violence will affect or not a dinner between Jodie and one of the other supporting actors, which will end in a more or less pleasant way depending on the case. And again, you can reach the end of the adventure with all the supporting actors alive or not (and there will be different sequences even in the final credits) or even mutilated based on the previous events... we counted at least eight different combinations and at one point we were faced with a choice between two macro sequences, and in the epilogue we had four further choices available. On the other hand, it happened several times to experience extreme situations where Jodie wanted to take her own life because of too much burden to bear: nothing to do, an external event or Aiden himself prevented this from happening. In short, Beyond offers a single great piloted story within which it is possible to autonomously define the character of the main protagonist and her relationships with the outside world, through sequences of alternating quality in how they are linked to the others and how they are scripted, sometimes too rambling, sometimes overly melodramatic. Some are in the middle, really beautiful in their own right - like the desert one - but clearly out of context, denoting plot elements not tied to perfection like in Heavy Rain (apart from the final narrative hole, of course). Extra passing you In the body of the review we told you about multiple endings, some accessible directly by replaying the epilogue and others the result of choices made previously; using Aiden it is also possible to ~hit~ secret points to unlock content within the bonus section in the main menu. Among the many we have seen some really beautiful sketches on the game and on the characters, the making of in different ~episodes~ and even the short ~The Dark Sorcerer~ in its entirety, the one shown during the Sony E3 conference and created completely in real time on PlayStation 4. Under the heading ~Extra Contents~ we saw an episode called ~Advanced Experiments~ which presumably will be an additional (free?) scene related to the tests on Jodie when she was little. Dulcis in fundo, once the game is over (it took us about 11 hours, there is no explicit counter) it is possible to face all the chapters / sequences in the preferred order, to perhaps try to make different choices. Film in hand For Beyond: Two Souls, Quantic Dreams has decided to eliminate some redundancies or superficial features that characterized the gameplay of the previous Heavy Rain, in order to make it more fluid and varied. Jodie's control takes place in its entirety with the left analog, without distinction between head direction and movement; quicktime sequences are less pressing for basic action and simply point the right analog stick to the right position to execute it. We are talking about basic actions such as opening doors, drinking coffee or other, which in Heavy Rain were unnecessarily varied in terms of keystrokes and here have been ~simplified~ with a view to making the gameplay more fluid and realistic. Obviously, in the event of running, climbing or moments of tension, the pressing of the keys of the Dualshock 3 returns. The part that requires more skill is instead linked to the fights: when the protagonist or the enemy launches an attack, the action slows down and you have to move the right analog in the direction of the attack itself or in the opposite one to avoid it; a seasoned player with a good sense of rhythm will complete the game without worries but in these phases a fair amount of choice and timing is certainly required. To meet the less savvy players there is the Easy mode which eliminates the diversification of the keys and also an application for iOS and Android, calledata Beyond Touch, which allows you to control the game directly from smartphones and tablets. We tested it on iPhone and iPad, it syncs immediately with the console, making game control even more immediate, probably also suitable for those who play less video games but want to enjoy the interactive experience designed by Quantic Dream to the fullest. The part dedicated to Aiden is obviously all new: with the triangle key control passes to the entity linked to Jodie, who can move freely even through walls and in a limited space. With L1 it is possible to interact with specific objects or people: they can be hit, killed directly or taken control of them, in such a way as to have the upper hand in more complex situations such as the one when Jodie is hunted by dozens of policemen from special units. Dulcis in fundo, it is possible to play cooperatively by delegating only the use of Aiden to a second player, a good omen for those who want to play in company. Ultimately, the gameplay of Beyond is more fluid and varied than that of Heavy Rain, while remaining in the context of a supporting role with respect to the narrative context. Context that is set in a truly exceptional artistic and technological sector: Beyond is sensationally beautiful to see and has benefited from all the technological progress that Quantic Dream has gained over the last few years. The use of the camera is always calibrated to the centimetre, photographic and non-photographic techniques such as depth of field, lights, scene saturation and atmospheric effects return a truly grandiose impact, supported by settings that present unforgettable glimpses. Just to name a couple, the sequence inside the snowy city offers a softness of the line and a detail that we had a hard time seeing even in The Last of Us; the autumn scene in the park is a moving picture of exceptional quality starting from the colors to the detail in the distance, obviously taking into account that compared to Naughty Dog's masterpiece the complexity of the scenario and the speed of the gameplay are visibly lower. The main characters, then, are incredible: Ellen Page is more beautiful than live; every smallest detail of the skin and clothes is made with great detail, the lip during the dialogues denotes how Quantic Dream has reached a level of motion capture typical of the best animated films. Even the other characters denote a lot of detail, albeit not at the level of the main protagonist, and it often happens to find yourself in situations where the stylistic and technical choices make the scene seem almost indistinguishable from a real one, perhaps from a science fiction film. The soundtrack, produced by Hans Zimmer and performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, is of excellent quality and always accompanies the action in the right way, even if it is perhaps less memorable than that of Heavy Rain. The English dubbing is of cinematic level, the Italian one remains at very high levels and allows you to enjoy the adventure without subtitles on the screen. Perhaps Willem Dafoe could have had a more full-bodied voice, but also the mixing from a technical point of view is better than what was seen, indeed heard, in The Last of Us.", "date": "2013-10-08", "grade": "9.0"}
