They travel a lot of kilometers to reach the Earth and instead of spending their time picking up indigenous women to mate and promote universal globalization, or tasting the local wine, they set about destroying everything and turning humans into hideous and repulsive creatures. no, in this case the Lazio Region has nothing to do with it. Let's try to stay serious because the danger is real, as Giacobbo would say after a night spent at the Oktober Fest. The only force that can oppose the aliens is the XCOM unit, specialized in contrasting space creatures, with the tooth a lot poisoned after the fool made with E.T.. This highly secret military body, funded by nations around the world and trained by watching old video tapes from the Mork & Mindy series, is tasked with stopping alien abductions, shooting down UFOs flying over cities, entering alien ships to discover their technologies , stop the space terrorism actions and attack the key facilities of the enemies. Do you understand why they are all single? A job like that prevents you from having a satisfying love life, unless by a satisfying love life you mean that at any moment some strange being could stick a tentacle in your stomach and play rock, paper and scissors while making a bracelet with your intestines. In battle XCOM: Enemy Unknown begins with a very clear tutorial that illustrates the basic concepts necessary to survive on the battlefield. We will therefore witness the massacre of a team by the aliens, necessary to explain how to attack, how to use the cover system, how to take advantage of secondary skills, how to move and so on (by starting a second game, the tutorial can be skipped entirely). Battles are turn-based, with the XCOMs acting first, then the aliens. Initially it is necessary to go and flush out the green friends (so to speak) or head towards the objectives prescribed by the mission, always however maintaining a certain caution. Advancing in an open field means certain death, especially when the forces in the field are unbalanced. So it is always advisable to move between covers, take advantage of the characteristics of the individual men and perhaps choose to defend rather than attack frantically. The aliens need only a few hits to eliminate a soldier, especially at the beginning, when the armor is weak and items that increase resistance have not yet been researched. Speaking of soldiers, let's try to understand how they are managed and how they evolve. After each successful mission the men get points which move them up the ranks. At the beginning we are talking about private soldiers, but from the second rank onwards each team member specializes in one class among four: Heavy, specializing in explosives and heavy machine guns; Stormtrooper, the quick attack action specialist; Sniper, the sniper rifle is his religion; and finally the Support, specialized in the defense and in the medical field. As each level increases each class gains a new skill, with the player having to choose one of two. At the beginning of the game the team will consist of four men, but by acquiring skills in the barracks of the base of operations, you will come to have groups of five and six soldiers. The enemies are very varied: ranging from the classic big-headed aliens, capable of giving each other psionic support, to the very poisonous Smilzi, to get to real extremely resistant war machines and creatures capable of taking mental control of one of the XCOM , in order to use it against you. Obviously not all enemies will be on the field right away and to meet the strongest, including the very strong ethereal ones, it will be necessary to reach the advanced stages of the game. In some cases, the new enemies are simply armored variants of other creatures, meaning they are tougher and wield more powerful weapons. Each alien creature behaves differently and must be dealt with accordingly. At the end of each mission, a debriefing screen will appear in which there will be a count of the wounded and dead. Of the former, the recovery time to return to the battlefield will be indicated, while the latter will end up directly in the memorial where all the heroes who fought in this dirty war are recorded. These are satisfactions. In case there are too many deaths in the player's ranks and they are short of personnel, new recruits can be hired in the base barracks. Another way to get fresh meat to grind is to carry out some missions that reward with the assignment of specialists of an already high level. The base of operations What would a special team be without its baseoperational, that is, that place to carry out scientific research on aliens, build structures to increase the chances of victory, look for the activities of enemies all over the world and stuff yourself with coffee? Well, XCOM has one too. At the beginning of the game you have to choose the territory where to place it. This is not a neutral choice, because each of the available nations will give different bonuses. In general you have to decide according to your style of play, but it is also possible, in subsequent games, to try different bases simply to vary a bit. Inside, the bases will all have the same initial structures: there is the scientific section, in which to study alien artifacts to develop new technologies; there is the workshop, in which to build objects, structures and carry out projects to improve the already researched equipment; there is the barracks, which we have already talked about in the previous paragraph; there is the tactical room, in which to observe the situation of the nations, i.e. their level of panic, manage the interceptor vehicles that are used to shoot down UFOs, fulfill the requests that are made by the various governments and sell objects in the so-called gray market; finally there is the control room, in which all the projects in progress are listed, with the relative time of realization, and above all, in which the activities of the aliens can be searched by satellites. Interface and funding Don't be frightened by so many options, because in reality the interface is designed in such a way as to allow you to have total control of the situation and to be able to make every decision with just a few clicks of the mouse. It doesn't take much to get used to, even if it will take some time to fully understand and try out all the available functions. Indeed, it is very likely that you will only test some features in subsequent games, given that you have a limited amount of funds available to invest and you have to carefully choose which sectors to favor and which equipment to bet on. Speaking of funds, these can be found in three ways. The first and most important, which deserves a little insight, is the monthly funding received from the council of nations. It is determined by how many countries support the XCOM project and whether or not there is a satellite on their territory. Losing the support of a nation is a tragedy, but it is not a remote possibility. Each has a level of panic about the alien menace, which if it gets too big results in riots erupting and, in extreme cases, exiting the council. The panic of nations grows if a mission fails, if a satellite is destroyed, if certain requests are not granted or if a UFO escapes the interceptors. The most common case of growing panic are kidnapping missions: three will be assigned at a time, on three different nations, but XCOM will only be able to perform one. Countries where no action is taken will see the level of panic rise immediately. This involves having to make precise choices, which often disregard the difficulty of the single mission and the prize that you will receive by concluding it: it is important to keep the largest number of active nations in the council compared to all other feasible considerations. The other forms of financing are much easier to explain. There is a possibility of receiving monetary rewards: for the success of missions (not all); as payment for the demands of some nations (for example, some will want weapons and some for alien artifacts) or by selling superfluous material collected on the battlefield (for example, fragments of alien weapons or enemy corpses) on the gray market. A big comeback If you have read up to here you will surely have understood that XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a complex and articulated game, with many facets to consider. Firaxis seems to have created an excellent compromise between reviving the series, which we have deliberately not mentioned in the course of the review (we have written a special box to illustrate this choice) and looking for fluid gameplay that can interest and satisfy even the most demanding players. young people, perhaps completely ignorant of strategic. The work done on the interface is really great, both in the base and on the battlefield. A few practice missions are enough to start acting with great fluidity, giving orders in a natural way and moving the camera effortlessly (it can be rotated 90 degrees and zoomed to widen or narrow the field of view). Sure, there's always a need to think about which moves to perform, but once you've made your choices, the interface poses no barrier to putting them into practice, resulting functional and explanatory ion every occasion. Each screen provides all the information needed immediately, without the need to scroll through other menus to understand what to do. The beauty is that if using the classic mouse + keyboard combo the convenience is not surprising, even if it is not obvious, instead it makes a big impression to see the same interface work perfectly with the joypad. Of course, there are a few more obstacles, but you never feel that heaviness in the controls that often characterizes the console versions of the strategic games. Praising the interface (we will talk about some defects in the next paragraph) is used to understand how it was possible to create such a fluid action in a turn-based strategy game. The actions performed are underlined by animations, often with the camera placed behind the soldier to make them more engaging, or with the enemies entering the scene with a curtain that highlights their presence. This quest for showmanship would have clashed with a heavier interface, but Firaxis managed to integrate everything perfectly, creating a winning mix. The missions We have largely already talked about the missions, but they deserve further study, because it is thanks to them that XCOM: Enemy Unknown is replayable several times. Most of the maps in which soldiers will act will be randomly generated; the position of the enemies and the arrangement of some elements, usually covers, will change. Only some missions will be fixed, mostly the ones required to continue the plot, but even within these different elements will be arranged randomly, so as to never make two games the same. The enemies you will encounter will largely depend on the level of your team and the progress made in scientific research. Other factors also add variety, such as the possibility of destroying many elements of the scenario, including walls and rocks and there are some variables such as explosive objects or upper floors reachable via stairs, handholds or, later in the game, by flying or using of grappling hooks. Precisely the destructibility of the scenario is the key to another mechanic that in some missions assumes great importance: to obtain the maximum possible loot, above all by boarding the alien spaceships, it is not necessary to destroy key structures such as energy nodes or flight computers, worth bringing home a meager profit. Even the enemies should be killed with normal weapons, and not with explosives, in order to collect the corpses on which to do autopsies or sell them to the nations. The classic series As many of you well know, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an attempt to revive a series of strategic games from the nineties that gave the gaming world at least a couple of masterpieces. During the review we deliberately avoided talking about it, because it would not really make sense to make comparisons with the first two chapters of the series, dating back twenty years ago, which moreover are available and playable on various digital delivery services. In 1994/95 the world of video games was extremely different and in terms of creativity and gameplay it could afford things that no modern developer can afford anymore if they want to stay on the market. So let's read the list of titles that make up the classic series and rejoice at the fact that it has returned to the fore with a quality strategy, given that we risked seeing it transformed into a shooter. X-COM: Enemy Unknown (1994) X-COM: Terror from the Deep (1995) X-COM: Apocalypse (1997) X-COM: Interceptor (1998) X-COM: Email Games (1999) X-COM: Enforcers (2001) All earthly problems If we could stop here, we'd talk about a masterpiece and go to sleep happy (never write reviews late at night, because then you have visions). Unfortunately XCOM: Enemy Unknown has several problems that can annoy, even if they are not tragic, some of which only emerge after many hours of play. The most obvious is that of the statistics of the shots: every time you aim at an enemy clearly visible on the screen, the percentage of the probability that the shot will be successful appears. The trouble is that sometimes these values seem a bit off. How to realize this? Well, after failing with 100% probability in favor we couldn't ignore it, but even very high percentages are often nullified by missed shots. For example, in two cases we missed with a success value of 99%. Other times it is not clear how these percentages are assigned. Moving in a square close to that of an enemy should give very high chances of scoring a hit, but even in these cases the mistakes are too many, with the bullets passing through the bodies of the", "date": "2012-10-08", "grade": "9.0"}
