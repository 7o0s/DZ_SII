{"name": "F355", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f355.html", "text": "Actually have a racing one!!! Just a note: was it really necessary to add the music in a title like this? For the rest, we are in the presence of the best driving simulator in our possession which puts the player in the situation of learning almost every point of each track by heart before pushing himself to actually compete: finish third, with all the aids activated with the exception of the Intelligent Braking System (IBS) is truly a feat with adversaries so tough they appear human. Forget the artificial intelligence (stupidity?) of the previous titles, the opponents do not disappear on the horizon once they pass, just take a curve sideways or decelerate a little too much and you find yourself with a position less in a heartbeat. Even in this case, however, it is not possible to avoid criticism: moving on the curb of the curves, the adversaries try to overtake us even on the grass without breaking down even for a while, while for us, as it should be, the least that can happen to us is a drastic drop in speed. Another note: ten centimeters from the wall they almost manage to overcome us, not caring highly about the impenetrability of the bodies. Another sore point: as in many other similar titles, the cars don't even scratch themselves. A real shame, this would have resulted in a unique level of realism and would have made the SEGA title practically perfect. Otherwise, the F355 is every car enthusiast's dream. Have one in cala 1/18!!! But be careful, the passionate adjective was not chosen at random, we are talking about true passion, casual players will be tempted to destroy the pad after an hour of play given the high level of simulation of the title in question. It is useless to try to play without assists (excluding the aforementioned IBS) for the first few days; in fact, this makes it possible to understand which aids are activated (a curve taken a little too fast and the StabilityControl will flash) and then switch to totally manual driving. This is the culmination of the SeGa title, because F355 is not a game, it is ~driving~, from life. In conclusion, in my view, the conversion carried out was undoubtedly excellent, the only thing that, in fact, is missing is a PC-like steering wheel that allows you to ~feel~ the car, which allows you to understand when you are reached the limit. In this regard, the Madcatz steering wheel in my opinion is the worst choice, ~plasticky~ and ~soft~ beyond belief, I would suggest trying the Guillemot Ferrari steering wheel (just to stay on the subject). trial Have a Ferrari!! Aside from the three screens and the excellent steering wheel, the game is almost identical to the arcade counterpart, including (at least initially) the few tracks available. The novelty (apart from the inevitable set-up of the case) is represented by the possibility of obtaining different visibility conditions (and not, unfortunately, different weather conditions) by activating the ~magic weather~ option which allows you to admire sunsets tinged with red and skies full of rain, but nothing more. Another novelty is the possibility of competing on all circuits in the championship mode which, while not actually bringing anything new, adds a bit of depth to a title which in the arcade mode allowed you to play races unrelated to each other ; but it is the visual component that, first of all, catches the eye of the player as soon as the game is started. The graphics, in fact, are undoubtedly the best ever appeared on any home system, even the excellent Gp3 by Crammond does not appear capable of holding up to the comparison of the SeGa title embellished with well-made textures and very solid polygons that outline the buildings adjacent to the track and rival cars without ever losing the slightest polygon even in the most chaotic situations. The frame-rate is also at very high levels: sixty frames per second without even a flaw, at the start as well as when exiting the corners and also in situations involving rear-end collisions, all perfectly fluid. The depth of the visual field then appears excellent and very rare are the cases in which the objects appear suddenly; from memory a tree in the long straight of the Monza circuit and the railings at Suzuka before the long curve that leads into the final chicane. The design of the tracks is also very accurate with skilful use of textures and colours, which are truly realistic, with the exception of the bonus tracks where the colors used, too violent, denote an evident detachment in the care taken in the realization. The sound is also good, absolutely in line with the realization of the title.", "date": "2000-10-11", "grade": null}
