As in Outrun 2, the powerslide, or skid or countersteer, if you prefer, plays the dominant role and it is relatively easy to gain good confidence with the driving system in order to reach the checkpoints that allow us to progress in the game. Once the controls have been mastered, we just have to face the real challenge of Outrun, the race against the stopwatch, the continuous improvement of personal times as taught by the best arcade tradition. once the controls are mastered we just have to face the real challenge of Outrun, the race against the stopwatch, the continuous improvement of personal times as taught by the best arcade tradition Time, implacable enemy From this point of view, the tracks and racing cars of Outrun SP, the arcade counterpart of Outrun 2, become a decidedly relevant addition also considering the differences in the design of the tracks and the different performance of the vehicles. This amalgam offers us the almost unlimited possibility to improve times and above all to travel the tracks at crazy speeds without having to bend to the boring laws of physics. Obviously it is thanks to the multiplayer that Coast 2 Coast finds its ideal location and if Xbox live is the most suitable ground for climbing the charts and competing with players from all over the world, PS2 and PSP also have a multiplayer mode capable of giving actual sense to return to the classic arcade style. Unity is strength Outrun 2006 Coast 2 Coast is to all intents and purposes the union, made with care and coherence, of Outrun 2 and Outrun SP with the addition of some brand new Ferraris and with some variations on the theme. Outrun 2 cards become Outrun Miles and the unlockable content is enriched with a line of modified and souped-up Ferraris. There is no lack of a series of automotive challenges that force us to face traffic or measure our precision in driving and the Heart Attack Mode finds new life thanks to the vast number of maps and related stunts to be performed at full speed to amaze the attractive and unconscious girl who sits beside us. The number of challenges is so high that it almost constitutes a separate game even if in the design of the game the greatest calibration remains dedicated to the pure and hard race, from coast to coast, with a stopwatch as judge and opponent. In its own way this new Outrun is a complete experience, even without modding or other elements that are the most popular lately, even if the differences compared to Outrun 2 are more quantitative than qualitative and some more substantial additions would certainly not have out of tune . A look up to par Graphically, especially on Xbox thanks to the hardware filters, Coast 2 Coast is an end-of-generation title and makes excellent use of the hardware it has available. The number of polygons and effects probably can't match that of Burnout 2, but it is certainly enough to immerse us in the sunny world of Outrun made of breathtaking coasts and heavenly seafronts. The models of the cars do not regret the arcade counterpart, especially in the case of the unlockable rigged vehicles which are extremely well-finished. Unfortunately in certain excited situations the framerate suffers visible drops but which do not seem able to affect the gaming experience. the sound sector is faithful to the atmosphere of Outrun, nothing bad or harsh but songs suitable for a run under the sun A look up to par The sound sector is faithful to the atmosphere of Outrun, nothing bad or harsh but songs suitable for a run under the sun and the choice to respect the atmosphere rather than follow the fashions of the moment, however risky, is an element that I particularly appreciated. The surrounding sounds, the ambient noises, the voices and the roar of the engines bring us down on a Ferrari that whizzes along the sunniest coast in the whole world and if you are or have been a lover of Outrun you cannot ask for more. Comment Although the salient innovations are minimal compared to the predecessor or the arcade version, the amalgam of the two predecessors, whose potential is multiplied thanks to the multiplayer, gives us a title capable of delighting fans of the genre, of recalling the glories of Outrun and to bring the concept of the challenge against time to its historical maximum, at least in a playful environment. Coast 2 Coast represents the ancestral call of the arcade, rich for a classic title, poor for odie standardsrni but certainly capable of delighting an enthusiast. Pros: Outrun at its best technically lives up to its name Cons: Limited compared to other fan-focused titles, it's a merger of two previously released titles The title is available for PS2, XBox and PSP. Graphically it does not present significant differences on home consoles beyond a greater video cleanliness on XBox. The PSP conversion is valuable and takes full advantage of the 3D potential of the Sony laptop. For several years now, with the change in the gaming market and the increase in production costs, niche titles have had to adapt to the mass market and the need to satisfy the largest number of potential buyers. In the racing genre, the boundaries between arcade and simulation have thus become increasingly thinned up to Gran Turismo, a true symbol of the modern hybrid, rich in outline and capable, thanks to an infinite series of tricks and touches of class, to give the feeling of realistic driving while escaping the toughest rules of pure simulation. Outrun, in its recent incarnations, does not try to follow this trend nor to follow the extreme line of Burnout but goes back to its origins and pushes on the purely playful aspect by betting on the validity of the first arcade model: a legendary extremely manageable racing car, a chronometer and a checkpoint.", "date": "2006-04-03", "grade": null}
