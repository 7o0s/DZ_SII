{"name": "Fenimore Fillmore's Revenge - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fenimore-fillmores-revenge-recensione.html", "text": "A dying man found on the desert sand. Sweet Rhiannon was immediately worried about her fate, so much so that she sent her partner, Fenimore Fillmore, in search of the nearest pool where to find water with which to wash the man's wound. Now in desperate conditions, in his delirium he reveals the existence of a treasure buried in a huge cemetery to the girl and the name of the grave under which to search. Fenimore returns when he has just died and three ugly thugs appear from the desert who, without apparent explanation, kidnap Rhiannon and leave the young man almost dead. If history reminds you of something, you are not mistaken: apart from a few details, the plot of the third adventure of Fenimore, a long-lived cowboy who has periodically reappeared on our monitors for ten years, faithfully follows that of Sergio Leone's masterpiece ~The Good The Ugly and The Bad Guy (purists will be pleased to know that the name of the man found by Fenimore and Rhiannon is Bill Carson, just like the southerner who gave the same information to Wallace and Eastwood in the film). We said that Fenimore is not new to the world of point and click graphic adventures: after his first adventure (The three skulls of the Toltecs, 1998) he returned to the limelight in 2004 with The Westerner and now with Revenge, where, completely uninterested in gold, he will have to join the hunt to save his Rhiannon from the ~bad guy~ of the moment (who happens to have a marked resemblance to the actor Lee Van Cleef). When you shoot, shoot, don't talk! Revenge is presented from the outset as a classic ~point and click~ style adventure: it is divided into various ~stages~ that it will be necessary to explore in order to be able to find certain objects which will then have to be used in the various elements of the scenario in order to be able to unlock the situation and proceed with the plot, in an atmosphere which, as is the tradition of the series, will repeatedly lead to the absurd or the tragicomic. For example, it will happen that Fenimore has to pass a shooting test, but, finding himself with the sun in his eyes, he will first be forced to repair a pair of glasses and then blacken them with soot, so as to also shoot against the light. These simple logical connections are then joined by wider-ranging puzzles, without the solution of which it is physically impossible to find objects with which to solve the following ones (the glasses in the example were found by solving a previous problem). At the end of a stage, the inventory is reset and it is necessary to work with what will be found in the next moment, and so on until the end. However, a criticism must be made on the system of puzzles: if some of them are actually the most logical one could think of, others suffer from the limitation of having only one way to solve them, sometimes making it very difficult to understand what to do. We also add that the cut-scenes to underline a failure are often long-winded and boring in the long run (however funny the first time), and given the impossibility of skipping them, they could in the long run bore the player, convincing him to switch off rather than try for the 'umpteenth time, worth putting up with the scolding again from the character of the moment. However, it wouldn't be the old west without the shootings and in fact, between one stage and another, it could happen that you find yourself forced to use strong ways: Revenge manages to present these action sequences without departing from its soul: a click of the mouse over a point on the map will make Fenimore run towards that place, a second click will make him take cover, while the right button will be used to shoot enemies. A pleasant diversion from the main role of the adventure that can only make happy all those who fail to appreciate a western without abundant consumption of lead. Blond, do you know whose son you are? You are the son of a great... Speaking instead of the graphic aspect of Fenimore Fillmore, we cannot fail to appreciate the beautiful landscapes, almost cinematic or postcard backgrounds, in which the protagonists move: huts, canyons, abandoned mines, saloons, everything is rendered with an almost maniacal perfection , covered with clean and pleasant textures and modeled on really fine cartoon-style drawings. The characters, on the other hand, created on deliberately caricatural three-dimensional models (as per the tradition of the series), are less perfect than the scenario, not so much due to deficiencies in the textures or details as for a certain woodiness and repetitiveness in the animations. Moving on to the sound, the developers of Revenge have seen fit to be inspired by the great themes of the master Morricone by reporting more or less direct quotations in each song that will accompany the characters during their adventures. The resultato is very appreciable, as are the voices of the protagonists, although in some cases they suffer from a somewhat flat acting.

The far west is presented in a witty and ironic way, its characters are accentuated beyond belief and the final result is more than satisfactory. The only flaws of this beautiful graphic adventure is the repetitiveness of some answers and various puzzles that defy the laws of the most elementary logic, but in any case it is a title that fans of adventures and westerns shouldn't miss out on for any reason.
