{"name": "Recensione Project Zero 2: Crimson Butterfly", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-project-zero-2-crimson-butterfly.html", "text": "Horror in one photo In reality, the points of contact between the first and second Project Zero are really reduced to the bone: except, of course, for the same genre of belonging, the only real aspect in common is to be found in the main tool available to the protagonist , or an old and dilapidated camera called Camera Oscura. No shotguns, rocket launchers, machine guns, uzis, desert eagles and so on: from this point of view, the approach adopted by the Tecmo programmers is undoubtedly original, as well as representing a fundamental contribution in giving the title the atmosphere of which it has. The plot revolves around the twins Mio and Mayu and their discovery, during a walk in the woods, of a village of which no trace had actually been found, many years earlier, after a mysterious nocturnal ceremony in which all the inhabitants had taken part. Obviously this is only the incipit to the events that from then on will overwhelm the poor sisters, trapped within the confines of the agglomeration of disturbing houses crossed by dark avenues and, above all, populated by terrible ghosts. It appears evident from the first moments of the game that the Japanese designers have preferred to focus their attention on the plot, graphics and sound, resting on the contrary on the foundations of an extremely classic gameplay devoid of particular creative cues. In fact, exactly as in the most consolidated tradition of the genre, Project Zero 2 offers the player exploratory phases of houses and exteriors, very limited interaction with the seabed, fights and simple puzzles mixed with care, but unlikely to surprise the user, even if only partial connoisseur of the genre to which the game belongs. In reality, the use of the aforementioned camera, in fact the only weapon available, turns out to be an element - the only one - capable of distinguishing the mechanics of Tecmo production from the mass of its peers. In fact, bringing the instrument to the face, the view passes in first person, complete with a different control system, similar to an fps. Although on paper all this may seem like a stretch, in reality the idea works very well, allowing a stimulating and appreciable approach to the combat phases. In fact, taking a photo of a ghost affects its vital bar, in a variable quantity and relating to various factors: distance from the subject, use of films with less or greater exorcising power, adoption of power-ups or special shots, as well as combos . The use of the first person view is essential not only to eliminate enemies, but also to observe the settings in complete freedom, solve some puzzles and perhaps find hidden or elusive ghosts. For mature audiences only But where Project Zero 2 really excels is in the story, atmosphere and immersion it is able to offer. Going to recall filmography, tradition and literature, the narrative of the Tecmo title slowly unfolds perfectly, engulfing the player in an atmosphere of sincere and real anguish from which it is really difficult to escape. The oppressive feeling of going through a cursed village has been perfectly recreated, as well as the relationship between the two twins which emerges as very different and more complex than it appears at the beginning. But an excellent screenplay would risk going unnoticed if not supported by a technical system worthy of its level. Fortunately, the effort of Japanese programmers represents one of the most successful expressions of the survival horror genre, strong in graphics and sound of the highest impact. As for the aesthetic component, the only real note that can be raised is to be found in the not entirely convincing animations of the protagonists, at times woody and rather unrelated to each other. Except for this detail, however, the rest of the Tecmo production proves to be a real pleasure for the eyes, from practically every point of view. The settings, especially as regards the interiors of the houses, are in fact extremely detailed, very rich in details, splendidly recreated and, above all, extremely effective in offering a possible sense of oppression, if not real claustrophobia. The modeling of the characters, as well as the ghosts, is absolutely outstanding; the same goes for most of the textures and lighting, while the CG cutscenes are among the best ever we've had the pleasure of seeing. Particular applause, and those who really know the genre know how important it is, must certainly be given to the management of the shots: with the exception of a handful of confusing occasions, the vast majority of vOften the virtual camera is perfectly placed, managing to enhance the drama of some passages with breaks or glimpses simply from applause. The sound component is also at very high levels, both in terms of dubbing and effects; in particular, some background sounds manage to be already sufficient to make the player's muscles contract, perpetually under emotional tension. Longevity, already more than valid in itself as regards the main adventure, is further increased by a whole series of extras that can really justify a second ~step~. If we add to this a conspicuous ~Mission~ mode, characterized by short sessions with objectives to be completed in the shortest possible time, the result is undoubtedly one of the best games of this European 2005 overall, especially on Xbox where the Resident jewel is missing evil. Comment Project Zero 2 is a title that has no revolutionary intent, unlike the masterpiece Resident Evil 4 on Cube. The Tecmo title also aims to adopt a classic mechanics, only partially renewed by an original combat system, focusing everything on a very first level technical aspect and a plot of indisputable value. The result is one of the best ~classic~ survival horrors ever, capable of conveying a sense of anguish and terror in the player as only a few other titles have been able to do. A purchase therefore a must for every lover of the genre, all the more so given the tired phase that this popular trend is going through. For Xbox owners, the purchase is even more recommended, given the total lack of the saga made in Capcom. From Ps2 to Xbox Project Zero 2: Crimson Butterfly arrives in Italy distributed by Microsoft. The Xbox version is substantially identical to the one already released on PS2, except for a greater graphic cleaning which, however, does not change the judgment on the already very good cosmetic aspect. You can now choose to always play in first person, without having to switch to third-person camera when not fighting and a survival mode has been added. Basically you have to survive in an arena in which you are attacked by an endless succession of ghosts. A good bonus, but it doesn't add anything substantial to the already excellent game. In great vogue just a few years ago, it is undeniable that survival horrors have experienced a period of crisis in recent months, or simply a creative decline, which has led to the rapid and semi-total disappearance of the genre from store shelves around the world . On the other hand it is indisputable that playing one of the last children or stepchildren of Resident Evil  but it would be better to say Alone in the Dark- represented an extremely less engaging and stimulating experience, victim as it was of a recycling of ideas and situations that it deprived him of one of the fundamental elements: the surprise effect. Just like in front of a horror film, playing a title of this vein, sensing more or less clearly every twist or twist of the plot, reduces everything to an event destined to last in the user's memory for a very short time. It is no coincidence that the main architect of the boom in the genre, Shinji Mikami, has decided to give a practically revolutionary boost to his most famous series -Resident Evil-, creating a fourth chapter very far from the previous episodes. Evidently not yet determined to recite the funeral epitaph of ~old-fashioned~ survival horror, Tecmo has decided to make the sequel to the appreciated Project Zero, a title released a couple of years ago and capable of obtaining good critical acclaim at the time and public.", "date": "2005-02-03", "grade": null}
