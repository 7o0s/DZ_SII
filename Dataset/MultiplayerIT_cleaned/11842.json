{"name": "Ratatouille - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ratatouille-recensione.html", "text": "After the success of ~The Incredibles~, Pixar immediately set to work on a new feature film animated in computer graphics, this time focusing on topics very different from the world of superheroes, decidedly more ~down to earth~. To be precise, ten centimeters above the ground. It's more or less from that height that the little mouse Remy sees the world, dreaming of becoming a famous chef. The film will show us that even the most insurmountable problems can be overcome, especially if there is someone to lend us a hand. Keep that right hand free, though, because you'll need it to wield the Nintendo DS stylus in this cute tie-in. Ratache? Upon launch, Ratatouille allows us to access the main game mode (story) but also the kitchen minigame. If we choose the first option, we will find ourselves controlling Remy in a series of stages that refer to the locations of the film, mainly with the aim of exploring them to collect all the objects. Sometimes we will have specific objectives, for example to collect a certain number of vegetables, and often we will have to be careful not to be seen by humans. In the upper part of the screen, in fact, we will find a bar that gradually fills up depending on how long we remain exposed: when it exceeds the alert level, it means that a person has noticed us and we must hurry and hide (under a piece of furniture, or in a box, or still under a cup) for the bar to reset to zero. The action takes place on the upper screen of the DS, while the touch screen is used to view the objects collected and possibly the face of the person watching us, but also to move the character using the peculiar stylus control. In this sense, Ratatouille gives us a certain freedom of choice, offering us a conventional control system (d-pad to move Remy and the four main buttons to jump, interact with the environment, use smell to locate targets) or original , moving the stylus on the screen to move the mouse and using only the d-pad to perform the various actions. Ratachi? The ~story~ mode follows the plot of ~Ratatouille~ and occasionally occurs in text sequences accompanied by images from the film, but at a certain point it also sees us try our hand at actual cooking. It is useless to get around it, the ~practice~ sections are the strong point of the game, and the developers probably realized this, so as to make the cooking minigames accessible right from the home screen. From there it is possible to select a level of difficulty and then choose a recipe to complete, then proceed with the preparation of the ingredients (some things must be cut, some sliced, others still chopped) and finally you get to the stove. There are three lit hobs to tend to, each with a pot or pan on it, while the left side of the screen shows the ingredients to add and a temperature gauge appears to the right. The minigame works in this way: as soon as the container reaches a certain temperature (green area of the indicator), on the left some of the ingredients become accessible and you can put them in cooking (dragging them with the stylus in the pot or pan), which it lowers the temperature. For the indicator to reach the green area more quickly (since we will still have a time limit to complete everything), we can mix the dish with the stylus. Every time one of the containers reaches the right temperature to add other ingredients, our attention is drawn to a bell. If we don't have time to act and the indicator reaches red, we can blow into the microphone of the DS to lower the temperature... otherwise, we'll have to throw the dish away and start over. Once all the ingredients have been added, as soon as the indicator touches the green area we can withdraw the dish. When everything is ready, all we have to do is put the food on the plates, decorate it and add the spices. Technical realization The DS version of Ratatouille boasts very well done graphics, which relates to the film only for the images that appear in the dialogues, with the aim of moving the plot forward. All the rest is the work of the Helixe team, which has chosen to characterize the characters with ~classic~ cartoon-style graphics in the loading screens and in the cooking mini-game, moving on to models more adherent to those created by Pixar for the real game. own. Remy moves within completely three-dimensional scenarios, managed by an efficient engine, which does its job without striking results but maintaining a constant frame rate. And the sound accompanies the action really well, with a series of catchy music characterized by atypical instruments for videogames, above all the classical guitar. There isn't much to say about the control system: the ~original~ version, based on the touch screen, turns out to be a bit cumbersome and immediately gives way to a classic solution, which behaves quite well. After all, you still end up using the touch screen in the cooking minigame, and in that context things work perfectly. Comment Ratatouille for Nintendo DS is definitely a product intended for a young target. Otherwise, such a repetitive and banal ~story~ mode, which focuses only on the collection of objects within locations which, moreover, tend to repeat themselves, cannot be explained. But when it comes time to cook, the game transforms completely, becoming fun, engaging and really well thought out. Needless to say: after trying the minigames, you will hardly try your hand at the main mode; and if you do, it will only be to reach the second half of the story, where you will begin to cook. We are faced with a bittersweet dish (to stay on topic), and the numerical vote can only represent a cross between its best and its worst. Pros Exceptional minigames Well done graphics Catchy sound Cons Boring and repetitive ~story~ mode Could have been an excellent ~cooking game~... ...if the license hadn't weighed in", "date": "2007-11-12", "grade": null}
