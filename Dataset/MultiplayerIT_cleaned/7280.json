At the time of its publication, in March 2005, the Capcom title surprised by the adoption of very courageous design choices, which cut ties with the previous chapters of the series and opened the doors to many new possibilities. First, the developers put aside the fixed shots a la Alone in the Dark, which has always been a characterizing element of the franchise, in favor of a third-person view, albeit adjusted in such a way as to prevent the player from having a distinct view of what what was happening around him. This factor, together with a control system that largely maintained the woodiness of the past, translated into a state of constant tension with respect to the pitfalls present in the scenario: an enemy could be hiding behind every corner; or maybe he was right there behind us, ready to attack us with an ax or a knife. There have been multiple re-releases of the game over the years, including an HD version released in 2011 on PlayStation Network and Xbox LIVE. The new edition of Resident Evil 4 available on Steam is based precisely on that experience, which from the point of view of content natively includes the Separate Ways expansion (unlockable once the story is completed), as well as boasting a resampling work for the graphics aimed at making the adventure visually current. There is no doubt that this new edition of Resident Evil 4 stands as the best ever made The foreigner does not pass After a not bad first experience as a policeman (he found himself in the middle of the zombie apocalypse of Raccoon City), Leon Kennedy returns to the protagonist in Resident Evil 4 as a special government agent, engaged in a very delicate mission: to find and save Ashley Graham, the young daughter of the President of the United States, kidnapped by a mysterious sect and taken to a remote Spanish village. Upon reaching the place, Leon immediately realizes that something is wrong: the inhabitants attack him on sight and seem to act according to a collective conscience. It is therefore not a question of zombies, another important novelty compared to the previous episodes of the series, but this does not make things easier, on the contrary. In fact, the peasants do not hesitate to hit it with axes and rakes, while some of them even dabble with dynamite. The survival component is evident in the possibility of escaping when the enemies are numerous, for example by holed up in a building and barring its doors, and then targeting everyone from above or looking for an alternative way to reach another area. The interaction with the scenario is limited but present, there are crates and barrels that must be destroyed to collect ammunition or traditional healing plants, while the combat system roughly reflects the mechanics of the first Resident Evil. Having met a bizarre merchant, we will be able to upgrade our equipment, sell any valuables collected along the way and buy new weapons, managing an inventory that is also of a classic nature, with boxes to fill and a limited range. Considering the main campaign and the extra missions, the offer of this new edition is fairly rich and amounts to about thirty hours of gameplay: a boon for those dying to immerse themselves again in the atmospheres of Capcom survival horror. Final edition? Beyond the numbers and extras, the element that characterizes this latest version of Resident Evil 4 is the graphic resampling work carried out by the developers. In fact, the game runs at a resolution of 1080p (or higher), in real 16:9, and allows you to select a frame rate locked at 30 or 60 frames per second, as well as to act on a series of additional parameters regarding graphics : antialiasing up to 8X (but the type is not specified), motion blur activation or not (which at 30 frames per second has a rather strange effect, to be honest), shadow quality, post-processing filter ( with which to ~color~ the game in a different way, by applying a filter) and finally the use of the original textures or those in HD. The problem with many ~remastering~ is that the polygon count necessarily remains the original one, but above all the definition of the textures ends up clashing with the increase in resolution. We can say that in the case of Resident Evil 4 a well-balanced job was done, given that the new resolution performs well net of some obvious ~edges~ for some models. The issue of textures, on the other hand, moves between ups and downs: there are surfaces that have quite clearly enjoyed ato replace the textures, but are contrasted with others that make a fine show of gigantic pixels. In short, it seems that the operation has been done in half, leaving out many elements of the scenarios that stand out in a particular way precisely because of the new resolution. That said, there is no doubt that the 60 frames per second, which can also be obtained on medium-range configurations and subject only to sporadic uncertainties, improve the enjoyment of the experience, which can be enjoyed both with an Xbox 360 controller and with a mouse and keyboard, in which case it is possible to aim more precisely (without significantly affecting the balance) and score a large number of headshots.", "date": "2014-03-03", "grade": "8.0"}
