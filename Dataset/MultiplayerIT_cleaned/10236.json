The Gyakuten Saiban series in Japan has a much longer history than seen in the West, having started on the Game Boy Advance, on whose platform it first arrived in 2001 and then with two other iterations then ported to the Nintendo DS. Ace Attorney is in fact a remake of the first episode released on Nintendo's single screen laptop, just as this chapter for WiiWare is the practically unchanged transposition of the game of the same name released on Nintendo DS, with no new introduction beyond the simple adaptation of the controls to the Wii Remote, switching on the other hand rather natural. Let's make things clear right away: if you expect a transposition made with a certain accuracy, equipped with at least a full-screen graphic reworking and improved definition, the impact could be chilling. Phoenix Wright on WiiWare is in fact taken verbatim from the Nintendo DS version, with the original screenshots inserted in a larger frame and definition smeared to fill an adequate portion of the screen, complete with huge pixels. It goes without saying that we would have gladly expected a minimum of more careful elaboration by Capcom, especially since the 2D graphics and the abundant amount of text could greatly facilitate the work, instead we are simply faced with the Nintendo DS version magnified. For the rest, the game is still the same, and consequently also its excellent quality, one only wonders if there is a real advantage in downloading it from WiiWare rather than buying it (perhaps on offer or used) on Nintendo DS, beyond the economic gain (1000 Nintendo Points for the download, but with the need to pay out an additional 100 points to access the last episode, with a choice that is also rather questionable on the part of Capcom). Law and Order Having made the necessary premises on the essence of the game and its origin, let's examine its structure. Phoenix Wright can be ascribed to the genre of point and click graphic adventures, but the dynamics that distinguish it are very different from what we might expect. It is all about playing the role of a defense attorney who is tasked with protecting his clients and uncovering the truth about the various cases brought before the court. The action is divided into two rather different sections: one takes place on the various ~crime scenes~ within which the game behaves more traditionally in the adventure style, with scenarios to examine, objects to collect and witnesses to interrogate in search of data and evidence to be stored in the inventory, also using specific tools for investigations. Once the materials have been collected, we move on to the courtroom trial, during which we have to interrogate and cross-examine the witnesses in search of uncertainties and inconsistencies in the various versions of the facts, highlighting them through the presentation of irrefutable evidence. The action in court is obviously emphatic and very unrealistic, as befits a video game that explores the unprecedented forensic field, also making the substantial amount of text (all translated into good Italian, by the way) present pleasant. Historical are the ~Objection!~ (~objection~, in the Italian version) and the ~Take that!~ (~here you are!~) shouted by the young and rampant lawyer at the moment of truth, reported in this version with the usual croaking voice coming from the Remote Control itself. The adaptation from the Nintendo DS version also with regard to the interface is as natural as possible: navigation through the menus takes place via the directional cross while a pointer replaces the pressure on the screen in the investigative phases. A characteristic, but rather awkward introduction is the possibility of shaking the Remote Control in the act of showing a proof, which can also be conveniently performed by simply pressing a key. A smeared lawyer The technical aspect of the adaptation is the weak point of this Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney on WiiWare, as we said earlier. It 's true that 1000 Wii Points are not many, but the work done by Capcom is really at the limits of decency this time. Perhaps a complete graphic reworking could not be expected, but a slightly more complex adaptation to the new resolution, which was not limited to the simple application of a filter to soften the outlines of the figures was still legitimate. The insertion of thefifth chapter (the only one originally conceived for Nintendo DS) as a paid downloadable extra, even if it does not require a large further outlay, tends to reinforce the idea of a rather brazen commercial operation by the Osaka publisher. Obviously, the excellent purely Japanese cartoon characterization that has pervaded the game since its first version dating back to 2001 remains, a charisma that has nothing to do with the definition or complexity of the graphics and which therefore manages to maintain the charm intact also in this version. The adaptation of the interface does not present particular changes compared to the original version and the remote control performs excellently even in this situation. Even the audio sector is drawn heavily from the Nintendo DS version, which is not a very positive element, given that the original music and sound effects, although characteristic, did not already shine with excellent quality. On the other hand, a really well-made adaptation in Italian is highlighted, which is moreover desirable given the large amount of written text present in the game. Ultimately, graphics and sound do not justify the purchase of the WiiWare version if you can access the Nintendo DS cartridge, if not for the reduced price that characterizes the downloadable version.", "date": "2010-01-22", "grade": "8.3"}
