{"name": "The King of Figthters Arena", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-king-of-figthters-arena-recensione.html", "text": "The King of Fighters series, born way back in 1994, had the extraordinary merit of unifying the universe in which the various SNK franchises coexisted, from Fatal Fury to Ikari Warriors, from Psycho Soldier to Art of Fighting, giving life to a team crossover fighting game of the highest quality and depth. The brand is still alive and well, despite everything, and this is demonstrated by the recent launch on PC and console of the excellent The King of Fighters XV. Well, how is the situation in the mobile sector? After the revival of the classic chapters adapted to touch commands, SNK has entered into a collaboration agreement with NetMarble which led to the birth of the controversial action RPG The King of Fighters All Star. Three years later, the developers have taken that simplified system, with buttons for special moves instead of stick and key combinations, to package a competitive online fighting game that is already enjoying great success on iOS and Android: let's find out what it comes in the review of The King of Fighters Arena. Structure: online challenges and nothing else The King of Fighters Arena, the character selection screen The King of Fighters Arena is a purely competitive fighting game, as the name suggests. This means that it has no single player modes of any kind, unless training is considered, and rather focuses on online challenges. The latter are present with a one-on-one match in the best of two rounds, therefore devoid of the elimination mechanics typical of the series, and with a three-on-three which instead sees every single element of the team fight. Mysteriously, the latter mode is only available at certain times. The good thing is that the large roster of characters is immediately available, while gacha aspects and summons are used only on the front of any upgrades (which lead to inevitable dynamics pay-to-win, it is clear) but in the context of a complicated mechanism, limited to those who want to put their hands on their wallets and also linked to the use of virtual NFT controllers: that is the indication that stands out on the start screen, deluding us that the game supports Bluetooth controllers when it doesn't. The matchmaking turns out to be very fast and we have not noticed the presence of bots, a sign that the user base is already quite solid and therefore guarantees the possibility of always challenging human opponents. Unfortunately, on the netcode and connection stability front, however, there are several reservations. During our tests, in fact, we encountered so many problematic situations, with excessive latency which translates into blocking or a noticeable slowdown of the action, up to intolerable levels. even when the connection has ~all notches~ and the European server promises response times of a few milliseconds. Gameplay: Simplified but not trivial The King of Fighters Arena, Ryo Sakazaki performs his flurry of punches on friend Robert Garcia Exactly as we wrote in the review of The King of Fighters All Star, the first impact with the controls of The King of Fighters Arena is inevitably traumatic for those accustomed to the crescents and charge mechanics of the original episodes of the SNK series. On the left we find, in fact, the classic virtual analog stick but without the possibility of jumping, as in gestural fighting games like the Marvel Challenge of Champions, while on the right there is a forest of buttons arranged in three rows. In the lower part we find in order the barrier, the dodge and the standard attack, which pressed repeatedly gives rise to an automatic combo. At the center there are instead three special moves, different for each character, which however cannot be performed indefinitely having to submit to cooldown times, as well as the aforementioned barrier. Finally, further above are the keys for the enhanced, super and ultimate modes, which can only be performed when the relative bar is full. The King of Fighters Arena, Athena Asamiya kicks Iori Yagami At first the experience seems like a trivial button masher in which you press keys randomly in the hope of opening your opponent's guard and dealing enough damage to win the match, then you understand how the correct timing and a pinch of strategy are essential to bring home the result. Of course, strong perplexities remain due to the excessive use of juggling, which gives rise to frustrating situations in which one ends up under the blows of the enemy without being able to escape even in mid-air, but even there by exploiting the ~barrier~ and dodging is Is it possible to somehow recover the position and go on the counterattack. In short, The King of Fighters Arena does not offer certainsurely a gameplay that lives up to its name and its story, that's beyond doubt, yet behind the simplicity of its combos and reloading special moves hides a minimum of thickness: the perspective offered is different from the one in which the fighting game enthusiasts are used to it, but not absolutely to be thrown away. Technical realization: beautiful but already seen The King of Fighters Arena, Ryo and Robert face off in front of a particularly suggestive scenario From a graphic point of view, The King of Fighters Arena is a great sight and takes up the polygonal interpretation of the characters introduced for some years now, thanks to a convincing design and a large amount of different animations for the characters which, we repeat, they are many: thirty-seven. Unfortunately the scenarios are not as numerous, but even those offer a great show of colors and details. Of course, it is also true that the vast majority of assets have been recycled from the aforementioned The King of Fighters All Star, to the point that Arena seems basically a rip-off. A speech that extends to the soundtrack, which at least can count on a selection of interesting and decidedly well-performed songs, with some great electric guitars playing a leading role.", "date": "2022-11-20", "grade": "6.8"}
