Let's find out in the Escape Academy review . Quality cooperatives Escape Academy: this is the main map where we will be able to access the different game levels, here some still hidden in the clouds This analysis, however, can only begin with a warning: even if it can be completed alone, this adventure is clearly designed to be tackled by two players and it wouldn't have been bad even in three, we add. But we are satisfied and we are not disappointed: the interaction between the two players is maximum and it is a continuous exchange of objects, opinions and possibly solutions. In this Escape Academy is reminiscent of Sea of Thieves, both built around very physical gameplay, levers to pull and buttons to press and friends to collaborate with. Cooperation remains tight because, as in Josef Fares' games, both players will see what the other sees through a screen split in half vertically. Thus we always remain involved, even when we will inevitably be in the throes of discouragement because we are still far from the solution. Escape Academy begins with two friends who visit an escape room in their city and here they prove to be so good as to attract the attention of the Academy of Escape, a sort of Hoghwarts, but specialized in escapology. Between the towers, the classrooms and the school courtyards they will have to deal with different characters, professors and students who are the protagonists of fast and basically of little importance, and well-conceived dialogues. Pleasant and valuable side dish that gladly leaves room for what is the true heart of the experience: the different escape rooms that will make up our school career in the academy. The two are also given a room in the dormitory in the school, initially a little sparse but which will become more pleasant and colorful as the puzzles proposed by the game are solved. Understand, solve and run! Escape Academy: each escape room is different from the previous one, but not all of them will be of the same quality level To get to the end of Escape Academy ten seals of the school are needed, which we will naturally get our hands on once one of the respective levels present is solved. In reality there are more escape rooms, but the others are introductory or connecting, which can be solved in a few minutes, clearly secondary. On the contrary, the main escape rooms are very long and complex, they usually introduce new game elements and will require much more speed as well as more effort. You didn't think you'd enter an escape room to stay there for days, did you? There is a time limit beyond which we will have failed the mission, the excellent news is that we will always be granted the possibility of reloading the last checkpoint. Escape Academy doesn't aim to make you restart a level, the puzzles are always the same and it would be boring, but it expects players to understand and solve its puzzles. Puzzle-breaking deductions Escape Academy: the graphic style used to create the characters of the academy is remarkable You can make mistakes endlessly, but if you really can't find a way to go on, the game includes a hint system that pushes you towards a solution without flashing it in front of your eyes, risking making us feel inadequate. The puzzles are extremely varied, mostly stimulating and well thought out, but some escape rooms are decidedly less interesting and precise than others: in a couple of levels, for example, it will be easier to get to the solution of the puzzles by deduction, instead of following the mechanism step by step set up by the designers... and that shouldn't just happen. But in most cases, playing Escape Academy, the difficulty is well calibrated and fun is guaranteed, at least if you accept the challenge in the company of a friend. Graphically Escape Academy is not bad at all: it is colorful, it is detailed to the right point and its puzzles are all clearly visible and easily interpretable. However, the Coin Crew Games game returns slow and awkward movements, which will make navigating the levels less pleasant than it should be. Marginal technical problems for what remains a small but intelligent independent title, and this should not be forgotten. The music and sound effects perform their task without infamy or praise, far from being the predominant features of the game.", "date": "2022-07-19", "grade": "7.6"}
