The cost is the usual one, not exactly cheap, so let's see if those who are interested in buying (presumably regardless) will benefit from spending the approximately fifteen euros required to take home four maps and the new zombie adventure. Nothing new, no bonus weapons as for the previous DLC, the package is the basic one, even if there are some features to enliven the usual downloadable routine. A different package from the usual, where the contents have as a common denominator being rather over the top, but not in the most positive sense of the term. Revolt all over the world Mob of the Dead is, as usual, the highest point of the offer since here Treyarch was able to indulge as expected, going beyond the strict setting of multiplayer maps. The players play the role of four gangsters locked up in Alcatraz, Finn O'Leavy, Arthur Arlington, Salvatore De Luca and Billy Handsome, with the features of famous actors who have often played the roles of criminals and mafiosi in their careers, that is, and going in order, Michael Madsen (Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs), Joe Pantoliano (Ralph Cifaretto in The Sopranos), Chazz Palminteri (Sonny LoSpecchio in The Bronx) and Ray Liotta (Henry Hill in Goodfellas), struggling with their ~great escape~ from the rock of San Francisco. Needless to say, the usual hordes of zombies will get in his way. The gameplay obviously remains the same, the complex is really very large and given the many dark areas there is the risk of getting lost or running into unpleasant encounters, and it hurts to say that sometimes you risk not quite understanding where to go or what to do , between objects and weapons to build, as usual without any hints on the screen. Anyone who remembers the first moments at the bus station in the map on the disc is well aware of the inevitable trial and error of some situations. However, there is no shortage of news. More than weapons and red-eyed zombies, the most interesting thing is the possibility of interacting, when dead, with machinery to be activated or with the zombies themselves, in this case by killing them. A nice idea, which gives rise to some spot on game mechanics, this is perhaps the best thing about Mob of the Dead. In terms of oddities, even competitive maps are no joke. Let's start with the ~negative~ notes. Half the pack, i.e. Studio and Vertigo make us look back. If Studio is an ~updating~ declared in an ironic key of the much loved Firing Range of Black Ops, Vertigo is roughly similar to Overwatch of Modern Warfare 3. In fact, therefore, the novelty rate of Uprising is almost halved. The two maps are still enjoyable. The relatively small Studio takes us to the cinema, not in theaters, but in open-air studios, among cardboard, and therefore not bulletproof, reproductions of sets for medieval films, science fiction, westerns and much more, the all seamless. The construction of the environments is the same, so we (re) find two parallel open spaces and the castle tower, from which you can enjoy a good viewpoint on the map. Well done artistically speaking, the mix of cinematic genres is certainly pleasant and unsettling for the first few games, but loses its freshness in the long run, the price to pay due for a map to be understood as pure fan service. Vertigo takes us to India, to Mumbai, to the top floor of a skyscraper, home to a luxurious apartment. Rather linear and not too developed vertically, Vertigo is undoubtedly an average map, which does not stand out for its ~craziness~ or for a particularly intricate and complex construction, with well-defined areas, between a large external part and an internal one with narrower, between apartments, offices and windows to be knocked down, ideal for ambushes, and more generally for frenetic Deathmatch matches. The two most original maps are therefore Encore and Magma. With the first we return to Europe, to London to be precise, to start shooting inside a concert arena along the Thames. Not very big, it is possibly the best map of the package, full of access points, defilations and ~hot~ areas from which to enjoy a good sniping point. Not a map for campers, however, since the stage and the control room face each other, but thanks to the parterre and the actual backstage, snipers can be easily taken from behind. Without forgetting that, even if there is no possibility of entering the stands, the under stage and some areas behind the seats allow further variation of the action. A well-designed map, non-trivial and perfect for a team that wants toto coordinate to achieve success. Magma, is the interactive map of Uprising. We are in Japan, a typical village has been destroyed by lava which actually blocks some areas, and forces us, in addition to carefully avoiding it and quickly changing direction, running mad, between narrow alleys and half-destroyed shops. Full of ruined buildings, and occasional hints of verticality offered by a few second floors, Magma didn't particularly convince us, starting with the idea of the lava. The only interesting starting point is given by a particularly hot area for those who have to control it, in which the defenders are surrounded from all sides and especially from above, since they are inside a huge crater caused by the earthquake / eruption . Uprising is not as successful as the other map packs. The main problem lies in the fact that it is only half ~unreleased~, given the tribute from the Studio and the obvious references from Vertigo. Mob of the Dead is undoubtedly interesting, but somewhat confusing, despite the addition of the ~spooky~ mechanics. In short, a DLC only for the most avid fans, in which the spectacular is not so functional to the typical gameplay of Call of Duty: Black Ops II.", "date": "2013-04-18", "grade": null}
