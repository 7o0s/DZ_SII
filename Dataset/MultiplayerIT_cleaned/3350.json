Is personal identity linked to a living being, to a physical place or to an event? What does ~redeem~ mean? Our review of Lost Ember on PlayStation 4 makes no claim to answer these questions, even if a precise answer exists or ever did. Lost Ember instead try at least to address the topics mentioned. It does so with the beauty of an experience that is both videogame and poetic: a symbiosis between gameplay and feelings that we haven't seen in a long (too) long time. Lost Ember is not a perfect game, indeed it has very obvious flaws; but it's fun, it's inspired, and it'll leave you with something for a long time. Having said all this, the review in question will explain whether it is what you were looking for, or not. The plot We will not anticipate the plot of Lost Ember, because it represents at least two thirds of the heart of the main adventure. It is sufficient that you know the narrative premises of the Mooneye Studios production, so as to immediately understand whether or not it can fit your strings. In Lost Ember you play a wolf: but it's not just any wolf, it's a soul reincarnated after death. The doctrine of metempsychosis, you know? After death, the soul returns to live in other bodies and other beings. In the world of Lost Ember, this happens when a human being, during his life, has not behaved righteously: he is therefore punished at the moment of death, and cannot enter the City of Light (the City of Light). At least not immediately, not before having somehow atoned for his sins. The wolf of Lost Ember is therefore one of the ~lost embers~, of the souls left behind, forced to continue living on Earth. But a completely fortuitous encounter saves him: instead he is a second soul ready for the definitive ~step~, to enter the City of Light. To do this, however, she needs someone with a good heart to show her the way. Here then is that the paths of being lost (the wolf) and of being already in itself safe (the wandering soul) meet: both will help each other along their path; the first, perhaps, will find a way to remedy the mistakes made when he was alive (but it is not said). The second will finally be able to find peace, learning along the way something more about the order of creation. You don't need to explain the symbolism behind the animal beings, worldview and narrative of Lost Ember, do you? It is a very rich cultural heritage, far from being invented out of whole cloth by the developers: once the game is over, we advise you to delve into it. The gameplay In Lost Ember is played, thank goodness. ~Well thanks, it's a video game~ you might object. And we could answer you with a real list of video games in which, beautiful narrative premises and inspired and poetic ideas aside, then they don't ask the player to do absolutely anything, except move from one point to another. But the title of Mooneye Studios was not designed in this way, fortunately. We started from a very specific idea at the level of gameplay, to then build everything else around it. The idea of this gameplay is: take possession of the various living beings present in the natural world of Lost Ember, and use them to continue and explore the surrounding environment. At the beginning you will have only the wolf at your disposal: the wolf runs, the wolf is fast, he covers large distances in no time. But a wolf cannot fly from one rocky ledge to another if there is an abyss in between: a bird is needed. Or a wolf can't dig a tunnel underground to get around a boulder. And he can't even swim. The animal's soul can then transmigrate, taking possession (for a time) of the physical bodies of other creatures. It is a sensation as immediate as it is pleasant: an astonishing sense of discovery, a brilliant idea. This gameplay mechanic, combined with the unassailable sound sector and a glance that is always, constantly spot on and evocative, is enough to assign 8 to Lost Ember. More is not possible, due to the brevity of the narrative and some technical problems, however due to the indie nature of the production (this is the first game by Mooneye Studios, by the way). Let's go back to the game mechanics. In Lost Ember you will basically have to continue the narrative, discovering why you are ~left behind~, without the possibility of entering the City of Light. Continuing along the path in the various chapters of the main adventure (which ends in a few hours, unfortunately), you will relive the memories of a world that has been gone for years, and you will solve small, minimal environmental puzzles by exploiting the skills of the various controllable animals from time to time from your soul. From scenario to scenariowe continue by observing all that can be observed, enjoying all the enjoyable details, experimenting with what can be experienced. And by collecting collectibles: relics, mushrooms and other completely accessory objects, often even very well hidden. Playstation 4 trophies Lost Ember can be completed in a few hours, but searching for all the well-hidden collectibles along the way will also take up additional time. In any case, getting the Platinum Trophy won't be difficult at all, especially if you have a good guide; for the rest it will be enough to complete the main narrative. Small flaws Lost Ember, we said, is not perfect: it has small defects that are immediately evident. For example, beyond the poetic and generally satisfactory graphic rendering, one notices all the technical limits of the production, which is sometimes very crude. However, it is not a neglected title, but rather ~edgy~: partly due to the style of artistic production, but also partly due to the resources of what is in effect a rookie team. In Lost Ember it is possible to forgive almost everything, but for fairness and objectivity it is necessary to take note of the technical limits of the production. These seemed evident to us especially on one occasion: when we took control of a mole to explore an underground conduit. At this point, only the conduit is visible on the screen: the entire surrounding world has disappeared. We were seeing what the developers were probably seeing at any given moment. This defect is quite serious, in addition to the fact that it almost completely breaks the identification. Other small defects of Lost Ember are its excessive linearity and duration: steps for the second, which could also represent a precise choice aimed at the intensity of the experience, for the first it is difficult not to turn up one's nose. There are practically red bonfires on the screen, indicating where to go, and the difficulty level is absent to the point that a player could simply move from here to there, several times in a row, and end the game missing everything else. Obviously, it is a personal choice that no one should make: but in any case a minimum of ideas in terms of environmental puzzles, or a slightly more reasoned continuation would not have hurt.", "date": "2019-11-28", "grade": "8.0"}
