{"name": "Saint Seiya Awakening", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/saint-seiya-awakening-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Saint Seiya Awakening: the new mobile game dedicated to the Knights of the Zodiac traces the events of the series created by Masami Kurumada up to the saga of Hades, bringing to the screen all the characters seen in the manga and creating engaging strategic battles in which the various Saints can resort to their most characteristic moves: Pegasus' Lightning, Rising Dragon's Strike, Diamond Dust and so on. Not only that: the most mistreated Bronze Knights are also given prominence, which you can include in your party to increase the variety of situations and discover never-before-seen maneuvers. In short, we will have Jabu of the Unicorn who attacks several targets simultaneously, Nachi of the Wolf who increases the power of a companion of your choice during the turn, Castalia (Marin of the Eagle in the original) who acts as a support unit with healing powers, and many others. The formula of the game is exactly the same seen very recently in Fist of the North Star Legends ReVive, as well as the philosophy behind both projects, which include a codex in which all the characters are described in detail as they are unlocked and interlude sequences which in the case of Saint Seiya cannot count on the quality of the SEGA kinematics (there are few scenes taken from the last anime), but once again they recall the tables of the original comic on several occasions. Gameplay and structure The main screen of Saint Seiya Awakening is very crowded, as often happens with oriental productions, and you need to do a little practice before understanding what the various items are for. The traditional summoning mechanisms are present to obtain new Knights and extra characters that we can insert into the party or ~sacrifice~ for the rebirth techniques of our main fighters, which increase the stars of the relative card by exceeding the pre-established ~rarity~ boundaries and allowing us to focus on the protagonists we like most instead of indulging in the classification of the game. The same system is used to improve the individual moves available to each Knight, while two different currencies regulate the expenditure for upgrades. Do you have to spend real money to be able to play without problems? Actually no: although the microtransactions represent an integral part of the experience, with numerous references to more or less rich paid packages, it is possible to proceed in the story without particular problems as long as you have a little patience and fall back on side quests and /or special missions in order to grow the team and reach the necessary level to face certain opponents. In the same vein, the energy of the action is very abundant and allows you to play for hours without having to wait for it to reset: from this point of view, the approach chosen by the developers appears rather permissive, even if the grinding necessarily becomes d obligation after a few hours. The structure is particularly rich, as you may have guessed: not only is it possible to retrace the events of the series in great detail, but also to relive memories of the past or to face the demons (literally) of each Knight in order to obtain experience points useful for progression. There are sections in which we move within the scenarios, albeit in a simplistic way, and then interact with the enemies we are going to face, but it is precisely the fights that constitute the fulcrum of the gameplay. As mentioned, the formula adopted is exactly the same as we saw recently in Fist of the North Star Legends ReVive, even if some important tricks fortunately manage to liven it up, making it more varied. In fact, a few games are enough to bring the team to include five elements, from chapter four the degree of difficulty becomes interesting (before that point the challenges are resolved in a rather trivial way) but above all there is an abundant repertoire of moves that diversifies the attacks and enhances the strategic element, enriching itself as upgrades are made. Therefore, if the game of Ken the Warrior takes a lot of time to reach this type of setting, that of the Knights of the Zodiac does it practically immediately, to the full advantage of the fun and the desire to return to face new battles. The technical realization is also in this case closely linked to the anime: as mentioned, there are no quality kinematics seen in the SEGA tie-in and the interlude sequences must be satisfied with the in-game graphics, which however appear very well done and can be adjusted in the level of detail and in the fluidity of the frame rate to adapt to non-ultim terminalsper generation. The special moves have been represented very well, in a rather spectacular way, but it is the soundtrack that makes the difference: the music is the original one from the cartoon and accompanies the action in a great way, significantly increasing the involvement, especially for the longtime fan of Saint Seiya. Too bad for the instability of the servers, which at the moment suffer from too many uncertainties and affect the experience in competitive games due to excessive latency.", "date": "2019-09-20", "grade": "7.8"}
