Here you are immediately asked to make a fundamental choice: agile or armored? It's important, because it will determine our approach to the whole game. After a shocking CG cutscene we find ourselves in some kind of rocket dump, not knowing what the hell happened in the meantime and why some drones attack us without too many pleasantries. Sparks, sparks everywhere! The important thing is that we can walk and, above all, fight. We kill them with a makeshift weapon and immediately notice a detail that will soon become a certainty: they are not cannon fodder. They are not very difficult, of course, but they are not even so much to make up the numbers. To pass them we must immediately learn to dodge their lasers and strike at the right time. Since The Surge is a soulslike, the comparison with From Software's titles is immediate but, despite the similarities (pace of the game, mobility of the protagonist, medical-bonfire areas to spend the scrap-souls obtained by fighting and more we will talk about), the first what catches the eye is a macroscopic difference: here even common enemies beat like damned and, if you're not careful, they can kill us without too many compliments. The factory where we are is gone crazy and all the workers with robotic limbs want to kill us. We meet the first one out of the medical area, still not active due to a malfunction. The tutorial, or writing on the walls, explains how to aim at the limbs, inviting us to hit the unarmored ones to do more damage. We strike the victim on the head, but we are not fast enough and we suffer his counterattack, which takes away a third of our energy. We shoot him down by alternating attacks and dodges (having chosen a fast character we can count less on parries), then we confiscate the wreckage he leaves on the ground thinking that he made us work harder than we expected. Deck13 has joined From Software with The Surge? Find out in our review! Common enemies, bosses and customization Now, The Surge also has bosses, some of which are really bad. Following the classic formula of the genre, we find some of them in the middle of the levels, placed to protect particular passages or precious loot. They are typically too strong to deal with when first encountered. For example, just to overcome the first boss, a half-broken mech, it took us a multitude of attempts and we had to learn to 'dance' with him death after death. In the advanced stages of the game the protagonist becomes a battleship The aiming system In short, fear not, because there is no shortage of clashes against the immense metal beasts that make the literal seven shirts sweat. Having said that, however, we confirm that the focus of the game is another: Deck13 has tried to make all the fights interesting, succeeding perfectly. Not only that, it also made them particularly spectacular. Imagine advancing down a dimly lit corridor and you are faced with a heavily armored enemy holding a giant hammer and starting to charge at you. He tries to hit you, but you dodge to the side and respond with a first blow to the head and a second blow to the arm in a combo. After a first stagger, the beast reacts and starts to swing the hammer in a menacing way taking you by surprise with a blow from the bottom up that makes you fly in the air, then crushes you as you fall to the ground, reducing you to the end. life. Passionate? Similar situations often occur in The Surge, situations that are all the more engaging the heavier the impacts are, which, as we will see, are the real 'story' of the game. But such brutal beauty would be nothing if it weren't accompanied by a rich system of personalization of the protagonist. Basically we can spend the scrap metal we mentioned above to build the equipment we own the blueprints for, upgrade what we already own and increase our nuclear energy, which is essential for getting stronger. Not only some characteristics of the character are linked to nuclear energy, but also the amount of grafts that he can carry around. The latter are essentially reducible to special powers, from which to learn to take advantage. For example, there are grafts that help us in exploration, others that enhance weapons, still others that increase health and so on. Are we done here with customization? Not really, because as you progress through the game, you'll unlock new abilities, such as that ofcontrol a drone, which will have to be managed separately, creating a remarkable set of development possibilities. Obviously all the objects are found by exploring every nook and cranny of the levels and massacring the inhabitants. World, you decay me Unfortunately The Surge also has its own set of problems. The most obvious concerns part of the narrative side. The Creo factory is fascinating and disturbing at the same time, but as soon as you come into contact with the first fragments of its recent history, the one that led to the situation you experience in the game, it begins to lose some of its narrative potential. The reason is that the script is very weak, starting with how it characterizes the protagonist. You die a lot Let's recap: we see him at the beginning of the game in a wheelchair who has already chosen his destiny, then we find him with a series of cybernetic implants in a factory where everything that moves wants to kill him (and often succeeds too), yet he never seems to be too involved in the story in which he is entangled, recalling the worst stereotypes of US action cinema; the one full of muscle-bound marines with quick witticisms and silly sidekicks to back them up. Even the starting point, which is its deepest side, namely his giving himself to Creo to be able to walk again, is soon lost along the way, vanishing in the maze of a plot full of clichs. Unfortunately, things get worse when you come into contact with the other characters, overall very uninteresting. Let us give you an example: in the second area you meet a girl who, in front of our arrival, doesn't bat an eyelid and starts flirting first and then trading. Now, mate, we met in a factory full of crazed cars and dead bodies and you don't care who you're dealing with? One question how we got there do you want to make it? Would you like to give us some help on where to go? Nah, nothing at all. But this is just one example of many possible. Throughout the game the characters you meet, with some exceptions, only serve to give us some additional missions, with rewards attached. In The Surge, even ordinary enemies present a challenge Thus a strange paradox is created: The Surge is more interesting when it seems to say nothing: that is, when you explore without knowing where you are going and suddenly you see one of the disturbing enemies, ready to kill us mercilessly. The real narration is not in the words, but in the heavy and physical impacts between the metal limbs, which make the clashes, even the most frequent ones, spectacular, filling the screen with sparks. It is in those moments that one wonders about the fate of those people and, in a certain sense, one participates in their drama; certainly not when talking to one of the boorish employees of the factory. Fortunately, you spend much more time alone exploring and fighting than chatting with the other survivors, which makes the narrative much more digestible. For the rest, Deck13's title has no other major problems. It happens that sometimes artificial intelligence proves a little too naive, falling into some precipice for no reason, suddenly losing interest in us or getting stuck by mysterious forces; fortunately these are rare eventualities, which do not compromise the gaming experience and do not make the enemies less lethal. And technically? How is it technically? Let's say right away that The Surge isn't the most beautiful game on the market, graphically speaking, but it still does its dirty work, offering detailed three-dimensional models, convincing environments and visually well-characterized creatures. The special effects are also remarkable, especially those of the fights, which do not make us regret much richer productions. Graphically it doesn't scream a miracle, but it's not bad at all Of course, it must be said that the levels are not very large and that some settings taste like they have already been seen, but overall one cannot really complain about the work done by the developers. In particular, it should be emphasized how The Surge becomes increasingly spectacular as the adventure progresses, with increasingly larger enemies and increasingly bad equipment. Without revealing too much, let's say that towards the end of the game the protagonist becomes a kind of walking battleship, with weapons that make an impression just to look at them. The work done on the soundtrack is also convincing. At the beginning, the absence of music in most of the environments is a bit strange, but it soon becomes clear that it is a precise choice to give more importance to the ambient sounds and the noises of the fights, in order to create a particular atmosphere : imagine the silence broken only by the sound of vsound, then the screeching of steel and finally the sound of a dead body burning... It works really well, there's not much more to say. Speaking of longevity The Surge lasts more or less hours depending on how familiar you are with the genre. It took us about thirty hours to finish it, but calculate that we are not particularly skilled. It must also be said that we already knew the first part, which we had been able to try in the preview version, and whose time was reset to zero in the review. Let's say that a lot depends on your skill and how much you want to explore all aspects of the game. For the rest of additional modes there are not many: only the classic New Game + which is unlocked after the ending.", "date": "2017-05-16", "grade": "8.5"}
