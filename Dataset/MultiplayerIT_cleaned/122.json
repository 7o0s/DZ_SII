{"name": "The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-spyro-a-new-beginning_b.html", "text": "Portable dragon Following a plot that to call sketchy is an understatement, The Legend of Spyro is a rather classic two-dimensional platformer that winds through various levels with an elemental setting (fire, ice, wind, etc.). As in the best tradition of the genre, our hero begins the adventure without particular potential, only to acquire various techniques as the game progresses. In this case, our Spyro will be able to increase his energy levels and magical charge as well as the variety and power of his breath. An aspect, the latter, intelligently exploited by the level design, which offers fairly complex stages, full of portals that can be opened using a peculiar type of breath as a key, and which lead to various types of bonuses. Obviously there are also enemies (in fact very little dangerous), to be eliminated strictly with warheads or using fireballs and the like. Portable dragon As a link between one level and another, The Legend of Spyro offers some flying sections in which the user must have good game in avoiding obstacles and collecting the green diamonds essential to replenish the magic gauge and thus allow the little dragon to continue its wing beat. Some bosses also make an appearance, not particularly inspired or challenging but which effectively mark the transition from one setting to another. In short, The Legend of Spyro seems to fit every element into the right place, and so it actually is: the problem is that the Vivendi product lacks a lot of personality, offering an adventure that can be played but without giving great emotions, and indeed causing more a few yawns here and there. On the other hand, every single aspect of the title has already been seen a thousand times in as many similar titles, so a pinch of boredom is more than justifiable. Beyond this, The Legend of Spyro is not surprising even in terms of the technical aspect: regardless of the device used, the graphics of the game are conventional and little more, with sprites of moderate size and acceptable animations, but with substantially bare settings and guilty of a completely questionable color palette. Finally, the sound is fugitive, which manifests itself in sparse music and absolutely anonymous effects. Game tested on Nokia 6630. Comment The Legend of Spyro is an honest platformer, which does its job without excelling in any particular area. Technically within the norm and equipped with a rather conventional play structure, the Vivendi product probably has the only flaw of being devoid of great personality: it can therefore be played with ease, but the mobile gaming panorama is full of titles that are certainly more attractive . Pros Decent platforming action Good level design Cons Quite boring and conventional Technically not great Short and undemanding adventure Made his debut on PlayStation by the talented Insomniac team, Spyro experienced excellent initial success, which gradually diminished with the transition to the next generation of consoles and above all with a change of developer which led to the creation of some decidedly subdued products. The Legend of Spyro is the title that should in theory mark the rebirth of the franchise, starting from the territory of mobile gaming...", "date": "2007-01-29", "grade": null}
