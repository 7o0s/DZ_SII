{"name": "Carmageddon TDR 2000", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/carmageddon-tdr-2000.html", "text": "Panic system requirements! Taking the package in hand, let's examine the minimum requirements (only the key parameters): P2 266 / AMD K6-2 300, 32 mb of ram, D3d accelerated video card with at least 8 mb of ram, 210 mb of hd; the recommended requirements for maximum enjoyment settle on a P3/ Athlon 500, 64 mb of ram, 32 mb accelerated video card. On my (usual) P3 500, 256 mb of ram and Matrox G400 max (with the 400 mb installation to avoid annoying swaps) I saw a maximum fluidity of 25 fps and an average of 20 fps at 640x480 in 32bit color with the maximum detail; at 800x600, with the same color depth, to obtain this fluidity, I had to reduce parameters such as the distance from the horizon and the number and quality of light and shadow sources to medium or minimum values; even by inserting 16-bit color and textures the situation does not differ much from the concept of poor optimization The cars present are well made, all quite different from each other (you can also see the drivers inside them, among other things really well defined) and some of the racing cars in the race such as the mobile wheel are a pleasant diversion from the usual hackneyed models but one cannot fail to notice the 3-4 barely textured polygons that make up the victims, whose poor realization is in part compensated by the discrete variety of movements available to them (they run away, walk calmly, get up if you have only touched them, limp and so on), made possible by a minimum of artificial intelligence. Coming to the seabed, although the engine is new and it is easily noticed, they are certainly not to tear your hair out and their variety is a bit discontinuous, a handful of similar levels, you change area and consequently the seabed changes for a few another race and so on, also to make sense of a plot that sees you in the guise of the psychopathic Max Damage at the dawn of a new millennium certainly not the most utopian (Hokuto no ken and, above all in this case, Mad Max teach!) . After a nuclear missile attack on the areas where the dregs of our blue planet lived (including you), the Earth was divided between superb looking technological cities inhabited by all the wealthy of the Earth and the area outside of these huge walls where all the outcasts live, poor people, psychopaths, mutants, until the usual ~very cool~ on duty, or Max, decides to penetrate the Subate to escape these bombings and because the script wants it! The word script is not accidental since this game was partly inspired by a film called The Death Race, even if in the end the agreements about it failed. The sound side is less desolating, thanks to the good quality of most of the music composed by the 2 aforementioned musical groups and by the musicians of the SCI. The sound effects are more than discreet, made even more convincing by the 3D audio with the usual Eax(2) and A3D protocols; the sound side is completed by the Italian dubbing, at times aberrant (I'm referring to the first part of the intro, fortunately the rest of the FMV is a completely different thing without that narrator!) and at times well done (like when pedestrians send you to that country ^_^). Playability and Longevity The first 5 minutes of pure adrenaline, born from the madness of the environment that surrounds you, from devastating the opponent by any means, chasing the innocents and taking them down (which personally doesn't excite me much anyway, but seeing many of my friends...) quickly turn into the desire to press Esc and change games: just enough time, therefore, for certain factors to come to the surface. Playability is not helped by the numerous power ups (extra time, oil to pour on your pursuers, etc) and extra weapons (missiles, lightning bolts, fireballs), nor by the presence of money (which is used to make the usual purchases such as car upgrades, new racing cars or to pay for, as I called it, ~divine help~ that gets you back on track in the event of an accident). The formula behind the ~races-missions~ pairing (the former are won by killing as many people as possible while the latter are slightly more bizarre versions of the races, where knowledge of the game map is important to destroy certain objects located in inaccessible places, arriving in certain areas on time and so on) certainly does not make this new episode of Carmageddon the title to play after a month of purchase. So there's only one mode left... ...multiplayer! The ability to play Carmageddon via Lan or Internet adds qA few hours of play also thanks to the 7 game modes and the 9 maps specially developed for multiplayer. You will be able to play the classic deathmatch until you remain the last alive, compete to cross the finish line first, participate in a sort of racing water bottle (one of the players has a time bomb mounted on his car, to be downloaded to the nearest player until the timer, having reached zero, will make the victim on duty explode and so on), a mode in which you will not have to let the enemy hit you for as long as you will be the only target (after the time available, if no one has hit you you will have won, if you are touched, your enemy becomes the prey) and finally a sort of automotive candle (in which a player must hit all the others who move from one area to another compulsorily, causing their destruction, declaring the winner the last to be touched). Conclusions All the anticipation for this title was, unfortunately, too much. A graphics department that requires a NASA computer (and there are no upcoming patches), some catchy songs, a sufficient variety of vehicles and weapons do not improve the fortunes of a game that is saved from rejection for the good multiplayer mode. In case you are a superfan of the series who will still buy the same Carmageddon 2000 I can reassure you that the zombies of the English version and the green blood are not present in the Italian version. Panic returns to the streets! When I was still a proud Playstation owner, I happened to hear several times in multiformat English magazines (which I bought in large quantities at the time) about an arcade driving game in which points were scored by running over defenseless pedestrians; soon Carmageddon was in the mouth of all gamers, especially those who, like me, could not have it on their console. When the undersigned finally got his PC, one of the first titles I bought, even if mostly out of curiosity, was Carmageddon 2, described as a polished Carmageddon with excellent graphics (animated by the same engine as the prequel, to be honest ) but little or no more; after 5 minutes of fun and laughter, the sad reality peeked out, decreeing that digital violence, decent graphics and some rock music are not enough to make a great video game and at that moment I realized how the more than good sales of this SCI series were due to the simple fact that people enjoyed ~ironing~ other people. However, the premises were not bad: new graphics engine written from scratch, music written, including those of the software house, by the Utah Saints (mythical!) and Plague (??), 50 cars to drive, almost 50 tracks (including missions to carry out and races to win) and a multiplayer mode worthy of the name. Even if I think you've already guessed what I think of this title let's go as usual to examine this new episode of Carmageddon point by point.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
