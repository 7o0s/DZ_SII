{"name": "Marvels Spider-Man: La Rapina", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/marvels-spider-man-la-rapina-recensione-dlc-ps4.html", "text": "Almost two months have now passed since the Marvel's Spider-Man review, a more than reasonable time to allow all owners of the first hour of the game to enjoy it properly. As the name of the series of DLCs provided by Insomniac Games reminds us, New York is however the city that never sleeps, and for someone like Spider-Man there can be so many things to do even after having sorted out all the Sinister Six lineup . The first additional content of the three total of Marvel's Spider-Man is entitled The Robbery, and puts us in pursuit of a familiar face also within the main adventure: in fact, it's up to Felicia Hardy, better known as Black Cat, to keep busy our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man after teasing him with a series of tracks scattered throughout Manhattan. We therefore more than willingly dressed up in our superhero costume once again, to go together with Peter Parker to find out what the sensual kitten has prepared for us. Playstation 4 trophies The Heist also introduces a set of new Trophies to Marvel's Spider-Man. We find a total of nine, divided between one of the Gold type (obtainable by completing the DLC one hundred percent), two Silver and six Bronze. To collect most of them, just complete the story of the additional content, then dedicating yourself to some of the side activities to secure the others as well. The plot: an excellent continuation The Robbery therefore hangs up on the line of secondary activities present in the basic version of Marvel's Spider-Man, leading us to finally discover the plans of the Black Cat. In fact, the thief is preparing a big heist inside a museum, from which she intends to steal a work of art: in the moment of completing the theft, Spider-Man also ends up on the spot, directed by the investigation that Mary Jane is unfolding on the gang fight that is taking place in New York. Cat and spider will therefore not be the only guests at the party in the museum, following which the Black Cat herself will end up getting involved in what Hammerhead is planning in turn. With Wilson Fisk brought to justice, the underworld boss is in fact intent on conquering power over the city, trying to eliminate Spider-Man to get the green light. A feat that will naturally prove difficult for the bad guy of the moment, given that Spider-Man will end up in turn involved up to his neck in the story to try to lend a hand to Black Cat. The character of Felicia Hardy is in fact one of Peter Parker's friends-enemies, with whom the woman also had some gallant affairs in the past. Just the bond of the two is at the center of the story of this first DLC, taking up the parallel narrative style that in the original game followed the private life of Peter and the public one of Spider-Man. Thus a kind of triangle emerges, in which Mary Jane is gradually confronted with what could be a rather shocking truth for the continuation of her relationship with Peter. Between intimate elements and misdeeds to foil among the buildings of New York, the story is followed in a pleasant way thus maintaining the high level that we have already had the opportunity to appreciate in Marvel's Spider-Man, for a total of about two and a half hours spent mainly to run after the Black Cat. The latter was characterized very well by the guys from Insomniac Games, good at making it a skilled charmer not only against Peter, but also for those who are in front of the screen. The gameplay: almost the same, but still fun To access the DLC The Heist, the player must select it from the appropriate item inserted by Insomniac Games in the game menu. While taking place in the same places seen in the basic edition of Marvel's Spider-Man, the dynamics of the additional content actually replace the activities present in the initial game, while keeping the structure intact. We therefore find a line of main missions, interrupted from time to time by the need to devote oneself to one of the side activities to introduce the player to them. Carrying them forward it is possible to unlock the three new costumes introduced with the DLC, to obtain which we must use the Spider-Bot gadget to defuse some bombs scattered on the street, recover some stolen works of art and have to deal once again with Screwball, insane ~social villain~ of Spider-Man. As we said, the system underlying the game remains mostly the same, including the puzzles. Some minor elements are an exception, among which we highlight the presence of new enemies equipped with a huge machine gun, capable of eliminating the protagonist in a few shots. In their presence the level of difficulty of the clashes increases resption to what we had become accustomed to, also due to the confined spaces in which they often take place. Even if it is not controllable in any phase of the game, Black Cat is particularly useful in one of the stealth phases, where while remaining in the role of Spider-Man we can count on the collaboration of the thief to eliminate a large group of enemies with the obligation not to let us discover. Do not miss the game phase in which we control Mary Jane, very similar to those already seen on the occasion of Marvel's Spider-Man. In conclusion, if you liked the original game The Robbery represents a more than valid pretext to return to twirl among the skyscrapers of New York, represented in this case in a wonderful nocturnal guise. Before proceeding with the purchase, however, it is good to keep in mind that the plot of the DLC is linked from the most classic of the ~To be continued ...~ to that of its successors, thus making its single purchase a bit senseless. Much better then to proceed with the entire package, thus saving even a few coins in view of the two chapters scheduled for November and December. At least for the moment, the quantity and quality of the contents will leave you satisfied.", "date": "2018-10-24", "grade": null}
