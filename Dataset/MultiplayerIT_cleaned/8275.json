We started talking about Fable: The Journey a couple of years ago, the awaited spin off of one of the sagas most loved by Xbox owners, always straddling fun, innovation and the betrayal of some of the basic mechanics of action RPGs. The true mirror of the contradictions of Peter Molyneux game designer, one of the most controversial characters in the entire videogame scene. A genius, even in the exaggeration of his declarations, cross and delight of PRs from all over the world, especially in recent years. Fable: The Journey was awaited by Kinect owners, a true hardcore game, with which to venture into beautiful Albion and become powerful wizards in search of treasures. A video, at E3 2011, showed what seemed to all intents and purposes a shooter on, almost, tracks: a cart along a road, to be driven by whipping a horse, and a series of dungeons in which to cast spells. A lot of curiosity, but also a lot of grumbling about the rigidity of the scheme. Peter stood up as a bulwark, promising larger areas to explore freely with the wagon, dungeons to navigate on foot leaning out of a chair, while secrets were discovered. Then, Molyneux left Lionhead before the game came out, and on balance, it's good for everyone, because Fable: The Journey is a decent Kinect title, but exactly what it seemed to be: a shooter on, almost, rails. . Theresa's story Albion has changed and the Heroes are all extinct. The Malatorre has reappeared in the middle of the sea, ready to bring the enemy to land through the gap it manages to open between the two parallel realities. Theresa, the blind seer who has accompanied the saga since the beginning, is ready to lend a hand this time too, helping Gabriel, a nomad following a caravan of gypsies, making him acquire magical powers thanks to the knobs that enclose the resulting crystals from the first time the Malatorre was destroyed by heroes. The game begins with Gabriel who remains isolated from his group after a bridge collapses and, along the way, he comes across Theresa and the evil that tries to overwhelm him by corrupting the whole surrounding countryside. The knobs that are given to him allow him to take care of the horse, Stella, and to face the enemies, at the cost, however, of the possibility of taking them off, forcing him on a long journey that will take him where a common man would never have dared to go. To get there, along an adventure that lasts about twelve/thirteen hours, you have to face the journey on the wagon, directing it by holding the virtual bridles, and on foot, when you have to recover all the powers of the knobs or when you explore the small side quests, which they are found along the road, highlighted by flashing circles in which to stop the wagon. When driving, one can move left and right along the roads, choosing small crossroads, but never being able to leave the main road. With the bridle you can make the chariot move at three different speeds and collect three different types of colored gems that give experience, slowing down or speeding up depending on the color. When Stella goes at maximum speed she consumes stamina, which must be increased by giving her a break, otherwise she will lose energy and then be able to make her recover it in the numerous rest/camp points, where you can find chests and where to groom the foal, feed it, water it and cure him, gaining further experience, but which end in a mechanical repetition of a few interactions. This is used to earn tokens to spend to increase Gabriel's health and the powers at his disposal, in a crescendo that however relegates role-playing game profiles to little more than a series of upgrades useful for making higher scores, even if in more advanced combat casting spells at random inevitably leads to death. The journeys with the wagon are a pretext to admire excellently made backdrops and to listen to the stories of Theresa and the various supporting actors, with a depth of detail that the saga is sometimes lacking, but if you are not interested in knowing these stories, the journey could turn out to be even too long, except for the sections in which evil attacks us by upsetting the seabed or those in which the wagon moves by itself and it is up to us to eliminate the hobbes by dint of spells. Xbox 360 goals Fable: The Journey is a generous title and already with the first pass, without having faced the arcade mode, you find yourself with at least 700 points collected out of the 1000 available. Full loot is almost inevitable with a little patience. Fireballs The fights are, of course, the strong point and Lionhead has done a really good job here. Gabriel uses both hands: con the left raises the magic shield with which to parry and send flaming arrows and boulders back to the sender. Always with the left he uses the ~push~ the magic that allows him to move objects, stun and throw enemies around the screen (up to a maximum of five by enhancing it) and solve small environmental puzzles, even during boss fights; with his right hand he launches lightning, fireballs and spears of energy, each with a different movement and with different effects. To increase the strategy of the clashes, the aftertouch, or the ability to direct the spells behind the obstacles after having thrown them in the air. Over time you find yourself using both hands without thinking about it, throwing enemies into the air (or blocking them with the energy tentacles of the push) and hitting them on the fly, non-stop. The dungeons are well designed (all on tracks and without crossroads, let's remember) and full of that English humor typical of the saga. There are also some boss fights at the end of the level (although one is missing at the end of the game) that require precise tactics and the combined use of backgrounds and powers, a pity that the developers have made icons appear on the screen if the player doesn't use the correct magic on different background elements as soon as possible, making things easier, but less intriguing. Fable: The Journey is a fun game in these stages, a treat for those who have played all Fable, but it seems a bit of a hybrid between what the team thought it could do best (a decent kinect shooter) and what Molyneux he absolutely wanted to make it. Thus there is no trace of the moral choices of the saga, the side quests are exhausted in a series of short additional foot sequences and that the chests scattered throughout the world contain cards with drawings of some of the most famous elements of the series, but which they have no use other than to form a sort of wikipedia on Albion. In short, once finished, it remains an arcade mode with which to play the best shooter sequences in which to achieve high scores, have fun with magic and unlock achievements, but no real reason to start from the beginning, as there are no difficulty levels. Especially since among the very detailed polygonal models, the light effects, the textures and the animations, this is one of the best incarnations of Albion, but, being a game on tracks, it was unlikely that technical problems could affect the always excellent direction artistic. Faced with this care in graphic design, with the use of the unreal engine instead of the proprietary engine, and sound, Fable fans will just have fun and, in the end, games like Child of Eden have shown that the score attack can be a great incentive to persevere. From Fable, however, it is difficult not to expect something more with the further note that, for the Italian edition, all well dubbed and subtitled, the voice commands have not been adapted, which work wonderfully in the UK version.", "date": "2012-10-09", "grade": "7.5"}
