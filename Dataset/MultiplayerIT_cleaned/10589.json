Who were these German developers who out of nowhere had launched an FPS capable of graphically rivaling the most recent titles from id Software and Valve (Doom 3 and Half-Life 2 by the way), while also managing to introduce several innovations in the genre, such as levels more open and a more dynamic game design of events and situations? A single game was enough to launch Crytek into the Olympus of world developers and to make the wait for their next project spasmodic, which already from the first images promised to be technically even superior to the already excellent Far Cry. Indeed, let's say better, it promised to be superior to anything else that had ever arrived on the market. It was to the point that at the time of launch there was almost no system capable of running it perfectly, so as to transform it into a benchmark and a small legend of the PC world. Obviously that game was the first Crysis and that technical mastery is still visible today in the Crysis Remastered Trilogy and that amazed us for the quality of the graphic rejuvenation made by Crytek with all three chapters, so much so that in some moments it didn't even seem to be faced with titles from two generations ago. Let's find out how in the review of Crysis Remastered Trilogy. The series The enhanced VFX from the Crysis Remastered Trilogy Crysis came out between 2007 and 2013, meaning they spanned the Xbox 360 / PS3 generation, stopping abruptly at the PS4 / Xbox One gates. One would suppose that, given the past time, they must appear ancient. In reality this is not the case and, despite some signs of rust, they are still very enjoyable and can offer highly spectacular moments, thanks above all to the introduction of various effects that were unthinkable at the time. After all, and it makes you smile to write it for Crysis, it's not just the graphics that count. Trying out the three games in a row was also an excellent opportunity to re-read them and better place them in the history of video games. Amazon offer Crysis Remastered Trilogy, Xbox One/Series X 49.99 See Offer In the path of the Crysis series, not only the path taken by Crytek as a development studio is visible, but also the end of the clear split between the PC and console worlds, which has increasingly led software houses to compromise to launch their titles on all popular systems simultaneously, up to an upward trend of the common standards. Crysis was essentially a PC game, then ported to consoles at a later stage. Crysis 2 was born with consoles already in mind, but betrayed many of the ideas of the first chapter, resulting poorer and, in many ways, insignificant. Finally, Crysis 3 achieved an almost perfect balance, also demonstrating that it was possible to address audiences of different platforms without necessarily displeasing them. It should be specified that the writer played and finished the three original Crysis on PC, so he has the best versions in mind. The test of the Crysis Remastered Trilogy was also done on a PC, equipped with a GeForce RTX 3070, which allowed us to play at the maximum possible detail. But now let's proceed to analyze them better one by one. Crysis Remastered Some landscapes from the Crysis Remastered Trilogy are still breathtaking Crysis Remastered is the first chapter of the series, as well as the most alien in terms of level structure and general gameplay. It is 2020, on the Lingshan Islands, off the coast of the Philippines. The player assumes the role of elite soldier Jake Dunn, codenamed Nomad who, wearing his special nanosuit and together with his team, called the Raptor, must find out what is happening in the area and explain the meaning of the message sent by a certain Dr. Rosenthal, speaking of a discovery that can change the world forever. The Raptor team is made up of some characters who will return several times in the series, also as protagonists: Nomad, Psycho, Aztec, Jester and Prophet. From the beginning of the adventure it is possible to use the powers of the nanosuit, which are for the most part the fulcrum of the entire experience, as well as the Crysis trademark. Not only is it possible to run faster than normal humans and make mighty leaps, but it is also possible to create a protective shield around Nomad, become invisible for a few seconds and do other nice things that give a lot of variety to the gameplay. Obviously there is no shortage of weapons, which can be collected from the corpses of enemies or from the various deposits scattered around the maps. Without going too far on this first chapter, which does not include the expansionWarhead, to which we have already dedicated a rich review, we can tell you that it is an excellent work of rejuvenation, in which the new dynamic lighting system, the simulation of the improved fluids, the more defined shadows, the ray tracing and all the other additions made by the developers, they help to bring out an impressive technical side still today, even if only for the demonstrated ability to know how to absorb the most recent technological innovations (virtue of the CryEngine). By now the myth of ~Will Crysis shoot us?~ has decayed, but Crysis Remastered is still a good sight, especially for some breathtaking landscapes, which enhance the open environments. Crysis 2 Remastered A nocturnal scenario from the Crysis Remastered Trilogy It is not surprising that the weakest title of the remastered trilogy is Crysis 2 Remastered, the result of numerous compromises, largely due to Crytek's first approach to the console world, which was in fact unknown to him. We are in August 2023 and three years have now passed since the events told in the opening chapter. The protagonist of the game here is Alcatraz, a Marine who is tasked with finding Doctor Nathan Gould with his team. At the beginning of the adventure, however, the submarine he is on is shot down and his team is exterminated. Alcatraz is also dying, but is rescued by Prophet, the leader of the Raptor team, who saves him by giving him his Nanosuit, version 2.0, and then commits suicide, so as not to suffer the harmful effects of an alien virus. The Nanosuit heals the wounds of Alcatraz which from that moment takes upon itself the onerous task of carrying on Prophet's mission. First, however, he must get the forces of CELL, a private military group out of his tail on his heels, out to kill him, believing him to be their savior. From here will start an adventure that will lead Alcatraz to cross a New York at war, in which everyone seems to want to kill him, whether they are humans or aliens, and in which everyone seems to want to destroy each other. As mentioned, Crysis 2 is the weakest chapter in the series, especially in the level design, enormously different from that of the progenitor. There where Crysis takes up the Far Cry philosophy, offering the player semi-open levels that give a good freedom of approach to the different objectives, thanks also to the use of the powers of the nanosuit, which allow you to better and more freely exploit any hiding place or other characteristic of the lush maps, so as to allow the adoption of different styles of play, Crysis 2 offers a more canonical experience, made up of much more linear and closed levels and less freedom of general approach, despite maintaining the powers. Therefore, the feeling of being a kind of predator in a highly hostile environment, which made wandering the islands of the first chapter in search of aliens and Koreans so special, is lost. The remastered version not only reiterates these defects, but somehow aggravates them, given that we are faced with the worst aged chapter, precisely by virtue of its structural limitations. That said, it's still wonderful to see how the remaster has made the New York of the game even more beautiful, with notable additions such as Temporal Anti-Aliasing, improved shadows, a completely overhauled lighting system, overhauled character models and many others. The PC version also enjoys advanced effects such as shadows cast on the water, hardware and software ray tracing and the Nvidia DLSS application. Many textures have also been modified and are now much more defined and realistic. It must be said that, unlike the first and third chapters, Crysis 2 snapped a bit, especially at the beginning of the levels. Evidently the problem is loading game items. Strange, however, that everything happens only with this intermediate chapter, while the other two the framerate was fixed on 60 fps. Nothing dramatic, but it's fair to report it. Crysis 3 Remastered The wet reflections of the Crysis Remastered Trilogy Crysis 3 Remastered is the third and final episode of the series, that of the almost perfect synthesis between the gameplay of the first and second chapter. We are in 2047, twenty-four years after the events of Crysis 2. The C.E.L.L. controls New York and built a gigantic dome on it, called the Liberty Dome. The original goal was to create a containment area for the aliens who survived the events of the second episode, but the C.E.L.L. he discovered a way to produce energy thanks to alien technologies and started selling it all over the world, at loansharking prices. Many went into debt to get some and, when they couldn't pay, they were invited to play 1,2,3 Star... no, that's anotherstory (let's not digress). They were put into CELLL's ~Work for Debt~ program, where they were essentially made into slaves in the service of the evil military group. Prophet (to find out how he was reborn, finish Crysis 2 ed) is kept in suspended animation by the CELL, but is awakened by Psyco who wants him by his side to fight the enemies. During his imprisonment, Prophet had a vision of the future where the entire human race is being exterminated by aliens and he wants to do everything to prevent that from actually happening. To succeed he will have to espouse the cause of Psycho and face the CELL, going to destroy the center of power. The levels of Crysis 3 have been conceived in a very different way compared to those of the second episode, returning to look largely at the first, despite being more closed. Thus, after a linear initial level, but with fairly large areas that allow you to try out the powers and different styles of play, you start with more open areas, where you can decide how to proceed to tackle the different obstacles, whether they are human or aliens. To mark the distance from the second chapter, Crytek has inserted a truly lethal weapon and a harbinger of great satisfaction: the bow. Using it doesn't use up the Nanosuit's energy, so it's perfect for those who like to play the sneaky style. From a remastering point of view, Crysis 3 is the chapter that offers the highest visual quality. After all, even the original on PC is still very usable without too many dramas, but this edition allows you to activate ray tracing, to raise the resolution up to native 4K and to enjoy the various additional effects already described for the other chapters, which are here magnified by a richer and more detailed already basic scenario. So get ready to be amazed by the light passing through the vegetation that has invaded New York, or by the explosions of towers and vehicles. Even the rain effect is particularly spectacular, as verifiable as soon as the adventure begins. If it weren't for some details, it would be very difficult to mistake it for a title from eight years ago. It should be noted that throughout our test, Crysis 3 proved to be very fluid, despite having selected the maximum detail.
