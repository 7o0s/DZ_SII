Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Born in 1996 and quickly spreading to arcades around the world, the Metal Slug series undoubtedly represents a great success for SNK, as well as proof that the Japanese house, at the time, could not only make excellent match fighting games, but had the credentials to also create intellectual property outside of that particular videogame vein. With seven regular episodes and several spin-offs under its belt, the franchise has not enjoyed particular fortune after the retirement of the Neo Geo nor has it been able to reinvent itself, remaining afloat only thanks to a large amount of remakes, especially for mobile devices. The release of Metal Slug Defense was therefore welcomed with great interest, because it represents for SNK a concrete attempt to relaunch its IP by moving into a different territory, that of ~tower defense~-style strategy games. The characters in the game are always the same, the ones we have come to know over the years, but the mechanics that regulate the gameplay are different and shift to a tactical level, giving us a campaign made up of an enormous number of missions as more and more complex, in which we are simply asked to proceed horizontally from left to right, from our position to that of the enemy, with the aim of destroying it. Too easy? The first levels, which basically play the role of a tutorial, are actually completed effortlessly and even leave a little bitterness in the mouth, revealing a structure apparently without thickness. However, it is enough to play for half an hour to understand what this new experience is made of and what its potential is. Unity is strength? The first units that Metal Slug Defense makes available to us are an anonymous soldier and a barricade construction worker. The former attacks only with his knife, but his special ability, which charges up within seconds, sees him throw a powerful grenade at the enemy. Keep these details in mind, because they form the core of the strategic experience created by SNK for iOS and Android terminals. After a few completed missions and a little virtual money earned, in fact, our roster will begin to enrich itself with valuable grafts such as the various Marco, Tarma, Eri and Flo, armed with a rifle but respectively equipped with the ability to fire a powerful burst of bullets, a powerful low-range rifle blast, a missile and a laser beam. To use a character's special power, simply touch it on the screen (an operation which, however, becomes confusing when the sprites overlap, sometimes making us waste the move) when the relative bar is full, and this mechanic significantly increases the thickness of a gameplay which otherwise would be based only on the sheer number of soldiers we can send against those of the enemy. Also in terms of unit management there is a significant tactical substratum, which takes the form both in the upgrade system between one stage and another and in the heart of the action, when it is necessary to decide to use the points that are automatically generated to recall in the field one unit rather than another, or to reinvest part of the ~nest egg~ to make the production procedure faster and therefore ensure more consistent supplies in the subsequent phases. Metal Slug Defense is a fun and challenging tower defense game with lots of missions and different cool ideas Between power and confusion While we wait for the counter to allow us to recall a soldier from the roster, automatic battles are taking place in the background between the units in the field; and the figures that at first seemed trivial to us, such as the person in charge of building the barricades, turn out to be of fundamental importance in facing the most arduous battles, those in which it seems that the enemies have an edge and tend to advance without too many problems, or the challenging bosses. In fact, we must consider that the barriers absorb blows instead of our soldiers, which guarantees the latter a greater duration and therefore the possibility of inflicting damage for longer without our base remaining at the mercy of the opponents' offensive. Pieces of a puzzle that is anything but trivial, which reaffirm their centrality also and above all when we decide to challenge anotherplayer online, in a normal or ranked game, or when we try our hand at the special events that appear from time to time on the mission map, and which are characterized by a higher than average degree of difficulty. In short, SNK seems to have hit the mark with Metal Slug Defense, however opting for a not particularly limiting freemium model, in which you can play for quite a while before our ~energy~ needs a top-up and without the concrete obligation to get involved to the wallet. The strategic gameplay and the full-bodied structure are also accompanied by a technical sector that draws liberally from the many episodes of the original series, recovering many characters (good and bad), suggestive and detailed scenarios, as well as quality music. It's just a pity that all these components find an ugly interface as a glue, which makes navigation through the menus not very intuitive.", "date": "2014-05-10", "grade": "7.7"}
