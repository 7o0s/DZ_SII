Passione Calcio continues, like its predecessors, with the philosophy of the ~deus ex machina~ coach, responsible for everything, and who has the last word on every decision made towards the team. At the beginning of the game we can decide whether to freely choose the team we are going to train or rely on chance, or venture into Career mode and go hunting for the few benches available in Europe with the aim of carving out our little slice of celebrity. In any case, the choice is not the one we are used to from other titles of the genre, in fact only the two main divisions of 8 European countries are available (to be clear, the equivalent of the Italian A and B), with the exception of 'England where the third division is also available, and Greece where we will necessarily have to settle for only the first. Each team will obviously have its objectives for the season and, if we are not able to meet them, we will actually run the risk of being fired. As coaches we will have a large number of tasks (even too many we said at the beginning). First of all, as always, it is good to take a look at the roster that makes up the team, just to get an idea of the ~human material~ with which we will have to work. Each player is characterized by 10 characteristics (to which physical fitness is added, which however is marked separately) which then modify the average values, called ~attitudes~, which indicate the player's ability in defense, midfield and attack. The calculation of these aptitudes is not fixed, but depends on the importance we have attributed to the characteristics according to the role. To put it more simply, the player's performance does not change but, by changing the way these averages are calculated, the way they appear to us changes, so it is easier for us to quickly identify those who, based precisely on our personal criteria, we consider more valid. On the other hand, the division of roles is too rigid: each player can only cover one role, and will have a lower performance if he is placed in even a slightly different position. If the roles were a limited number this would also be fine, but with 6 distinct roles for defenders, as many for midfielders and 2 for attackers, having a complete squad capable of covering injuries and suspensions is practically impossible. The coach in the ball The tactical section is pretty sparse. Only the tactics indicated by 3 numbers are available (therefore 4-4-2 and 4-3-3 for example), but not those that contemplate intermediate roles such as the libero, the back playmaker or the attacking midfielder. It is possible to manually move the position of the players on the field, but only within limited areas based on the basic role established by the chosen tactic, so it is often particularly complex, if not completely impossible, to position the players exactly how and where you want. The workouts have undergone a substantial restyling. There is no possibility of creating tailor-made training programs, but the existing three (physical, technical and tactical) can be customized by indicating the amount of time to be assigned to each specific aspect, then, through the main screen, distribute these three workouts ( to which are added the training match and the cool-down) over an entire month. At the end of a week, the program of the one just passed is copied to the last one. If we then add to this that the presence of matches is also indicated, we have obtained a simple but very comfortable training system which allows an excellent level of customization and planning in all situations. The icing on the cake, it is also possible to send the team to retreat, which will give a bonus to the effects of training for that period, also topped off with nice options such as the possibility of allowing players to be accompanied by their families, allowing them free exit, or barricade yourself behind the press blackout. Nothing particular to report on the market. There is the essential search engine, in which we can as always define every single characteristic of the player we are looking for and the annoying, but inevitable, negotiation to convince players to change teams and teams to let them go. It is a pity, however, that there are no so-called ~free agents~, the ~uncontracted~ ones, among whom it is always hoped to find some good players to put under contract without having to pay the termination clause. Sometimes even the assistants earn their salary... In many managers the section dedicated to the staffit exists more for beauty than anything else. However, this certainly cannot be said of Passione Calcio. Here each of them has its own importance (there are no less than 6 different ones) not so much because they free us from a boring or complicated task, but because the presence of some of them is essential to use some dedicated sections, such as the search for unknown talents and automatic workouts. Others of them, on the other hand, are simply useful to facilitate us in certain tasks, such as fan leaders to keep the fans calm and be able to reduce security without running risks, or to get clues and advice. Economy The economic management deserves a separate discussion. For several years now it has been customary to entrust the player with only the tasks of manager (the coach, or more precisely the technical director), this also to keep the games similar to the real situation in the world of football. In Passione Calcio, just like in its predecessors, we go back to the origins, to the glories of the now prehistoric Manager, in which everything rests on our shoulders. This note also applies to the economic management of the team, which includes managing the budget for stadium maintenance and its safety, ticket and season ticket prices, sponsorship contracts, and player insurance. These are simple and quick options to manage, but which often boil down to simple distractions from the routine of our managerial duties. The match Much has been done to improve the managerial section, much less for the actual game. The game is static as always: a fixed screen of the field without any type of animation. Every now and then a small image appears accompanied by a message that explains what is happening on the pitch. Then it takes three to four games to see the whole sample of actions present in the game, so all too soon you end up bored, or worse, frustrated. Compared to the last edition, at least the player statistics are updated in real time, but even this still does not make it easy to understand how and where to put your hands to overturn a disadvantageous situation. Furthermore, the impossibility of changing the team's attitude from defensive to offensive makes it impossible to even think of defending an unexpected advantage. The only note of interest is the presence of the ~manager's nitro~ (in other words, the fervor of the coach), which can be modified to influence the intensity of the players' play, modifying their performance, but also the risk of being booked and injury. There is nothing else to say, simply because there is nothing else to see Final comment If it weren't for the representation of the match, Passione Calcio would be a really nice little game The Waywardxs have made great strides in the managerial section compared to the previous edition: there are still many imperfections, and much more can still be improved, but in this respect it is pleasant enough to play. What's really wrong is the game! It's not so much about the static visualization, but about the monotony and boredom that you feel after a while: a few games and you can say you've seen it all... You understand if you only scored on the very last image of an action, so you don't have it doesn't even make sense to see the rest, on the contrary, often one would like to be able to remove them even if only to speed up the progress of the match ... not to mention the difficulty in understanding how to intervene ... Passione Calcio however, as we already said at the beginning, does not want to put itself on the same level as the industry giants. It is proposed to a different public and, seen from this point of view, it does its ~dirty work~. So it's recommended for all those who want to have fun with a football manager without going crazy behind dozens of incomprehensible numbers, or even just for those who want to try the genre without spending an exaggerated amount. Pro More useful and full-bodied manual than many of its more famous competitors Management of monthly training instead of weekly Customization of the calculation of the players' averages Cons Visualization of the static match Sparse and repetitive commentary Limited and not very versatile tactic With the giants Football Manager and Championship Manager fighting each other, a small software house like our local Waywardxs certainly cannot throw itself into the fray without criteria. After two not exactly convincing titles such as Gianluca Vialli's European Manager and PC Calciatori 2004, he therefore comes out with this Passione Calcio to try to conquer the market for budget management, perhaps less profitable, but still full of fans.", "date": "2005-12-14", "grade": null}
