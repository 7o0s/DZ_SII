{"name": "Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-trek-voyager-elite-force_a.html", "text": "From Kirk to Geneway For those of you who are unfamiliar with the adventures of Captain Geneway's crew (and who wonder where that nice pointy-eared Vulcan and that quarrelsome captain have gone), a brief history lesson will be quite useful. Since the glory days of Captain Kirk and Doctor McCoy much water has passed under the bridge; nearly a hundred years have passed since those days, the Federation has now reached a peaceful settlement with the Klingons; the encounter with new races has produced new enemies and new allies, and with the passage of the Enterprise into the hands of Captain Picard, the federation has also expanded its own cognitive limits, redefining their geographical maps with the meeting of some races, not properly cordial, hailing from the Delta sector, almost 70 years of travel away from earth. Right in the Delta quadrant, for a strange twist of fate, and with the complicity of a very powerful alien entity, Voyager is sent, the scientific admiral vessel of the Federation which has taken the place of Enterprise D, which after seven years of travel interstellar has earned its well-deserved retirement. The Voyager, captained by, horrified even the purists (in my day they were called male chauvinists, n.d.Pucci) of the series, a woman, thus tries to head home, with the hope of actually being able to shorten the expected time for the return (70 years of travel in fact they are many), traveling through the Delta quadrant in the hope of being able to establish new alliances for the Federation as well. The game is inspired by the idea that, in a quadrant where more enemies than allies probably lurk, it is necessary to set up a defense team specialized in the use of weapons and combat tactics: who to entrust the leadership of this team, called Hazard Team, if not in Tuvok, the defense officer? The game puts us in the role of a lieutenant, Alex Munro, second in command of the Hazard Team, while he is carrying out a training session in Voyager's holographic room; suddenly a meeting with an entity that immediately turns out to be hostile, teleports the entire ship to an unknown point in space and gives us the opportunity to put ourselves at the service of the Captain, captaining and guiding the Hazard Team in carrying out some missions. What episode is this? It should immediately be underlined how the entire game has been modeled on a decidedly cinematic and therefore very spectacular plot: the same credits present at the beginning of the game (which scroll according to the custom of the show after the first important event) have been programmed by tracing faithfully the intro of the series, replacing the names of the programmers with those of the actors. This already manages to capture the attention of the gamer, thus revealing the main objective of the programmers: to make us feel like protagonists of our show. The perfect reproduction of the Voyager environments, the autonomous existence of some NPCs who wander around the ship, eat in the canteen in the bow room, go to the holographic doctor to be treated, chat about the quality of the food offered by Neelix, the accurate reproduction of the main characters of the show (the holographic doctor himself throws a few jokes and hums to you when he is not intent on treating anyone, Tuvok maintains his detached Vulcan sense even in moments of greatest pathos, the Captain is always sensitive to the advice of the other members of the ship , Neelix only thinks about cooking and raising the morale of the troops) all of this has been artfully recreated to allow us to feel ~our part~ inside. However, even if it is possible to listen to some sporadic dialogue from the other members of the ship, and participate in our turn, it should be emphasized that this aspect is not as marked as we perhaps would like (more likely the experience of Deus Ex has left its mark), and most of the time we will not struggle to recognize a certain independence of the Npc characters from our actions: the fact remains that the mark has been hit, the sense of being ~in the show~ is full and satisfying, and that listening to the Klingons sing their songs of war before the battle is truly exceptional. The story itself, divided in its development by many sub-episodes, is expertly told with some twists; there are also a couple of ~semi-hidden~ quotes, one of which is, for fans of the first series, truly unmissable. Naturally I am careful not to reveal it to you, leaving you the pleasure of discovering it, even if the most observant of you cannot help but notice a strange symbol present on the wall of an old spaceship among the screenshots Through many cut-scenes, beautifullymade using the same game engine, very few movies (so much the better, their quality is far from high) and few (too few to tell the truth, yet Half-Life has set the standard in this) scripted events, you are immersed in a captivating story whose demerit is to be too linear; only a couple of times in fact you manage to influence the story, and in an all too subtle way. To surround all this also the sound effects that faithfully reproduce those of the real Voyager (and of the other ships, to be precise) and an audio commentary that accompanies us during our raids suitable for every occasion (even on one occasion we hear the music that long ago accompanied a well-known episode of the classic series, from which a mission of the game is inspired...). The only regret in a story so well invented, and so well told, is to carry out all missions on enemy ships (we were trapped in a kind of ship graveyard by a strange force field), denying ourselves the possibility of carrying out a mission to a planet or an external environment. Gimme Some Action So, slow Vulcan reflections on human feelings and emotions? Long discussions on the validity of the first directive? Fascinating speeches by the captain on the need to remain united to the spirit of the Federation even if so far away? Nope, none of that. Elite Force is an action game that will catapult you against many different enemies, each with particular attack characteristics: the Borg will try to surround you and outnumber you, the Klingons will try to attack you from a distance, the ~ethereals~ will not leave you for a moment to think with their repeating attacks... and so on. Between one fight and another, however, you will spend a lot of time observing the events that take place and that are told to you through the cutscenes mentioned above; certainly the combination of the two components is extremely well thought out, and both the lover of pure action ( la doom, to be clear) and the one who wishes to experience the adventure more intensely will certainly be satisfied. Unfortunately, and this is a fairly significant flaw in my view, the enemies we will meet do not vary much during the missions, and in the Klingon ship we will only have to deal with Klingons all armed with repeating rifles, in the Borg cube we will only approach Borg trying to get close or hit us at a distance and so on; this seriously limits the variety of attacks available to our opponents, which in the long run will become repetitive and predictable. Only in the last levels there is an improvement and a diversification of the attacks, since the enemies we will meet will be able to hit us in different ways. However, it is a clear choice of the programmers, who have tried to keep the game action faithful to the plot trekker, and this aspect, although open to criticism, certainly does not sacrifice the validity of the final product. Especially since in one of the missions, which vary greatly from each other (since according to a tested dynamic mechanism our submissions will vary during the action), we will be ~forced~ to infiltrate an enemy ship trying not to to see, maintaining that stealth attitude so dear to spies from all over the world. So many clashes, many cutscenes and some diversified objectives (we will have to lower the shields of a ship, restore the energy of another, recover our companions at another time ...), and few puzzles: too few, to say the truth, and all quite easy and banal (go through the pipeline, shoot that barrel). to the big mobs of Doom and his descendants... Sadly the enemy AI doesn't seem to have come a long way since the guards in Soldier of Fortune as often all they will do is unload their arsenal on you , not trying to implement any defensive or different attack tactic: especially since the attacks, and this is certainly a flaw, will be directed more towards you, even when in front of them the other team members try to block their way to sound of lasers. Graphically there is nothing to object to, also because the Quake3 engine offers guarantees in itself: very beautiful light effects (all the weapons are energy-powered, so you will see the plasma sparkle everywhere), very well-crafted main and secondary characterswell-defined movements of the enemies, very rich polygonal models, Bezier curves in profusion. Truly a beautiful sight for the eyes, and if you wanted to find a fault at all costs by making an effort... the only chance would be to re-propose for the umpteenth time the criticism of the color palette of the ID engines, but this time we would probably talk at random, since, especially on the Borg cube and in some multiplayer levels, the colors manage to reproduce the game environments wonderfully. Me, mamma and you - or rather: John Romero watches and learns However, what most distinguishes Elite Force from all the other Fps in circulation, is the possibility of being in charge of a group of secondary characters, the Hazard Team, who will follow us in the game action; these team members will not only help us in the clashes by actively intervening in every fire dispute, but many times they will be absolutely indispensable elements for our continuation (they will open doors, hack force fields, destroy ducts with explosives ...). The mention to John Romero, and his Daikatana, is naturally not accidental, because apart from a few sporadic moments in Half-Life and Opposing Force, the Ion Storm programmer had tried in his latest product to design a game action assisted by the support of other active members, but the final result was decidedly disappointing, above all for the level of AI. In this case things improve and not a little: team play is necessary in several points (as mentioned before the amount of enemies that meet at the same time is truly remarkable), and the computer-controlled members manage their AI routines decidedly better than in the past. Unfortunately, and of this choice it is absolutely not clear why, their shots don't seem to do much harm, and they almost never produce your firepower, so much so that in most cases you will have to do the bulk of the work , leaving them the task of weakening the enemy attack. Among other things, none of them ever uses the alternative fire that every weapon has, and this certainly leaves a sense of incompleteness; however, to tell the truth, the feeling of fighting in a group is there and it is very satisfying: just think that during the missions your members can also die, and in those cases the story will take on a slight variant (when the soldier capable of opening the doors dies, all you have to do is get help from the explosives specialist ). If on the one hand the AI of the companions should therefore be praised, on the other there remains the small regret of not being able to give them any orders ( who knows why, the routines for team play were already beautiful and ready with the Quake3 engine ), always leaving the initiative to them; however, this remains a precise choice of game design, since the feeling of being part of a team, and not of commanding it, is certainly more relevant to the game itself and to the Trekkian spirit. Among other things, the Raven programmers have adopted a little trick that we will probably see in every subsequent title regarding the use of elevators and other particular means of movement: when we are ready to use it, and maybe the team is still wandering around the environments, we just need to press the activation button to immediately recall them to order and see them all run on the elevator: Romero, watch and learn. But what a beautiful arsenal! The weapons at our disposal are all energy-powered and this is not a random choice: in fact, Paramount, the television rights holder of the Star Trek series, has always imposed the complete absence of the smallest drop of blood. And precisely for this reason the weapons, which vaporize the enemies, do not produce visible wounds of any kind, keeping the levels of violence present during the game at the antipodes of what we saw in Soldier of Fortune (where the arms jumped into the air, the legs detached from the bust......and so on). The result is ......... very convincing, because in this way the trekker spirit has been absolutely preserved (firefights are very rare in TV series, and when violence does happen it is only in the death of the characters and not in the way of dying). Among other things, the possibility of using energy weapons and ammunition gives the gamer a real feast for the eyes, with fires of all colors chasing each other across the screen; surely from this point of view the title is a p", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
