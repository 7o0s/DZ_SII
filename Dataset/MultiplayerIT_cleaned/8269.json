Real bricks. Whole apartments, to be exact. We got to know these four terrible monsters last year, with the release of Monsters Ate My Condo, and here they are again on the App Store for a sequel that not only immediately takes advantage of the extra space offered by the new iPhone 5 resolution , but at the same time it offers us a more elaborate gameplay, in which the achievements come before anything else and the games follow one another with that goal in mind. In short, we will not simply have to score as many points as possible, but also get a certain amount of matches right, take advantage of the various bonuses, create bricks never seen before and so on, following a path that will gradually lead us to the unlocking of new elements, so to further enrich the experience. The gameplay of Super Monsters Ate My Condo! it's what we already know: in the central part of the touch screen it ~rains~ some yellow, green, red or blue apartments, and you have to make sure to pair those of the same shade so that they transform into something different. Three apartments therefore become a bronze brick, three bronze bricks become a silver brick, three silver bricks form a gold brick and finally three gold bricks are transformed into a precious diamond. Obtaining more and more precious blocks will allow us to obtain stratospheric scores, but it will not be easy to do so. Torrequake The cast of the first Monsters Ate My Condo returns in this sequel. We then find Boat Head, the huge red crab that, growing bigger, overwhelmed a ship that now acts as his hat; Reginald Starfire, the blue unicorn with a passion for color; Mr. Shigoto, a cyclops mysteriously dressed in typical Bavarian clothes; and Lord Ferocious, a large pug who controls a massive mechanical body. The new elements introduced into the gameplay by PikPok Games, such as the ninety achievements to unlock and all that follows, certainly make the survival structure more bearable, i.e. the ~single match~ with no levels to complete or a real progression system. The choice to unlock new objects as you complete the objectives seemed particularly apt to us, so as to make the experience more interesting in the long run rather than putting everything on the plate right away, with the risk of quickly decreasing the interest. Having said that, the changes made to the game in our opinion are far from substantial, almost worthy of a simple update rather than a real sequel: the graphics have been reworked here and there but the assets remain the same, the excellent touch controls have been confirmed for this second episode and even the ~bonuses~ that are obtained by feeding the special bricks have not changed. There's certainly more extra blocks, which goes hand in hand with the gradual unlocking of new items, but that doesn't really change the action. Perhaps it was necessary to introduce a new mode, rather than eliminating the secondary one present in the original game, an operation which inevitably made the offer of Super Monsters Ate My Condo! poorer.", "date": "2012-10-11", "grade": "7.4"}
