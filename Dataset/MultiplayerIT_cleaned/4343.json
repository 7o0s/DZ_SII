We return to control the five heroes of Ubersreik, captured by the enemy army after the collapse of the great city but determined to regroup to free the world from the threat of the ferocious ratmen and the dark forces that accompany their advance. The tutorial of the game puts us in the role of the soldier Markus Kruber, in a series of sequences that will see us free our adventure companions while carrying out a ~review~ of the control system, the same as in the first episode but with the addition of a special ability that can be activated when its gauge is full. Forming the team again, the heroes find refuge in Helmgart fortress, where they plan a new offensive that will lead them to face the enemy in thirteen different maps. The black tide In structural and conceptual terms, Warhammer: Vermintide II stands as the classic ~more of the same~, going to re-propose the formula that had worked so well with the debut chapter, clearly inspired by the mechanics of Left 4 Dead, but enriching it in some important respects. In the first place, the introduction of three specializations for each character, which are unlocked upon reaching certain levels of experience and allow for quite radical changes not only in the appearance but also in the approach of the fighter: the aforementioned Markus Kruber starts as a Mercenary, but can also become a Hunter or a Knight on Foot; dwarf warrior Bardin Goreksson is a Veteran Ranger by default, but can transform into an Ironbreaker or even a Slayer; the Kerillian elf begins as a Keeper of the Paths, but can become a Handmaid or a Shadow. Victor Saltzpyre is a Captain of the Witch Hunters, but can upgrade to the Bounty Hunter specialization or transform into a Zealot; finally Sienna Fuegonasus, a Warrior Mage, can become a Pyromancer or take the Out of Control form, unleashing her fire-related powers. Each profession boasts a different passive ability, special move and unlockable perks, but a more advanced class may not necessarily lend itself better to your style than the default one: it all depends, in fact, on the way you prefer to fight. Do you like heavy weapons or quick and light ones? Do you prefer to hit from a distance or up close? Do you want an advantage against bosses or an ability that allows you to hide when necessary? After a few hours of playing you will probably have an idea of what is the best solution for your character. Change of scenery Another important novelty of Warhammer: Vermintide II lies in the design of the scenarios: the thirteen maps available are substantially more vast, multifaceted and interesting than those of the first episode, with some truly suggestive glimpses and an unprecedented sense of verticality, which is in the field on more than one occasion to strongly characterize certain areas of the locations. Sometimes you find yourself climbing mountains, snowy or not; to descend from hills in the midst of a splendid but treacherous forest; to follow the paths between the plantations of a completely open and sunny setting. The degree of interaction is also quite limited here, it is true, but the developers have seen fit to introduce a random mechanism in the generation of hordes to make each game different. This means that you will not have precise reference points: every time you walk the streets of a specific map, you will not know if and when you will hear the horn of the enemy forces, which calls hordes of basic Skaven, armored, armed with machine guns or flamethrowers; but also Chaos warriors of various kinds, including some huge units equipped with heavy armor, which will give you a lot of trouble especially during the first few games. To this will be added minibosses along the lines of the Left 4 Dead Tanks, belonging to four different types and also randomly recalled on the map: the Bile Trolls, huge monsters that vomit poisonous bile; the two different Rat Ogres, decidedly overgrown mice; and finally the Abominations of Chaos, tentacled and gruesome creatures. In short, the bestiary of the Fatshark title has been enriched with numerous figures, to the advantage of the variety of situations and the degree of challenge, certainly not trivial and adjustable on four levels: Recruit, Veteran, Champion and Legend.The road to victory An experience like the one proposed by Warhammer: Vermintide II can be really exciting at first, but then risks tiring where new features are not introduced; which is then what in many ways happened with the first episode. Fortunately, the game will keep us busy for a few dozen hours just to unlock all the maps and classes; not to mention the aforementioned difficulty levels, which bring with them an enrichment of the loot. In this regard, the questionable solution of the dice has fortunately been set aside in favor of prize boxes which can become more valuable on the basis of some completion bonuses, and which contain new weapons and equipment for our character. The system works well, is completely devoid of microtransactions and releases new items in a fairly generous way, allowing us to change our fighter's equipment after the first success. On the crafting front, all unused objects can be melted down, so as to obtain the raw materials necessary to build new weapons or to enhance those in our possession, with sections also dedicated to the properties of each tool and any illusions we want to apply to them. Unfortunately, from this point of view, the interface is a bit cumbersome and you need to do some experiments to understand how each single feature works. Too bad: a simpler and more immediate approach would have represented a further arrow in the arc of the Fatshark title, especially towards those approaching the series for the first time. Spectacular fight In short, Warhammer: Vermintide II takes the strengths of the first episode and emphasizes them, smoothing out some edges of the original offer and enriching the structure both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view. The combat system is solid, especially when facing a single opponent, but still tends to become a bit slippery and inconsistent when facing a veritable flood of enemies. We greatly appreciated some technical aspects, such as the reactions that accompany amputations or beheadings of the Skaven or other types of hostile units, as well as some details of the protagonists, which however on the animation front obey the traditional rule of online functionality with respect to pleasantness. Seen in motion, the game certainly impresses and manages to gain a bit of personality, even if it falls into the generic on some occasions due to assets that are not exactly original and inserted a bit randomly into the scenario. The effects are not brilliant: the fire on the ground or on the enemies is ugly, as is the water and, above all, the rain: old-gen drifts that denote a budget clearly not at the level of the most famous productions, and which are paired with a few too frequent glitches (the ~crazy ragdoll~ effect, mainly), which we thought would be fixed after the beta. On the technical front, there are so many adjustments available, which means that the game can run on a wide range of configurations, however, being slightly demanding when setting the values to the maximum. Given the importance of the sixty frames per second, in our case we opted for a resolution of 1440p with everything on ultra, apart from the quality of the shadows and the anti-aliasing (set to FXAA), achieving a fluidity that is not rocky but rather stable even in the most complicated situations, which for Vermintide II means literally hundreds of characters on the screen at the same time. The music is excellent, capable of enhancing every situation and starting with an engaging crescendo when the enemies are arriving, just as we found the dialogues in English, subtitled in Italian, convincing. We played using both the mouse / keyboard combination and the Xbox 360 controller, perfectly supported in-game but not as much as regards the interface of the crates or crafting between one mission and another, operations that become slow with the pad and woody.", "date": "2018-03-16", "grade": "8.2"}
