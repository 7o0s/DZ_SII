{"name": "Braid - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/braid-recensione.html", "text": "Don't be surprised if you've never heard of Braid. Officially presented for the first time in its Xbox 360 version during the Microsoft conference of the Tokyo Game Show 2007, and arrived without any kind of clamor until the time of its publication thanks to the questionable promotional policy of the Redmond house regarding the titles for the XBLA service, Braid is an independent project developed by one Jonathan Blow. So far nothing strange, if it weren't for one detail: Braid is a small masterpiece. My name is not Mario It is strange and particularly rare to speak in these terms of a game made by a label without a large emblem or a multi-million dollar budget behind it; yet, with a tremor of joy that cannot fail to involve even the fatalistic pessimists on the standardization of the industry, Braid succeeds in finding what is now the Holy Grail of the market, that is to propose a product that is as innovative as it is engaging and simply fun . All this thanks to a perfect amalgam of the elements that make up the effort of the Number One, Inc. team, all excellent if taken individually but which become sensationally exciting when put together. Let's start from the plot, narrated in a purely textual way through a series of books distributed at the beginning of each level; a common thread with a moving and sincerely touching strength and thickness, of a depth unknown to the vast majority of video games. In summary, it is the story of the protagonist Tim and his princess, lost due to a mistake he is trying to fix. In reality it is not at all so obvious and trivial, since the protagonists are metaphors to talk about loves, friendships, affections that simply concern anyone. Reading those books, those few words, really pushes to a reflection (even personal) at times unsettling, a perfect viaticum that brilliantly introduces the adopted artistic style. Also in this case it is difficult to describe in words what Braid is capable of offering, the strings it is able to touch without the aid of a single polygon. Everything is in fact purely two-dimensional, but each frame could very well be framed and hung on the wall of your home; the impression is of being in front of a watercolor full of colors and details, drawn by hand and therefore vibrant and simply alive. And of the same value is the musical accompaniment, capable of embracing every game situation accompanying it in a frankly perfect way, with such a balance that it is never intrusive or negligible. But with the pad in hand, what is Braid? We try to explain it to you, but keep in mind that only by playing it will you be able to understand its true value... Time doesn't matter Observing it for about 2 seconds, Jonathan Blow's fatigue may seem like a banal Super Mario Bros clone; you move left or right in these beautiful 2d worlds, you jump on the heads of enemies to eliminate them, there are platforms, that sort of thing. Blow himself had a lot of fun playing on this false identity, associating Braid with some elements that can only recall the Nintendo milestone; see carnivorous plants coming out of green pipes or the message that, at the end of each level, warns us that the princess is in another castle just to name a couple. But in this case the platform genre has little to do, because if we really had to catalog Braid it would certainly be put in the puzzle game vein. And in fact it is precisely the collection of puzzle pieces, 12 for each of the 6 worlds, the primary objective of the mechanics offered; however, how to be able to recover them is a whole other matter, since Tim's power to manipulate time comes into play. But forget the memories of Blinx or Prince of Persia; in this case this aspect represents the foundations of the gameplay, thanks to an integration, evolution and development of the concept that can only surprise. The X key is a kind of rewind, with which to go back a single action or even up to the beginning of the level; and certainly it can be used to avoid a death, a wrong jump or an enemy attack, but this is only the beginning, the tip of the iceberg of the mechanism. In truth, we need to think broader, trying to understand how this power can integrate with the environment and with the situation present in it to be exploited to one's advantage. The surprising thing is that there is no puzzle piece that needs to be collected in the same way; the variety and quality of the situations offered is incredible, as is the continuous evolution of the concept that gradually adds elements or shuffles the cards on the table giving enormous gratification to the user on the occasion of each success. In fact, each of the levels offers a different approach; just to give a few examples, in one of them we find ourselves changing the passage of time simply by walking to the right (scrolls forward) or to the left (backwards), while in another we create bubbles in which everything slows down compared to the rest. Later, however, you will have to deal with your own duplicates, shadows created by the player on the basis of your movements just performed. Trust us: very simply, playing Braid you touch authentic game design peaks that will remain in the heart of every gamer who wants to welcome them. And forget any discussion about the 1200 points required for purchase or the reduced longevity ... Comment Braid is the jewel you don't expect, the truly great title of this summer 2008 lacking in particular videogame emotions. On the contrary, Jonathan Blow's project brings an incredible breath of fresh air, in a whirlwind of poetry, coherence, art, intelligence, creativity, innovation and pure and brilliant game design that can only leave you speechless. A must buy, quite simply. Pro Brilliant game design Excellent art direction Gorgeous storyline Cons Short, it's true, but damn intense Goals 200 points that will be given to you simply by continuing through the levels and completing the game, without any particular ancillary requests. The objectives are in fact linked to the crossing of the worlds and the completion of the related puzzles, with the only exception of the speed run if performed with a time lower than that indicated.", "date": "2008-08-12", "grade": null}
