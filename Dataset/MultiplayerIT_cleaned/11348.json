{"name": "Good Night Mr. Snoozleberg", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/good-night-mr-snoozleberg.html", "text": "Both casual gamers and ~navigated~ gamers will sometimes find themselves trying their hand at an online game, one of those developed in Flash and available on some sites. Immediately comes to mind Alien Hominid, made in 2002, which was played literally millions of times, with obvious repercussions on the popularity of the web pages that made it available to visitors. There are several such products, in reality, and Mr. Snoozleberg was born in the same way: created way back in 1998 by the Canadian developers of the Sarbakan team, it is a cross between Mister Magoo and the various Disney characters who have ventured into with the theme of sleepwalking (Pippo above all). In this case, however, it is not luck that saves the protagonist's skin, but the intervention of the player, who will have to interact with the scenario so that Mr. Snoozleberg does not fall to the ground. Good Night Mr. Snoozleberg is just the latest episode of a series designed for mobile gaming. The game structure is always the same: each stage presents us with a different scenario, and we will have to modify its elements as the sleepwalker approaches. If Mr. Snoozleberg starts walking on a roof, it is clear that we will have to approach the pointer to the edge of the building and look for an interactable element, such as a drain pipe, to ~bend~ it so that the character can walk on it and perhaps reach a balcony. If this faces a window, maybe there's something there that we can move into a little platform to land on. And so on, until the character reaches ground level, without running any more dangers. The first levels act a bit as a tutorial, with the various ~hot spots~ highlighted graphically: at which point we'll simply have to activate them at the right time. Later on, things will get a little more complicated, since we will have to rely only on our ability to identify the interactive elements, while the character continues on his unconscious walk, therefore with a few seconds available to make the right move. Very often this translates into a series of preliminary attempts aimed at discovering the characteristics of a scenario, which must be memorized in order to achieve the objective. The control system is extremely simple, in fact it is based on the use of the joystick to move the pointer and the 5 key to interact with the setting. You can also pause the action by pressing the right soft key. On a graphic level, the game tries to resume the style used for the numerous Flash versions, very cartoonish, but it doesn't fully succeed: the animation of the character is mediocre, just as the design of the scenarios does not shine. The choice of colors is good, but it is not enough to improve the situation, definitively drowned by a music that is too sharp and annoying, to be deactivated on the fly. The joystick allows us to control the pointer precisely, but it is clear that the comparison with the agility of a mouse is merciless, and strongly reflects on the goodness of the gameplay.
