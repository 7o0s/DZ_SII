{"name": "Ritorno a Rapture", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125527-bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea-episode-1-ritorno-a-rapture.html", "text": "The first part of Burial at Sea begins in a smoky office with a pretty girl who asks for the help of a private investigator to find a lost little girl. A classic noir opening, complete with soft lights and accompanying cigarettes, even if there is nothing classic under the skin. In fact, she is Elizabeth and he, the investigator, is Booker and together they have guided us from flying island to flying island to discover the city of Columbia. The two, however, do not know each other and even if Booker, for a moment, has the impression of remembering something, it is clear that these are not the same characters we met in Bioshock Infinite. An unsettling truth that becomes even more evident when the office door opens and we find ourselves in front of an immense window overlooking the ocean. We are in Rapture, the utopian oceanic metropolis, but not the one destroyed and about to collapse of the first two Bioshocks, but the one of the flyers, still vital, crowded with people and illuminated by thousands of lights. An underwater city created by mixing Jules Verne's steampunk with noir tones and dystopian science fiction, a place where progress pursues utopia regardless of the cracks of madness that already make their way along the large windows overlooking the ocean depths. But in Burial at Sea's Rapture the illusion still holds and the paradoxes of the run-up to the future have not yet transformed progress into a monster. The big brothers are still in operation, however inherently disturbing given their size and equipment, and even the little sisters are still children walking down the street. Sure, they wear masks and are framed as marines, but there's still no sign of glassy eyes and demonic voices. Yet, somewhere, the Rapture of the alternate future, the dark one populated by monsters and humans deprived of reason, already exists. And it awaits us. The first part of Bioshock Infinite: Burial at Sea is really short but it is also powerful and suggestive A jump into the past In the first part of Burial at Sea we are confronted with both souls of Rapture. The futuristic and vital one, quite exciting to visit firsthand, and the dark one, made of madness, rubble and adrift experiments that have produced unimaginable horrors. The first of the two characterizes the first part of the DLC, a long introduction marked almost exclusively by narrative-type mechanics. We can collect the objects we find and we are even given the possibility to choose the order of the places to visit to find an object useful for the investigation, but the actual action is sacrificed in favor of exploration and story. Elements that also remain in the second part of Burial at Sea, set in an area of Rapture already transfigured by degradation, even if in this case the classic gameplay of the series returns predominant which asks us to find particular powers to overcome otherwise insurmountable obstacles while sending us meeting waves of crazed humans, turrets and big brothers to face using stealth, elemental plasmids, mental powers and Elizabeth's particular plasmid with which she is able to alter space-time to summon useful objects. At the base, therefore, the gameplay is that of Bioshock Infinite and the formula made up of vintage plasmids, explosions, powers and machine guns is undoubtedly fun even if it has not escaped the criticisms of those who would have liked a few more changes with the third chapter of the series. A lack of innovation that in the basic title is overshadowed by the visual richness and evocative imagery but which for this reason becomes even more evident when the wonder effect fades. Well, we will hardly see such criticisms in the case of Burial at Sea. Almost in direct response to the complaints, in fact, Levine and his cohorts have churned out an extremely intense and equally short expansion that slips through your fingers in a couple of hours at most. The gameplay, excluding some refinements and a decidedly powerful microwave beam, is practically unchanged, but dialogues and fights follow one another at a fast pace and it's really difficult to get bored even getting lost behind the secrets hidden in the DLC's Rapture. Small but mighty Overall size-wise, Burial at Sea is modest and doesn't offer the awe-inspiring visuals of Bioshock Infinite. But it is still a top-level product with profusion of details, disturbing details, absurd statues, automatons of all kinds, mechanical turrets and suggestive panoramas, all created with a care and visual coherence capable of giving the graphics sector an edge. The characters, as in Bioshock Infinite, are well characterized and sonor rather expressive although they are not endowed with memorable facial mobility. But the excellent dialogues, unfortunately this time only in English, and the cartoon-style look help turn a blind eye to the small limitation of a title that is decidedly robust from an aesthetic point of view. Finding yourself in a vital, shimmering Rapture made even more sumptuous by the Bioshock Infinite engine can arouse strong emotions in fans of the Irrational series who in the first two chapters of the series were treated as born in a post-nuclear world, raised with the promises of a Rapture whose magnificence has remained only in the form of a powerful and terrible decay. The one in which we find ourselves in the DLC is not exactly the same city but it comes close enough and the ~new~ Rapture has the advantage of being able to enjoy the novelties of Bioshock Infinite also on the gameplay front. Novelties that include the Skyhook, useful for climbing and traveling at great speed along suspended tracks, and the Elizabeth plasmid that can create non-existent objects by evoking them from an alternate reality allowing us, through our ally, to generate turrets in predetermined positions, automata from allied combat and medipack crates. These are not elements that distort the gameplay but this is rich enough to support the two hours of gameplay, up to the final twist. Summing up Bioshock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 1 is a short, expensive DLC and, excluding more or less obvious refinements, it does not present significant novelties on the gameplay front. Yet it is highly recommended to all fans of the series not only because it brings to life the virtual memories of millions of fans but also because it maintains the narrative power of Bioshock Infinite. And the latter is an element that transcends any consideration of the gameplay and which also leads to consider the price in a different light. Unfortunately this is still high but if nothing else the season pass, sold for  19.99, allows you to save a lot and is almost an obligatory choice given that the second DLC planned for Bioshock Infinite will be the second part of Burial at Sea.", "date": "2013-11-15", "grade": null}
