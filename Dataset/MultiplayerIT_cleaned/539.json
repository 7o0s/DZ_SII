{"name": "Tales of Phantasia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tales-of-phantasia_a.html", "text": "If there is evil in this world, it lurks in the hearts of man. Cress Albein and Chester Barklight are two young inhabitants of the small village of Euclid. Returning from a hunting trip, the two find their village completely destroyed and their families exterminated: before dying, Cress's mother reveals to him that whoever carried out the massacre was looking for the pendant that had been given to him by his father time before. That, in fact, is the answer to the riddle: although determined to exact revenge, Cress and Chester will face an incredibly more dangerous threat. After saving a sweet priestess, Mint Adnade, Cress will inevitably end up meeting the true responsible for the horrors and wars that are affecting his world: the pendant that belonged to his parents is actually one of the seals that imprison a supernatural entity , Dhaos, who has been the cause of innumerable misfortunes in the past. To defeat it, Cress and Mint will embark on the most unpredictable of adventures: they will have to travel through time, between the past and the future, to prevent Dhaos from threatening the world and, at the same time, to find a way to bring it down. Thus begins an odyssey that will involve various heroes and opponents: Cress and Mint will soon be joined by Claus F. Lester, a conjurer of elemental spirits, and the bizarre elf witch Arche Klein. A race through time, and against time, to discover the secrets of Dhaos, the arcane Yggdrasil and their magical world... 1996-2006: ten years and not hearing them Right from the start, Phantasia reveals its belonging to an almost forgotten world, when the plots of JRPGs, however complex, unraveled through synthetic dialogues that were often even a little naive, but able to keep the player's interest alive. The long-awaited adaptation of Phantasia turns out to be a bit odd, especially giving the protagonist Cress a gab that hardly fits the epic nature of his adventure and his fearless character. The text is always and in any case enjoyable, and has the merit of not particularly slowing down the adventure with the kilometric and often too rhetorical scripts seen in much more recent RPGs. A key feature of the Tales has always been the quality of the travel companions of the player himself: Phantasia, progenitor of the series, gives us some of the most beautiful and charismatic heroes ever. But it is not only the narrative system that makes Phantasia strong ten years after its birth: the play structure, although traditionally clinging to the mix of exploration and action, between world-maps, cities and dungeons, is still more lively today that never. The main-quest flows naturally, in a not particularly linear way, disseminating the clues that the player must grasp in order to understand how to proceed towards the next dungeon to face, together with its monsters and puzzles: the latter, even if simple, turn out to be always coherent, ingenious and not very repetitive. Whether it's moving boulders to block gas emissions, or positioning mirrors to reflect a beam of light in the best way, the puzzle component in Phantasia's dungeons is a pleasant and never frustrating obstacle. Exploration, even when solving the various puzzles, is unfortunately undermined by a rather excessive frequency of random fights. These present, inevitably, the original play system born with Phantasia in 1996 and since then reworked in all the Tales, and which has inspired dozens of video games of the genre subsequently produced: the Linear Action Battle System. Tales of Phantasia, progenitor of the series, gives us some of the most beautiful and charismatic heroes ever. 1996-2006: ten years and not hearing them The clashes take place on a single axis, with the four party members seen in profile, ready to fight the various enemies: the action is in real time, the player has direct control over Cress, while a discreet AI manages the others personages. It is possible to indicate to everyone a certain strategy to follow, for example preventing magicians from using too many spells to conserve their Technical Points, or suggesting to Mint to heal only in case of need. Cress, on the other hand, is able to wield any weapon to launch special attacks of various types: the player can customize the commands so that he can carry out an attack by pressing a simple combination of keys. The good amount of skills automatically available as the level progresses is further increased by the spells and secret abilities that can be learned through side-quests, furthermore, guaranteeing an excellent variety in the fights which, however, have some shortcomings due to the GBA hardware: the clashes in fact they are not particularly fluid and it takes some time toget used to a speed that does not adapt well to a fast-paced game system like the one proposed. Having overcome the obstacle of Claus's summons, which paralyze the fight during the animation, which is not easy to get used to, and having become familiar with the various shortcuts positioned on the same keys that allow you to change target, you finally begin to appreciate the battle- system, not without flaws but certainly more fun than the classic turn-based battles that characterize the majority of video games of this type. The most recent elements introduced in the various incarnations of LABS are missing, such as the combined attacks, but on the other hand Namco has actually converted for GBA not the original Phantasia for SNES, but the remake for PSOne: this translates into the presence of a greater number of optional side-quests, as well as the possibility of cooking healing dishes by learning recipes around the world and, above all, of recruiting an unprecedented party member, the little ninja Suzu Fujibayashi. Time transformations Tales of Phantasia is a product of 1996, let's remember, and then it literally shocked the market by presenting itself as an immense SNES cartridge with features that had practically never been seen before: not only a very high graphic quality, but also a stratospheric audio sector, full of vocalizations. In the PSX conversion these elements had been further improved thanks to the optical support, with the inclusion of numerous cartoon sequences and a three-dimensional world map. On Game Boy Advance, a step backwards was necessarily made: the 3D world-map is once again processed with mode-7, and the animated sequences have obviously disappeared. The numerous pieces of music have been kept, always beautiful and suitable for the various game sequences, but the terrible speaker of the GBA does not do them full justice, as he does not do it to the digitized speech: the name of each spell or ability is exclaimed by the characters at its use, but the lack of sharpness makes the final effect a little ridiculous. If we have talked about the discrete fluidity in battle, it must be said that their spectacularity remains unchanged: the sprites of the characters are large and very colorful (while maintaining the classic super-deformed rendering), with the graphics of weapons and shields that change according to the equipped items, and the amount of opponents to face is also huge. The various spells and abilities do not fully exploit the potential of the hardware to fill the screen with bright colors, as Golden Sun did, but it must also be remembered that time travel is not only narrative. The GBA toy library has certainly not been stingy with RPGs in English or Italian: the various Golden Sun, Breath of Fire, Megaman Battle Network, Riviera, Pokmon and Fire Emblem have entertained us in these long years in which the GBA has dominated the videogame sector portable. Tales of Phantasia arrives late: the port released in Japan at the dawn of the GBA era has been very successful, but we are still talking about a title from ten years ago. The strong point of Phantasia is always to be always fresh, fun, huge. The captivating story and the splendid characters are the impetus to progress in a game where the fun battle-system requires the player to get used to the action a little less frenetic than it should be. Fans of the genre, who have not played the previous incarnations of Phantasia, cannot miss a real pearl of the Japanese Role Playing Game; all the others should at the very least experience a ten-year experience that even today has something to teach those who clone and copy right and left without being able to give a real identity to their own products. Pros A milestone of RPGs, finally understandable Exciting story and splendid characters Varied and fun battle system Cons Graphically an already excellent work could have been improved The splendid soundtrack is not gratified by the bad speaker Frenzy and reduced speed of the fights Role Playing Games enthusiasts, stop holding your breath: yes, it's true, Tales of Phantasia has been localized in the American and European versions. Ten years have passed since the release of this milestone of the genre on the SNES, several winters also since the distribution of the remake for PSOne, but finally Namco, thanks to the sales results of Tales of Symphonia, has decided to translate into a more understandable one of his absolute masterpieces. Tales of Phantasia is the progenitor of the noble Tales series, which has been going crazy on all consoles for years: SNES, Game Boy, PSOne, PS2, Gamecube, Game Boy Advance, PSP ... even for DS a nnew episode, while the saga enjoys ever renewed esteem, especially in Japan, thanks to the animated series, manga and various gadgets inspired by the various stories and characters that have given life to these fantastic universes. But if fans of the genre will be delighted by the possibility of playing and above all understanding a title that has really made the history of RPGs, will the gamers of the new generation be able to adapt to the more ancient elements that characterize a playful experience that is no longer completely original?", "date": "2006-04-18", "grade": null}
