{"name": "Resident Evil 5 Versus - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-5-versus-recensione.html", "text": "1.86 MB (even less for the PlayStation 3 version) represents the scandal stone of the first Resident Evil add-on, for a Capcom used in the past to bestow its users with a plethora of unlockable add-ons, and which now seems to have bowed to the laws of the market, with an expansion, oriented to online gaming, which aroused the wrath of gamers for not having been added directly within the title, but made available after about a month for the sum of 400 Microsoft Points, almost 5 euros. In reality, the small size of this update is easily explained, Versus proposes the mode called Mercenaries in a competitive key and with small changes, which becomes available once the main campaign has been completed. In this sense, the maps are exactly the same eight (Assembly, The Mines, Village, Ancient Ruins, Laboratories, Missile Area, Ship Bridge, Prison), the game options are called Assassins and Survivors, which can be faced single-player (up to four players ) or teams of two. In the first, the aim is to earn points by killing the highest possible number of infected enemies controlled by artificial intelligence, trying to ring in combos that allow you to dramatically increase your score. Obviously the other human players present in the game will also do the same trying to rage towards the others, who will lose precious points if eliminated. In Survivors mode, on the other hand, the enemies do not give any score, but they are still ready to catch you from behind if you are too distracted by the clashes against the other players, given that the main purpose is precisely to eliminate them as many times as possible to increase the score. The prizes for victory materialize in some points, identical to those obtained during the game campaign, which can be spent in the ~Extras~ section, for example to unlock all ten characters present in Versus itself, obviously taken borrowed from story mode. In fact, it starts with Chris and Sheva, with the first in possession of the classic pistol and sawn-off shotgun, while the second has a machine gun, up to then unlocking more diversified accessories and weapons. But how to play? We can define this sort of multiplayer as ~old times~, by virtue of the options present and its well-known control system, where it is not possible to shoot and move at the same time. So goodbye to lateral movements or running fights, welcome to situations in which you are face to face (not to say 20 cm away) against an opponent in a fight with shotgun or pistol shots, to decree the fastest with the trigger or the one with the most rounds in the barrel, except for interruptions by enemies who roam around them. The other strategy is instead that of the ~hit and run~, that is to find the character, throw some bombs at him or take the opportunity to hit him while he is engaged in another firefight, and then flee like hell throughout the map in order to recharge and find some medical herbs. The maps themselves, which represent extracts from the single-player game, contain some barrels and chests that allow you to acquire new weapons rather than bombs of various kinds, give you the possibility to move on several levels and are quite easy to memorize, almost always giving ways of escape in all directions. The result is therefore rather amusing and atypical (which is a good thing these days), hilarious in some points for the situations mentioned above, a pity however that the incentives are few, and that the whole component is reduced to the bone as depth and customization, lacking for example the possibility of modifying basic parameters such as game time rather than matchmaking or the presence or absence of the map, not to mention that at the end of each game you return to the main menu without the possibility of being able to directly play another game. Dulcis in fundo, there is no penalty for disconnection, and more than once it happened that our opponent disconnected with a few seconds left while we were ahead, resulting in a final irritation. Comment Resident Evil 5: Versus, beyond the criticisms that we can address to Capcom for how it has been proposed to users, takes a single mode and throws it into a multiplayer key, taking advantage of its salient features. Of course, from an absolute perspective, 5 euros for this expansion can be faced by those who have appreciated the title, but they must be added to those of a game which, by its setting, is much more valid in the single or cooperative campaign and which now timidly puts the musor towards a competitive multiplayer, interesting and atypical in some ways, but largely incomplete and shallow. Pros Fun in the short term Good maps Against Shallow gameplay Bare-bone options Xbox 360 - Goals Resident Evil 5 offers the classic 200 additional points for an expansion, some easily achievable such as 40,000 points in Survivors mode, others a little more demanding such as 30 victories in Assassins. However, with a few hours of play it should be possible to unlock them all.", "date": "2009-04-21", "grade": null}
