The graphic style is the first thing that catches the eye. The heroes and monsters, as well as the dungeon tiles, look like they were drawn in pencil. Although it is a choice in line with the clear and simple structure of the game, some may turn up their noses. In fact, the adventurers all look like children, and even with the equipment on it is difficult to see them as heroes or heroines with whom to identify. On the other hand, the game lets us know right away that our job is to manage and grow a guild of nerd adventurers. We therefore alternate between two screens, that of the guild and that of the world map, from which we can enter the various dungeons. To begin a mission, simply choose a class from those unlocked. Once down underground we have to reach the goal set for that particular level. In some cases it is necessary to kill a certain number of enemies, in others a particular type, other times we have to bring home treasure chests. In some levels a final boss is chasing us and we have a limited number of turns before he finds us and the fight begins. However, if you think it's good to rush to the target immediately, then be prepared to have a guild graveyard full of tombstones (which will happen anyway, since death is permanent). In fact, each adventurer begins the mission from the first level, regardless of the progress made in previous missions. Before reaching any goal we must therefore make it grow and equip it with the best equipment. And this is where the game mechanics shine. Each turn we are dealt a hand of cards, which may contain treasure, enemies or dungeon tiles. Our strategy is to place tiles and enemies in such a way as to pilot the adventurer's artificial intelligence as safely as possible. For example, we can place a treasure together with a monster to convince him to face the one instead of a more powerful one he was aiming for. The fact that you can take your time (when possible) before attacking the boss or objectives of the level is very pleasant and relaxing. However, there is one fact to keep in mind. The developers, very wisely, have excluded any form of grinding. Killing an enemy of our level makes us advance to the next level, and so on up to the maximum level allowed by the dungeon. Reached the limit, we can only fight enemies of that level to get better items. You may have understood where we are going: we are never safe during battles, because lower-level enemies offer now useless loot, while those of our level can always fool us if we are not careful. Truly a devilish little game, this Guild of Dungeoneering. When taken in small doses, Guild of Dungeoneering is like a game of cards: it's always fun My deck is bigger than yours We said that the clashes are important to get new equipment. When we kill an enemy, the game lets us choose one of three randomly drawn equipment cards. Each equipment card in turn consists of a certain number of cards that are added to our attack deck, the one from which we draw during battles. The better the equipment, the better the cards with which we can fight, even if it is often difficult to choose between weapons and armor of the same level. Will we need more defensive cards? Or is a card that damages the opponent over time better? Magical or melee attacks? Lots of questions to answer that increase the strategic depth of the game. In fact, one mistake is enough and the fight is lost, the hero dead and the level ended in defeat. The best thing is to evaluate the specific skills of the class we are playing as and the level objective, keeping in mind that the strongest cards are not always the most effective. During fights both we and our opponent play a card and, unless there are special effects, the damage is inflicted on both at the same time. However, each enemy is a separate case. To give some examples, the bandit is weaker if stuck in a dead end, the skeleton suffers double damage if we inflict a certain number of them all at once, while the fire elemental burns the playbox inflicting damage per shift. As we said, many variables and very little room for errors. At the end of the day, however, the goal is always the same: bring home some gold. If we die, the loot that reaches the coffers of the gilda is only a small percentage of what is collected, while if we solve the level, all the stolen gold increases our reserve. Unfortunately, it is not possible to play the same level over and over again. No grinding, remember? Once back home we can spend the accumulated gold to unlock new classes or evolve those already bought, improve the type of equipment found in the dungeons or buy other types of bonuses. Each improvement appears on the guild screen in the form of a tile to be placed next to those already present as we like. The guild is ours, after all. To surround the whole there is a hilarious Irish voice that comments on the passages between the death of one boss and another and delights in ironic ballads about our unfortunate heroes. The music of the levels is pleasant, even if it becomes repetitive in the long run. We can't say that we've ever grown fond of any of the adventurers, partly because they die very easily, partly because all progress is lost at the end of a level. On the other hand, the mix of strategy and cards works very well. However, we have noticed that, despite the excellent balance, occasionally bad luck plays a key role, perhaps frustrating an hour of careful planning. Let's also assume that there are no great incentives to continue and the dungeons all look a bit alike and we have a crystalline game in the dynamics which, however, does not hold up for long game sessions. On the other hand, if we launch it from time to time for a short raid, just long enough to see whether or not we can beat the boss that has been making us suffer for some time, then Guild of Dungeoneering is worth the time spent and the (little) money what does it cost.", "date": "2015-07-22", "grade": "7.7"}
