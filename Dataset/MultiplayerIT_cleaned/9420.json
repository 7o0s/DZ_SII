{"name": "Fight Night Champion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/86289-fight-night-champion-locchio-della-tigre.html", "text": "Born in 2004, the Fight Night franchise represents EA Sports' attempt to revive boxing simulations in the video game market after the cancellation of the Knockout Kings series. The fifth episode of the series, Fight Night Champion, sees the presence of something like fifty real-life boxers and a very thick story mode, in which we play the role of Andre Bishop, a boxer who is behind bars and through flashbacks he relives his moments of glory, until he can't get the chance to redeem himself. The iPhone and iPod Touch version of the game clearly saw cuts compared to what was available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and so the total number of boxers dropped to twenty and the story mode became a sort of ~scenario mode~ in which we can impersonate a famous boxer and follow his fighting career in combat. Unfortunately, online multiplayer is also missing, which would have actually enriched the experience, especially from the point of view of longevity. Despite those defections, however, Fight Night Champion's cut boasts enough numbers and depth to annihilate the competition on the App Store. The whole world can change! There are three modes that the game offers: ~Fight Now~, ~Story~ and ~Multiplayer~. The first is the classic ~quick game~ with random values: we choose a boxer and we face another, ideal if you have a few minutes available or want to quickly try out the gameplay. Multiplayer, as mentioned above, is not available online but only locally, so to access it you need to have another Apple device nearby with a copy of the game. Finally, the ~History~ constitutes the fulcrum of EA's production, and can be played in two different ways: ~Recreate legend~ or ~Create new career~. In the first case we will find ourselves dealing with a sort of ~scenario mode~ in which we can choose one of the twenty boxers present (among the most famous in the world, belonging to all eras) and relive his career a meeting after another. In the second case, however, we'll have to create our boxer from scratch using a simple but complete editor, then start fighting to make him quickly earn fame and money. In any case, the same rules apply: the fight can have different duration and characteristics, and in the same way it is possible to choose from a certain number of views the one that best suits our personal vision of the match, but beyond this we will be alone against our opponent, and within a few rounds we will have the task of proving that we are the strongest. The control system of Fight Night Champion uses the iPhone and iPod Touch input devices in the most complete way possible: the accelerometer detects the inclination and consequently moves the boxer on the square, while the touch screen translates our gestures into action : a touch in the four areas of the screen to throw directly at the face or body, a horizontal slide to execute a hook, vertical for an uppercut, oblique for a feint with a hook to the body. By keeping both thumbs on the touch screen, it is possible to assume a defensive position, and drag them to the side for our character to perform rapid lateral swerves. In short, the repertoire of moves appears more complete than ever, and guarantees the fights a thickness and a strategy that is rarely possible to find in a mobile game. The use of the three on-screen indicators (health, energy and damage) also proves to be very clever and realistic, with the boxer being out of breath when low on energy or close to knocking out when health is low and the high damage. At the end of each round, it is possible to spend the points earned to restore these indicators, at least in part, and have a better chance of achieving victory. The downside is the response to the commands, not always punctual, as well as the overwhelming amount of maneuvers that can be performed, which especially at the beginning pushes us to attack head-on, focusing on only two or three movements. Finally, little to say about the technical realization: graphics and sound are excellent, the characters boast excellent quality polygonal models (even the models who parade at the end of each round!) and the presence of numerous replays makes some sequences truly spectacular.
