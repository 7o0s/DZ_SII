The background of this new edition sees the colonization attempt of the few land areas of our planet that remain habitable by some corporations, which actually aim much higher: space. The goal is ambitious, but to reach it the isotope Helium-3 is needed, which is found in large quantities only on the Moon. From this canvas, the developers have generated a single player campaign in which the player must alternate management and conquest to try to conquer the space before his opponents. Is it worth it? We have reviewed Anno 2205, the new title of the historical series of strategic games The management stage The single player campaign, for now the only mode present, is divided into two clear and distinct phases: the management phase and the RTS phase. The management phase requires doing more or less what has always been done in the series: building houses and economic activities with the intention of creating ever larger and more active agglomerations, which exploit the resources of the territory and generate wealth. Construction doesn't proceed blindly, because a system of objectives always makes us quite clear what to do. Is there a need for manpower? Then you have to build houses. Is there a job request? Then it is necessary to found more businesses, perhaps choosing those that produce goods of which there is a shortage. Lack of energy? We choose the way to produce some from the appropriate menu and the game is done. The novelty compared to the other editions of the game is the possibility of managing multiple cities at the same time on different maps (three maps for three types of scenario: temperate, arctic and lunar), with each map designed to vary the things to do. When multiple maps are active, it becomes very important to trade resources in order to allow constant growth of the entire newborn federation. As you progress, you will unlock upgrades for buildings, which can be improved without having to revise their location or function. So far everything seems great, but it's when put under stress that Anno 2205 reveals his dual nature and gets a bit lost along the way. On the one hand it recalls the stylistic features of the series, but on the other it reveals some considerable structural limits. For example, the expandability of the federation on multiple maps has forced a net simplification in resource management, with citizens who have never lost a certain level of productivity and happiness and businesses that have become much more agile to manage, but also less specific. The reason for this choice is clear: having to go back and forth between multiple maps, the complications would be counterproductive for the gameplay. However, it is certain that in this way there is no incentive to review certain aspects of the cities and we end up acting only when the game directly requests it, giving us new objectives to achieve. It is true that there is the possibility of siding with this or that faction by carrying out its quests, but do not expect major gameplay upheavals. Anno 2205's single player campaign is linear. Indeed, very linear. The RTS phase As we said, the game also includes an RTS phase. These are naval combat missions that take place on the same maps as the strategic phase, in which you have to lead a fleet to conquer some objectives, such as destroying some enemy units or forcing a naval blockade and so on. The controls are typical of real-time strategy and give the possibility to select one or more units in a practical and fast way to then send them into combat. Each unit has its own attack and defense characteristics, which can be upgraded throughout the game, and performs better against certain enemies. However, in addition to the standard arsenal, it is also possible to use special techniques that help a lot in the most difficult situations. For example, a very powerful satellite attack can be used, or, to give another example, emergency bots can be activated to repair the damaged hulls of our units. The typical progression of this phase is very linear. Usually it is required to beat the map inch by inch by destroying the destructible. The only ones to break the action are the characters who, if reached and questioned, can give us side missions, but in general we never go very far from what is described. With the increased difficulty of the fights, which can be experienced in the advanced maps, the same does not change much: you just have to proceed with greater caution. In short, the RTS phase has somewhat the same problem as the rest of the game: the first impression is excellent, but whenor if its limits are discovered, enthusiasm is reduced and as the campaign proceeds it becomes coldness. Another major problem is that there isn't much communication between the RTS section and the management section. In what sense? Well, the troops you use in battle are fixed and you can't produce them in cities. Since there is not even a real simulation of the conflict between the factions, whose relationships are managed through quests, graphics and dialogues and do not manifest themselves on the maps, where the opponents have no cities or other infrastructures, the RTS missions become an end in themselves . Nice but empty? Compared to the other chapters of the series, Anno 2205 stands out for some shortcomings. When we said that the only playable mode is the single player campaign we weren't exaggerating: it really is. In short, the alternative modes that usually lengthen the duration of such titles dramatically, such as the random generation of maps or the skirmish, are completely missing. There are not even multiplayer modes to act as a side dish. In total, therefore, we have the aforementioned three scenarios with three fixed maps each on which to develop one's own corporation and that's it. A little bit, given that you get to see everything there is to see in a handful of hours, where this genre usually offers a very high longevity. On the other hand, Anno 2205 excels from a technical point of view, in relation to the genre of strategic / management. Selecting Ultra detail, which didn't feel very smooth on the test system, we experienced lush, detailed scenery surrounded by a clean, realistic sea, and filled with buildings full of life and light. Watching a city at the highest level of development is a pleasure and if the variety had also been worked on it would have been even more so. For those worried about performance, let's say that Anno 2205 remains beautiful to look at even by lowering the detail by one or two midpoints. In short, at least from this point of view, the Blue-Byte title excels and stands out over the competition, for example proposing splendid explosions in the RTS phase (the orbital attack is selected even if only to see the effect it has). Too bad about the penalties in the strategic phase.", "date": "2015-11-13", "grade": "7.0"}
