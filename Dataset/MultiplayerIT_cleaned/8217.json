Clearly we are talking about the acquisition of LucasFilm by The Walt Disney Company and the consequent announcement of a new Star Wars trilogy whose first feature film, Episode 7, will arrive in 2015. It is a bolt from the blue that predictably split the Lucasian fandom, but which in reality does nothing but resume and highlight a debate that has been carried out for some time in cinema and video games, in relation to squeezing or resurrecting successful franchises. It's certainly a long way from having the cultural value or fame of Lucas's Galaxy Far, Far Away, but Spy Hunter is one of those cult favorites awakened from beyond the grave in hopes of a new epiphany. After the regrettable attempt to revive the brand in the past generation of consoles, Warner Bros. and TT Fusion want to pay homage to the thirtieth anniversary of Spy Hunter with a new title for portable consoles that mixes driving and reckless action. The result, unfortunately, is a new spin off the road. Spies at the wheel A real reboot of the 1983 game, Spy Hunter for Vita and 3DS is an action game at the wheel of a car armed up to the neck, in a potentially winning mix between Supercar and 007. The story is studded with some typical elements of the espionage genre, starting with the protagonist, a secret agent who through a series of missions must investigate a possible mole within his own company, while soon finding himself entangled in the usual anti-government plot. The only weapon available to the spy is the Interceptor, a four-wheeled prototype capable of transforming when necessary to travel both on water and on dirt roads. It doesn't take long before the stereotypical super-enemy decides to unleash his army of explosive cars, armored trucks and helicopters in pursuit of the player, in an attempt to stop his advance once and for all. Brief dialogues with other team members have been inserted before and during each level, but any attempt to create an interesting thread throughout the campaign is useless. In general, each mission boils down to a fast and reckless race along a route with a few insignificant alternative routes, in order to reach an objective while trying to survive the constant ambushes of enemies, between bombs planted on the asphalt, vans equipped with flamethrowers and small self-driving kamikazes. The Intereptor also has a respectable array of paraphernalia at its disposal, with new weapons that can be unlocked and upgraded by completing the missions: ranging from a simple machine gun to a Shocker that launches electric shocks at the sides of the car, from rear mines to guided missiles. The need to have to choose four weapons to carry around and to assign to the console's front keys initially suggests a minimum of tactical depth useful for taking advantage of this or that level, but in the vast majority of cases each weapon is as good as the other, and so we end up choosing the four with which we have the most fun. Generally the level of difficulty is never too high, but what makes the game frustrating in some points is the unfortunate combination of too long courses and a bad checkpoint system: in case the Interceptor were to be destroyed, the player would be forced starting over from the last gun-truck, often placed at the beginning of the level; no problem, except that a large part of the defeats depend on controls that are anything but precise, both as regards the driveability of the car and for the use of weapons, not to mention the evident and annoying elastic effect that the enemies to be extremely faster when the player is in front of them. It's a real shame, because even in its superficiality and with its thousand problems, Spy Hunter has its moments, almost managing to exalt after eliminating three enemies in a row and avoiding a series of mines by jumping up an improvised ramp. In closing, it must be emphasized that, while saving us frame drops, graphically the game is only mediocre and absolutely does not exploit the enormous hardware potential of Vita, while a discreet soundtrack is partially raised by the historical theme of Peter Gunn.", "date": "2012-10-31", "grade": "5.0"}
