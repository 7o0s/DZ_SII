Built on the skilful narrative interweaving that underlies the plot, the game presents itself as an immense tribute to the fantasy imagery that has always inspired the world of video games. In the remote past, the world of Eo experienced a period of peace and justice under the guidance of the 13 Wizards of the Circle; protected by the words of an ancient prophecy they were supposed to reign over the planet for 500 years, until the moment in which only one of them could rule over all the others. But the thirst for power brought hate and destruction before the time was up. The world fell under the weight of a magical war of immense proportions, which reduced the world to ashes. From the ruins of a dying civilization the sole surviving mage of the Circle, Rohen, set out to restore balance to the world by summoning the mystical powers of the Runestone. Hence the beginning of our story. Magic and brute force The player takes his first steps in the world of Spellforce going through an initial ~setting~ phase with a clear RPG orientation. The first thing to do, in fact, is to create the character that will represent us within the game. Our alter ego will have a personalized appearance and a series of characteristics that will make it unique, starting from the ~class~ which may have an orientation devoted to magic or combat with weapons. The first plays a fundamental role in the world of Eo, and there are four types, all different from each other but equally fearsome. White magic, which includes three branches: Life magic, capable of regenerating wounds and protecting with beneficial auras, Nature magic, capable of influencing the natural order and its creatures, and Blessing magic, which includes protection spells and strengthening the defenses of the characters. Our alter ego will have a personalized appearance and a series of characteristics that will make it unique, starting from the ~class~ which may have an orientation devoted to magic or combat with weapons Magic and brute force Black magic is divided into Death, the bearer of serious wounds and destruction, Necromancy, capable of manipulating the effects of death, and Curse, to weaken the spirit and body of the opponents. Elemental magic can manipulate the power of Ice, Fire, or Earth at the mage's disposal. Finally, Mental magic, divided into Enchantment, Offense and Defense, skipping the physical plane, can penetrate the spirit of the adversaries by subjecting them to their own purposes. If magic can play an absolutely important role in a world dominated by the power of Mana, the same goes for the combative arts which favor the brutal use of conventional weapons. Eo's training schools have produced different fighting styles capable of enhancing the effectiveness of individual types of weapons, whether they are defensive or offensive. The three main Arts of War (light, heavy and ranged combat) open the perspective of choice to 10 different subclasses, giving the possibility to hone one's combat skills using the weapon of choice. Having carefully chosen the specialization of our character and distributed the scores among the available characteristics, our alter ego will be ready to immerse himself in the world of Spellforce and get to know the vast range of races that populate the lands of Eo. Genre orgy The game interface immediately brings to mind the two souls that make up the game's basic structure. On the one hand, in fact, the typical commands of the classic RTS are evident, the map of the game stage and the icons of the controlled characters; on the other hand it is possible to access the characteristics of the character and the inventory which contains a lot of information, the book of spells, the contents of the hero's backpack and the equipment. In fact, there are moments in which the player is led to follow the narrative flow of the game by stepping into the shoes of the protagonist and playing as a classic RPG would be played [...] in other moments instead the game immediately switches to the RTS aspect Wandering around the map, you can easily switch between third-person and top-down views. By using both modes, in a few minutes you get in tune with the main innovation of the game, starting to appreciate the coexistence of the two approaches to the game mechanism, perfectly merged into a single essence. In fact, there are moments in which the player is led to follow the narrative flow of the game by putting himself in the role of the protagonist and playingas a classic RPG would be played, facing enemies alone or in small parties, conversing with the characters scattered along the maps and completing quests and missions collected in an absolutely dynamic way. In other moments, however, the game immediately switches to the RTS aspect, changing its being but paradoxically remaining the same game. It's not a question of digressions, of ~jerks~ at the level of gameplay, but of a natural nuance of the game that continuously switches from the focused aspect of the RPG to the wide-ranging one of the RTS. Complicit in this is certainly the game interface, absolutely intuitive and simple. The protagonist always remains at the center of the scene. It is the only true core of the gameplay, whatever form it has taken. Genre orgy When the game foresees it, it is possible to interact with particular artifacts capable of generating production units in pure RTS style. To activate these artifacts, the presence of our hero is required, who at this point will be able to take control of the units he produces and establish his own command center. In Spellforce there are no factions, and the races present do not necessarily have to fight against each other. High Elves, Dark Elves, Orcs, Humans, Dwarves and Trolls represent the cauldron of peoples scattered across Eo. They can be controlled equally by the player, and all together if the case deems it appropriate. The focus of the game is the control of runic artifacts capable of summoning creatures. Each race is capable of producing nine different types of units, and as many types of buildings, each with its own characteristics and activation costs. Finally, each race can count on the intervention of a Titan protector: mythological creatures (Cyclops, Treant, Spiderbrood, Griffins, Iron Golem and Ragefire) capable of unleashing incredible power on enemies. To complete your objectives through the use of support races, it is necessary to immerse yourself in the most classic of RTS situations, complete with the collection of resources and the search for raw materials. High Elves, Dark Elves, Orcs, Humans, Dwarves and Trolls represent the cauldron of peoples scattered across Eo Genre orgy In fact, each population has units specialized in the collection of resources and in the construction and maintenance of buildings. Combat units, on the other hand, can enjoy the benefits of weapon and skill upgrades. Then there are a series of enemies common to each race, not controllable by the player, which populate the maps and which represent the greatest danger for units and heroes who decide to roam the map too lightly. The total bestiary reaches surprising proportions worthy of a top-level RPG title. Often these monsters possess artifacts and special items that are very useful for enriching the hero's crew. Every success in battle, then, brings an enormous benefit to the character, who can increase his power by ~leveling up~ as in any self-respecting RPG. The advancement of the character takes place even in its external appearance, which changes in an absolutely dynamic way according to the weapons and armor equipped by the latter. Breath of winter The Gold version provides an all-in-one package that merges the main title Spellforce: The order of Dawn with the Breath of Winter expansion. While not making essential changes to the gameplay model, this expansion gives the title a deeper dimension, enriching it with a large extension of the story, adding important tweaks to the control interface and adding to the ranks of enemies and heroes scattered on the field. Having been able to try the title in the full version we were able to appreciate its stability and admirable vastness. From a technical point of view, Spellforce can count on a versatile graphics engine capable of switching from panoramas to close-ups without sacrificing detail. While not counting on a pretentious engine, the final effect is pleasant and suitable for the purpose. Immersion in the world is also guaranteed by a good sound sector and really pleasant light effects. In addition to adding the ~Free Game~ mode disconnected from the narrative context, the expansion brings an adequate spin to the longevity of the game in campaign mode, pushing it to 120 hours of total play! Finally, the map customization editor concludes the book of offers, putting the bow on the package of a truly attractive total offer. The gaming experience can then flow into the inevitable multiplayer, through the servers hosted by Gamespy. The corner of the requirement The minimum requirements include a Pentium III 1 GHz with 256 Mb RAM and sche32 MB of 3D graphics, plus a total of 2.8 GB of hard disk space. The recommended configuration focuses on a mid-level machine clocked at 1.8 GHz, 512 MB RAM and a 64 MB graphics card. Tested on Athlon 64Bit 3500+, 2GB RAM, Geforce 6600GT. Final comment In conclusion, we cannot fail to admit the amazement felt in front of a game so vast and at the same time original in its simplicity. Fusing the two most popular schools of thought, RTS and RPG, Spellforce is the synthesis of fun and depth. It does not reach the highest mark only because it is a bit dated in the graphic aspect, but we are eagerly awaiting the release of the second chapter, which has already been under construction for some time. A must for anyone looking for a breath of fresh air without compromise. Pros I immediately like the idea of mixing genres Guaranteed longevity (up to 120 hours of gameplay) Wide range of choice for character specializations Cons Graphically not avant-garde Sometimes you switch to third-person view without wanting to The digital entertainment industry is a huge cauldron, an infernal machine, which has been continuously trying to renew itself in all its forms for decades. The videogame field, despite being the most recent appendage of this world, is more affected by the need to regenerate and renew itself more frequently. What has become the leitmotif of review rhetoric for years now is that video games are starting to suffer from a pathological lack of originality. If the eighties represented the dawn of a new era of entertainment and the nineties the golden age of gameplay, the threshold of the new millennium has fatally covered the role of watershed with the pioneering period to face the big industry and the million dollar productions. As always, it was the freshness of the productions that paid the price, immolated at the altar of commercial profit. Moral of the story nowadays investing on little traveled roads has become risky and it is less and less frequent to come across real revolutions. So what drives us to make these considerations on the occasion of the review of the Gold Edition of Spellforce? It is soon said. By picking up this title in the editorial office, we came to the conclusion that we had set aside one of those rare examples of that same originality that we are looking for on every shore. To better understand what we are trying to explain to you, it is advisable to approach the analysis of this product more carefully.", "date": "2006-02-15", "grade": null}
