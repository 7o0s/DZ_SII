{"name": "Dynasty Warriors: Fighter's Battle - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dynasty-warriors-fighters-battle-recensione.html", "text": "Once upon a time in China The story behind Dynasty Warriors is the same as always: different factions are fighting to conquer the regions of ancient China, the player will have to take sides and take part in the battle, defeating all the enemies that appear in front of them to conquer the final victory. In addition to not being able to find a new, as well as decent, pretext, the game structure of this chapter on DS does not change one iota compared to its predecessors. The main game mode is the one dedicated to the single player campaign, but before putting your feet on the battlefield you are introduced to the art of war (practice) from a short but comprehensive tutorial, which takes into consideration in the first part the game controls to move in the second to the victory conditions on the field. Each game chapter, relating to the campaign in one of the 11 regions present in the empire, is divided into two macro-phases, in which the player first tactically arranges his resources and secondly is catapulted directly onto the battlefield. The first phase, certainly the less 'active' of the two, is the moment in which the player chooses his 3 generals from a deck of cards (at the beginning decidedly limited and as the adventure progresses more and more complete). support in battle, or the three characters who will have the task of defending the intermediate outposts and the final base camp. The second phase, as previously announced, is the one dedicated to combat or to the moment in which the player and his opponent challenge each other on the field in an attempt to conquer the enemy base and continue the work of conquest. The playing field is represented on the DS lower screen as a map with a series of icons symbolizing the position (and situation) of one's outposts and those of the opponent. The aim of the player is to move around the map, first capturing enemy outposts and then going straight to the main camp to fight the general in charge of defending the camp. During the movements between the different areas, the player can strategically decide to collide directly with his opponent on the field and - resulting in victory - relegating him for a short period of time away from the battlefield. Each battle won corresponds to a conquered card for your deck of cards, so you can harness new and more powerful forces for the battles to follow. Spirits of war The battle phases follow the cornerstones of the series: within medium-sized environments, the player has the obligation to fight a certain number of opponents (indicated at the top right of the screen) to ensure that the doors that they lead to the next areas. In the case of settings that contain enemy outposts, the number of enemies to beat will also indicate the opening signal of the outpost door, leading the player to clash with the general on duty. Even the combat system remains totally unchanged: hordes of enemies attack the player at the same time who, endowed with incredible strength and a series of special moves, is able to stand up to dozens and dozens of opponents at once. The control system of your character allows the player to take advantage of two different types of weapon-based attacks, to use the classic 'Musou' move (a super special move capable of inflicting huge damage) and finally to use a sort of of elemental special move to further aid itself. This last type of attack can only be used after collecting the tokens/coins that appear after defeating enemies. Although quite valid on paper, the game experience suffers - first of all - from an excessive simplicity and flattening: the battles are similar to each other, there are no objectives that diversify the adventure and also the insertion of the cards to give a 'tactical' tone to the game, turns out to be a monotonous element in the long run since, with as many as 120 cards available, the player will often and willingly find himself playing always and only with the same 10/15. Spirits of war If from the point of view of the game structure, this Dynasty Warriors is almost completely comparable to its predecessors on other platforms, the aspect in which it is absolutely most deficient is the graphic one. The animations of the characters on the screen are sparse, with very few frames and above all not at all defined; the enemies are represented by elements that closely resemble simple splashes of color in tones ranging from gray to brown rather than human forms, the main and secondary characters although havingI give a large number of moves and attacks available, they seem to be always and in any case characterized in the same way, often making it even difficult to recognize them alone. The settings - likewise - are tiny and boringly monotonous, with dull and flat textures. The sound sector does not live on better luck, the music of the series has never been memorable and unfortunately these too make no difference, however the difference is made by the sound effects, decidedly below the sufficiency for a DS game. Comment This Dynasty Warriors for Ds has a big lack: it takes away the spectacularity of a product that now has nothing else left. Although supported by a good game structure, carried with good results on DS (the stylus is never used anyway and so -obviously- the touch screen), the graphic side and an excessive monotony affect the final result. Maybe it's time for KOEI to revisit the series or start developing new ideas. Pros Game structure in all respects similar to the home versions 120 cards relating to game characters Cons Totally inadequate graphics In the long run boring and monotonous It's always the same Dynasty Warriors Dynasty Warriors: Fighter's Battle DS is available for DS. The version used for this review is the DS version. In the world of video games there are a whole series of 'itinerant' games, those that have at least one incarnation in all the consoles currently on the market. One of the most striking examples is probably the one represented by the saga dedicated to the Dynasty Warriors, capable of fighting their wars for the dominance of the clan on all consoles that came after the birth of the very first chapter on psx. Since then, for KOEI, the road has been paved with more or less similar dynasties who have fought hard to obtain a minimum of visibility. And, once the round of home consoles is over, it's now the turn of the Nintendo DS to host the saga, with all its load of oriental atmospheres, swords, spears and saddled battle horses.", "date": "2007-09-14", "grade": null}
