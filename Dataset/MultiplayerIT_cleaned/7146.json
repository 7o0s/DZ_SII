Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. The protagonist of Swamp Attack is a bit the archetype of the American all guns and private property, with a hunter's cap and a tank top decidedly cinched at the waist, who sits in a rocking chair in front of his cottage in wood, waiting to feed a few buckshot to those who dare to enter his land. The point, however, is that here we are not talking about petty thieves or nuisances, but about monsters that come straight from a swamp teeming with creepy and threatening creatures. Crocodiles walking on two legs? There are. Giant mice armed with spingarda? There are those too. Giant tortoises capable of coming out of their shells to jump on us? They are not missing either. The bestiary put together by the developers of Moving Eye, designed with a cartoonish and pleasant style, while the action is underlined by nice country guitars, really includes everything and gets richer as we progress in the single player campaign, composed for the moment from fifty-four levels divided into three different settings, to which new missions will be added with the next updates. What can we do to stop the advance of the monsters? Simple: shoot everything we have at them. Swamp Attack is a simple but fun game, with lots of monsters and a considerable degree of challenge The touch that kills The idea behind Swamp Attack is very simple: on the left of the screen there is our house and the character who defends it, with an energy bar that drops when we start to suffer attacks, whether they are close or from distance; in the right area instead the march of the monsters starts, also regulated by a bar that makes us understand at what point we are in the wave. The enemies move from right to left, therefore, and to open fire with the equipped weapon and hit them we simply have to touch them. The peculiarity of the gameplay is that this action causes different results depending on various factors, including the distance and the precision of the touch, as well as the characteristics of our equipment. In addition to the service rifle, especially effective up close, we can in fact unlock a light machine gun or an assault rifle, a flamethrower or even a minigun, even if the freemium dynamics make some of the tools difficult to obtain where you don't want to spend real money . Furthermore, to eliminate the waves without the monsters getting too close to the house, it is vitally important to calculate the times well to allow our hero to reload, as well as use the gold coins earned with each victory to upgrade the arsenal in various ways: improve its effectiveness, increase the number of rounds in the barrel or, as already mentioned, unlock more powerful weapons. In addition to rifles and machine guns, some extra items will also come in handy, such as sticks of dynamite, Molotov cocktails and... refrigerators. The latter, lowered from above, have the ability to ~freeze~ the monsters for a few moments and allow us to target them in comfort. The progression of the experience, thanks to the ability to insert some variation on the theme from time to time (see the missions with the UFO), manages to keep the game fun and engaging, even if everything becomes quite challenging after about ten missions. The possibility of continuing the game to game over is linked to in-app purchases and every few attempts we have to wait for our ~energy~ to recharge, which represents a legitimate policy on the part of the developers but fortunately it does not affect the advantages of the product.", "date": "2014-05-03", "grade": "7.5"}
