Many developers therefore, rather than heating soups with the risk of failing sensationally on target, have preferred to adapt some traditional concepts to the peculiar characteristics of Apple devices, above all in relation to the lack of a physical control system: a path also followed by the creators of this Bean's Quest. Jump what passes you Made by the tiny Kumobius team, Bean's Quest is a title that doesn't get lost in too much talk. The story sees the protagonist Emilio forced to save his girlfriend after an evil sorcerer has kidnapped her and turned him into a Mexican bean, and is so ridiculous and useless for gameplay that it doesn't even deserve a mention before the credits head. In fact, the game simply opens with a main menu - objectively of rare ugliness - which allows you to deactivate music and sound effects, view the credits and start the adventure, where Bean's Quest proves its worth. The game is based on a simple foundation, that is the continuous bouncing of the character on the screen: the user must therefore bring him to the end of the stage by simply moving him to the right or to the left, acting on the two extremes of the touchscreen. As it is easy to imagine, such a basic structure must necessarily be based on a winning design, and in this respect the Kumobius product brings home a good result: the internships are well studied and, if we exclude the first interlocutors, it is the efforts made by the developers to create enjoyable scenarios for casual use but which could give a hard time to anyone who wanted to go a little deeper. In fact, each level of Bean's Quest has three distinct objectives to be achieved in order to be considered 100% complete, or collect all the gems, find a hidden object and complete the path with a number of jumps equal to or less than the established one. Being virtually impossible to do all this in a single session, the player is pushed to repeat the same stages several times in search of the perfect score, a pleasant practice anyway given the simple and fun gameplay of the title and the high challenge rate of some objectives (especially those related to rebounds). It's a pity, however, that the fun ends really too soon: the version we tested of Bean's Quest could count on the misery of eight scenarios, which will certainly be expanded with future free updates, but which in the current state of things lead the game to last from a minimum of 10 minutes to a maximum of two hours only if you aim to reach all the goals. In short, for 2.39 Euros it is little stuff compared to the average offer of the App Store. However, the Kumobius title makes up for it thanks to its delightful appearance that will surely conquer all those who grew up with 16-bit consoles: a colorful retro graphics and a captivating synth soundtrack are the icing on the cake of a commendable production, but excessively sparse in content.
