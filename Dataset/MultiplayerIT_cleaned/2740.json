However, it is also a way to browse the technical implications of such an ambitious conversion, made possible once again thanks to the talent and precision of the Panic Button developers, who by accepting the inevitable compromises have probably accomplished their feat more extraordinary. Gameplay However, let's start with the gameplay, which is the most characteristic feature of DOOM Eternal also on Nintendo Switch. Without paying too much attention to the story, which sees the DOOM Slayer facing demonic troops this time on planet Earth instead of Mars, and which is a mere expedient to give life to new, furious battles, we can say that the game is in perfect shape on the Japanese hybrid console. The transition to 30 fps is naturally noticeable, there is no doubt, and ends up taking away some precision from our speed maneuvers. However, the possibility of activating the commands via gyroscope, which conveniently do not replace the analog sticks but integrate them, giving us the opportunity to adjust the aim on the fly, especially in precision shots, puts a patch on it and substantially reduces this lack. The run & gun approach remains the backbone of DOOM Eternal: the game sees us dance within the scenarios while we land our shots and try to avoid enemy fire, ringing violent finishers one after the other and changing to I fly the weapon on the basis of the situation and the available ammunition, the latter element managed in a very intelligent way already at the intermediate difficulty level. On the front of the arsenal, compared to DOOM, there are not many innovations but the characterization of each individual instrument is excellent once again. Some weapons have been replaced by different models that however boast similar functions (see the heavy cannon and the ballista), others have received a very pleasant upgrade (see the shotgun, which now includes a hook to grab enemies and close the distance before firing point blank). There is also the brand new Crucible, the lethal sword of light that however requires the use of a recharge with each blow. Compared to the expansion The Ancient Gods - Part 1, the DOOM Eternal campaign is certainly more airy and interesting, alternating the inevitable fights with tantalizing platform sections. Thanks to the presence of the double shot, which integrates perfectly with the double jump, we will be able to produce ourselves in long sequences in which we move from one hold to another, possibly collecting boosts in mid-air to recharge the maneuvers. Sometimes these phases are frustrating, but completing them successfully returns a great sense of satisfaction. The portability element on Nintendo Switch finally represents a very valuable extra for such a product. Playing with DOOM Eternal by taking the console with you almost everywhere (but you need a connection to register the unlockables, watch out) is really satisfying and the integrated display well masks the inevitable limits of graphics in terms of detail and cleanliness. Technical realization So let's come to the technical realization, which undoubtedly represents the most interesting aspect of the conversion made by Panic Button. In general, the sensations that the game transmits are similar to those of the previous reduction works carried out by the Texan team, but it is clear and evident that the extra time required by the studio has paid off, translating into a more refined experience. The compromises to which the developers had to go down are clearly visible when playing in docked mode. The resolution has clearly been lowered, with a dynamic solution that tends to mix the elements a lot in the more complex phases, returning the inevitable feeling of poor cleanliness. In close-up shots, even in quiet situations, the use of low-definition textures is noticeable. The transition from the original 60 fps to 30 fps is perceived, of course, but it doesn't sacrifice the experience too much thanks to the general stability of the frame rate. You only see slowdowns during the cutscenes, where the scaler probably doesn't intervene aggressively, but otherwise you dance and shoot which is a pleasure, exactly like on the more powerful platforms. In short, the juice of DOOM Eternal was not over-diluted and it retained its excellent flavour. An important consideration, if we think that this last chapteror of the id Software series is technically the most complex and boasts a very convincing artistic direction, accompanied by a soundtrack that even on the Nintendo portable console does not hold back and involves right from the start.", "date": "2020-12-10", "grade": "8.5"}
