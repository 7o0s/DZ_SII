The question marks in the main menu of the game clearly reflect the spirit of The Sanctuary, where you had to complete the story mode several times to unlock the other modes. Also in this case, once the main mode and its two short ~appendices~ have been completed, you gain access to the ~Legend~, ~Endless Battle~ and ~Lightning Battle~ modes, which add up to the versus mode (~ Battle of the 1000 Days~) and the extras of the ~Zodiac Holiday~. By selecting ~Hades~ you access a story mode very similar to the one seen in The Sanctuary, therefore as the story is told, through dialogues and interlude sequences, we will find ourselves in command of different characters and sometimes we will have to make choices that could determine the continuation of the story. Or at least that's what happened in the first game: in Hades the crossroads increased in number and choice (four ~answers~ in total, one for each pad button), but if in The Sanctuary we witnessed unprecedented events and clashes, that in the animated series were not shown or that they had even been created for the occasion, in Hades it seems that opting for one answer or the other does not change the substance, with the story that always proceeds in the same way. Since there are four possible answers, the mode must be completed four times for all to be usable. But already completing it once allows us to access the two appendices, or the clash with Aiacos and Minos, two of the three generals of Hades (the third is Radamantis, and you will face him several times in the story mode). Apart from this major lack, the story mode of the game is more full-bodied than that of The Sanctuary: there are more fights and sometimes we will also have three characters available to face a particularly powerful enemy. If the thickness of the first game of Knights of the Zodiac was considerably increased by the presence of the ~Grand Priest~ mode (in which one placed himself on the side of the ~bad guys~ and had to move his warriors with a pinch of strategy, according to the growth and strengthening rules of role-playing games), unfortunately in Hades there is nothing similar, only classic choices ~disguised~ with high-sounding names: a very normal versus mode, a survival (~Battaglia Infinita~), a time attack (Blitzkrieg) and a sort of arcade mode (Legend). The extras of the ~Zodiac Holiday~ are now unlocked in a more complicated way, and it will be necessary not only to complete the various modes, but also to collect excellent ratings in your fights. [C] Entering mode ~Seventh Sense~ allows you to land special shots at full strength. The Scorpio fighting style is very strong. really nice to see. The Golden Knights returned from the afterlife they are definitely alive and powerful. [/C] Abandonment of the East! The Knights of the Zodiac  The Sanctuary presented itself as a fighting game clearly off the screens, simplified in the special moves for narrative needs: during the story mode you took control of different characters, therefore it was more practical to use the same button combinations for everyone. And there was no lack of a strategic component, as timing in parries and button presses, in general, often became the key to getting the better of the opponents. All of this has changed only marginally in Hades: special moves that involve the presence of animated sequences are now much more difficult to undo and return to the sender, because you have to press the button that is indicated for only a fraction of a second, and the rarely when you manage to do this you find yourself facing another skill challenge, always based on reflexes. At that point it is better to put up with the special blow and amen, especially since the balance in the damage inflicted between normal and special moves has not enjoyed a rationalization compared to the past and therefore it is often advisable to resort to normal attacks to get the better of the opponents, relegating the special to a pure aesthetic resource. However, some combos and some special moves have been added, including the manifestation of the Seventh Sense: when the special moves bar is filled to the maximum level, just press two pad buttons simultaneously to change the scenario and have at your disposal, for a while, increased power and the ability to perform all special moves without the relative bar emptying. Using this technique, as well as the one in which you ~expand~ your cosmos to hurl a too ~sticky~ enemy away, causes the special bar to disappear for a while. GreatestCaution! Turning to the technical realization, unfortunately Hades sins from several points of view. The speech is not so much absolute as relative: the improvements compared to The Sanctuary are really too few. Just think that there are only four new Knights (Orpheus, Radamantis, Aiacos and Minos), where Sion was derived from the polygonal model of Mur (they are both Knights of Ram, after all), and the total number of scenarios, which also count some novelties, has actually decreased compared to the first game. Furthermore, and this is the most negative note, in a couple of advanced stages there is a heavy and constant drop in the frame rate, an indication of a lack of optimization of the code by the developers. For the rest, the good words spent during the review of Il Santuario are valid: the armor of the Knights are fantastic, there is a disproportionate use of excellent special effects and the animations are really beautiful and different for each individual character. This means that Milo of the Scorpion will fight in one way, Saga of Gemini in another, Pegasus in yet another: it's all very nice to see, and almost makes you forget the scarce detail with which the warriors inside the armor are equipped, both for as regards the face and the hair, the latter really rendered in a simplistic way. The new stages are very large and full of the same light effects seen in the past. Unfortunately, however, no progress has been made regarding the interactivity of the same: moving within the scenarios becomes an accessory action, because only some columns can be destroyed and doing so does not translate into a great advantage in the economy of the fights. The use of colors focuses too much on the cold, but it is probably a targeted choice to bring out the armor and light effects, a good choice as everything can be said about the game except that it is not visually spectacular. And the sound? It is perhaps the real strength of Hades, for the great quality of the music (many already present in Il Santuario, however) and for the Japanese voices, sometimes subtitled in Italian following the conventions of the Italian version of the anime, sometimes resorting to transliterations originals. [C] The Andromeda chain is a great weapon at any range. The mighty Radamantis will challenge you; more times. For the sacred Capricorn! [/C] Comment Last year we witnessed the first appearance of Knights of the Zodiac on PlayStation 2, and the game impressed us with its absolute fidelity to the series, the precision of the controls and the presence of some extra modes that greatly increased the value of the product. We evaluated it with the eye of an enthusiast, and even using the same yardstick we can't say that Hades is the sequel we expected. There is no arguing about the charm of the series, the sound commentary is really exciting and the Japanese voices are exceptional but the impression is that the developers have used the same base, added the bare minimum and put on sale a title that can only appeal to to Saint Seiya enthusiasts, preferably to those who don't own The Sanctuary and who therefore cannot realize the fact that Hades has something less and not more than its prequel. Furthermore, the fact of being based on the last chapter of the television series, on the one hand, exerts an attraction for those who have not seen those episodes, on the other hand, inevitably makes the game ~crippled~ on a narrative level, and open to a ~second part which is certainly already in the pipeline but which we hope will herald a decisive restyling at a technical and gameplay level. Pros: Fantastic armors Exceptional music Unquestionably fascinating story and characters Cons: Too similar to The Sanctuary Lack of alternative game modes Heavy slowdowns in some stages Two and a half centuries have passed since Doko, Knight of Libra, and Sion, Knight of Aries, thwarted the conquest plans of the god Hades. Athena managed to seal the mighty enemy in a rock prison and ordered Doko to watch over it, then made Zion her High Priest. Now Hades has freed himself and is ready to return to the attack: the Bronze Saints and the Golden Saints will therefore have to face very powerful and dark enemies, as well as find themselves face to face with deceased warriors who have returned from the afterlife with the sole objective of kill Lady Isabel. But what is the real reason that pushes the Knights loyal to Athena to return from the world of the dead? And who really is Hades? Second episode of the series of videogames dedicated to Knights of the Zodiac, the new title developed by Dimps took everyone by surprise, as it was taken from the latest saga ofthe manga by Masami Kurumada, only recently translated into animation and still unreleased outside Japan. On the one hand, one wonders why interesting sagas such as that of Asgard and Neptune have been skipped, not to mention possibly the films; then, however, the curiosity for the unpublished story prevails and one becomes passionate in front of the new characters and the drama of the events narrated... from this point of view, the game undoubtedly manages to involve all fans of the series. And what about everything else? [C] In Hades many mysteries are revealed, such as that of the Knight of Libra. Mur has a very non-physical, energy-based fighting style. The graphic rendering of the hits is; certainly spectacular. [/C]", "date": "2006-10-16", "grade": null}
