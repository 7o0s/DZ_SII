The amount of added content is really hard to think of as part of a simple add-on package (not for nothing they weigh almost as much as the entire XCOM 2). In quantitative terms, the only comparison that seems appropriate to us is with Blood & Wine for The Witcher 3, despite the obvious differences due to the different genres. Unfortunately, many new features also bring some problems: the changes that are made to the game are so profound that many mods, especially those that affect the game structure such as Long War 2, stop working after installation. Say hello to one of the chosen ones Not bad, because even those who have never stopped playing XCOM 2 since its launch will have something to rejoice and sweat with War of the Chosen. At this point, however, it should be clarified that some elements have remained similar, if not identical, to those of the base game. For example, the interface has not undergone major upheavals, except for some convenient adjustments, as has the plot which, except for some additions that we will discuss, has remained substantially unchanged: the Advent have taken possession of the Earth and the XCOM team, from a defense group, it has turned into a resistance. Will they be able to regain control of our beloved planet and foil the plans of the Elders? In short, it's XCOM 2, only bigger. Technical upgrade and missions galore The first things that catch your eye after installing War of the Chosen are the reduced loading times compared to those of the base game and the graphic renewal. The scenarios are richer and more detailed, the effects and shot changes during the action are more refined, with the same configuration the fluidity is greater and, in general, one feels that a great deal of work has been done to enrich the visual part of the game. Another novelty clearly emerges from the first missions: there are many more settings than the base game. From this point of view, XCOM 2 was much richer than the first chapter, but now the variety has become very high and each scenario has so many variations that it is almost impossible to find yourself playing on two maps that look alike, even though they continue to be procedurally generated. There are new rural areas, more styles of urban environments, new landing areas for enemy saucers, you name it. With so much variety comes a big increase in the type of missions. Think that in about thirty hours of play we have faced the same kind of assignment up to three times and never in the same scenario. What are the new missions? Well, there are so many, too many to list all. For example, in some cases we will be required to mark supply crates to have them extracted by the allies before the aliens take them; in others we will have to kill personalities before they escape; in still others we will have to bring together the representatives of the allied factions in neutral areas. In addition, individual lenses admit a number of variations that diversify them even more. For example, some rescue missions no longer require long marches to get to the extraction point, but force you to defend against a certain number of aliens before help arrives. The interface has remained identical This wasn't enough, even the old missions have been partially revised. For example, now when the aliens attack the bases of the resistance, they are no longer faced only with helpless and very frightened citizens, but also with armed rebels. Of course, they have poor weapons and need our intervention, but at least now they no longer run around the maps like madmen getting slaughtered without offering the slightest resistance. Unfortunately accounting for all the new missions would take up a lot of space and make us lose sight of the big picture. The important thing is that you understand why after installing War of the Chosen it's worth replaying the entire single player campaign from scratch (also because old saves are not compatible with the expansion). The three factions and the three Chosen Two of the most relevant innovations introduced by Firaxis are the factions and the Chosen, which coincidentally are three and three. The factions are nothing more than rebel groups characterized by their own philosophies and unique units: there are the Reapers, i.e. very skilled assassins capable of maintaining concealment for longer and exploiting very advanced tactical skills; the skirmisher, Advent rebels who fight for the freedom of their species and who are skilled soldiers; and the Tempslari, specialized in the use of psionic powers and very skilled melee fighters. The Warlock is the most powerful of the Chosen If desired, we can consider them as very powerful variants of already existing classes, equipped with specific weapons and characteristics, as well as a growth system different from that of XCOM soldiers: while the latter can choose one of two skills for each level they acquire, allies some factions acquire experience points which they spend on skill trees that are very reminiscent of those of an RPG, albeit more limited. However, the factions are not limited to providing men to XCOM, but also offer a simple micro-management part. Each faction has its own objectives to be achieved, represented by passive missions, which do not require you to go directly to the battlefield, but which are resolved by sending the required units to the front. What are these missions for? To obtain resources and, above all, trust: the more a faction has faith in XCOM, the more it will provide them with bonuses. Factions have a different growth system than XCOM soldiers Theoretically, the use of factions risked making the whole game much easier, but fortunately that didn't happen, because the developers balanced the difficulty by inserting some truly fearsome new enemies. Meanwhile, new Advent troops have been introduced such as the purifier (a soldier armed with a flamethrower capable of burning the entire team with a single attack), the priest (a support soldier who enhances other troops), and the ghosts, (yes transform into particle clouds that are impossible to hit and can take over our soldiers). Also now the cities are teeming with zombies, or lost if you prefer. As tradition dictates, the latter are very weak when taken individually, but become fearsome when attacking in a horde. Fortunately, in order not to make its presence frustrating, the developers have made a small addition to the combat: when you kill one, you can continue to act. So in a single turn you can kill a lot of casualties, magazine permitting. It should also be noted that the undead friends (or whatever) are not affiliated with the Advent and therefore in maps where both are present they wage war with each other. The biggest news, however, concerns the introduction of the three Chosen Ones: the Assassin, the Hunter and the Warlock; that is, alien heroes, let's call them that, really powerful. Zombies, there are zombies! They are special units that can only be put to flight and that in order to be definitively eliminated require to face dedicated missions. When a Chosen patrols a certain territory, their icon appears amidst the flames. This means that in all missions that take place in the vicinity there is a risk of seeing them appear. Since these are really very strong units, finding them in the middle of the feet together with the other enemies can be a trying experience. What are they doing? Well, the Assassin has incredible movement range and the power to stun anyone with her attacks, the Hunter is the most skilled sniper around and generates panic when she strikes, while the Warlock uses his powers in a truly destructive way psionics. When the Chosen attack, all other targets fade into the background, on pain of being wiped out. Tired, stressed and a little flirtatious Among the other innovations that must certainly be reported, there is also the soldier fatigue system, which greatly changes the management of XCOM operatives. Basically now our men have to rest a few days after facing a certain number of missions (whether direct or passive). However, forcing them to fight when they are tired can cause a drastic deterioration in their performance. What does this entail? It's easy to guess: while in XCOM there was a tendency to create a handful of super men with whom to face all the missions, leaving the other soldiers to themselves, in War of the Chosen one is forced to manage the troops in a more prudent way and to make them grow more, because the requirement for active units has become much higher. The chosen ones don't love each other very much To make you understand: in the base game we had brought about ten units to the maximum level, while in War of the Chosen we got to have almost thirty promoted, net of deaths. Another novelty related to soldiers concerns the bonds that are established on the battlefield. Yes, even these brutal war machines have feelings and can bond with some of their colleagues to the point of gaining special abilities when they fight together. Think that if you want, you can also take team and couple photos to strengthen ties... a dear onea bit coquettish, but ultimately likeable. Towards the end of the game, it feels good to look back at the photo album, especially when you come across dead soldiers. But perhaps we are being too sentimental. The graphics have been refined and now everything is smoother A final note deserves the challenge mode, which offers a different mission every day, unique for everyone, in which the goal is to score the best score. This isn't big news, but if you get caught up in leaderboard fever you can rest assured that you won't be uninstalling XCOM 2: War of the Chosen anytime soon. We honestly struggle to see major flaws in War of the Chosen. Surely some will not like the fact that they cannot always use the same units on missions, but this is a matter of personal taste and nobody prevents you from starting XCOM 2 smoothly and playing with the old system.", "date": "2017-09-01", "grade": "9.1"}
