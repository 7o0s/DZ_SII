It may happen that the concoction obtained is unstable and not functional for the pre-established purposes, but it often happens that the final result appears even better than the sum of its parts: let us therefore see in which direction The Muscle Hustle present here has gone, which combines gameplay brought to success by Monster Strike and a modern free to play formula, all inserted in the context of a wrestling ring ... Combat pawns But forget about sweaty big men who pretend to fight each other: the fighters in The Muscle Hustle in fact take the form of pawns that are thrown around the screen using the ~slingshot~ system made famous by Angry Birds, thus swiping the finger on the touchscreen in the opposite direction to the desired one and releasing it at a distance proportional to the force to be applied to the blow. Much easier to try than to explain, the playful structure of the Foxglove title is effectively illustrated by the tutorial that accompanies the very first stages of the game: the user has a team made up of three elements, which can move in turns in an attempt to inflict the damage to the opposing team as much as possible. Each contact between opposing pieces corresponds to a blow inflicted by the active side, with the impact speed determining the power of the attack. As if you were on a billiard table, then, playing from the side can be an effective technique, given that the strings of the ring allow the checkers to rebound thus paving the way for potentially devastating multiple contacts. However, the most interesting component of The Muscle Hustle's gameplay lies in the special abilities of the members of one's team, capable of changing the fate of a match if used correctly, perhaps by linking them with those of the allies. There are therefore pawns that unleash additional attacks when they are hit by a friendly unit, others that crush the first enemy in range with an angel flight when they reach a corner of the ring and still others that strike from a distance every time they bounce off the ropes, and this is just to name a few: the Foxglove developers have been good at inserting these moves in more than enough number and variety to give a pleasant strategic depth to the fights and to leave the player the freedom to create a team that reflects his style of struggle. Also because there is a whole management system (very simple, of course) that takes up the time you don't spend in the ring: the wrestlers of your stable earn experience points for each victory, and it is possible to divide them into different teams, train them in the gym to improve their characteristics and equip them with equipment items that give them additional skills. Unfortunately, The Muscle Hustle is not impermeable to the most annoying tendencies of today's free to play, and therefore presents the bill in terms of in-app purchases which have their considerable weight in the economy of the title: the most valuable elements essential to make to make the wrestlers the proverbial leap in quality are difficult to find with the rewards following the matches, while they make their fine show in the in-game shop at decidedly high prices if not integrated with real money. As always in cases of this kind, a point is soon reached where the progression in the game enters a bottleneck from which you can only get out by repetitive grinding or putting your hand on your credit card. For those who don't have problems with one or the other practice, The Muscle Hustle still reserves a satisfactory offer of content: there are various competitions and tournaments to face, and there is no shortage of special matches, challenges and a multiplayer mode to complete the Square.", "date": "2017-11-11", "grade": "7.5"}
