{"name": "No More Heroes - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/no-more-heroes-recensione.html", "text": "Assassin you were and assassin you remain Killer 7 and No More Heroes are linked by a double thread: that of the graphics, sharing the same artistic technique, and that of the storyline. Also in its new title, SUDA 51 wanted to put assassins as protagonists, in particular one: Travis Touchdown, the player's alter ego and intriguing cross between a samurai, a wrestler and an otaku. The incipit of No More Heroes (deliberately liquidated with a few minutes intro) sees our hero firmly intending to become the number one hit man in the country, a goal to be achieved by progressively eliminating the ten killers at the top of the rankings. Let's start from the weak link of the Grasshopper production, or what is inserted between one kill and another: in these phases, the user is forced to wander around the city of Santa Destroy aboard his own absurd motorcycle, carrying out part-time jobs or commissioned crimes in order to raise enough money to register for the next challenge. In one word: boredom. The urban scenario is sadly bare, both graphically and in terms of content, with little traffic, few pedestrians and above all few locations to visit in relation to the extent of the map. There are some shops where you can buy new clothes and upgrades of various types, and two agencies where you can grab some extra jobs: also considering how these sub-missions do not prove to be particularly stimulating, it goes without saying that these interlude phases of No More Heroes become soon a cyclical formality to be disposed of in the shortest possible time, and not an adequate side dish to the main activity. Which, fortunately, manages to make up for the deficiencies just described in an excellent way. The heart of No More Heroes is made up of scenarios filled with enemies to be wiped out with your own colorful fighting technique, a mix of electric sword slashing (?) and grappling. The result is exciting, also capable of exploiting the characteristics of the Remote + Nunchuck combo well. The Z key is used for lock-on, while A controls his beam katana, which produces different blows depending on the high or low posture (managed by the inclination of the Remote), and B controls the holds that can be performed on enemies. Both these and the various finishing moves involve the movement of the two controllers in the directions indicated on the screen, a simple element that contributes significantly to increasing the fun factor of the clashes. Sure, with all the opponents you're facing, the combat system tends to get a bit repetitive, but while it lasts, it's pure exhilaration... Killers 10 Paradoxically, what should be the most vivid point of the playful experience offered by No More Heroes - i.e. the boss fights - does not fully meet expectations, at least from a strict gameplay point of view. In the end, almost all of these fights are resolved in circling the opponent, dodging his special move and striking immediately afterwards. The real touch of class lies in the typology of the various killers, all over the top characters to say the least born from the perverse mind of SUDA 51: the female soldier with a rocket-launching leg armed with a shovel is one of the most shining examples in this sense. And to be honest, the value of No More Heroes as a work in itself is mainly dictated by ancillary aspects or by the sensations it arouses rather than by the mere sum of the parts. Just think of the slot machine that is activated at the conclusion of each kill and which leads to temporary boosts in the event of a favorable combination, or the need to periodically reload your beam katana by pressing the 1 key and shaking the Remote. Or again to the delirious dialogues of the characters, not to mention the fact that to save the game it is necessary to sit on the toilet bowl ... in short, No More Heroes will be remembered more for the positive vibes it is able to transmit rather than for the goodness of its gameplay or its technical realization. Which, needless to say, is by no means unassailable from an exquisitely critical point of view: despite the captivating style, No More Heroes offers few polygons and a lackluster definition, and the soundtrack is (deliberately?) repetitive like few others. But even here unexpectedly positive elements intervene: the 8-bit style ~pixelated~ icons, the loading sequences that recall pop art, the poetic uselessness of certain activities (for example playing with the cat in your own apartment), a dubbing in English among the trashiest ever heard. In short, if it is true that a video game, like so many other things, is not judged only by the workmanship of the individual components, No More Heroes is theclearest proof of this assumption. Comment No More Heroes is a truly anomalous product, not only for the crazy stylistic and narrative choices that make up its essence, but above all for its ability to capture the player while not offering anything truly excellent. The fights are simple and prone to repetitiveness, the free-roaming parts are boring, the graphics - although cool - are full of flaws. Yet the title Grasshopper is a truly immersive experience, much more complete than its ~spiritual prequel~ Killer 7. Who knows if it doesn't reach perfection with the next game SUDA 51...
