{"name": "Magical Hammer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/magical-hammer.html", "text": "The protagonists of the game in the deformed version are the famous characters from the Darkstalker beat'em up series, we will find all our heroes, and above all we will be able to enjoy the sensual Morrigan. The Capcom title is yet another variant of Bejeweled and Tetris, the aim of the game is quite simple and consists in forming blocks of at least 3 colored stones both horizontally and vertically. The game area consists of 6 columns and 7 rows of blocks, we will be able to move these colored spheres using our hammer by moving our character to the right and left of them and up and down. By therefore applying force to our weapon we will move them in the desired direction to try to form combinations. Time is limited and we will only be able to stop it by making winning and colorful combinations. Once we have eliminated the blocks of a certain color the indicator of the same ~suit~ will level up, and when all the indicators are full the mission mode will open. We will have to complete these special levels (there are 8 different ones) within the established time and satisfying particular requests, such as for example aligning 4 blocks of one color without caring about the rest. Once you have completed all the missions you will return to the main mode, on the other hand if the time available to us runs out the game over will be inevitable. The title itself is fun enough, not particularly innovative, but certainly the special missions and the presence of characters from the Capcom saga make it rightly attractive. The commands work well and our character responds quickly and precisely to our impulses, so we will see him go up and down and move from right to left like lightning to select the right line to hit with the magic hammer. On a technical level we are certainly not in the presence of anything special, the scheme is static, very colorful but always the same. Unfortunately the developers have not thought of any mode usable in multiplayer, a missed opportunity.
