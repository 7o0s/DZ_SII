But be careful: maybe it was all those beautiful Disney and Pixar puppets that attracted you, right? There's nothing wrong with admitting it. But it is good to know, before anything else, what TSUM TSUM are. It is a series of Japanese soft toys based on the characters owned by Disney: for some years they have also spread in Italy. Do you think that there are even animated short films with these funny protagonists; their name comes from the Japanese verb tsumu, which roughly means ~to stack~. In fact they have the ability to ~combine~ in small columns, to the great delight of all collectors. Having said that, the TSUM TSUM are the protagonists of the party game of the same name on Nintendo Switch, which for many parents could represent the perfect purchase for Christmas 2019. Gameplay: Lots of minigames Disney Tsum Tsum Festival is a party game, a collection of minigames that arrives exclusively on Nintendo Switch: in truth, there is also a single puzzle game that gave rise to the video game series, released some time ago on Android mobile devices and iOS. This is the only case in which, to play, you will have to use Nintendo Switch in tabletop mode and in its vertical arrangement: all the other mini-games can be played both in portable mode (horizontally) and in TV mode, up to a maximum of four players in total, each of which must have one and only one Joy-Con. The play offer of Disney Tsum Tsum Festival is extremely intuitive and immediate: after the short introductory film, which will surely delight children and leave adults who do not know this brand of Disney soft toys slightly perplexed, the player finds himself inside of the square, which also serves as the main hub. From here, he will be able to freely choose the individual mini-games offered, eleven in total, or the Festival Tour, which will present them to him one at a time. A story mode is not contemplated, which on balance is not even necessary: the use is designed for short games in the company of friends. Small on-screen instructions remind you of the game rules of the individual party games included, or ask you to select some variants of the challenges: in the case of Curling Tsum, for example, you can choose between the classic game (longer) or the quick (shorter). The mini-games are sufficiently varied (this is also reflected in a certain diversification in the gameplay), and some in particular shine with their own light: this is the case of the Ice Cream Stacker, where the player must keep his cone in balance while from other ice cream scoops come down, using the motion sensors of the Nintendo Switch. But the possibilities of the Joy-Con, in general, are exploited whenever the situation allows it: Rhythm Tsum is practically a super-simplified Just Dance designed for the little ones, where the latter can squirm by squeezing the motion controller in their hand to the rhythm of music, following the movements of the characters on the screen; in Tsum Tsum Mania, on the other hand, you point the remote control at the TV as if it were a real gun, to fire at the UFOs on the screen and accumulate points. It is good to note that each game mode is usable in both competitive and cooperative modes: the better of the two does not necessarily have to win, it is also possible to collaborate to achieve certain scores. If there are only two players, the CPU can possibly take the place of the last two players expected in the match. The contents Minigames represent Disney Tsum Tsum Festival's main offering, if not the only noteworthy one, on balance. The contents wink in a not too veiled way to the real classics, from Tetris to Pac-Man (of the latter there is even the Tsum Tsum as a playable character, thanks to the collaboration with Wreck-It Ralph). Of course, the dozen mini-games offered hardly justify a really high introductory price, which is around fifty euros for the entire package, even considering that the contents, once you have tried the various mini-games, are practically finished. Party game aside, Disney Tsum Tsum Festival relies on the collecting and completionism of the players: unlocking all the characters present, many also considering their variants, will take away an enormous amount of time. This is because access to every single character requires1000 coins, that is about a dozen games, if not more: a figure that seems really excessive, and which, rather than enticing the player to continue playing, forces him to real grinding sessions. Of course, you could consider participating in the Lost Treasure, a sort of slot machine in which by wearing a few coins you could win many more, but the operation is so risky and cumbersome that it is better to let it go and accumulate them to unlock the characters from the balloons. Bingo, on the other hand, presents a series of internal production challenges: they are practically the ~Trophies~ in the Nintendo Switch version, but even here the rewards provided are not particularly interesting, and most of the time you will simply forget to pay attention to the proposed missions from Bingo. The graphic and technical sector of Disney Tsum Tsum Festival remains at good levels, without excelling: the images on the screen are clean, and the artistic direction focuses on the theme of the party, the circus and fun. Balloons everywhere, masks, confetti, festoons, riot of light and color everywhere, bordering on confusing: fortunately, colors, rhythm and images become more contained once again when the actual mini-games begin. However, the overall quality of the animations does not make you cry out for a miracle, but it is above all the loading times that annoy you: present everywhere, starting and exiting the individual games, when there are not who knows how many elements on the screen and characters inside them to load. Hopefully some future patch will improve the situation, at least partially. It is commendable that, although Disney Tsum Tsum Festival is clearly designed for local multiplayer, it is possible to play online with players from all over the world, even with the presence of rankings.", "date": "2019-11-20", "grade": "7.0"}
