Taking a further step back however, the genesis of Heroes of the Storm dates back to BlizzCon 2010, where Blizzard itself presented a mod for Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty called Blizzard DOTA. Clear reference to the Defense of the Ancients map developed by a group of enthusiasts for Warcraft III. In contrast with the history of the Irvine company which more than ten years ago was able to take the ball by giving life to the MMORPG that is still the most played and loved today, they did not register the DOTA trademark assuming that coming from the Warcraft III community it would be still remained tied to the company. Following the lawsuit won by Valve, however, it was Gabe Newell's company that gave life to the spiritual sequel to that mod with DOTA 2. Blizzard's project then changed its name to Blizzard All-Star, then suffering a violent setback in terms of communication thanks to the cancellation of BlizzCon 2012. However, the project was not dead, indeed the developers were looking for the best formula to merge all the famous Blizzard universes into a MOBA that could somehow differentiate itself from the crowd, proposing ideas fresh and original. Precisely for this reason, after having failed with the attempt to keep DOTA, the first step was to eliminate the word MOBA from the company dictionary, replacing it with Hero Browler, which already alone makes it clear how much the title is more focused on teamfights rather than on individuality. The reactions in these months of technical alpha, first, and of beta subsequently were the most disparate, from those who appreciated the less complex and more quarrelsome look of the title to those who instead immediately labeled it as an excessive simplification of the underlying structure of Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. However, the servers have always been very crowded, accompanying the launch of Heroes of the Storm under the best auspices. Heroes of the Storm finally arrives in definitive form full of character and with the typical Blizzard style Alternative MOBA Despite detaching itself from the two giants of the genre, even in Heroes of the Storm individual skills mix with the ability to cooperate with one's teammates, still requiring a good strategic vision and guaranteeing a certain complexity to the title which, although stripped of some mechanics, it always maintains a considerable level of depth. Basically, however, it is not complicated at all since we are faced with a multiplayer title that sees two teams of five heroes each fight for domination of the opponents' base on maps that include two or three corridors separated by a more or less intricate jungle. From the two specular bases minions are generated in regular waves, non-player characters who proceed along the lane to which they belong, attacking everything hostile they find in their path. Each line therefore has defensive structures such as towers and fortresses capable of attacking anyone who gets too close to them, to be knocked down before reaching the opposing Nexus. The jungle here has a very important role since the creatures that populate it become an active part of the ~laning phase~: once defeated, in fact, these don't just give a buff to the player who killed them, but they join the minions of the team by helping them make their way to the opposing base. There are three types, the besiegers who thanks to their very long range manage to do damage to enemy structures without entering their firing range, the fighters who are instead very strong in hand-to-hand combat and more resistant, and the boss, the strongest non-player character in the jungle, very effective for upsetting the tactical balance of the opponents and forcing them to divide between the lanes. However, unlike League of Legends and DOTA 2, it is the map itself that assumes prominent importance, given that if in the latter it has always been the same, in Heroes of the Storm there are currently seven, each characterized from a specific form and peculiar dynamic objectives that it is essential to meet in order to be able to win the match. These represent the true soul of the Blizzard title as they practically always lead to teamfights by acting as a fundamental point of interest for both teams, a bit like the Dragon and Baron Nashor from League of Legends. Every time an objective appears on the map it is an invitation to fight, overcoming the ~classic~ MOBA concept that sees each player focused on thehis line to grind experience points and gold by exterminating minions and waiting for the gank to score a kill. Here all this talk about lane control crumbles around mechanics specifically designed to involve all players by moving the games tremendously and also shortening their duration. In this sense, mounts were introduced in full World of Warcraft style to move faster from one point to another, and then added on the maps of the fountains to regain part of the life and mana points, without necessarily having to return to the base and break the rhythm of the game. So many maps, so much variety In Heroes of the Storm there is not only one map, but there are seven of which four are focused on creatures and three on direct damage to structures. All are excellently characterized both in design and in the required tactical approach and perhaps represent the most interesting introduction in the field of MOBAs by Blizzard, which thanks to a good dose of creativity has made the battlefields much more varied and attractive especially for new players. Below are those currently available: Cursed Valley: By collecting three Raven Lord tributes, the opposing team is struck by a curse that weakens minions and disables structures facilitating the push. The tributes are generated in random order and every time the teamfight is guaranteed. Blackheart Bay: here the task is to collect doubloons by attacking chests, mercenaries and skeletons and then deliver them to Blackheart, who will bombard enemy structures with the cannons of his ghost vessel. Once you have taken the doubloons, however, you must be careful not to get killed by leaving them to the opposing team. County of the Dragon: when a team conquers the two altars, located one in the top and the other in the bot, a player can take possession of the Dragon Knight: very resistant and devastating especially against enemy structures. Haunted Mines: The undead appear at regular intervals in the mines, whose skulls are used to awaken the Golem, a massive non-player character who grows stronger and more resistant as the skulls collected increase. Based on its power, it is up to the team's tactical intelligence to decide whether to shoot down the enemy Golem or support its own towards the opposing base. Garden of Terror: when night falls in the garden, mutants are generated which, once killed, release seeds. Every hundred seeds collected generates the Arboreal Terror which, once controlled by a player, is very powerful both against opposing heroes and against structures. Celestial Temple: in this map with an Egyptian setting there are three temples which, once conquered, activate a powerful destructive ray which causes massive damage to enemy structures. Each temple is protected by guardians who can be used to kill opponents. Tomb of the Spider Queen: in the latest map introduced, wool control becomes fundamental. In fact, by killing particular minions, you get gems to donate to the Spider Queen's altar to ensure an additional wave of weavers for each lane. The Blizzard charm Playing since alpha we have rarely happened to exceed thirty minutes of play even in ranked matches, but don't misunderstand the relative brevity and aptitude for teamfights with the lack of tactics. Although you don't reach the levels of DotA 2, Heroes of the Storm requires a certain amount of coordination and organization to be able to gain and permanently maintain control of the map, in a process that includes minions, camps, dynamic objectives and, of course, the hero kills. Controlling more lines is essential especially at the beginning of the match, where experience points count more than kills to outrun opponents in the race for experience levels. The ~first blood~ in fact does not give that boost in experience points that one might expect, but it is more efficient to kill as many minions as possible. In this sense, we are light years away from the mechanics of LoL and DOTA 2 since there is no minion ~last hit~ and above all there is no gold. Both of Blizzard's choices are in line with the goal of streamlining the mechanics surrounding the management of the hero on the battlefield as much as possible in order to focus as much as possible on the map and on combat, with experience points that accumulate only by being close proximity to minions and slain enemies, and the complete absence of a shop. In addition, the experience is shared with teammates, completely canceling any ~feed~ mechanism. The only way to personalize your virtual alter ego concernsgives the system of talents to be unlocked when specific levels are obtained, which allow you to enhance some skills and unlock additional talents, with rather varied builds for the same character. Just as there is no ~last hit~ for minions, there is neither for kills which have been renamed killings and also incorporate assists within them, freeing us from the age-old problem of stealing kills from teammates. Even the roles have been revisited given the considerable mobility of the players on the map, with four basic types that differ in parameters and use: we have the Assassins who do a lot of damage both in close combat and from a distance; the Warriors capable of absorbing a good number of blows; the Supports that act for teammates by healing or enhancing them; and finally the Specialists, an atypical role which includes characters with particular aptitudes that are very useful if included in the right composition of the team. There are currently thirty-six heroes, all from the three very famous Blizzard universes, but there are many more in the pipeline, especially given the bottomless pit from which the developer can draw. StarCraft, Diablo and above all Warcraft are a real forge of charismatic characters to be modified and reworked to adapt them to the gameplay of Heroes of the Storm, plus the characters of the new Overwatch who will soon appear on the Nexsus maps. In addition to having iconic heroes, Blizzard has also proved to be very good at taking unconventional paths by introducing for example the Lost Vikings who are three heroes in one to be managed individually, or Abathur who does not fight in first person but is limited to generating creatures additions on the playing field and to provide periodic boosts to teammates. Always competitive By winning games you get experience points to increase the level of the player's profile and that of the hero used in the game: in the first case the cap is set at forty, while in the second at twenty. Once the ranked games have been unlocked, you proceed in a system very similar to that of Hearthstone which from level fifty to forty allows you to earn points from victories and not lose them in defeats, and then subtract them from the total calculation once the climb towards the level has begun. 1. In addition to the non-impeccable balancing, especially with the newly launched characters (see Kael'thas), one of the main problems of Heroes of the Storm is the economic model, too stingy towards the players. Although it is a free to play in fact, as in League of Legends also in this case there are a handful of heroes in free rotation per week which, in order to have them permanently available, must be purchased by spending real money or the currency earned in game at the end of every game. It takes ten thousand to unlock most of the characters which in money is equivalent to 9.99, an excessive cost. To meet the player we think the Daily Missions that reward the completion of each objective with a few hundred gold. You can have up to three active at the same time with challenges that require you to finish a certain number of games using heroes from a specific universe or with a particular role. Each hero then has a series of skins and mounts to unlock, some available only after reaching level 10 and others only by spending real money. In this sense, given the scarcity of money, we found the introduction of the Test function in the shop very useful, which allows you to test the skills of the character in an ad hoc map with a lane, before proceeding irrevocably with the purchase. From a purely graphic point of view, Heroes of the Storm keeps all the style and color palette of recent Blizzard productions intact. In the face of an inspired design of the maps and a remarkable care for the effects and animations of each hero, the overall graphic impact is excellent on the best performing systems, without forgetting however a great scalability. Finally, since it is a MOBA, only the continuity and expansion of the community will sanction its effective success, but the Irvine software house has not hidden its aims in the competitive arena by announcing the first World Championship at the next BizzCon. The first major event was the Heroes of the Dorm university tournament which also attracted the attention of a television station such as ESPN, which broadcast the matches in full, marking another important step in the diffusion of eSports on a large scale.", "date": "2015-06-02", "grade": "8.5"}
