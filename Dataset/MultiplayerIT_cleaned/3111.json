As already evident from the name, Dirt Bike Unchained is very similar to the games mentioned above, to the point that it is not an exaggeration to define it as a direct sequel with the engine of a motocross bike instead of the pedals of a bicycle: let's see, therefore, if this difference whether or not it has brought about improvements in the playful experience. Like riding a bicycle The first bars of Dirt Bike Unchained follow closely the path traced by the other Red Bull productions: in the role of a promising rider at the beginning, you are introduced to the racing world by the digital reproduction of a star of the motocross circuit, who leads us by the hand in the early stages of our career. The process is the classic one seen in millions of similar products: you participate in competitions that earn credits to spend to upgrade the bike and thus access higher-end races, always keeping an eye on the energy indicator which drops every time you goes on the saddle and which can be restored by waiting for some time or by putting a hand in the wallet. There is obviously no shortage of prize boxes and the like, for a product which, however, does not have an excessively predatory attitude in terms of microtransactions, however well present and continuously passed under the player's nose. If the game structure says nothing new, even in terms of gameplay, one should not expect who knows what revolutions from Dirt Bike Unchained, which in fact takes up the concepts made known by its pedal predecessors, adapting them to this new context. We are therefore always talking about a very simplified racing game, which is played by holding the smartphone vertically and using only one finger: the pilot on the screen follows the path of the track independently, and you only have to keep pressing the touchscreen to accelerate, releasing it at the right timing to perform jumps, landings and drifts. These are precisely the situations in which an advantage over the opponents can be obtained or not, given that performing perfect deadlifts leads to momentary speed boosts that make the difference, especially considering the brevity of the races and the absence of other variables. In fact, the competitions do not see us directly challenging other centaurs, but the ghost of their best times, whether they are guided by artificial intelligence or by human players. As with the previous Bike Unchained, also in this case the fact of adopting such a simple and ~guided~ gameplay brings with it strengths and weaknesses: if the game is therefore immediately enjoyable, suitable for anyone and ideal for quick games without too many preambles, at the same time it is inevitably very repetitive and characterized by a level of challenge that almost entirely depends on the rate of improvement of one's bike rather than on real skills on the track. The contents offered do not help in this sense, relying on competitions that are a little too similar to each other, also thanks to the on-track nature of the gameplay which does not allow who knows what inventions in terms of tracks. In short, Red Bull certainly could and should have done something more to make this Dirt Bike Unchained better than its not very illustrious previous ones: at least from a technical point of view, the software house managed to shake off the mediocrity that had characterized the other two productions, fielding a graphic that does its duty and a sound suitable for the purpose.", "date": "2020-05-02", "grade": "6.5"}
