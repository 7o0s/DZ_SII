The latter is a lot of fun because each beaten opponent gives a bonus, to be taken in the arena and it is not always easy to be able to beat the opponent and at the same time, for example, go to the edge of the arena and take the strawberry that gives extra life. The characters are initially 12, then progressing with the game and unlocking the various bonuses, you will get the Boss Tengu and Bayman. You will also be able to collect about 80 costumes, also obtainable by dissecting the game, trying to meticulously finish each mode that has not been completed. The difficulty level is very well calibrated and directly influences the single player longevity of the title: the Ninja Team has tried to implement, by choosing different difficulty levels, a formula that adapts to the different needs of the player: from easy to hard not only will the opponents be stronger, but the whole bonus unlocking system will radically change. ...even better than Tekken Tag We still continue to talk on an objective basis: graphically speaking, Dead or Alive 2 is currently the best that the Ps2 can offer, even better than Tekken Tag, and this says a lot about the visual richness of the game. The level of detail is simply frightening: in each fighter it is possible to see details that we have never been able to see with such precision before, such as the design of the muscles or the particularities of the clothes, which move and flutter in accordance with the movement of the fighter. wearing them and the environmental characteristics. The animations are extremely smooth and there is no slowdown to pay it gold. The lighting effects are for now the state of the art on the Sony machine. Every time we are thrown on the edges of the arenas something will happen to us, and this something, whether it's a 10,000 volt shock all to ourselves, or some nice explosion, will generate multicolored effects that affect the general photography of the whole arena. Absolutely amazing! The backdrops are beautiful: some, like the one that begins on the roofs of a city, are of a disarming beauty. The lighting changes dynamically according to the movements of the characters, an effect already seen on other machines, but the results are now of a perfection and realism bordering on the manic. The sound effects and music do their duty well, average in short. The first love... Let's now analyze the subjective aspect: preferring Tekken, my judgment on the playability and feeling of the game may seem too meticulous, but this is what I think and if you want to compare yourself with it. What does DoA2 have more or less than Tekken Tag? In my opinion DoA2 loses in terms of technicality in performing the attacks, and many times you will go on pushing the keys almost at random. The feeling of perfectly mastering the chosen character, of almost entering into symbiosis with him is higher with Tekken. Having more moves available does not necessarily mean being more complete. Another thing that I don't like, since the time of the first DoA, is the strong and adrenaline-pumping sensation of the impact of the blow delivered to the opponent, which is often absent here. Let me explain: as in the Virtua Fighter series, dropping a cardboard (rather strong punch NDCartac) on the face hearing the sound of bones breaking is less satisfying than in Tekken. In the latter, every hit scored is underlined by a light effect, a Bud Spencer-style sound effect, and last but not least, a convincing and real animation of the moments following a good beating. Landing a well done shot is rendered visually, but also emotionally at the highest level. In DoA2 this sense of involvement is much less: sometimes after a good combo of 4 or 5 punches to the opponent's chest I didn't understand if he had parried everything, with lethal consequences for me, or if I had actually hit him. In my opinion this is a serious flaw, in a fighting game involvement is very important! Conclusions On the other hand, I find the introduction of counter-moves/counter-holds very positive, which actually give more substance to the matches. Now let's talk about graphics, but not in terms of texture and company. I tried this title on 2 different TVs, a 17-inch from '93 and a 32-inch 100htz wide from '98 with very different results: with the first it seems that the jaggies are less visible, but the 60htz mode shows in white and black, when Dreamcast pal games at 60htz worked great. The latter showed more lack of aliasing, while the 60htz mode worked great. In common between the 2 trials is the ominous A/V cable that the Ps2 carries as a dowry. I hope the forum is filled with your evidence! Summing up DoA2 is a great title, graphically exceptional, very long-lived and playable and fun, perhaps more usable by newbies than by expert geeks, with years of fighting games behind them. In my opinion, a contestable setting of the collision routines invalidates a judgment of absolute excellence, but this is a sensation rather than a real lack. matrix docket As already mentioned in the preview phase, the Team Ninja title is the latest incarnation of a porting process that brought it first to the Dreamcast and then to the Ps2, improving significantly at each step. The version that now comes out for the European market is undoubtedly the best of all those released so far. There are all the game modes of the other versions plus some new ones, such as the UPS, the Recording Mode and the Watch. The UPS gives us the possibility to write a file with all our game statistics. Recording Mode is used to let us experience the thrill of a professional movement player, with results that will see us busy for hours recreating the ~and now I'll go around!~ of the Matrix, (but also Scary Movie), while the Watch Mode is particularly suitable for those who want to see matches in which our Ps2 challenges itself.", "date": "2000-12-14", "grade": null}
