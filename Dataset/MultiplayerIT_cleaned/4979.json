{"name": "Lost Eidolons", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lost-eidolons-recensione.html", "text": "The possible fulfillment of a prophecy made the emperor tougher, leading him to violently suppress all forms of protest. Eden is a mercenary who lives quietly in his village with his companions, when a series of linked events force him to become the commander of a group of rebels, organized by a noble dissatisfied with the current political situation. The path ahead is full of battles, dangers and betrayals, which will make him mature and become someone he never knew he was. Of course, he will also learn that when you have nothing to say it is better to keep quiet, as we will see in the review of Lost Eidolons, Ocean Drive Studio's turn-based strategy RPG with a medieval fantasy setting, which shines every time you forget you are also an RPG. Game structure An official artwork of Lost Eidolons that represents one of the main conflicts of the game The Lost Eidolons is a title structured in a very classic way: on the one hand there are the battles, built around a Fire Emblem-like turn-based system, even if more direct in execution, and on the other there is the narrative part, modulated with interlude sequences, pre and post fights, with long dialogues that recall the world of visual novels and with exploratory sequences that take place in a military camp. The story told is quite predictable and basically follows Eden's rise to power, with various twists and turns along the way and different characters to interact with to achieve the goal. As we will see, however, the problem is not so much the story told, which can be considered acceptable, considering that its purpose is to be the backdrop for a military campaign divided into twenty-seven chapters (for about fifty hours of play), but the quality of the writing and the need to lengthen the broth which leads to many repetitions and an excessive length of often useless and superfluous dialogues, which end up always revolving around the same topics. We will talk about this aspect again in the paragraph dedicated to the GDR side, the weakest of the entire work. Now let's focus on its strong point, which alone is worth the whole experience. The strategic part Eden is a fairly predictable character in her development, who in Lost Eidolons will go from being a kind of Robin Hood to becoming a charismatic boss The strategic part of Lost Eidolons recalls many classics of the genre (Shining Force, Final Fantasy Tactics, the aforementioned Fire Emblem, just to name a few). At the beginning of each fight we see our troops deployed on the field on a 3D map divided into squares. Once you've done a quick reconnaissance of the battlefield, counted your enemies and estimated your forces, you can begin moving one unit at a time. Usually you start from the bottom of the map and you have to go up until you reach all the objectives, the most frequent of which is the defeat of the boss, the classic strongest unit that commands all the others. Each character has different characteristics based on his class, so wizards are more skilled in casting spells, knights have a fighting style based on the use of sword and shield, warriors generally do big damage, losing something in defense and etc. The sampling of the genre is all there, with a fundamental eye on progression, one of the cornerstones of the experience itself. The latter is managed largely spontaneously: each skill used by the characters makes them grow in a certain direction. For example, a character who often uses a bow as a means of offense will surely develop hunter skills, as well as a character who fights by leafing through a library with light magic will become a priest. In this way it is possible to mix the classes better, addressing the various units as desired. The system, coupled with the traditional growth of levels, which takes place by accumulating experience points (each action yields a little) works very well, to be honest, and also enjoys a certain depth that does not make you regret much more famous and famous titles. The battles are undoubtedly the best part of Lost Eidolons, the one that we can define as the most successful. Strategizing to achieve all the objectives is rewarding, although often they are very linear tasks and simply require cleaning up the maps. There may be some little extra tasks to perform, such as opening certain containers to get items, or escaping to certain locations, but they are in the minority. What matters is that the player is often called upon to think about his own moves, because every mistake can cost the loss of a unit or of the battle itself.Despite the spells and monsters, the overall style of Lost Eidolons is quite realistic and straightforward In this the artificial intelligence that guides the opposing units helps a lot, because it is able to develop interesting tactics, encircling and prodding weak points when possible. It's not flawless, but it does its job and never creates holes that allow a certain tactic to be replicated ad libitum until victory is achieved. The level design also contributes to the goodness of the battles, in this case the set of map and troop positioning, which often creates interesting and challenging tactical situations. Speaking of enemy units, for the most part they are made up of better or better soldiers worse equipped. If it weren't for the presence of some monsters, such as hellhounds, manticores, giant snakes, dragons and others, which must be tackled using a particularly successful combo system which consists in hitting the right point of the beast with the right weapon, it would almost seem of being in a realistic medieval world, between wooden palisades that protect muddy and poor villages, castles protected by stone walls without any particular decoration and a very earthy general atmosphere, so to speak. Role playing game Level design often offers interesting moments If the strategic part works, and also very well, where the experience offered by Lost Eidolons pays off is when it also claims to be an RPG. At the helm of Eden, after each battle we will find ourselves in the camp of our increasingly numerous team to carry out various activities, first of all talking to the other characters. It is here that we will promote the heroes to the higher classes, buy weapons, manage the inventory and libraries, hire new mercenaries and carry out the so-called prestige missions, i.e. small tasks that can be solved within the field that yield resources and points that can be spent to increase our influence on individual characters, including those still undecided about whether or not to take part in our campaign. As the battles continue, various structures inside the field will also be unlocked, such as a square for merchants or a training area for units. The objective of this section is to let us manage the progression of the army and to give us details on the campaign, making us listen to the point of view of our men on the most diverse topics. Too bad that the latter have very little interesting to say and that, in most cases, the dialogues are resolved in sterile and fruitless exchanges of jokes, often on topics already discussed previously. The RPG sections are the weakest part of Lost Eidolons The underlying problem is that the characters are quite flat in their characterization and therefore lack an interesting background to draw from. So the insecure archer who gets better and better or the virtuous woman oppressed by guilt for having killed the man who held her prisoner (just to give two examples) develop in such a predictable way that in some cases it is possible to skip the dialogues without really missing anything fundamental. This flatness actually reverberates in many of the secondary activities, often just sketched, which in the long run turn out to be very uninvolving. The missions themselves mostly require you to go around the field and talk to this or that character, buy goods from merchants or go in search of objects, usually clearly visible. In the long run, rather than being a pleasant addition, they end up tiring. Of course, the whole part related to management is appropriate, given that it serves to account for the progress made, but it is precisely the structure of the entire section, in which many hours are spent overall, that leaves more than a few doubts. The substance is that you often end up skipping as much stuff as possible to get back to fighting as soon as possible, net of the operations that are still necessary in order not to penalize progression. Technique Lost Eidolons battles have some spectacular moments From a technical point of view Lost Eidolons is an overall pleasant title, but with ups and downs. On the one hand there are the battles, in which the 3D models of the well-made and well-animated characters stand out, in scenarios that are not exactly exceptional but still decent. On the other hand, there are some elements that are not very digestible, such as the pre-rendered static screens of the dialogue sequences, which are really ugly, and the direction of the dialogues itself, which, wanting to imitate the visual novels, ends up ungluing the characters, creating an overall effect that is not exactly pleasant. Even the soundtrack thrives on these contrasts, with the music being spot on but sannot already heard in numerous other titles. Let's say that in principle the result is acceptable, also because much more could not be expected from a production that is not exactly millionaire anyway. Of course, by rethinking certain elements, much better results could have been obtained, but that will be for the next title.", "date": "2022-11-08", "grade": "7.0"}
