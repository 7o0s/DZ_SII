The imagery of the Metro series is drawn from the books with a post-nuclear setting by the writer Dmitry Glukhovsky, suggestive volumes that have touched the chords of other writers, including our own Tullio Avoledo, who have created a universe, through five books, of international character. But the merit of the literary success, this is clear, we also owe it to the two video games that boast a decidedly high quality. The developers have been authentic masters in rendering the atmosphere of the Moscow underground, a maze of lights and shadows that has become the home of a lost humanity, of extremist sects and horribly mutated creatures. The latter dominate outside where the radiation is too intense to allow human life and infiltrate the subsoil in search of human beings. They look like crazed beasts, monsters. But there is something wrong. Behind the monsters assaulting the last human strongholds there are creatures trying to communicate, sinuous and inscrutable beings that hide a mystery. To get involved is the heroic Artyom who, inspired by heroic figures of all kinds, enters the depths of the subway, dragging us with him into an undeniably intense experience. And this intensity is not only due to the splendid design of the underground towns, the eerie nuclear silos or the excellent sound sector. What makes both titles memorable is also the always varied action that drags us into wild rides aboard mining carts, forces us to support extreme defense actions and offers us good-level stealth situations. All seasoned with an engaging narrative component and not without spectacular moments. And with the Redux version both titles are further enriched both from an aesthetic point of view and from that of content. The first chapter of the series is in fact equipped with the latest version of the 4A Games graphics engine and among the additions there is also the non-essential but certainly suggestive day and night cycle. Metro Redux is not a simple reissue and hides a lot of pleasant surprises Not just graphics On the aesthetic side, it is inevitably Metro 2033 that undergoes the major changes with the lights and post processing seen in Last Light which enrich a still good level graphics sector. The aesthetic progress on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One compared to the old generation consoles is obviously greater than that of the PC version, but the detail increases significantly in this case too and the new visual effects give the first chapter of the series a rendering very close to that of Last Light. In essence, the result is excellent between truly splendid textures and incredibly realistic fabrics. Furthermore, 4K resolution has also been implemented for those lucky few who can afford a configuration capable of supporting it. Unfortunately, the greater cleaning also highlights some problems related to the fluctuating quality of the models of the inhabitants of the subway, but the inconsistencies are not so evident and the restyling operation can be considered a complete success. In the case of Metro: Last Light, however, the leap compared to the original is less impressive but we are obviously talking about the PC version, while on consoles it is much more evident. Rather if the contents are unchanged or almost unchanged for the second chapter, Metro 2033 can boast a long series of interesting innovations. For the latter, in fact, new animations have been added, various missions have been modified and new cutscenes have been created, some of which enrich the transition from one area to another. Where before there was a black screen now there are connecting scenes which, while not telling anything new, make everything more believable. Furthermore, the control system has been updated, some levels divided into two parts have been merged and the possibility has been added, also in the case of Metro: Last Light, to consult the clock and inventory. In essence, there is no shortage of substantial innovations that undoubtedly give meaning to the entire operation, even if the will to ride, with this re-edition, the release of the new generation consoles is evident. But 4A Games could have limited the work to the aesthetic component while it has shown that it does not mind a little extra work and has had the foresight to include the downloadable contents of Metro: Last Light in the offer. No surprises from an optimization standpoint. Both titles require a decent computer to play in full detail while not being resource-hungry like Metro 2033 in relation to the hardware of the time. Although when the antialiasing value is maxed out, even a Haswell with a GTX 770 starts to falter. Not that the rendering changes radically by lowering the SSAA value to two, but the difference in terms of image cleanliness is noticeable. On the other hand, bringing the SSAA value to 0.5 blurs the image considerably and the title is lighter even compared to when anti-aliasing is deactivated. Obviously in this case the detail decreases instead of increasing but those who play at low resolutions or don't have the resources to activate v-sync, quite useful given the copious tearing, could find this option attractive since it allows you to streamline the engine without giving up motion blur and effects in high quality. From a gameplay point of view, both titles earn something. Metro 2033 boasts all the mechanics introduced in Last Light including improved artificial intelligence, weapon customization, mask cleaning, non-lethal attacks and sneak attacks. And the latter find a more complete sense in Last Light thanks to the more substantial novelty of Metro Redux. Both titles can now be played in two distinct modes. That Survival is designed to enhance the stealth dynamics and is more effective if combined with the Ranger difficulty which further reduces the amount of available ammunition, lengthens loading times and makes poor Artyom more vulnerable making the cautious approach much healthier than a charge to the bersagliera. The Spartan mode is instead declined towards the classic shooter with more ammunition and monsters less reluctant to die. The first Metro already had its stealth dignity that was partially lost with the second chapter even if this one had more refined mechanics. Now both titles offer a fairly challenging stealth experience thanks to the Ranger mode and despite the action nature of the original, the areas of Last Light are full of ravines and are therefore suitable for supporting much deeper stealth dynamics than those offered in the first version of the title. The result is a truly rich and refined offer that can be purchased as a whole for around forty euros, a price that is quite attractive considering the quality of the two titles, or separately using digital delivery. No mandatory package, in essence, and it undoubtedly makes sense. On the other hand, those who have recently played Metro: Last Light and don't want to replay it by focusing on stealth mode might find it more logical to buy Metro 2033 Redux alone, which comes to us transformed not only aesthetically but also in terms of content.", "date": "2014-08-19", "grade": "8.5"}
