{"name": "Crash'N'Burn : Recensione PS2/Xbox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crashnburn-recensione-ps2xbox.html", "text": "Crashing is good, sometimes... With games on the market like Burnout 3 and Need for Speed Underground 2, this Crash'N'Burn tries to take gameplay elements from both of these two illustrious rivals and carve out its own space. The Climax Studios title is a racing game with strong choreographic components enhanced by accidents during the races. Evidently a game like Burnout is starting to make school and the followers are becoming numerous lately. The spectacularity of the accidents, an element on which a large part of Crash'N'Burn's appeal rests, is however not as well cared for and satisfactory as compared to what has already been seen in the ~master~ of Criterion. Secondly, a large part of the good intentions of this title come from the possibility of customizing your car beyond belief, buying components such as engines, exhaust pipes, spoilers, Nitro and anything else necessary to try to pulverize the enemies once on the track. Of course, this factor is very accurate and full of options, but perhaps the guys at Climax Studios have forgotten that the fundamental component of any good racing game is called ~challenge~, otherwise called ~emotional tension~, caused by racing against other cars . perhaps the guys at Climax Studios have forgotten that the fundamental component of any good racing game is called ~challenge~, otherwise called ~emotional tension~ The fun of all well-made driving games, and I also include MarioKart, F-Zero, Burnout rather than a Wipeout or a Gran Turismo, is the result between the sum of Artificial Intelligence and ~playability~, or the ~drivability ~ of the middle. The speed of the controls, the accuracy of the steering response or anything else falls into this definition. Crash'N'Burn unfortunately sins in these aspects. The Artificial Intelligence is reduced to the bone, the enemies in the race do not seem to care much about our presence in the rear view mirrors. We will often find ourselves faced with rather funny or bizarre situations, with enemy vehicles crashing by themselves (perhaps for the sake of causing accidents), for no apparent reason. The second quality of any worthy racing game that we don't find in Crash'N'Burn is the goodness of the control system. The response to the commands does not appear brilliant, and every possible change imaginable that we can make on our car will not influence its physics in a convincing way, quite the contrary. Mostly we will notice slight increases in speed, but without any influence on stability, corner entry or steering. Spectacular accidents? Crash'N'Burn is a very ~simple~ game in terms of graphics. Precisely thanks to the lack of detail of the backdrops and the general care taken in the creation of the settings, it can travel at 60 fluid frames, but this means looking at the glass half full, being optimistic in short. Even the accidents, which nevertheless are the basis of this game, appear drawn away, victims of a careless physics that makes the cars look like big boxes. The damages are not, in fact, very realistic and, above all, they are not very varied, giving the impression that they occur randomly, without following a real on-screen collision mechanic. It goes without saying that the vehicles are figments of the programmers' imagination, and no commercially-branded cars appear in Crash'N'Burn. While setting aside a certain crassness in the track design and general choreography of this title, it is disheartening to note the lack of the most basic effects such as dynamic shadows and lights, bump mapping or particles. To the overall meager visual sector, we must add the problems of the soundtrack: simply banal and anonymous. The sound effects are saved, but on the other hand it is reasonable to think that the Climax studios have shelves now overflowing with samples suitable for a driving game. The sound effects are saved, but on the other hand it is reasonable to think that the Climax studios have shelves now overflowing with samples suitable for a driving game Unsurprisingly, the Xbox version of Crash'N'Burn is vastly superior, for that matter. Definition, clean image and sharpness of the textures are in favor of the green cross console. However, PlayStation2 gets along well with this game that disfigures next to the latest generation titles, with a little help given by an always welcome online option, for challenges up to a maximum of 16 players. This is, without a doubt, positive news, given the poorly developed AI of the title. The human challengers are obviously of a completely different kind, and in this mode Crash'N'Burn could be of interest to some network game enthusiasts. However, considering that there are games of the cbook of Outrun 2 and Burnout 3 it is really difficult to recommend the title of Climax. Comment Crash'N'Burn comes out in a video game moment that is anything but favorable to compete with racing games of the caliber of Burnout 3, Need For Speed Underground 2 and Outrun 2. For this reason the guys from Climax certainly had to be more daring, going to look for qualities and characteristics different from those developed in their title. A game of crashing and souped-up car racing has to be about challenging enemies and car physics, two factors that are far from well done. The only positive note is the presence of a fun online mode that gives body to the Crash'N'Burn multiplayer, both on PlayStation2 and on Xbox. In this context it is therefore difficult, even with all the good will, to continue looking for positive elements that make a possible purchase attractive. Pros: Flows smoothly at 60 Fps Online game up to 16 players Cons: Bad audiovisual sector Inaccurate controls Physics to be improved A resume that speaks for itself Browsing through the Curriculum Vitae of Climax developers, we can only be amazed at the amount of racing games created. Starting from laptops, with HotWeels for GBA, through Rally Fusion and ATV for Gamecube and the entire MotoGP series for Xbox and PC, up to Speed Kings, Stunt Drivers, Mille Miglia and Italian Job on PlayStation2. Not to be confused with their Japanese colleagues of the same name, Climax Studios is an entirely English team, which has also recently launched into the world of RPGs with Sudeki on Xbox. After this long series of racing titles, they try again with an excellent sequel: that Crash 'N' Burn that appeared several years ago on the Panasonic 3DO, which ~older~ gamers will have no trouble remembering for its splendid epoch) pre-rendered backdrops that darted fast on the screen, creating the sensation of a screaming graphic, even if at that time not many knew how to distinguish it from a real time..", "date": "2004-11-27", "grade": null}
