{"name": "Dalle parti di Farmville", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76275-we-rule-dalle-parti-di-farmville.html", "text": "For a long time, users of Apple platforms have been asking for a version of Farmville for their iPhone/iPod Touch, but their wishes have remained unfulfilled. Until Ngmoco decided to get busy and propose its own version of a management MMO that somehow tries to re-propose the gaming experience that has depopulated on the famous social network Facebook. The result is We Rule, a free application that only requires an online connection and a Plus+ account to play, which allows you to form your own friends list, essential for its community-game mechanics. Even if in reality some fields to cultivate can also be found in We Rule, it is not a farm that will have to be managed, but a real feudal realm to be developed around the castle of the ruler, that is the player himself. Medieval atmospheres, therefore, even if seasoned with various fantasy elements and characterized by bright colors and cute and cartoonish characters that give the whole a cheerful and playful tone, also thanks to a soundtrack full of ringing sounds and high notes. What a boring court life! However, the formula that has made management software such as Farmville and many others successful on Facebook does not have the same effect once applied to Apple mobile devices, or at least Ngmoco's pioneering attempt has run aground on some rocks. Starting with the game servers which for long weeks prevented players from accessing the title's features due to bugs that were not promptly resolved, but also due to an unexpected huge influx which evidently exceeded expectations, probably also thanks to the free application. Most of the technical problems seem to have been solved by now, but a series of other conceptual difficulties do not make the game usable as we would have hoped. The mechanics themselves are elementary: it is a question of earning money and experience points through the construction of fields to cultivate, houses for the people and commercial structures of various types. The houses will generate taxes and XP automatically, the fields will be to sow and then earn from the harvest once it has matured, the structures will work alone or thanks to our friends from the neighboring realms. The entire social structure rests on the latter: by going out on the map screen it is possible to visit the realms of those who have been added to your friend list, with the usual system. An intermittent sign on them indicates if there are vacant jobs inside, at which point you can visit the realm and plug the free structure that will engage the workers, earning both the player and his friend a consideration in money and XP once once the production cycle is complete. Of course, XP is used to level up to unlock new structures and decorations for the realm. And here the game ends, thus proposing the usual scheme of farm / wait / collect / earn. Worth mentioning is a microtransaction system that allows anyone who wants to buy ~Mojo~, i.e. a potion that instantly concludes a work cycle or the construction of a structure chosen by the player, obviously useful for accelerating growth times. Everything remains extremely an end in itself and even after solving the various post-launch problems it remains maddeningly slow and not very usable, also due to a very little immediate structure and management of friends. Push notifications have no sound and only half perform their function and the title, which does not set any real goal and does not entice the player with some mini-quest or occasional interaction to break the monotony of an endlessly repetitive pattern, it quickly becomes boring and inconclusive. It's still free to play, so it's well worth checking out and following if only to see if Ngmoco will be able to update and revitalize it with new options.
