This category includes many antipode products, which have in common only a soft approach to the world of video games: there is no other way, otherwise, to find a common denominator that unites Mario Party and Wii Fit. At the same time it is quite difficult to understand what differentiates this series from Mario Kart so much, but the best answer is probably also the most intuitive: if until 1999 the various Mario kart spin-offs had been characterized by the famous ~easy to play, hard to master~ from Nintendo, Mario Party was the first - or at least the first big project - to go beyond this philosophy. It was immediate and the son of a brilliant intuition, but it didn't dig as deeply as Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros. Exactly as Wii Sports and proselytes would do years later. Hudson cubed That the ideal Mario Party consoles are precisely those by Iwata, despite the series being born at the time of Nintendo64, is demonstrated by the sales figures: although the eighth episode was certainly one of the worst in the series, perhaps the worst ever, it is the one that has sold the most. More than the original, more than the excellent GameCube sequels. And mind you, this is not an obvious consequence due to the increase in the installed base: Super Smash Bros, much less ~casual~, has totaled almost the same numbers on Wii and GameCube. Similar speech for Mario Party DS, also a bestseller. And this, we repeat, although the eighth chapter was disastrous: the worn-out formula, zero novelty, inaccurate use of the Wiimote, graphics almost identical to that of the fourth title. Think what could have happened if Hudson had made Mario Party 8 with care. Yes, Hudson: a company that was in crisis at the time, and which now, at least apparently, no longer deals with the series. Mario Party 9 was in fact developed by NdCube, a software house founded a decade ago by Nintendo. The fact that he gave birth to the most original episode since 1999 might suggest that Hudson was to blame: wrong, because due to various vicissitudes the old NdCube was merged almost entirely into other companies (including Nintendo) and its members were replaced by the old team that worked on Mario Party for years. The freshness of the product is therefore surprising, just as some rather wicked design choices - and balance - are surprising. Unique pawn For those who have never tried a title in the series, let's clarify that Mario Party is a brilliant mix between a board game and a video game, literally the first board game: others had tried to unify the two concepts, but no one had ever created a distillate of this quality. It is not a simple electronic adaptation of a famous board game, in fact it has rules and events that cannot be reproduced elsewhere: minigames at the end of each round, for example. Arrived at the seventh episode, however, the formula now appeared rusty, abused: it needed novelties, novelties that Mario Party 8 was not able to bring, from any point of view. Having taken the fundamental pause for reflection, a finally original ninth chapter has arrived. The first innovation lies in the characters/figures, who no longer move independently, but travel together in the same car, driven in alternating shifts: this greatly limits the strategy and the complexity of the boards, but is functional to the objective of the game, i.e. bring out the arcade soul of the product. More speed, more interaction. The boards become paths, safaris rather than boards to explore: barring unforeseen and rare crossroads, they are guided tours. All clearly divided into three sections: a first part of the approach, a second in which a gap begins to create between the players, a third which upsets the game and leads to a clash with the boss, the latter for the first time at the center of the 'experience. Alea iacta est Before returning to the question of the board, let's pause for a moment on the excellent minigames: they are the main specialty of the game, the element without which Mario Party would be anonymous, and in this episode they shine again as they did in the good old days. The motion controls are never used inappropriately (sometimes they are useless, but never annoying as in the predecessor), and the tests appear well balanced: the most beautiful minigames are not up to the best in the series, but there are no annoying ones style falls that had characterized almost all the predecessors. The numerous boss fights deserve a separate consideration (two per board, one intermediate and one final): they range from discreto excellent, but above all they represent a real novelty, at least for the importance they have in Mario Party 9. Of course, they are not Power Stones, but they are fun and well elaborated. At the end of each minigame, stars are awarded to the winner: whoever has the most stars at the end of the game wins. And here comes the problem: luck has always been one of the basic ingredients of Mario Party - one of the ingredients, in fact. Too bad that in this ninth chapter, having reached the third part of the board, the case totally takes over. Observing the graph that outlines the progress of the races, it can be seen that at the end of the second section the gap between the various characters is (often) well defined, to then flatten, twist and sometimes overturn during the third - and last - phase. It's not a possibility, it's a constant. This is because the last boxes of the board are almost all ~Bowser~, or unexpected events with consequences ranging from tragic to apocalyptic. Reversals are beautiful if rare, if surprising: in the old Mario Parties they were frequent, but it was not a given that they would happen. Here, unfortunately, they are inevitable. And even the prizes at the end of the game (which go to whoever has scored the most points in the minigames, for example) are quite useless: they don't in the least balance the stars collected along the way, and the winner is almost always established - and more than usual, we reiterate - from the case. To conclude, a brief mention on the visual sector, which records a clear step forward compared to its predecessor, although masked by the backwardness of the hardware.", "date": "2012-03-15", "grade": "7.0"}
