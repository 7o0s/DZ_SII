{"name": "Ultimate Mortal Kombat - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ultimate-mortal-kombat-recensione.html", "text": "Like here! We are faced with a rather faithful conversion: Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is present with all its characteristic elements, even if perhaps there have been some cuts in the animations and in the detail of the backdrops compared to the arcade version. The game, however, is always the same: very difficult at the beginning, it becomes more engaging once you get into its ~spirit~. The upper screen of the DS comes to our aid, providing us with a list of keystrokes necessary to perform special moves as well as the various Fatalities, Babalities and so on at the end of the fight. The d-pad moves the character, the main buttons allow us to deliver two types of punch and kick, while the back keys are used to run (back L) and to parry (back R). A control system of the classic type, which however in some situations is cumbersome and inconvenient. Puzzle Kombat is a different matter, a real puzzle game in which you choose a character and face opponents in sequence always over three rounds, but with the aim of blowing up blocks of the same color and then sending them to the screen of the rival. If in other titles of the genre it is enough to put together three or more blocks of the same color to eliminate them, in this case you have to wait for a ~detonator~ of that particular color, which once placed on similar and adjacent blocks makes them explode. Clearly, eliminating a large number of blocks at the same time produces better results, but the ~random~ mechanic of the arrival of detonators often makes things complicated and maybe you end up losing trying to build a good combo. While the blocks scroll in the lower screen, in the upper one the protagonists of the challenge give each other a thrashing, and clearly the victory of one or the other translates into a horrible end for the loser. Ultimate Mortal Kombat is only available for Nintendo DS. Technical realization As mentioned, the conversion of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is very faithful to the original, even if something has probably been filed to avoid technical problems. The sprites are recognizable and boast a good level of detail, but the animations are anything but smooth and the scenery is generally quite poor. The sound sector, on the other hand, is really identical to that of the original title, with all the voices and effects in their place. As for Puzzle Kombat, it is not a technically complex product and in fact it is reproduced without any problem: in the upper screen there are the two warriors who face each other (using no more than discreet polygonal models), drawn with a sort of style ~ super deformed~ not very successful. The use of the touch screen is almost nil. The control system, rather immediate, responds promptly to inputs, even if the use of the backbones is often uncomfortable and forces us to fight relying very little on the block. Comment Ultimate Mortal Kombat is a decidedly sui generis product. It is clear that this is a ~gift~ for all those nostalgic for the series, who in this way can relive the emotions of the classic Mortal Kombat with the convenience of a portable console and the interesting possibility of challenging their friends online, as well as players from all over the world. And in this sense, the inclusion of Puzzle Kombat is extremely welcome, it adds a pinch of variety in the form of a puzzle game that is not exceptional but fairly fun, perhaps too long in its sessions and governed by sometimes unfortunate rules. Ultimately, if you are a fan of Mortal Kombat (the original one, with digitized characters and 2D graphics) here is a really interesting product, which will allow you not only to recover a classic, but also to use it online. If, on the other hand, you don't like MK fights, it is clear that this conversion will not change your mind. Pros: Technically faithful to the original Online mode Two games in one Cons: Only for Mortal Kombat fans Uncomfortable control Puzzle Kombat is not exciting Finish him! Ultimate Mortal Kombat for Nintendo DS takes up the last episode of the series with the characteristic digitized graphics, or Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, and offers it adapted to the characteristics of the dual-screen laptop, adding the nice spin-off Puzzle Kombat. Both games also allow us to have online multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, or to challenge a friend wirelessly (preferably in possession of a second cartridge). As the title suggests, UMK3 is an enhanced version of the third chapter of this match-based fighting game, with the addition of some new characters and some extra challenges. The game sees us face offThere is the usual sequence of enemies after choosing our character from those available, but the road can be more or less long and winding depending on the difficulty level selected. We will therefore be engaged in fights lasting three rounds, some of which are characterized by a different structure: sometimes we will have to collide with pairs of opponents who take turns, or with two of them at the same time. The final stages are common to each path, and see us face the usual monstrous creatures up to the powerful Shao Kahn.", "date": "2007-12-21", "grade": null}
