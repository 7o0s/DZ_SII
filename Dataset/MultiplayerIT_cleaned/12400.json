{"name": "Uefa Champions League 2006-2007 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/uefa-champions-league-2006-2007-recensione.html", "text": "To the shortcomings is also added the impossibility of saving the replays, which, thanks to the excellent graphics engine and the rendering of certain shots, is truly a missed opportunity. Numerous game modes are available in the UEFA menu, starting from the classic quick match, to participation in the Champions League, starting from the qualifying round. The groups, as well as the participating teams, can be changed at will. Among the modalities we find the ~Challenge~ section which offers 42 re-editions of matches that took place during the past Champions Leagues, in which we will have to try to conquer primary and secondary objectives, such as overturning the result 10 minutes from the end or scoring a certain number of goals. Magic Meets Fifa The real heart of the game, however, is different from the simple final phase of the Champions League, and is called Ultimate Team Mode, a meeting point between a football management title, Magic and Fifa. Basically, we have to found our own football team, starting with unknown players, to then create the team of our dreams, buying the best players in Europe and gaining access to the Champions League. To develop our team we need money, and credits can be earned in different ways, either by playing games with our team, by moving up the ranks, or in other single-player or even multiplayer game modes via Xbox Live. Magic Meets Fifa With credits you can buy packs of virtual stickers, which contain a mix of three types of cards. The real players, each with their own skills and characteristics, the different staff members, such as the manager, the goalkeeping coach, the team doctor and so on, or the bonus cards to increase some player parameters during the game or not. The latter are a really interesting gimmick, since they can also be used in combination with staff members, to carry out operations outside of matches. For example, with a card to cure a player's shoulder, combined with the card of a good doctor, you can eliminate the 5 days of rest of an injured player. Or they can be used directly in the game, and obtain temporary bonuses such as improving the accuracy of shots or lowering the morale of the opponents. At first glance it seems like a soup of three types of games that have nothing to do with each other, after the first few games, however, you find yourself completely taken by this mode, so much so that the rest of the game appears almost marginal. In addition, if you have a gold subscription to Xbox Live, we will be able to access a real online market of these stickers, where it will be possible to individually choose the players we need most, find our idols, and obviously sell ours duplicates or players who do not fit into our team's plans. We specify that everything takes place using the credits inside the game itself, no Microsoft Points must be spent for this type of transaction. Sound graphics and AI In the technical aspect, the leap in quality compared to Fifa 07 can be seen from the rendering of the characters, who have finally lost the zombie effect caused by poorly calibrated lighting. As for the graphics engine, Uefa has nothing to envy to its rivals, indeed it takes the lead in this category by right. Among the best implemented features, the highest vote is taken by the player animations. We can only congratulate the development team, because the performance is truly superb in all game situations. Among the negative notes is the lack of different weather conditions, and the yield of the turf, which, although well reproduced, is always quite similar from stadium to stadium. The graphic cleanliness is at the highest levels, as is the frame rate which does not create playability problems during games. Even from the sound point of view, one cannot complain, the choirs and the environmental effects of the stadium are very well-kept, just as several soundtracks by famous artists have been implemented, albeit to a lesser extent than in Fifa 07. The commentary, which uses Bruno Longhi's commentary, hasn't improved much compared to the previous Fifa, in fact there are several synchronization errors between real actions and commentary by the commentators. Sound graphics and AI The AI implemented in the game is still incomplete, at times it shows practically perfect situations to create realistic game actions, while in other moments it leaves something completely to be desired. For example, if we are carrying out a counterattack and to get rid of a defender we try to stop and dribble by going back a few steps, our teammates will often stop too, nullifying thethe possibility of a through ball. This is the point on which EA should focus more for the next chapter of Fifa. The graphics and sound performance, already like this, are clearly ahead of any other competitor, but the way to make the real leap in quality in the football sector is to work on the artificial intelligence of our teammates and opponents. Online and Albums The appeal does not lack the entire online section of the game which, although not yet at the level of other EA sportsmen, is more accurate than the previous football titles on Xbox 360. Quick or personalized match, ranked or between friends, from 1 vs. 1 to 4 vs 4, rankings and various statistics, the aforementioned possibility of exchanging game cards via Xbox Live and support for downloading future additional content. During the review we were only able to try 1 vs 1 matches, and the game code responded well, avoiding lag problems during games. Finally, there is a real virtual sticker album, to be completed by adding the duplicates of the players found in the various packets, or those that you are unable to sell or do not want to include in your team. Completing the album or album pages does not lead to particular benefits in the game, but it is linked to some UEFA objectives, which we discuss in the appropriate box. Goals 360 There are 31 achievements in the game, each awarding 5 to 200 points. Wanting to unlock them all will take a long time, and many hours of play, in this respect Uefa is a really challenging title. To make 200-250, however, you won't have to work long. Comment Uefa Champions League 2006-2007 is undoubtedly EA's best football achievement on Xbox 360. The game mechanic continues to improve from edition to edition, even if it is still not perfect in every department, with the weakest point again represented by the Artificial Intelligence, excluding that of goalkeepers. In terms of technical, audio and video, animations, various game modes, including the new and successful ~Ultimate Team Mode~, multiplayer options and the exploitation of licenses, UEFA is promoted with very few reservations. Now it's a matter of ironing out the flaws, not revisiting the core of Fifa from scratch. Pros: Graphics Ultimate Team Mode Player Animations Cons: Artificial Intelligence Commentary Unsaveable Replays Electronic Arts takes us back to stadiums across Europe, with the most coveted challenge for all the teams of the old continent, the conquest of the Champions League. Numbers in hand, this is the fourth iteration of football made in EA on Xbox 360, in just over 14 months of life. many? Yes.. Too many? Given the results of the UEFA Champions League 2006-2007, definitely not. The teams featured in the game are all those registered in this year's Champions league, with the squads updated for the winter market, plus those of the main European championships (Italian, English, German, Spanish, French) and some other historical teams outside these championships, including Juventus. Present and Past Compared to Fifa and the previous World Cup 06, the player control system has remained unchanged, with the possibility of making it completely identical to the one used in Pro Evolution Soccer, making the transition between the two titles immediate. The Uefa game mechanic takes up some details from the one seen in Fifa 07, for better or for worse. Among the positive notes we find that the deep passes have been limited in effectiveness, making their execution more difficult, the collision itself between the ball and the player has been optimized to make the reactions of the ball more realistic. Unfortunately some defects such as the tendency to clash between teammates, called to double on the opponent, have also remained in this version. In addition, there are still imperfections that harm the gaming experience. For example, you will often want to change players, using the relative key on the pad, to select the defender in the best position to make a tackle, and instead take control of a different player, perhaps slightly closer to the ball but chasing the attacker from behind and not the one slightly further in front of the attacker. From this point of view, the automatisms of Uefa still have to be fixed, the core of the mechanics is decidedly valid, but these types of details are the ones that make the difference with the competition.", "date": "2007-03-29", "grade": null}
