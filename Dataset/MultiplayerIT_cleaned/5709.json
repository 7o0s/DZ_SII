However, Marvel Avengers Academy is an original interpretation, in the sense that it is not based on particular storylines or comic book titles: from this point of view, the work done by TinyCo, especially in terms of characterization of the characters, is pleasant and interesting. The incipit is the birth of an Academy of Avengers, precisely, founded by Nick Fury (in the now traditional Ultimate version) to train young heroes in view of possible threats from all over the world, and even from ~schools~. rivals~ such as that of HYDRA. Initially a young Tony Stark, Wasp, Loki and the Black Widow are part of the academy, and our task throughout the game will be to obtain additional characters, all rejuvenated for the occasion, as well as develop the structure of the school to add man hand new zones and buildings. We will therefore not have to deal with a city to be rebuilt as in Family Guy: Mission for Glory, the focus will shift to the characters and the activities to be carried out to unlock them and add them to the group, but the casual mechanisms and freemium dynamics are exactly the themselves. And that's not a good thing, actually. Marvel Avengers Academy is a very nice casual game from a graphic point of view, but boring and banal Tap and wait The genre of Farmville-like simulations hasn't evolved much since its inception, this is true, but we have still seen interesting variations on the theme, with the addition of strategic sections to enrich a gameplay that is too passive in its basic mechanics and aimed at pure and simple monetization, given that the completion of any operation can be speeded up using hard currency, the one that is obtained almost exclusively with real money. Well, Marvel Avengers Academy does not draw any ideas in this sense, rather it proposes a traditional structure in which we are simply asked to select one character at a time, entrust him with a task and wait for him to complete it to collect coins, objects and points experience useful for progression. The only added value is represented by the excellent graphic characterization of the characters, rendered very well thanks to the use of cel shading, although their being young translates into more than one occasion in the display of stereotypes which frankly we would have done without , like Wasp taking selfies or Tony Stark self-celebrating while working on some new project. All the rest, as mentioned, with a view to passive, slow and boring use: you open the application, give some orders, close it and then come back after an hour to reap the benefits of the various operations. Frankly, this is not the mobile gaming we would like to see.", "date": "2016-02-13", "grade": "4.0"}
