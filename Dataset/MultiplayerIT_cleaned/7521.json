Assisted in the development of the project by Visual Concepts, the Japanese team is once again ready to inflame the hearts of millions of fans with the fights between the wrestlers of American wrestling thanks to WWE 2K14. Apart from the name change, the game continues the tradition of the old franchise and is probably the richest ever for the series in terms of content: as we will soon see, it is a real concentrate of modes, with numerous grafts of great interest, an important roster and an editor so complete as to be divided into various sectors, each one enhanced compared to what has been seen in recent years. Yuke's American wrestling is back again this year full of content and modalities The history of WWE Listing all the modes of WWE 2K14 would be a titanic undertaking given that, as per tradition for the series, there are so many. Therefore, in order to avoid dwelling too much on those that can be considered secondary or on others now known by those who live on bread and wrestling, we prefer to dwell on the new game options and the most important ones in our review. Among the unpublished ones, the one called Thirty Years of Wrestlemania undoubtedly deserves particular attention, a mode entirely dedicated to the most spectacular clashes that have taken place from the end of the 80s to today with arenas, fighters' clothing and situations in the ring faithfully reproduced. The presence of this section has allowed the developers to introduce legends of that period such as Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, Ultimate Warrior and Andr The Giant into the large roster of athletes, just to name a few. From the game menu it is possible to check the characteristics of the match, the arena, the original date on which the match was held and the participants, so as to choose the one interested in the best way. It is also possible to take advantage of the substantial multimedia archive present, to deepen the knowledge of the wrestling world of the past and that of its legends. The clashes proposed by the mode are 46 in all and present a mix of primary objectives necessary to win the challenge, and secondary or historical ones, that is, closely linked to what really happened in the ring. For example in WrestleMania III you must try to reproduce an ~irish whip~ and the ~body slam~ of Hulk Hogan, followed by a ~leg drop~ on the late Andr the Giant, to virtually repeat the sequence of moves that led to victory and to keep the title the blond athlete, as it happened in 1987. While in the End of an it was Hell in the Cell match of WrestleMania XXVIII which saw The Undertaker and Triple H face off, to obtain a certain objective you must try to win the match by performing the final Tombstone Piledriver on the King of Kings with the Phenomenon. in these cases the artificial intelligence of the game takes over, which in fact pilots part of the sequences indicated, activating short cutscenes in key moments and leaving the player only the task of pressing the right keys at the right moment as in the most classic tradition of ~quick time events ~. However, the aforementioned nostalgic mode is not the only novelty of WWE 2K14 as mentioned. The other, equally interesting, is certainly the one linked to the myth of The Undertaker. The gamer's aim is to attempt the impossible, that is to beat the gravedigger for the first time in the Wrestlemania ring, impersonating his rival, or to defend and extend his streak of 21 victories and no defeats, playing his role. . In all cases, whatever role the user has chosen to play, a far from simple task awaits him. It should be noted that if he has decided to fight against The Undertaker, that even in the event of a defeat his performance is evaluated by the game, with a final score which, if desired, can be published in special online rankings. Superstar life If these two brand new modes weren't enough for the fans, as mentioned at the beginning of the article, there are plenty of them as always within the product. Among the ~classics~ the most interesting by far is WWE Universe, the managerial soul of the production. This remains the core of the experience even in WWE 2K14, since it is capable of guaranteeing months and months of fun on its own. The section, where the gamer is called upon to play a practically infinite season playing a real champion or one created from scratch, is very rich in content. In a special menu are visThe various options are available, the statistics, which matches are scheduled for the evening or in the next few days, the rankings of the federations, the news from the backstage with the relative cases that gradually arise (quarrels, aggressions), and many other functions. The only limit of this section is in many cases linked to the gamer's imagination. In fact, he can build his shows as he sees fit, programming the stories of the athletes in the various shows, deciding the weekly structure of the events, the roster, the rivalries (three per show) and their duration, pay per view such as the King tournament of the Ring, first available in Universe, and so on. The feeling, if you work well, is that of being part of a real world, where you can relive the reality of WWE from the inside, with friendships between athletes that are formed and broken, belts passing from hand in hand and the characters who change their attitude from face to heel. Among other things, WWE 2K14 offers a respectable roster, and among Superstars, Divas and Legends on the disc we find athletes of the caliber of John Cena, the current World Heavyweight Champion, then Randy Orton of the WWE Championship, and the various Triple H, Kane , Daniel Bryan, Alberto Del Rio and the timeless Rey Mysterio. There are also some of the greats of American wrestling history who are no longer properly active, such as ~Stone Cold~ Steve Austin, The Rock and Shawn Michaels. To this plethora of fighters who already in themselves guarantee the product many variations and great longevity, are added those that will be made available in the coming weeks via DLC, for the details of which we refer you to this news, and those that can be recreated from scratch via the usual powerful internal editor of the game. In this mode, up to one hundred Superstars can be created, using optionally the predefined models of 14 heads borrowed from famous fighters. Then, as usual, design new arenas, move sets, finishers, and add story-related elements. Especially the creation of arenas and the fighters' costumes have been expanded, with more basic elements to build from. As if that weren't enough, the player can also modify the existing belts, or create completely new ones, adding entirely customized logos. Xbox 360 goals WWE 2K14 offers gamers 41 goals for a total score of 1,000 points. We start from the simplest ones, which are obtained by winning, within WWE Universe, a generic match or a Money in the Bank using a Created Superstar, or by playing a ranked match on Xbox Live. More tiring are those that give the most points, which require, for example, to win at least 50 matches at the level of difficulty difficult or higher in Universe or Exhibition modes. Small tweaks Once in the ring, things obviously become more serious and the real challenge begins for the user. The clashes take place along the lines of those seen in the past, and in this sense the playability of the title is confirmed to be largely identical to that of the previous edition. In reality, there are some differences, and after the first exchanges of chops and various blows, the most attentive eye cannot fail to notice those small tricks made by the developers on the structure of the gameplay. In particular we have a significant improvement in the speed of action, due in part to the implementation of some new animation in the athletes, which makes some of their movements more fluid and which is also reflected in their reactivity. Mind you, it is not that they have suddenly become perfectly animated and easily controllable, given that there are still some historical defects in the execution of some moves, in the fluctuating artificial intelligence of the characters, as well as in the detection of collisions. But there are certainly some steps forward, and the control system is a little more efficient. Still on the subject of retouches, in addition to those that concern small aspects related to attacks or grips, the execution of which leaves little room for luck or simple hammering of the keys as per tradition, great emphasis has been placed on reversals, which following a discreet restyling have assumed an even more important role than in the past. They can always be used with the right trigger of the pad and are activated whenever the player is about to suffer an attack. In these situations, a special indicator appears above the head of the wrestler being controlled, which for a fraction of a second indicates the right moment to pull the trigger. If successful, a reversal starts which, depending on the positioning of the fighters in the ring, translates into a dodge or a counterattack, to which it is then possible tofollow other moves, perhaps taking advantage of a possible stunning of the opponent who has ended up in the corner or on the ground in the meantime. If vice versa the player fails to press the button in time, the move fails with all the negative consequences of the case. This mechanism restores a certain tacticism to combat, also because both the indicator and the effectiveness of the reversal take into account the fighters' fatigue and state of health, forcing them to always remain vigilant. For the rest, nothing really new: the best features of the 2013 edition are confirmed, such as for example the one introduced just last season relating to the Y key (Triangle in the PlayStation 3 version), which can be used to perform finishers and to perform particular choreographic moves inherent to the context and the position in which the two wrestlers are, linked to the particular function called OMG. When the contender is close to a certain element of the scenario or in a particular position, the aforementioned writing appears on the screen: pressing the right button then starts an interlude sequence which stages a scenographic move, complete with shot changes and cheering to the stars. Barrel on the web As far as the online component is concerned, it was not possible for us to test the product as the servers were not yet fully functional for the European territory. For this reason, we will limit ourselves to briefly describing the methods available for online gaming. Which then in principle are the classic ones of the Yuke's saga, including the possibility of being able to participate in any type of match, such as exhibitions or the Royal Rumble. Closed the brief parenthesis dedicated to the part related to the online functions of WWE 2k14, let's take a look at its technical sector. There are no major differences compared to what was seen in the 2013 edition, due to the limits imposed by the engine adopted and the hardware available. In this sense it is clear that the graphics engine has its years. Having said that, when compared to its predecessor, some positive changes can still be found in the aesthetics of the wrestlers, whose physical features more or less faithfully follow those of their respective real counterparts. We wrote ~more or less~ because some models actually appear disproportionate when compared to the athlete they are supposed to represent, someone else unusual, perhaps due to an excessive shine of the skin or a zombie-like expressiveness. The glance when the contenders enter the scene or when they find themselves fighting on the square, each with its own choreography or moves, still manages to immerse the player in the hubbub of the competition and more generally in the typical climate of the show. Which, regardless of everything, is what this production has always aimed for. The presence of the typical period film effects for the meetings that take place in the 80s is beautiful. The atmosphere that surrounds the event is also involving from an audio point of view, thanks to the behavior of the public, ready to cheer on their favorite, perhaps while he is busy beating up the bad guy mercilessly, or on the other hand to boo a particularly unpopular wrestler, who is beating up a wrestler face. The commentary in English from ringside by the commentators is good, even if there are sometimes some out of place interventions and a certain repetitiveness in certain situations of the match. However we believe that in general, the final result is to be appreciated.", "date": "2013-11-01", "grade": "8.2"}
