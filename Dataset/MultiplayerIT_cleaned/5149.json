If the name of Darksiders doesn't mean anything to you or action isn't your forte, or six years ago you were intent on sobering up your post-Christmas videogame hangover and you missed this pearl that arrived in the very first days of the year, know that you are I missed something exciting. From our original review, the enthusiasm for Darksiders' ability to combine effective gameplay with excellent level design and excellent characterization of the protagonist shines through, embellished by the design of Joe Madureira, one of the most talented contemporary cartoonists around. The result was a particular title with character to sell, capable of being the progenitor of a series paused by the bankruptcy of THQ. Waiting therefore to see the third chapter of the story of the knights of the apocalypse, we played Darksiders: Warmastered Edition on PlayStation 4 with gusto. Darksiders: Warmastered Edition improves on the excellent title of 2010 by improving its graphics and frame rate Nice to see It seems like many more years have passed, but it was only 2010 when games were sold complete on launch day and what you found installed on the console when you first started was what the developers had spent years of hard work and effort on. Barring a few corrective patches, DLCs, expansions or downloadable content of any kind that would enrich the initial offer were not yet in fashion. Darksiders is one of the latest exponents of this philosophy, so in the Warmastered Edition you will find exactly what you found in 2010, only a little better. In fact, the remastered of the Vigil Games title focuses entirely on the new look guaranteed by the greater horses made available by the current generation of consoles which have allowed substantial improvements both from a visual and gameplay point of view, effectively correcting the major criticalities. Last-generation 720p resolution and 30 frames per second pairing saw a massive boost to 1080p and 60 frames per second on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, while it had to stop at 30 frames per second on Wii U with a version halfway between the two generations. For PlayStation 4 Pro owners, there is also the possibility of enjoying War's adventures in 4K always upscaled to 60 frames per second, thus significantly increasing the visual rendering but without having to compromise on the fluidity of the action of game. Doubling the frame rate was perhaps the most significant improvement, given the rich and frenetic gameplay that characterizes Darksiders: being a third-person action game in which more or less complex combos are the only way to make your way through hordes of enemies , the 60 frames per second give the image greater softness and harmony, allowing us to whirl between demons and the undead, always striking precise and punctual blows. To improve the graphic impact there are also a whole series of improvements such as the doubled resolution of the textures, new post-processing effects and the higher quality of the shadows which give greater depth to the suggestive world set up by Joe Madureira and his companions. The skilful use of colors by the American cartoonist remains the most recognizable characteristic touch of the Darksiders style, now as then capable of capturing from the first screen thanks to its captivating protagonist and equally well-characterized antagonists. Playstation 4 trophies Darksiders: Warmastered Edition does not include any new trophies other than those originally available for PlayStation 3. 26 bronze, 13 silver and 3 gold trophies will be required to earn Platinum. Complete the game on apocalypse difficulty, collect all artifacts, fully upgrade weapons and unlock all combat moves. and a good game The artistic direction remains the strong point of the entire production, embellished even more by the excellent renovation work carried out by THQ Nordic to rejuvenate and reinvigorate a title that has plenty of style. However, six years is a long time and some structural problems still persist today. When we talk about remastered it must always be clear that it is a work carried out starting from a pre-existing base and that therefore some critical issues relating to the animations and scenarios that are too bare have remained unchanged. The polygonal models of characters, monsters and objects are affected by the dated technical system, as well as the visual horizons which always tend to be monotonous, losing anycharacterizing detail. However, pad in hand, the cleanliness of the image and the aforementioned granite frame rate in any situation, return an excellent feeling and gaming experience, making us remember in the blink of an eye all the merits that had won us over six years does. From the excellent level design to the variety of settings and the duration of the main plot, quite full-bodied, but never too long-winded and able to avoid dead times by always keeping the pace of the game high thanks to environmental puzzles of different sizes and rather ingenious sections. The Warmastered Edition has therefore returned to us a very enjoyable Darksiders, which however, as mentioned at the beginning, in terms of content does not add anything new compared to the original title. Having no DLC or other additional content, today's version is a photocopy of that of 2010, a factor that could lead some players to find little interest in completing the War adventures again. In this sense we would not have disdained a more substantial collection that also included the Deathinitive Edition of Darksiders II. For all those who have never come into contact with the title of Vigil Game, this is a very propitious opportunity also considering the very correct price of  19.99 of the digital version.", "date": "2016-11-29", "grade": "8.3"}
