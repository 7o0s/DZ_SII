{"name": "Hospital Tycoon - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hospital-tycoon-recensione.html", "text": "We talked about a ~story~ mode, which is proposed as the main game mode. In fact the story, somehow, tries to be there, developing in three series each of four chapters. We say ~search~ because unfortunately, in addition to a couple of nurses who compete for the little doctor on duty, who in turn vies for the crown of contention with the new little doctor on duty and some minor intrigue, we don't hear of history great perfume. The chapters of the various series unfold in an excessively linear way and the feeling of following a plot is really rarefied, to the point of struggling to follow the details. Unfortunately, the Italian localization does not help, due to the various grammatical errors and typos that pop up here and there in dialogues and menus. In short, it pains us to say it, but we found ourselves faced with a really rough job, which certainly cannot facilitate identification or involvement in the already fragile narrative plot. It is true that this plot actually aims to give an ironic reinterpretation of the main themes of the great television series with a medical hospital background, but frankly the irony and humor that we have managed to capture are really of little depth, and make you smile perhaps because the first minutes of the game. 1... 2... 3... free! Ehr, no, the system broke Of course, the focal point of the game is not being close to the romantic relationships of doctors and nurses, even if the part that is composed of it is by no means secondary. In reality, however, the main goal of success in the game is to better manage the entire hospital facility. Following, as is logical, all the medical progress of our patients and trying to make sure that the structure is adapted to the diseases that will arise in order to always be able to treat our patients. Patients will flow from the hall entrance to present themselves at the reception desk, from where they will then be sorted and directed towards the diagnostician, in the case of unknown diseases, or towards the related medical facilities. Each level will feature roughly a couple of new diseases, which will need to be diagnosed and will require you to build new medical facilities in order to cure them. Once these two steps have been taken, we will naturally have to hire the necessary personnel, including doctors, surgeons, technicians and nurses. The inevitable cleaners and plant maintenance personnel will also be needed. Which have a tendency to break every few uses. There will also be some random events, which will try to break the routine of the game, such as epidemic diseases or visits from the inspectorate. In principle, however, the game proceeds on tracks of extreme linearity, in an absolutely repetitive way and completely devoid of any imagination or commitment. Yes, diseases are nice, the poor victims of golf fights, with a ball stuck in the eye and a club rolled up like a scarf make you smile. The pestilential flatulence called ~wind~ will be fun to treat by making the patients bounce in hyperbaric chambers which are actually made up of elastic mattresses... but frankly they too are disarming in their insanity. Beautiful woman, but hips a bit angular The graphics that accompany the game certainly do not help to increase its enjoyment. For heaven's sake, it's a managerial on an ironic basis, we don't expect the Crysis engine... but a little more care would have been really welcome. There are too many defects that catch the eye even at the maximum detail allowed by the settings. The characters are cut with a cutter and although they want to be grotesque for the sake of an ironic setting, in the end they are just ugly. As for the settings... we see things that would have been fine many years ago, but which today are frankly too poor, especially in light of the latest sim games and the same other titles in the Tycoon or Theme series. An extremely careless title, this, starting from the localization which too often contains unforgivable flaws, such as the ~credits~ button which is translated into ~Thanks~. Except that it does not enter the entire key to be clicked and then goes to the beginning, becoming ~thank you - you~. The ~n~ gets lost along the way. Or the ~villain~ bar in the character menu turning ~mauve~ because it didn't fully fit. Comments We don't know what else to say about a title that certainly offers itself as fun to spend a couple of hours of leisure without engaging the brain. If taken in its managerial nature, given the absolute scarcity of basic management tools, while the advanced ones are absolutely absent, one for all the economic system, we must necessarilywhat to definitely advise against. If taken as a grotesque parody of the soap opera plots of hospital television series... then we can all but laugh. But only two. The game mechanics are the most repetitive and tedious we have seen, the freedom of action is zero and what is built in a mission, including the accumulated resources, are reset in the next. The free-build mode is simply too poor to consider. Let's hope so for another title. Pro A couple of hours without brain It can be fun. Cons Linear ad boredom Graphically below the limits of sufficiency Vulgar and grotesque narrative diseases and plots System requirements Test system requirements: Windows XP SP2 with DirectX 9.0 AMD Athlon 3.2+ / 2.00 GHz RAM: 1.5 GB NVIDIA GeForce 7600GS 512 No slowdowns or problems have been reported. Hospital-themed managerial games are not new to our PCs, the old Theme Hospital had inaugurated the genre. Hospital Tycoon, several years after its forerunner, intends to bring back to our screens a title that engages us between waiting rooms, diagnostics and surgery, without disdaining some soap opera-style elements that won't make you turn up your nose (or maybe yes) to Grey's Anatomy fans. through a series of more or less schematic actions whose sole purpose is to proceed with the management without letting too many patients die. In fact, even if it should unfortunately happen that a patient passes away by collapsing at the foot of a coffee machine... nobody will notice it at all. Except the hospital results bar, which however won't petulate in any way.", "date": "2007-07-17", "grade": null}
