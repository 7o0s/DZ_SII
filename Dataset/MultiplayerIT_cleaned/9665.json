The stories of Onimusha or, in a completely different way, those of Afro Samurai (game based on the manga series of the same name by Takashi Okazaki) are just two of the numerous examples that testify to what was claimed. On the iPhone in particular Samurai 2: Vengeance presents itself as a very valid exponent of the genre which, however, despite being the sequel to Way of The Warrior, differs in some ways in a substantial way. Violence is nothing without control Already at a first quick glance it is easy to see how the element that marks the immediate separation between the two titles is certainly the control system: Samurai: Way of The Warrior included elements that were both innovative and unsettling at the same time. The movement of the main character for example, i.e. the samurai Daisuke, was in fact delegated to the pressure of the finger along the frontal portions of the free road, while the attacks were performed by quickly swiping the fingertips over the enemies (reminiscent of the hilarious Fruit Ninja) . In Samurai 2: Vengeance, however, everything falls within the classic canons of any action game: movement via virtual analog stick and interaction via the usual weak attack, strong attack and dodge keys. A scheme that, while losing in originality, certainly acquires ease of handling and intuitiveness. The ability to change the position of the buttons on the screen as desired then offers a further degree of customization, obviating the inconveniences that the size of the hands can cause when playing on a small touch screen. Unfortunately, nothing new to report on the gameplay front: like the vast majority of titles belonging to the scrolling fighting game genre, 99% of the time will be spent quickly pressing the 3 action keys, chaining the available combos. The latter can be used upon purchase, through Karma points (released by enemies with each killing or by shattering the vases scattered in the arenas); each combo is upgradeable up to the third level, as is the life bar. However, the RPG elements end here: the growth of the character is therefore limited only to varying the attack but, given the very dynamic context, this choice does not appear entirely wrong. The presence of small environmental puzzles, absolutely irrelevant to the mechanics of the game, ultimately represents only an excuse to regain sensitivity to the fingers, victims of repeated furious pressures, being, among other things, the exploratory component null. The story around which the story unfolds, narrated during the change of chapters from beautiful hand-drawn comics, tells the long journey of the brave samurai in search of the demon Orochi, an enemy of a lifetime. Daisuke's pilgrimage will see him cross dangerous forests, villages to be cleaned up and flying islands, along 7 different stages, driven only by the desire for revenge that he will vent abundantly against the various enemies scattered along the way. These are basically divided into two categories, namely the archers (annoying because they attack from afar) and the warriors, in turn differentiated into different sub-categories, of increasing power and resistance. However, facing the various opponents will not require much tactics: it will be enough to swing more or less intensely, dodging attacks from time to time and causing copious losses of blood. Just Blood is one of the constant elements in the killings of the brave warrior; in addition to the normal splashes that arise with each successful hit, it will frequently happen to finish off an enemy with spectacular slow motion, a prelude to violent beheadings or dismemberments a la ~Goemon~ (Lupin's samurai, for the few who don't know him). In a purely hack and slash game like this, violence is an absolutely natural element; however, the particularly bloody way in which the final killings take place is mitigated by the ~anime~ style of the game, created precisely as if we were faced with a real interactive comic. The graphics engine used, called Unity 3D 3.0, manages in this incarnation to create an incredible game environment to look at, while also remaining perfectly scalable: Samurai 2: Vengeance is in fact available for all iOS devices starting from iPhone 3G, thanks to the great adaptability of the aforementioned polygonal engine. However, the highest quality will inevitably come with the new Apple-branded devices: running on the iPhone 4 or iPad, the game undergoes a sort of transfiguration, showing an HD resolution accompaniedfrom an incredible framerate of 60 fps, only occasionally affected in their granitic fluidity (during particularly agitated phases there may be small jerks which in any case will not worsen the gaming experience). An amazing result, to which must be added the good soundtrack, with well-contextualized oriental music, and the audio effects of the various enemies, which seem taken from the classic oriental martial arts B-movies. Longevity stands at 2/3 hours (if played intensely), but thanks to the Dojo mode it will be possible to take advantage of a sort of Survival Mode, with hordes of increasingly aggressive enemies to be faced in succession.
