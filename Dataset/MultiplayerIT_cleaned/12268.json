In the video game, up to four competitors in Multiplayer can challenge each other in a whole series of modes that are substantially similar to each other (change a few small rules) by taking advantage of peripherals such as Eye Toy and Buzz! to increase its longevity and enjoyment. In the first case, it is possible to customize one's virtual alter ego (before starting a quiz session one must in fact select a funny character who represents one of the many available) by inserting one's face within the game. With Buzz! instead you can perform new actions such as stealing a question, passing it to your opponents or using double risk by trusting in the error of the other competitor. Which among other things is quite probable given that among the over a thousand new questions available there are some very difficult ones already in the first lines. Graphically Who Wants to Be a Millionaire looks elegant and visually identical to the television counterpart, with a faithfully reproduced game interface and virtual competitors, those who represent us in the game, cute and quite crazy in their pseudo-deformed style physical characterization. The audio is also beautiful, with the appropriate music and above all the voice of Gerry Scotti to formulate the questions which will then have to be answered. Conclusions It's not always easy to make a video game up to par from a successful TV program, not so much for the technical part, but rather for the concept or setting, the structure, but in this case Eidos has managed to hit the target. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire is the faithful videogame transposition of Gerry Scotti's nice quiz, but in an edition that is more complete than in the past editions, in some ways ~innovative~ (support for Eyetoy and Buzz!). Not a masterpiece, and God forbid given the type of game, but certainly an excellent party game, fun and able to offer great entertainment especially in the evenings with friends. Side note: the vote must obviously be taken into consideration in relation to the type of game. Pros: Hilarious. Multiplayer up to 4 players. Sony Buzz! and Eyetoys. Cons: Some PCs a little obnoxious. Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Party Edition is available on PC and PlayStation 2. The tested version is the PlayStation 2 version. It's these days the news that Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, a television quiz show hosted by Gerry Scotti, has achieved record ratings in its last few months of programming. From the TV to the console, the step was short, and the two ~things~ almost went hand in hand, in symbiosis, even the sales figures of the videogame counterpart of the aforementioned show were more than positive. On the other hand, already a few years ago Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? it had been one of the best-selling games in all of Europe and especially in England and Italy. In short, Eidos has seen us right, and with this edition called ~Party Edition~ it seems to have hit the mark once again. The formula behind the game is the classic one of the TV show of the same name, which we are going to ~review~. Ten contestants compete to win the 1 million prize pool. The player is called to pass an initial test, a question, after which, having defeated the other nine opponents, he will be able to access the actual game and attempt the climb towards the ~super-prize~, through 15 questions and a progressive jackpot , until the end, of one million euros. If the competitor answers correctly, he continues in the game, if he is wrong he is eliminated. If he fails between questions 1 and 4, the win is zero, between 5 and 9 he wins 500 Euros, between 10 and 14, he wins 16 thousand Euros. If, on the other hand, the competitor voluntarily gives up on continuing the game (he can do so at any time) he takes home the amount earned up to then. In case of doubts or various difficulties, the competitor can resort to three bonuses: the so-called ~50%~ with which the shortlist of answers is reduced to two; ~the phone call home~ with which you ask for help from a friend/relative who in a lapse of time of 30 seconds will have to help the competitor find the correct answer (in the video game everything is simulated, there will be a fake call and some fake virtual friends on the other end of the phone); ~the help of the public~ in the studio which, using a push-button panel, gives a percentage indication of the correct answer.", "date": "2007-05-18", "grade": null}
