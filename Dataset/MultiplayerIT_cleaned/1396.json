{"name": "Gladiator - Sword of Vengeance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gladiator-sword-of-vengeance-2.html", "text": "Copy paper As written at the beginning, Gladiator - Sword of Vengeance is ~inspired~ by the famous film ~Gladiator~, taking up its setting as well as part of the plot: the elderly emperor who is assassinated and replaced by an evil character, against whom he lashes out the wrath of the protagonist. Of course, the development of the story is quite different, due to ~script requirements~: in the new Acclaim title, the fights are a fundamental element and everything else is pure side dish. Even the concept of exploration is not explored at all by the developers, who have created rather repetitive and banal scenarios, however fixing the view and allowing the player only a useless ~zoom~ on the controlled character. Fights in the foreground, I said, in the best tradition of ~slash'em up~. The problem, however, lies in how this aspect of the game, moreover of fundamental importance, was developed. The character has two types of attack available with his weapon, the execution of which must be combined to obtain combos of different types and effectiveness. While one key is intended for jumping and another for action (use of objects, etc.), it is possible to ~lock-on~ an enemy using the Dual Shock 2's shoulder keys. On balance, this function does not turns out to be useful as it should: being impossible to parry enemy attacks, with an evasive maneuver as the only way of defense against a sudden blow, hooking an opponent has the only use of not dispersing the attacks and eliminating the threat in the shortest possible time. All without the possibility of carrying out ~mixed~ attacks, which knock out one or more enemies to reorganize the maneuver, especially when you are faced with a group of ten skeletons hungry for blood... Needless to talk about grips, then. The only variations compared to the basic two or three combo routine are represented by the special attack (which can be performed when the relative bar is full) and by the possibility of using different weapons (once collected, of course) depending on their suitability for a given fight . Nothing transcendental in both elements: the special attack leaves something to be desired in terms of power and spectacularity, while the weapons obtainable during the game are very few. The presence of improbable ~fatality~ for the toughest enemies does not improve the situation. In short, Gladiator's mechanics are too repetitive, offer little variety and practically no relevant elements outside of the fights. The numerous tests that the character must undergo to amplify their powers do not go beyond the killing of a certain number of enemies or the destruction of some boxes within a time limit. Which, the latter, is damned difficult due to the ~anchoring~ system I praised earlier: the character is able to jump half a screen to hit an enemy, and in doing so he doesn't even touch the target of the trial. Here, I forgot to mention the bad collision detection, as well as the absolute absence of any enhancement every time the shots hit: the characters always move in the same way, there is no feeling of ~impact~ and the sound effects do not help at all in this sense, given their poverty. The other side of the coin If you have reached this point in the review without concluding that Gladiator is a product of little interest, perhaps because the setting intrigues you, I can tell you that the game, despite everything, boasts several strengths. First of all, the graphic design: the developers have put into this product some of the best lighting effects that have ever been seen on a console, and moreover they have used them in an intelligent way. In this case, the solar flare was used to distinguish the ~alive~ and ~dead~ game phases of Invictus, and above all the ~introductory~ section is impressive from this point of view. The protagonist has been drawn well, the use of polygons in general is very generous and the slowdowns can be counted on the fingers of one hand (but there are, watch out). While on the one hand details such as blood and corpses left over from battles amaze with their quality, on the other hand the level design is generally not very inspired and the enemies are not very numerous. The sound effects, as anticipated, are not what one might expect from such a production. To raise the average of the sound sector, the music takes care of it, of a certain quality and rather suitable for the setting, even if it slavishly follows some popular film soundtrack.Comment Gladiator  Sword of Vengeance amazes for the graphic design and above all for the special effects inserted by the developers. Unfortunately, the lack of a valid game structure, which supplements the glance, is also surprising: there are only fights, and the problem is that facing them soon becomes boring and repetitive. The vein of scrolling fighting games is intrinsically not very varied, I agree, but this deficiency can be remedied with the inclusion of numerous moves, with the possibility of moving between enemies with a pinch of strategy and with the presence of multiple characters controllable (even in multiplayer). Evidently, in the development of Gladiator no attention was paid to the ~historical precedents~ of its videogame genre. Pros: Exceptional light effects Music suitable for the setting Dubbed in Italian, and also good Cons: Too repetitive Levels poorly made Combat system to be reviewed in some points Rome, 106 after Christ. The emperor Trajan is assassinated by the insane Arruntius, who succeeds him to the throne and establishes a dictatorship based exclusively on his person, forcing his subjects to worship him as a god. There is only one obstacle to Arruntius' design: the undefeated gladiator Invictus Thrax, Trajan's faithful servant and living icon of the previous emperor's values. To get rid of it, Arruntius organizes an unprecedented show, in which Invictus will have to fight alone against dozens of powerful warriors. This is where you come into play: under the command of the powerful gladiator, you will have to exterminate all the opponents that Arruntius will send against you, taking the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the game control system. A strong performance on your part won't change the ending of this prologue, though: Invictus is slaughtered in front of thousands of spectators, to the delight of the evil emperor. The gods don't abandon the brave warrior, though. Awakened after his death in the Elysian Fields, Invictus is faced with none other than Romulus and Remus in the form of children: Trajan was respectful of the gods, while Arruntius would like to replace them. The people's lack of faith has weakened the immortals, who want to take revenge at the hands of the gladiator. So Invictus Thrax is subjected to a tough test, during which he will acquire the powers necessary to return to Rome and restore the right order...", "date": "2004-02-10", "grade": null}
