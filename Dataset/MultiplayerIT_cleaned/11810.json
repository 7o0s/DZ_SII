{"name": "Crash of the Titans - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-of-the-titans-recensione.html", "text": "When the Crash Bandicoot character made his first appearance on the newborn Playstation ten years ago, many were ready to name him the first real mascot of the Sony console. Unfortunately, history has shown how the Playstation project is very unaccustomed to mascots and poor Crash, after three platformers of fluctuating luck, was abandoned by the creators Naughty Dog, who switched to the development of Jak & Daxter. Passing from hand to hand and systematically losing more and more verve, the franchise passed from Traveller's Tale, to Vicarious Visions, and finally to Amaze Entertainment who - armed with all their good will - have promised to bring the most famous peramele back to its former glory of the gaming industry. A difficult undertaking, without a doubt, taking into account the fact that the strength of Crash Bandicoot has always been only one: the absolute simplicity of the game mixed with a context rich in tragicomic characters. A blend of explosive fun. In search of the lost Mojo Crash of the Titans, in addition to paraphrasing a famous 80s fantasy film on the myth of Perseus (~Clash of the titans~), is the title of this new adventure by Crash Bandicoot which, since its first steps, wants to simultaneously the basis for a bridge between the first chapters of the saga and a new possible evolutionary line. The story behind Crash of the Titans is not so dissimilar from the classic situations surrounding the Bandicoot: the evil doctor Neo Cortex wants to dominate the world. This is the substance of the facts, which - going into the detail of the situation - tells of the doctor who comes into possession of the 'Mojo', a magical liquid capable of subjecting the peaceful inhabitants of Wumpa Island to his will. It will be Crash's job to stop the advent of the forces of evil once again, thanks to the help of his usual companions and the ever-faithful Aku Aku, the mask capable of giving him immense powers. As mentioned a few lines above, Crash of the Titans proves to be a game capable of combining what was good in the first appearances of the series, with a whole series of new solutions capable of rejuvenating the game structure and re-proposing itself to the best on Nintendo DS. The game structure is the same as always (spin offs excluded, of course), the protagonist moves within limited 3D environments, where it is not so much the freedom of exploration granted to the player that dominates, but the very classic platforms that they draw the topography of the levels to be explored. 'Platforming' is once again the setting chosen to shape Crash of the Titans, but unlike the Bandicoot's previous appearances, a large part of the gameplay is dedicated to fighting against enemies: no longer relegated to simply pressing a key to execute the pinwheel attack (that of Taz, to understand) or the eternal jump on the opponents' heads, now the player is required to fight using a -much more boring and monotonous- system of combos based on punches and kicks. Crash's physiognomy has definitely changed: in an attempt to make him more mature, aggressive and in step with the times, the developers have created a new look for him with tattoos that replace the gloves and a punk-derived crest. In this process of rejuvenation, the protagonist's way of expressing himself has also undergone a radical change, going on to react to situations and dialogues through a series of guttural sounds which enhance the ironic atmosphere that permeates the game (often the dialogues are overlapped actual recorded laughter, as if the game were actually a film being shown in a movie theater full of laughter-loving audiences). Sliding Aku Aku The whole game bases its structure between the islands that Crash visits to save the inhabitants from their sad fate and to destroy Cortex's certainties one after the other (Cortex himself, due to his ineptitude, at a certain point in the game will sidelined by the real villain. We won't reveal anything else so as not to spoil the surprise...). Each level can be undertaken in two different modes: classic and time attack, while the first mode is limited to following the story itself, the second offers players a different type of challenge to the level, putting Crash on the mount of the animal of turn inside a vertically scrolling level (actually the level doesn't scroll, but the ridden animal can only be controlled to the right and left) in search of masks, souls and precious points. The souls collected during the levels are essentially used for the first two real novelties of the game: the pachinko and the upgrade menu. While the first is a totally independent game from the story, the upgrade menu allows the player to upgrade Crash's abilities, improving his combos, attack, defense or simply speed. Contrary to what one might think, Crash of the Titans on Nintendo Ds doesn't make great use of the possibilities brought into play by the touch screen, limiting itself to a few - and not too relevant - features. One of these (certainly the most used and important) is the one concerning the use of Aku Aku, the voodoo mask that has always helped Crash in his adventures, no longer usable during the levels as an invulnerability (provided you collect three in the course of the level), but as a tool to take possession of the enemy's body for short periods. To perform this move, the player must, with the stylus, throw the Aku Aku mask found on the touch screen in the direction of the enemy: if the move is successful, the player will be given the opportunity to use the moves of the captured opponent against every other enemy on screen. Although the desire and effort to create a new ideal world for Crash exists and is tangible, the work done by Amaze Entertainment is unfortunately only half done: if the insertion of moves based on combos can be a breath of fresh air fresh, on the other hand it is clear that this insertion makes crash very similar to dozens and dozens of other platformers based on the same structure. Unfortunately, the touch screen was little considered in the development phase (apart from a couple of exploits) and the visual rejuvenation of poor Crash was achieved in a direction that is unlikely to satisfy fans of the series. However, not everything is to be thrown away, the character growth system gives space to a series of new evolutionary paths in the series, as well as the use of the Aku Aku mask to 'possess' enemy skills and thus continue on one's path. Graphically Crash of the Titans does not particularly disappoint but it will certainly not come as the greatest exponent of the genre, a separate discussion for the whole sound sector, often disappointing and very little suited to the style of the game. One thing must be said: it's hard to be a platformer when the king of the genre is a certain Mario. It's difficult because Mario can afford to fight Bowser for the past twenty years without actually having tired the fans yet. Crash Bandicoot, on the other hand, has now entered a phase where the main characters and supporting actors now have little to say and give, it is therefore normal for the developers to find themselves with a double responsibility, having to rejuvenate the series and at the same time keep it for those who, with peramele , started playing 10 years ago. The work done by Amaze Entertainment is a good first step, but still not enough to revive a series that still seems to have some arrows from its side. Pros: Character growth mode New use of Aku Aku It's Crash Bandicoot... Cons: ...it's Crash Bandicoot New look too extreme Underused touch screen Combo system trivial and boring in the long run", "date": "2007-11-21", "grade": null}
