{"name": "Into the Pit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/into-the-pit-recensione.html", "text": "The nostalgia effect is a goal that many producers (not just videogames) try to achieve nowadays: partly for a real sense of affection towards a past creation or trend, partly for the relative simplicity of building on the foundations stable and already run in instead of starting all over again. The second option is the one chosen by Nullpointer Games for its Into the Pit, a first-person roguelite that draws from the videogame culture of the late twentieth century and reworks (in a decidedly ~cunning~ way) the basic concepts to adapt them to the current market. In this review of Into the Pit we illustrate why it is a title to try (especially since it is also available on Xbox Game Pass), but also to be approached with distrust. A narrative pretext Into the Pit: the Village, the nerve center of our adventure Usually, you don't approach a roguelite because you place great expectations in the story being told. Indeed, most of the time this is just an ~excuse~ to kick off the game action. Into the Pit is no exception. The adventure catapults us into a distinctly fantastic world, in which we play the role of a ~mystic~ in search of his cousin, who disappeared immediately after finding a demonic ~pit~ at the foot of a small village. In order to understand what happened to the girl, we must delve into the depths of the dark dimensional rift. This is the summary of the story behind the game. Nothing too elaborate, but still in line with what is proposed by other titles. However, this does not mean that the game is justified in offering a small narrative sector. In fact, in various similar adventures, to replace the void of a consistent and significant main plot, we generally find a whole contextual undergrowth capable of building, one piece at a time, interest in the environment to be explored. The examples of the past have given ample proof of the effectiveness of this ~staging~, yet Into the Pit seems to lose this boat too, proposing too little narrative content, unable to create a strong and lasting attachment between the player and the world of game. A classic roguelite Into the Pit: the room from which to access the various realms of the pit The game features the classic roguelite structure, with several procedural elements as well. Before descending into the pit, the player has the option to choose the ~realm~ in which to venture and some permanent abilities. A normal game consists of five levels. To help you better understand the structure of the latter, imagine a square area outlined by four walls. On each of them there are two portals that lead to the rooms where the actual action will take place. The player is left with the possibility of choosing which portal to cross, depending on the reward he wants to obtain (highlighted with a symbol above each arch). Until a room is chosen on each of the four walls, it will not be possible to proceed to the next level. The game ends when the player dies, or when he manages to reach the fifth level and defeat the boss. Into the Pit: An example of chests, which are only available in certain rooms Back in the village, we can improve and expand our roster of starting skills thanks to various vendors (unlockable as you save the villagers lost in the pit). And, as per tradition, the cycle essentially continues until you get tired of playing. The peculiarity of Into the Pit is the fact that each game is never the same, but not only due to its procedural nature, but also for the ability to mix ~biomes~ (six in total) and unlock different combinations of environments and enemies to face. A world of anniversaries Into the Pit: environments and situations are often repeated If the possibility of merging different characteristics is interesting on paper, it becomes a little less so when you are actually in contact with the reality of the game. As interesting as an intuition, it is undeniable that this choice was made to mask the lack of variety in the maps, which are repeated very often (even during the first game). The design of places and enemies changes, but the rest remains almost unchanged ( including the skills of the opponents, all very similar, differentiated only by some status effects). This leads, after very few hours of play, to know perfectly environments, patterns and position of enemies and objects, practically eliminating the learning parable and making the whole process of descending into the pit something extremely mechanical and calculated, at times without a real challenge. Gameplay frenetic Into the Pit: The action is fast and needs reactivity Fortunately, when it comes to plain and simple gameplay, Into the Pit seems to fit the bill better. The game is without a doubt a shooter. As soon as you go down into the pit, the player is given the opportunity to choose (among three randomly provided options) a type of spell (which we could call ~burst of fire~) for each hand and an ability defensive. Each time, therefore, the attack strategy will inevitably be a little different, given that you have to adapt to the fighting style (closer or from a distance, or a mixture of both) depending on the spells available. From the moment you set foot in the first arena (maybe due to the somewhat retro graphic style, may be due to the demonic context), your mind immediately returns to the splatter frenzy of the Doom saga. In fact, the gameplay resembles that of id Software titles. Hyperkinetic and addicted to speed of action, it seems to be for minutes to clear a room, when in truth only a handful of seconds have passed. Which isn't a bad thing. Indeed, this time dilation pushes to complete the picture as quickly as possible, so as to improve one's time. The frenzy of the game is always kept high (at least on PC) by a speed of interactions capable of eliminating dead moments. The simplicity of the screens and the responsiveness of the controls allow you to move quickly from one arena to another, a key feature for a title with this pace. Visually nostalgic, technically problematic Into the Pit: Visually the game is very pleasing A few images are enough to notice the attention paid to the visual sector of Into the Pit. With a nostalgic eye, the game pays homage to videogame history, but also manages to make it current, through well-designed light effects and a varied color palette, used in a very original way. It is not one of those universal styles, able to please everyone, but surely a niche will be able to appreciate the work behind the title. However, there is a ~but~. Despite being graphically inspired, the game is technically very dirty. Between imprecise hit-boxes and various interpenetrations (it often happens that the character gets stuck in the walls, which in a game where movement is fundamental, is equivalent to a ~game over~), Into the Pit, at times, is so beautiful that see how frustrating to play.", "date": "2021-10-31", "grade": "6.8"}
