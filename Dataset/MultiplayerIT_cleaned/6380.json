Yes, you understood correctly: it is far too big and full-bodied because, in addition to the announced set dedicated to Animal Crossing, a free update has arrived at the same time which introduces support for further amiibo and, above all, the 200cc category (so far, as you know , the maximum reached was 150). It is even obvious to underline how fruitful it can be to spend eight Euros for all this goodness (or twelve, if you have already purchased the package with the first DLC); but, when we wrote that the proposal is exaggeratedly rich, we weren't being ironic. Nintendo could have dosed these updates more carefully, postponing the 200cc class to the next few months: whether it was just a gamble or there is something underneath, whether this huge block has been published to leave visibility for other games or in view of a third DLC , well, we'll know just by waiting. Basically, EAD let us eat in a luxury restaurant for ten Euros, and once there he offered us an equally delicious and substantial course, making the overeating, with annexed daze, the foregone conclusion: the tasting overwhelmed by greed. During digestion we tried to separate - and appreciate - the distinct flavors, but it wasn't easy. We will try to explain why. Eight tracks, three racers, four vehicles and a new engine capacity - is it as good as it sounds? Oh yes. Here I am. Pilots, wasps and racing cars The Animal Crossing set is comparable to the one appreciated months ago, dedicated to Zelda, to which it also shares the same price: eight new tracks (including four remakes) and four additional vehicles, plus three characters (as well as a hang glider and an unpublished tire pack). Enough material to fill months of play, as anticipated a few lines ago. Unlike that in the first DLC, this time none of the new characters originates a ~personal~ category, however it enriches the previously introduced ones: Fuffi enlarges the already large troop of the light ones (that of Toad and Lakitu, to be clear), the female Inhabitant approaches Peach the Cat (of the medium-light weight runners), the male Inhabitant to Mario Tanooki (exactly in the middle between the heavy and the light), Skelobowser finally joins the three highly selected thugs, namely Wario, Bowser and Morton Koopa. Overall, therefore, the choice widens and the sagas contemplated increase. Skeletal Bowser is a luxury alternative, much more interesting than golden Peach, and the characters of Animal Crossing, as well as its settings, go well with the aesthetics of the game: certainly more than Hyrule, which in fact had been - rightly - sprinkled with sugar before being baptized as a circuit. Moving on to the new vehicles, the steed dedicated to Skelobowser is a bony and fiery quad, which will only interest the - few but tough - lovers of this vehicle. Let's imagine that the P-wing Bludger, an unexpected homage to the coveted ~wing~ of Super Mario Bros. 3, and the very tender Scarabuggy, an ill-concealed lightning bolt of war with the same characteristics as the Blue Falcon, will have more luck. To conclude the epic ~vespa~, here prosaically referred to as Scooter Crossing: it shares the characteristics with traditional karts, but deserves a try even just for its appearance (extremely different from character to character, among other things). The hang glider and tires are also Animal Crossing themed, but they don't stand out for their creativity. The new, old circuits Mario Kart 8 is one of those rare blessed games in which any risk turns into a brilliant success, in full Super Mario Galaxy style; Yabuki and his companions have brought the average quality of the track design to such high levels as to make any comparison with the predecessors useless. The eight new tracks are distributed in two trophies, Crossing and Campanella, hybridizing remakes and new tracks: the total of circuits now amounts to forty-eight, a record for the series, but the quantity does not however corrupt the adamantine brilliance of the design. Stentorian labels aside, a distinction needs to be made between remakes and remakes: Koopa City is nearly identical (beautifully identical) to its Nintendo 3DS counterpart, while Ribbon Road is essentially a new track from the Game Boy Advance original. Nintendo has proven courageous in drawing without hesitation from Mario Kart: Super Circuit, the least sold of the series (eighth chapter excluded) but one of the peaks in terms of circuit design, here dynamized and glorified by polygons and anti-gravity. The Terra del Formaggio belongs to this category, a sandy track which, although it does not shine for innovation, manages to combine the irregularity of the terrain with the technicality of the curves, made even more risky by the marked verticality of the track.or. One of the best desert tracks in the series, even if not at the level of the magnificent Tartosso Desert. The aforementioned Strada del Fiocco, in addition to being beautiful to look at in its playful ambitions, offers a circuit full of curves and with risky shortcuts, which is also quite demanding. Black sheep of the remakes is Baby Park, the famous and controversial track from the Gamecube era, a short seven-lap oval in which you double and you are double-crossed in an orgiastic throwing of shells: the anti-gravity further encourages the fight and, at 200cc, it literally makes your head spin. An unrefined track, but characteristic and unique. The fourth and last remake is Koopa City, as mentioned very similar to the Nintendo 3DS edition, with some more effects and some less puddles; in summary, the Monte Carlo Circuit is to Formula One what Koopa City is to Mario Kart. Almost unique among the polygonal tracks for the brazen skill required, a jewel that will test your coolness (and the acoustic tolerance of the neighbours). Among the new ones, the awaited Animal Crossing, while remarkable in some respects - from the music to the changing seasons - is certainly not the best: it is beautiful and varied, but it does not overflow with genius. La Mariopolitana is an excellent street circuit, which balances well (rare feat) the balance between obstacles to avoid and paths to follow. The Boscodromo is perhaps the most graphically beautiful track among the new ones, the atmosphere is enchanted but the track takes on completeness only through the new 200cc mode: the setting is in Mario Kart Wii style, or rather a wide course with long and soft curves , all too ~comfortable~ at low speeds. We close with Big Blue, the second circuit dedicated to F-Zero: it belongs to the long tracks, made up of a single lap segmented into three sections. The track is exceptional: fast, rapid and dangerous, it varies in alternating jumps, parabolic curves and accelerators. 200 per hour And here we are at the 200cc, which comes with an update - we repeat - free and separate from the Animal Crossing set. A strange and unpredictable move, given that it is probably the most significant introduction among those observed so far; on the net it praises ~Mario Kart 9~, we prefer to say that this displacement leads the series towards hitherto unexplored terrains. And it provides such a different perspective from the usual as to shine even the old circuits: for this reason at the beginning we wrote that, had it arrived in a few months, it would probably have been tasted more calmly and carefully. Until now, there were two ways to play Mario Kart, one as a novice and one as an expert: with two buttons (gas and weapons) and three (gas, weapons and drifts) respectively. This mode transforms it into a ~four-button~ game, a feature which, so called, might seem less important than it actually is: the fact is that at 200cc, more often than not, you have to press the brake during cornering. Sometimes it needs to be touched, others pressed for a few seconds with the risk of losing grip. For historical players it is a modification halfway between revolutionary and disturbing, because it forces you to face the (often well-known) circuits by contemplating another variable. If at 150cc you do everything possible to accelerate, from stunts to the disputed ~fire hopping~, at 200cc speed must be dosed: it is a totally different approach to the game. It is necessary to limit the power of your vehicle, sometimes leaving the gas, sometimes pressing the brake, still others by avoiding the accelerations allowed by the ramps and boosters. It is undoubtedly a more technical and demanding experience than usual, a nice alternative that cannot and will never be able to dethrone the classic 150cc, precisely because of its excessive difficulty. A consideration that in no way undermines the beauty of this modality which, once tamed, gives more adrenaline-pumping sensations than those usually granted by the series. Some circuits are exalted and find full maturity only at this speed (such as the Electrodrome), others force you to torture your thumbs to reach the first position, in an exhausting alternation between braking and sudden accelerations. All tracks, without distinction, require a different interpretation with respect to the lower engine capacity. A fascinating and engaging mode, which will not be appreciated by everyone: due to lack of skill, patience or, more simply, due to a different conception of Mario Kart. Finally, we underline that at 200cc, having exceeded 10,000 points, at the moment there are few challengers. And let's point out a single, significant lack: given the originality of this approach, Nintendo should have extended the time trials to this engine capacity too, because now the only way to explore the tracks isthe most brutal and bloody one, namely the race.", "date": "2015-04-27", "grade": null}
