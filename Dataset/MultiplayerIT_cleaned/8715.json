Evidently the son of R.U.S.E., with whom it shares the IRISZOOM engine, Wargame: European Escalation includes 361 faithfully reproduced military units, a structured multiplayer compartment and 150 square kilometers maps. The desire for realism, combined with the scale of the title, makes this formula difficult to balance but also allows a simple skirmish to be a well-rounded experience. The strategic also does not give up on giving us a long, complex campaign with an articulated plot. The story is set at the end of 1975, with Europe on the brink of crisis and with the two Germanys, at the time divided by the Iron Curtain and the famous Berlin Wall, ready to enter into conflict. War explodes on the edge of the border between the two sides, right during the first game mission, and drags all eight nations that make up NATO and the Pact into war. Not real but realistic Getting familiar with the wide-ranging strategy of Wargame: European Escalation is not easy. The size of the maps, combined with the ability to make vehicles travel quickly on the road, influences movement tactics quite realistically. The ability to move vehicles quickly allows you to quickly place tanks and infantry that must be exploited in detail since the engine brings the game closer to reality by including real shooting distances in the statistics and credible in terms of proportions. So a scout will reveal enemies hundreds of meters away forcing us to constantly keep an eye on large portions of the map. But even weapons, such as radars, are equipped with generous range distances which, in combination with various types of coverage and heights, force you to weigh the engagement carefully so as not to waste empty shots. We are still far from absolute realism but the Eugen Systems strategy takes a decisive step forward and not only in terms of appearance. The vehicles have limited ammunition and a decidedly limited supply of fuel, the covers offer various degrees of protection, the terrain affects the performance of the units and the shots have a specific effect on different components of each vehicle. This setting gives importance to all units starting from the supply truck up to the anti-tank infantry unit that can sneak behind the enemy front, or jump into the forest to set up ambushes, bringing rocket launchers and grenades with them. To further complicate matters there is also the psychological dimension that sees them fleeing in the face of a massive bombing or being stunned following a surprise attack. The title also includes a whole series of modifiers and malfunctions to the equipment of the vehicles, each of which generates malus, random or not, which can last a variable number of seconds. They range from the failure of the aiming system to the breaking of the tracks with potentially devastating consequences even in situations of apparent advantage. Furthermore, the high simulation rate means that missiles and tank shots can hit critical points causing unexpected damage and depriving us of a fundamental unit at the worst moment. Obviously in these cases a recovery of the situation thanks to one's skills in directing the troops gives more satisfaction but it is not always possible to save oneself. This guarantees the title a certain degree of difficulty by adding a pinch of unpredictability to the multiplayer and making a campaign already full of rather substantial even if not always varied missions even longer. In some cases, however, to understand whether a situation is recoverable or not, it is necessary to try one's luck, perhaps wasting minutes in planning impossible attacks whose clearly unattainable resolution can cause a pinch of frustration. But unpredictability is one of the elements that make this strategy different from most military-style strategies. Territory control Each single player mission is a small campaign full of primary and secondary objectives. The latter are not necessary to progress but allow you to obtain various command stars that allow you to unlock new units or variants of those already available. The points gradually accumulated during the game are also fundamental, which guarantee the possibility of calling for reinforcements. The number of troops that can be deployed is high but there is always a maximum limit for each unit, even in multiplayerer, which decreases with increasing degree. In fact, the title allows you to directly recall graduated vehicles, sacrificing more points, to be placed in the crucial areas. However, the importance of having a large number of guns should not be underestimated, which proves to be decisive in most situations. In any case, sometimes calling the most suitable unit to resolve a situation, among the dozens and dozens available, is a necessity, both in multiplayer and in single player, and in such situations calling already high-level troops can make the difference. The player level determines the rank of the multiplayer match which then assigns a value to the skirmishes and is used for the matchmaking system that supports competitive matches. As for the single player, reinforcements are paid in points and can be summoned already with a high rank but at a higher cost. To accumulate these points that we have talked about so much, it is necessary to control strategic areas which in Wargame: European Escalation are seen in a less videogame way than in titles of this genre, i.e. without flags. A more credible system with more realistic tactical implications that is based on a large area to be kept in check with a command vehicle. But standard units aren't enough to gain control of a zone. In fact, a unity of command is needed which must obviously be protected. Not to forget the supply centers, a key element for resupplying and repairing one's vehicles, which at the same time represent a primary objective in the event that the structure belongs to the enemies. But resources are still limited, so it's impossible to stick to a static strategy which among other things, in multiplayer, would allow the opponent to hide their troops in strategic points or to place them on high ground. In essence, even if the complexity and breadth make Wargame: European Escalation slower, in absolute terms, than the classic real-time strategy games, a few seconds of delay in placing a unit, whether infantry or armored, can lead to a lightning defeat. Furthermore, enemy units do not automatically reveal themselves when they fire and in these cases the ability to fire in an area in the hope of pinpointing the precise origin of the attacks becomes essential. Then the defense from above is important. The aircraft are in fact devastating even if with a good anti-aircraft positioning they can be quickly neutralized. Used in abundance for multiplayer rushes, they can be lethal given the higher movement speed. However, they are not perfectly simulated, unlike the other units, perhaps to avoid imbalances. Between heaven and earth The IRISZOOM Engine, as the name of the engine suggests, allows you to rapidly zoom stratospheric starting from the entire quadrant of the game to get down to a single hair of grass. Grass that is crushed by vehicles, leaving permanent traces, and that ignites during fights, staying on fire for a long time. Also from the point of view of the composition of the map, the realism is extreme. There are not only sparse trees but parts of dense forest, woods, rows of trees and land of all kinds. An extremely credible central European panorama, enhanced by the reflections of the structures and by a general yield of materials that are excellent for a strategic title. Even the vehicles are treated in relation to the wide-ranging strategic nature of the title even if the extreme zoom can expose some defects. To compensate we think the towns, real urban agglomerations characterized by a surprising minuteness of details. Unfortunately they are not interactable as are various farms and pavilions scattered around the map and there is no lack of some overlooked detail such as indestructible trees. Sure, the choice is functional to the stealth dynamics of the units, but clashes with the realism of the fighting. The end result is still remarkable and some elements of the map, such as checkpoints and bases, are instead destructible. Obviously, to make this possible, the engine uses a system that reduces detail over distance. So as you get closer to the objects you can see the transformation of the models, the appearance of reflections in real time and the change in detail of the vegetation. During the action however, between explosions and fires, the only thing that annoys are the glitches but we don't doubt they will be fixed soon. With the bird's eye camera most of the defects disappear and the only visible defect is the disappearance of the burn marks on the ground. But you can't expect too much. On the other hand Wargame: European Escalation is already impressive and in relation to the graphic beautyit's also pretty fluid. The interface that indicates the level of land coverage, the movement of companions and so on is excellent, all on the screen in augmented reality style. It is also possible to deactivate the units' weapons, control the vehicles in blocks of four or separate them and it is possible to customize zoom and view in order to quickly reach every point of the immense map to manage multiple situations at the same time. Finally, it is possible to tell each vehicle whether to use the main arteries in order to move quickly and it is easy to quickly observe the statistics of each individual unit. Everything works through large and clear icons integrated into the interface or through the shortcuts that are essential when it becomes necessary to quickly manage several units. Obviously there is also a full-bodied tutorial that explains functions and codes with descriptions and indicators. The speech is in English, or in the language of the specific units, while the texts are all translated into Italian.", "date": "2012-02-28", "grade": "8.4"}
