{"name": "Boxing Star", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/boxing-star-la-recensione.html", "text": "Nintendo has always put gameplay at the center of attention, also overturning the conventions to bend the representation of the game to its mechanics and following a particular vision built on the basis of game design. When was the first Punch-Out!! the particular shot from the protagonist's shoulders caused a certain sensation, in a type of game usually represented from the side, in order to offer a more canonical vision of the clash. However, the choice was perfectly motivated by the mechanics of the gameplay, which could not be better rendered from another perspective. After several years, several have tried to imitate this particular way of representing boxing, but few have come close to the perfect construct of Nintendo. Among the challengers we now also include Boxing Star, a mobile title developed by the Koreans of Four Thirty Three and focused on the career of a young aspiring boxer, from the most shabby gyms to international stages. To tell the truth, the interpretation of boxing offered by this game for smartphones and tablets also has several original ideas, but the comparison with the old NES classic is inevitable, considering the framing and strongly arcade declination adopted. Also in this case, in fact, it is a question of fighting in matches that focus entirely on the timing and the choice of the right attack at the right moment through rather intuitive controls, thus remaining far from a realistic simulation of this sport, as also underlined by the style caricature graphic used. The fact that the action is seen from behind the protagonist's back (albeit three-quarters of the way from Punch-Out!!) only cements the comparison with the classic. Fingertip barrel As befits a free-to-play mobile game, Boxing Star is based on two parallel elements: the actual game action that takes place in the ring and a complex boxer management and management system, which aims to capture users in the canvas of constant progression, always on the edge of the micro-transaction. As far as the combat system is concerned, the game behaves admirably: the controls respond in a rather reactive way, simplifying the various blows and defensive maneuvers typical of boxing in simple taps and swipes of the fingers on both sides of the screen, with a intuitive and satisfactory solution even if in some cases it is not easy to interpret the moves and act accordingly. The dynamics of the clash are mainly focused on timing, on the ability to dodge attacks and catch opponents off guard to maximize the damage inflicted by the counterattack. The clashes are quite engaging but the basic repetitiveness emerges in the long term and above all the variations and particular situations that were typical for example of Punch-Out are missing!! Here the opponents all tend to look alike due to the presence of a substantially equal set of moves, with the variations brought about above all by the increase in level and power of statistics and equipment. The latter elements are obviously part of the character progression system, which in order to better face the more advanced challenges must evolve by winning matches but also by unlocking and purchasing more advanced equipment and special abilities (mostly modifiers to be applied to standard moves). The progress is quite balanced and there are really many things to follow between training, collecting materials, buying and building equipment, managing sponsors and fighting between story and League modes, but it is easy to see a pay to win mechanic emerging in the long run period, when micro-transactions cut sharply the typical times of grinding.", "date": "2018-07-20", "grade": "7.0"}
