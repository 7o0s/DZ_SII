{"name": "Real Rugby", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/real-rugby.html", "text": "A rugby simulation was certainly missing from the mobile video game scene, and it must be admitted that the new Gameloft title boasts at least great ambitions, reproducing all aspects of a sport that is not very popular but certainly fascinating on mobile. In Real Rugby we'll have all the national teams from the rugby world championship at our disposal and three game modes (quick game, tournament and championship) that will allow us to perfectly recreate all the situations that occur in real matches. The aspect of the game is very reminiscent of the Electronic Arts sports series before the advent of polygonal graphics, so we have an isometric view and a surprising level of detail. The rules are those of real rugby, so we'll have to try in every way to recover the ball before the opponents go too far into our half, and to do so we'll be able to produce spectacular tackles and blocks. Once in possession of the ball, we will have to avoid all the opponents who try to stop us and reach the goal, perhaps passing before ending up against a human wall. Fortunately, there aren't many elements to take into consideration, and the developers have thought of a control system that is as intuitive as possible: our players run automatically, and the number keys 4, 2 and 6 will make them change direction, while the 5 key serves to pass the ball to the closest teammate (when in possession of the ball) or to tackle an opponent. The same key is also used when there is a place kick to be taken. On a technical level, Real Rugby looks good, with good animations and a large number of sprites on the screen, which unfortunately weigh heavily on the frame rate and scrolling speed. The sound sector includes a couple of well done music, and little else. The control system, as mentioned, is perhaps the best possible compromise between immediacy and convenience. What is most surprising about the game, however, is the presence of numerous customization possibilities as regards the team, whose tactical behavior can be oriented in three different ways to better adapt to one's style of play.
