Whether it's for consistency or perseverance, Minority Media has decided to take the same approach for their new mobile title, this Spirits of Spring which also promotes the supremacy of story and atmosphere over the real game. Bears, rabbits and crows The main protagonist of Spirits of Spring is Chiwatin, a young Native American endowed with the power to summon the spirits of spring responsible for maintaining the beautiful season in the land where he lives, an imaginary place inspired by northern Canada: while he is walking with his best friends (a rabbit and a bear both with the gift of speech), the boy notices that something is wrong, and in less than no time a flock of evil crows kidnap his companions and brutalize the magical trees, causing the immediate arrival of a cold winter. It will therefore be up to the user to guide Chiwatin in his attempt to drive out the invaders and return things to their original state, using the spirits of spring to make the trees bloom again and allow the sun to return to melt the ice. What at first sight appears as the re-proposition of a popular legend in a video game key is actually an allegory to talk about the delicate subject of bullying, in a very effective way indeed: the symbols used by Minority Media are immediately recognizable, and the message of fund is strong enough to be enjoyed by anyone, especially those who have experienced such experiences in their past. The quality of the story is then further enhanced by the tools used to narrate the story, with textual dialogues between the characters, drawn static sequences and a voiceover that punctuates the main actions of the protagonists. Even from a purely technical point of view, Spirits of Spring defends itself well: the graphics, framed from a bird's eye view, offer enchanting scenarios and excellent animations for Chiwatin, while the soundtrack flawlessly accompanies the actions of the player. Spirits of Spring fails to offer gameplay that lives up to its highly sought-after atmosphere As happened with Papo & Yo, Spirits of Spring also suffers from an evident inferiority of the playful component compared to the narrative one: it is therefore sad to note that the developers have not managed to combine the beautiful story with noteworthy gameplay even this time. The most obvious limitation of the title lies in its chronic lack of content, given that the adventure can be completed in scarce two hours to spend in a rather passive way. The user mainly controls Chiwatin, but there are sections in which you take control of the rabbit and the bear, with each of the three characters having its own peculiarity regarding the exploration of the surrounding environment: Chiwatin can use spirits to build bridges over rivers, the rabbit is capable of slipping into holes to reach otherwise inaccessible areas while the bear is able to swim freely in the icy waters of the place. However, these skills are not exploited in real environmental puzzles, and the playful component of Spirits of Spring is practically reduced to the mere movement of the protagonist from one point of the scenario to another. To further dampen the enthusiasm intervenes a control system that leaves more than a few perplexities despite the few functions that it is called upon to manage: to move the character it is necessary to keep a finger pressed on the screen, thus obstructing a large part of the view, while the swipe required to ~launch~ the spirits towards a target is very often incorrectly detected by the software.", "date": "2014-10-16", "grade": "6.8"}
