Even awaited releases, such as that Gray Matter signed by Jane Jensen after very long years of waiting, have left a bitter taste in the mouth and act as a litmus test of a genre confined on the one hand by interest - and therefore commercial outlets - to certain territories, from 'other increasingly looking for a new dimension which declines in casual drift or in experiments, even successful, on consoles. In short, it doesn't look exceptional, and if it weren't for a part of the European market, the situation would be even worse. From Germany, in particular, some interesting products continue to arrive such as those of Daedalic Entertainment which, after the imperfect and fascinating The Whispered World, returns to the fray with A New Beginning, an eco-thriller that has been in development for more than four years and has finally arrived on the territory homegrown. A world in ruins The one staged by A New Beginning is a rather articulated plot at first which, in terms of narrative plans, moves from the year 2500, in which the Earth is on the verge of destruction due to an irrecoverable environmental condition, up to the present day, when Dr. Bent Svensson is joined by Fay, communications technician part of a group of scientists from the future who have the task of going back in time to prevent the causes of the catastrophe. In between a long parenthesis in 2050, the first destination of the mission participants who, underestimating how much the reasons for this deterioration of the earth's atmosphere were lost in the past, make a mistake in aiming risking compromising its success and seeing themselves decimated. The environmental theme is the background to the entire development of the game but the fear that the theme remains vague, making the whole plot become a little lesson on the division of wet from paper from plastic, is canceled by a story full of events, well written and with compelling characters. For heaven's sake, a thread of rhetoric escapes us from time to time and is probably inevitable, but the way in which Bent, a disillusioned ex-biologist whose work commitment has prevailed over private life to irrecoverable extremes, and Fay, a little ' naive and detached from a reality unlike that of the future in which she grew up, they convince both as characters in their own right and when they serve to introduce secondary ones. Often excellent, as in the case of the inflexible commander Salvador. Part of the story, then, become the settings themselves: Daedalic Entertainment reconfirms its ability to draw, as long as things remain static, one of the best 2Ds around, with excellent tables that paint completely opposite environments - from Brazil to San Francisco to the woods northern Europeans and so on - but they also tell in a precise way of different eras, with glimpses of futuristic structures and of the degradation to come, and of characters who are distant from each other. The hours of the game - about a dozen to complete it - pass in a solid and fun way, the story is passionate even if in certain points it seems that certain passages want to lengthen the broth a bit. The rhythm of the dialogues is also good which, in the most important passages, is accompanied by a technique that simulates that of comics but enlivens it with animations and the progressive appearance of the boxes. All dubbed in English with a good overall rendering but with more than a few ups and downs, and subtitles in Italian. Classic adventure Although the genre of graphic adventures is the one most naturally inclined to give space to the narrative component, the fact remains that good playful creation is also essential for the success of the product. A New Beginning chooses a very traditional direction, asking us to interact with the seabed, collect and combine objects and complete a series of environmental puzzles or enigmas independent of the rest of the setting. In short, everything as per rule, being able to move between a never too large number of different scenarios but interacting with a large number of hot spots, so as to make many situations turn out to be complex at the right point without becoming frustrating. Unfortunately there is no growth of interest in the puzzles during the second half of the game: the levels are always quite high but as the story increases in intensity, the challenge does not always seem to follow it properly. Right clicking opens and closes the inventory while holding down the left on a punsubject to interaction, a radial menu will open from which to select the desired type of action; usually it involves examining, commenting, using, opening, and so on. Overall A New Beginning is, with what has been said in the previous lines, an adventure that we cannot fail to recommend to all those looking for a solid, mature and well-crafted title. In reality, in addition to the aforementioned non-perfect sealing in the final part, there are some problems that are mainly attributable to the engine used by the developers. If the drawings are excellent and the use of reflections and lights gives more dynamism to the images compared to The Whispered World, as in the previous work you suffer from somewhat poor animations, some dead time in passing from one image to another and above all an image ratio of 4:3. The absence of the widescreen format is more difficult to solve when working with two-dimensional graphics, however many will have to suffer from the black side lines to which it is now really hard to get used to. All the musical accompaniment is excellent.", "date": "2011-06-22", "grade": "8.5"}
