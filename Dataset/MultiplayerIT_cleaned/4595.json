The mobile reduction of the game, available on the App Store and Google Play at a price of 5.49 euros, includes almost all the original contents, net of the ~moddable~ mode, which allowed the creation of new situations and puzzles to extend the duration of the game. adventure. In any case, we are talking about a great conversion, which makes the most of the hardware of the latest smartphones and tablets to deliver detailed, evocative and rather fluid graphics on the iPhone 7, especially after the latest updates. In the game we find ourselves in a mysterious garden, in the role of a synthetic creature, while the voice of our creator (dubbed in Italian in this version) guides us towards the resolution of a large number of environmental puzzles. The goal is to complete the various puzzles and get hold of the seals (in the form of tetrominoes) that will allow us to access new areas of the scenario and unlock gadgets capable of giving us a set of essential extra skills to face the most difficult stages. advanced adventure: a jammer useful for blocking barriers or electronic traps; a laser connector for redirecting light beams; a cube necessary to be able to reach otherwise inaccessible areas; a fan to move certain objects; a holographic recorder able to double our actions; and finally a platform to lift specific items. Divine touch When you are faced with the mobile reduction of a title born on PC and console, it is natural to ask yourself how the developers have adapted the original controls to the touch screen. In the case of The Talos Principle, fortunately, the default setting that works with the classic ~tap and go~ can be replaced by a traditional layout, with a repositionable virtual analog stick on the left side of the screen, free management of the camera on the right side and two buttons at the bottom, one for interacting with the environment and one for jumping. The latter solution undoubtedly proves to be the best, the most reactive and precise one, especially when the degree of difficulty of the puzzles increases and you need not only to think, but also to move quickly to avoid the many pitfalls present within the scenarios . During the early stages of the campaign, however, you won't have any particular problems overcoming the challenges that the game offers, and which revolve almost exclusively around the use of devices capable of deactivating barriers or blocking sentinels with a deadly touch. Of course, the strength of the Croteam title does not lie solely in its puzzle mechanics, sometimes similar to those of Portal, nor in the excellent technical direction that accompanies our gait in the mysterious garden of the ~creator~, but also and above all in the narrative implications that it is possible to discover through textual contributions that can be consulted at certain workstations. The nature of the protagonist, free will, its inevitable limits, the indications of the guiding voice are in fact elements that lead to profound reflections on the meaning of life, on the differences between human beings and machines, as well as on the possible purpose of our existence. Implications that invariably generate great involvement and earn points for the entire experience, therefore not only solid and lasting in terms of structure and gameplay, but also capable of triggering non-trivial reasoning.", "date": "2017-10-25", "grade": "8.8"}
