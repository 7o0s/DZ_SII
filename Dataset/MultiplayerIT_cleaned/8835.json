So far it hasn't been masterpieces, unfortunately: the idea that the franchise was basically aimed at children has led publishers and developers to make poor quality tie-ins. From this point of view, we say it right away, Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet is probably the most successful experiment so far, although in the end it doesn't shine for its gameplay. The plot of the game takes up one of the classic Marvel sagas, that of the Infinity Gauntlet, a weapon created by the evil Thanos to control the entire universe thanks to the six gems set in it: the soul gem, the time gem, the gem of Space, the Mind Gem, the Reality Gem, and finally the Power Gem. The objective of our team, through seven rather full-bodied and gradually more complex levels, will therefore be to recover the gems and defeat what is probably the most fearsome ~super villain~ of the Marvel universe. To succeed in the enterprise we will be able to count on the contribution of a large number of superheroes, each equipped with peculiar abilities that will allow us to overcome certain obstacles along the way. ~I know a good sandwich shop in Asgard!~ In terms of concept, the similarities between Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet and any episode of the LEGO series are evident. In fact, you find yourself managing a team of two characters at a time, with the possibility of switching from one to the other at will, but within the scenarios there are often devices or objects with which only certain superheroes can interact. Which leads us to make the quick switch if this superhero is already part of our duo, or to start looking for the first switch post nearby. The obligation of having to do a lot of ~back tracking~ to find these machines but above all the ~block~ management of the locations, with the automatic respawn of all the enemies already eliminated, unfortunately tend to make the experience rather frustrating as things get more complex. Which is a pity, given that the combat system turns out to be fairly implemented, with an excellent representation of the powers of each character and an excellent quality Italian dubbing (we mention Pietro Ubaldi in the guise of a very nice Hulk, Ivo ~Pegasus~ De Palma who plays an equally funny Thor, etc.). The alternation between fast attacks and powerful attacks, the latter to be ~charged~ after having locked onto a target, makes the action quite varied and fun: launch missiles at the command of Iron Man, electrocute your opponents with Thor's powers or defeat them with the spells of Scarlet Witch it is quite pleasant, but as already mentioned the infinite respawn of the enemies and the management of the scenario in its entirety will lead us, in a certain moment, to dribble the fights beautifully in search of the switch that we are missing to conclude the mission and get to the boss fight. The 3D effect Bad news: the three-dimensional effect implemented in Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet seemed to us to be poorly made, sometimes even annoying when applied to the graphical interface. The visual thickness of the characters soon turns out to be useless for gameplay purposes, so you will find yourself resetting the 3D regulator after a few minutes... Always use the Infinity Gauntlet Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet is therefore based on a structure that is in some ways valid (the concept of switches and the change between the various characters), in others less (the continuous respawn of enemies and the intrusive back tracking), offering us a decent combat system but relying, above all, on the appeal generated by the presence of a large number of usable superheroes. There are fifteen of them in all, as mentioned very well represented in their abilities; among them stand out celebrities Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Wolverine and Spider-Man, but also lesser-known names such as Nova, Scarlet Witch, Reptil and Quicksilver. The group of villains is also well fed, with characters such as Doctor Doom, Magneto, Loki, the Super Skrull and obviously Thanos. The technical sector manages to do justice to this plethora of personalities, thanks to an apt design but above all to really nice outline animations (see, for example, Spider-Man who begins to ~jump rope~ using his web if he we hold still too long). The musics arecute but very repetitive, while as already mentioned the dubbing is really excellent and by itself significantly increases the attractiveness of the THQ product, especially in the eyes of younger players.", "date": "2011-12-27", "grade": "S.V."}
