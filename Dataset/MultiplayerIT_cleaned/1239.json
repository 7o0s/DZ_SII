{"name": "Speed Kings", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/speed-kings.html", "text": "On the road Once you have started the game, you can immediately try your hand at some tests for your licence, another name to indicate a very short and very simple tutorial on the basic controls of your motorbike. Once this is done you will move on to the real races, ranging from single races to rallies, series of three races in which, once you get a minimum score, you can unlock new stages, to head-to-head races against a single opponent. There is also a mode in which to show off your entire repertoire of daredevil tricks with the bike also present from the beginning and a moto gp mode to be unlocked later in the game. Even in Speed Kings, as in most motorcycle games, you will be called upon to perform increasingly dangerous evolutions with the sole purpose of increasing your Powerband, a bar which, once filled, will allow you to dash away at inconceivable speeds, making you lose your tracks to the group of pursuers. Among the most common evolutions we mention the wheelie, classic wheelie, surfing or the more useful Powerdown. The latter will allow you to overcome otherwise insurmountable obstacles and to pass under trailers dangerously placed in the middle of the road by performing a short slide with your motorcycle. Often, however, less ~clean~ means may be needed to eliminate the other runners from your path, and this is why the game programmers have dedicated a joypad button to punches and kicks, in order to physically remove annoying opponents . This too will give you a substantial increase in the Powerband and which in some cases will allow you to obtain valuable respect points. It is in fact important to point out that each stage presents three challenges which, once completed, will reward the player with respect points, necessary to unlock higher quality bikes. Nice bike One thing that certainly catches the eye are the colorful uniforms that show off the fruit of licenses purchased directly from manufacturers that deal with motorcycle clothing such as Shoei and Alpinestars. Even the bikes, despite being the result of the programmers' invention, are very likely and follow the lines of some models on the market. Too bad with regard to the graphics of the landscapes which are repetitive and monotonous. Unfortunately, the details are often reduced to a minimum and the same textures are copiously recycled in the three circuits that make up a gathering. The sound is certainly not something you will remember with pleasure once you turn off the console, not only for the total anonymity of the soundtracks, but especially for the awful sound effects. The engines all grunt alike, and collision noises are a bit far-fetched resulting in a nagging jumble of nasty sounds. The infamous ~DINGs~ Often, to complete some tests of respect you will be required to perform a certain number of DINGs which simply consist of grazing the vehicles that crowd the streets of the game. It might seem easy, but often performing such evolutions requires nerves of steel due to the frustrating difficulty of execution. What perhaps in the eyes of the programmers had appeared as a brilliant idea turns out to be something absolutely impracticable in the game and decidedly to be avoided if you do not want to end up disastrously on the ground with the bike destroyed. It should be noted that the bike is destroyed ~strangely~ almost always in the same way, scattering a few pieces left and right. Getting familiar with the controls is almost immediate and you will soon be able to perform even the most daring evolutions. Too bad, however, that the repertoire of stunts runs out immediately both because they are too simple to perform and given the small number. Perhaps the numerous game modes will be able to increase an apparently very short longevity in itself. In fact, the rallies are quite simple to finish, and the other modes are basically a bit repetitive, both due to the excessive similarity of the stages and the lack of variety in the game. Too bad for the very high difficulty of some challenges which contrasts with the extreme simplicity of the entire game, annoyingly unbalancing the overall difficulty of the title. Comment Speed Kings is certainly not a bad game, but it certainly deviates a lot from the high standards to which driving games such as Gran Turismo have accustomed us, making us spontaneously wonder why they keep coming out for Playstation 2 games.i that we could already see on previous generation consoles. Road Rash nostalgics will probably be able to enjoy the first few games, but they will hardly find their expectations fulfilled by playing a little longer. Pros Beautiful textures of the pilots Uhm ... Cons Monotonous crackling sound Speed Kings belongs to that genre that has always been somewhat mistreated, that of motorcycling. There are quite a few video games dedicated to racing motorcycles, but on the contrary you can count on the fingers of one hand the titles capable of rising above an overwhelming mediocrity that has always made them not very suitable for enthusiasts and even less for those who are involved in motorcycle racing. he is totally fasting. Speed Kings tries, in a certain way, to merge the professional spirit with the more purely arcade action, to make inroads into a wider range of users. The results?
