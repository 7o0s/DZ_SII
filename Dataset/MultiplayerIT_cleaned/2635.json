Surely this choice will make many PS2 owners turn upside down, and honestly it is not very shared. Ok for the phenomenon of retrogaming based on emulators, but I think very few are willing to spend the hard-earned one hundred for two titooo who, despite having made the history of video games, now carry 15 years on their backs.

Gradius III has typical 16-bit 2D graphics, while Gradius IV includes a smattering of 3D effects and high-resolution sprites. Despite the passing of the years, one aspect that can compete with next-generation games is longevity. In fact, the element that has always distinguished the Gradius saga is the level of difficulty, so arm yourself with holy patience because it will take you a long time to complete it. While the idea of fully transposing a classic onto the most powerful console currently available is appreciable, I would like to note that users are now more attracted by graphics than by playability and the low sales of this title are proof of this. I feel like recommending it only to nostalgics, for everyone else I recommend keeping away. YOU TRAVEL Many of you bought the Playstation 2 because you were enthralled by the graphic beauty of the games, which can almost reproduce the real world. But on November 24, at the European launch of the console, there was also a ~different~ title from the others. I'm talking about Konami's Gradius III and IV. This saga was born in 1985 and immediately became the yardstick for any new scrolling shooter. In fact, Gradius is a spaceship-based scrolling shooter, which I was lucky enough to play on my tireless Nes.", "date": "2001-02-09", "grade": null}
