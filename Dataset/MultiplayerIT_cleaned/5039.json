The sharp sounds of swords clashing with each other, the typical noise of a successful blow that tears cloth and flesh and the images of beheadings and disembowelments are all elements still alive in our memories. The Ubisoft title, as you may have already read in our previous article dedicated to the console version, impressed us positively in many respects and today we're back to talking about it thanks to the analysis of the PC edition. Ubisoft, we say it right away, has done a great job this time by presenting an extremely scalable title, with some particularities capable of making the users of the master race proud. In 4K and at 60 frames per second For Honor is truly magnificent, both to look at and to play The keyboard is my shield, the mouse is my blade As we have already had the opportunity to explain to you in our previous article, the For Honor control system is the backbone of the entire production. During our test with the PlayStation 4 version, the movements made thanks to the DualShock 4's analog sticks seemed extremely fluid to us, making it clear that the entire game structure had been designed with the pad in mind. The automatic coupling on the triggers, the few commands that manage the entire attack and defense function and even the movements were not at all easy to replicate on the PC but the mouse and keyboard still proved to be excellent tools to be able to have fun in an optimal way. The three directions for attacks and parries (from the right, from the left and from above) are now completely managed by the movement of the wrist which, in an almost natural way, simulates the movement of the sword hilt. While playing we found ourselves repeatedly empathizing with the movements of our on-screen alter ego for an instant and smooth response. It takes a little more effort with the particularly slow and massive characters but nothing that you can't easily overcome with a little practice. Coming from a few intense days of use of the pad, the first impact was still quite traumatic. The dead zones of the controller are much larger than the practically non-existent ones of the mouse, fundamentally changing the timing of attacks and counters. To balance a possible problem, it is in any case possible to completely reset every single key, and also go and adjust the sensitivity of the camera and the guard mode. The gaming experience is thus extremely enjoyable and nothing prevents you from attaching a pad and making your life easier in this way. Even on PC, unfortunately, the biggest problem remains the Peer to Peer servers which are causing various disconnection and host migration problems for some players. An important detail remains to be reported, just as we would like to underline that in all our hours of play we have basically never had any kind of problem in the vast majority of games. We are talking about something like 1% of influence, both with the open NAT of the consoles and with the moderate one on our PC, problems however always related to a host migration and never to disconnections or lag. Ubisoft has ensured that the host function of the matches will not have significant advantages in terms of response time during matches compared to guests and, as far as we have seen and tried, we can feel comfortable confirming this theory at the moment. The war of factions then follows the same course being cross platform but we cannot fail to highlight a clearly superior community on PlayStation 4 compared to what was seen on PC. We've tried logging in at different times these days and the percentages are quite dramatic. We are talking about twice the number of players at any time on consoles compared to those usually seen on PCs, ranging from a minimum of twenty thousand players connected simultaneously to a maximum of seventy thousand, against the over one hundred and twenty thousand observed on day one on PlayStation 4. Just the essential Hacking through the options on the For Honor screen reveals some tasty surprises. In fact, the title supports a large number of image ratios ranging from the classic 4:3 and 16:9 to more sophisticated formats such as 16:10, 21:9 or even 3:2 and 5:3. Directly from the menu it is then possible to decide which monitor to use without going through the Windows options and obviously decide independently the refresh rate. Among the options also check the letterbox format to simulate the 16:9 format in case you prefer it to your classic resolution. Also noteworthy is the possibility of managing the depth of the field of view from a minimumof 60 to a maximum of 90. This change not only has a graphical impact but, by maintaining a higher FOV, you will have the possibility to be more reactive on the battlefield and have a much wider peripheral vision, both in clashes against multiple opponents and in the unfortunate event that someone gets there at shoulders. If your PC can handle 90, then don't hesitate for a single second as you will notice all the advantages, even in terms of gameplay. Taking a quick look at the graphic options, however, you notice the usual indispensable options but nothing that makes you cry for a miracle. Three anti-aliasing filters (FXAA, SMAA and TAA), texture detail, dynamic shadow quality, ambient occlusion and environmental detail are all you can expect. They are simple parameters to modify but interestingly there is a bar dedicated to the consumption of the VRAM of your video card which keeps you constantly updated on the load of the GPU with your every single modification. It is an extremely simple tool but capable of making you immediately realize how much you are pushing your machine to the limit and eventually allows you to lower some details directly from the menus, without having to enter the game every time to experiment. We tested the title on several machines, starting from a PC equipped with i7-3770K@3.50 gHz, 16 GB of RAM and an SLI of 780 and the results were quite satisfactory. The machine manages to hold up to 60 frames per second at Extreme in practically every situation having some drops only in the four-on-four domination mode in the center of the conquest zone B where the two sides collide in a riot of polygons and particle effects everywhere . Leaving the work mule behind, it turns out that with the best performing cards the title is a real splinter. To play serenely with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and maintain a stable frame rate above 70 frames we can start from a GTX 1080 up to a SLI of 1070 for 4K, even if only with a SLI of 1080 it is possible to have a completely smooth and seamless experience.", "date": "2017-02-17", "grade": "8.3"}
