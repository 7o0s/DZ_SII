We waited for this new release of the ~Birds of~ saga with the desire to understand how the brand could evolve and improve, and this Birds of Steel fully responded to our wishes. Birds of Steel is a real dive into the past, in that era in which as children with a little glue and many hours available many small pieces of plastic were placed close together in order to recreate the planes that characterized the clashes of the Second World War. Turning on the console, Xbox 360 in our test, and immediately seeing the perfectly recreated models in the tutorial with which we spent the hours was really a pleasant step back in time. The long tutorial, about half an hour, immediately lets you understand what the game is made of, with the possibility of setting the difficulty according to three well-defined levels, between the more arcade and less demanding and the more simulative in which you can also avoid to fall will be quite a challenge. The difficulty is then further manageable by selecting the amount of fuel and ammunition and whether these resources should actually be limited or infinite. One of the greatest qualities of Birds of Steel is its ability to adapt to the type of approach desired by the player, the result is perfect for all those who wish to approach an air battle game, from the most passionate lover of simulations and attached to realism , to the more light-hearted who simply wants to spend half an hour throwing down some enemy Messerchmitt. Style of play If we had to make a comparison Birds of Steel in every aspect, from the graphics to the control system, it seems to us a tribute to the world of military aviation as much as famous driving games (from Forza Motorsport to Gran Turismo) are for the motoring. Every single texture of the 100 reconstructed and recreated models can be seen to have been studied with care and with an almost maniacal perfectionism for details. The control system, which you learn to manage by facing the tutorial with due attention, provides a perfect and more or less sensitive approach depending on the level of challenge chosen, allowing not only to take off and land without too many problems with due practice, but also to face bombardments and real screaming dogfights. The ability to read the on-screen indicators, more or less always present depending on how you decide to face the challenge, will be essential for the success of the missions that you will face from time to time. In the Historical Campaign, the largest air battles that occurred during the Second World War have been recreated, with departures from aircraft carriers near Pearl Harbor or with bombing of fixed Axis positions. Within the Campaign mode, therefore, twenty challenges in the Pacific are faced, fighting both on the American and Japanese sides, we greatly appreciated the presence of historical films that take stock of the situation and allow greater identification in the theater of war. There are also many single challenges in which you fly around Europe and the Eastern Front aboard Italian aircraft, but also German, British and even Australian ones. During the individual missions and the Campaign what made us turn up our noses a little is the feeling of lack of dynamism of everything that revolves around our plane, the fact that everything is practically scripted and that not only the objectives, but also enemies, simply wait for our moves to react. The missions last an average of 30-40 minutes and can also propose sub-objectives such as, for example, the destruction of all the planes on the map; the completion of these further challenges allows you to earn experience points to then spend on the customizations of our vehicle. Xbox 360 goals Getting the desired 1000 points divided into 50 objectives will not be an easy task. It is in fact necessary to play the Historical Campaign several times even at the most advanced level of difficulty, it is then necessary to satisfy particular requests during the completion of certain missions but above all you will have to destroy everything that moves without leaving the enemy's planes and positions standing . Under whose turn it is! Missions like crazy For perfect control of the aircraft, three different views have been set, the one we prefer allows you to see the plane completely from the outside, the internal one which shows the cockpit in its entirety and the ~shooter~ one which instead allows you to play in first person. Yes to theseit then adds an additional view when we fly the big bombers inside which there is always a machine gunner who will take care of massacring enemies and above all defending the heavy aircraft from the fast enemy aircraft. All these shots allow you to fully appreciate the work done by the developers, not only the polygonal models of the planes, which as mentioned are really excellent, but also the reproduction of the control cabins in which the smallest details are highlighted and it is really exhilarating to see your pilot grappling with the throttle grips or the individual switches. What could certainly be improved is the overall impact of the scenario within which the combat racing cars move, with more or less coarse details and with not particularly accurate reproductions of the settings. However, some moments are decidedly exciting, such as the sunset returning after a mission or flying in the pouring rain with an exaggerated difficulty and due to the lack of visibility. If this weren't enough for you in Simulator mode, in addition to a more demanding management of the aircraft, all the clashes, bombings and dogfights take place without the useful on-screen indicators with all the additional difficulties that this entails. It is clear that trying the Campaign and the individual challenges at the highest level of difficulty is yes demanding but also very satisfying given that the approach with the control of the vehicle changes decisively. The sharp turns perhaps accompanied by powerful acceleration of the engine become much more dangerous and risky maneuvers very often risk making you lose control (and probably also your patience). Together with this we have to admit that if we wanted to be fussy certain maneuvers would most likely have been very difficult if not impossible for the fighters of that precise historical period, but it's more fun that way. The longevity of Birds of Steel is ensured by the high number of missions available for the single player but also by the good dose of extras that encourage you to continue playing and which above all concern customizations for your aircraft. Inside the hangar it is possible to observe in every detail the planes unlocked each time in the Campaign. In addition to all this, there is a good mode for online multiplayer battles via Xbox Live for up to 16 players and an excellent editor that allows you to create, customize in every aspect and share missions to be tackled perhaps in coop. You set the type of mission, amount of weapons and fuel, and then all the thousand options regarding the type of challenge with enemies on the ground or in the water and a truly disproportionate number of planes to choose from.", "date": "2012-03-22", "grade": "8.5"}
