{"name": "Il re degli stickman", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100888-fancy-pants-il-re-degli-stickman.html", "text": "Although there are lucky exceptions, making a game with stickmen and very simple stylized graphics is never a good business card. This is especially true in a market like the iOS one, where all too often a book is judged by its cover and where even a poorly maintained icon can have a more or less evident weight in terms of sales. Yet, with the Fancy Pants Adventures series, the independent developer Brad Borne has managed to transform a simple stickman into a real icon on Flash game portals, recognizable by all platform enthusiasts who have been attentive to the indie scene for years. Mario or Sonic? Porting of Fancy Pants for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, the chapter for iOS offers the same formula as the episodes that have already been available online for some time, trying to cure it and refine it enough to pack a complete and salable title. Among the novelties there is also a plot outline, with the protagonist intent on crossing a series of settings and facing various dangers in an attempt to save his little sister from a crew of somewhat dumb pirates. Nothing too elaborate, mind you, but at least this time Fancy Pants has a pretext for its high-speed frolics between one level and another, for its thousand acrobatic jumps and daring slides down steep slopes. Fancy Pants, if you haven't understood it, is a 2D platformer that tries not to detach itself from the more traditional stakes of the genre, although the attempt to propose a characteristic and recognizable gameplay is evident. There is therefore no shortage of walljumps, jumps from platform to platform or enemies that can be eliminated by landing on their heads, but in the same way the game is distinguished by a frenetic and fast pace, thanks to the slopes, the halfpipes and the numerous ups and downs that dot each level. Wanting to simplify, we could say that Fancy Pants is a successful blend of Mario's acrobatic skills and Sonic's incessant racing, a mix that is further enhanced by the splendid animations, so fluid and varied as to make the stylized protagonist much more alive and charismatic more elaborately designed heroes. Too bad that everything is partly ruined by two elements, the first of which is inevitably linked to the control system, which has always been a plague of platformers on mobile devices: although we are far from mediocrity, the speed with which the action takes place on screen and constant jumping require tactile feedback that the touchscreen interface of iPhone and iPad can not offer. But if those just mentioned are defects due more to the limits of the device than to the work of the developers, the situation is different for the confusing design choices and the absence of a clear direction. The protagonist's abilities and the thousand ramps in the levels entice the user to tackle each level at maximum speed and without stopping even for an instant, yet this time, unlike the Flash chapters, the new Fancy Pants offers an enormous amount of additional content and secret areas that can be explored: the result is a platformer with an uneven pace and in which the action is constantly broken up. Then when in the more advanced levels you come into possession of a pencil to use as a sword, you need to stop from time to time to face opponents or destroy some walls. The player must thus choose whether to go through the levels in one breath, missing out on a large number of mini-games and secret levels, or whether to devote himself to exploration and collecting objects, however sacrificing the possibility of fully enjoying a title which, as far as The fluidity and speed of the action is second only to RunMan: Race Around the World and the more recent 2D Sonic games. Unfortunately, a subdued level design disincentives the player to face the same scenarios in both ways, despite the countless unlockable objects with which to customize the aesthetics of Fancy Pants represent a welcome addition.", "date": "2012-04-03", "grade": "7.0"}
