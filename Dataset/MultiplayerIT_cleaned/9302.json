Honestly, we expected everything except reviewing a remake of a title for Atari 2600, released way back in 1981. Yars' Revenge is a name that can only capture the attention of the most venerable players. Yet it happened, simply by changing the position of the apostrophe, Yar's Revenge returns to be talked about with this reincarnation specially packaged by the Californian team Killspace Entertainment for digital delivery. For the occasion, the original comic that accompanied the cartridge is presented again, a nice leap to the heart for the nostalgic, but the emotions stop there, since everything else is completely different from the inspiring product. The story puts us in the shoes of a new generation of Yars, creatures vaguely resembling flies, grappling with the typical plot of deception, redemption and revenge against a belligerent alien army (the Qotiles). In addition to delicately feminine features, Yar sports an impressive paraphernalia, ranging from devastating laser beams to homing missiles, as well as obviously the ability to fly, a fundamental characteristic for the setting decided by the developers. It is in fact a shoot and run on tracks, where our concern is completely turned to the maneuvers of evasion and attack of the enemies, while direction and speed are decided automatically. This allows the setting up of detailed scenarios and above all a dynamic direction, otherwise impossible, which gives a cinematographic effect. The cell shading engine prepared by Killspace proves to be absolutely up to the task, almost surprising by the standards of Live Arcade. Attention to detail, richness of colors, effects and polygons on screen, but the downside of such visual abundance is hardly tolerable. Yet I forgot about you Six scenarios for a total duration of two hours are really small for the asking price (800 MP / 9.99), especially when the little we have to use is compromised by obvious problems in the gaming sector. The difficulty is really excessive and already problematic right from the lowest level, which among other things completely precludes the objectives. Yar's Revenge fails to balance the simple ingredients of a genre like this well, making it very frustrating to play. The choice to control the protagonist and the viewfinder separately through the two analog sticks should guarantee a certain dynamism on paper, but in reality it turns out to be cumbersome and takes time to get used to, as well as a certain ability in independences that is not at all obvious. The action proceeds in a decidedly chaotic manner, with the screen soon filling up with bullets, forcing the player to continually abuse a specific elusive maneuver, which can be activated with a special key. However, this makes understanding what is happening on the screen even more difficult, and does not help the element of disturbance represented by the parts of the scenario capable of blocking our shots, making everything even more frustrating. The standard shots prove to be of little effectiveness, while the more incisive ones are all subject to certain conditions, both of timed and quantity reloads. It is therefore practically impossible to clean up the screen as the formula seems to suggest, see the presence of the typical score multiplier, while it is essential to instantly locate the enemies capable of causing us damage. A solution that goes against the simplistic nature of the shooter. The picture is closed by long final bosses to break down, exhausting and devoid of particularly creative patterns, even if a certain style must be recognized in their characterization. It is necessary to mention at least one, a bizarre war device at the end of the fourth level, able to replicate our shots, and which shows a sprite of the original game on the head. But as you may have understood, the shape is the least of Yar's Revenge's problems. Xbox 360 goals Yar's Revenge features the canonical 12 objectives, for a total of 200 player points, which is the standard Live Arcade. You go from completing the game without dying or using only the laser, to killing a certain number of enemies. All prove to be quite challenging to achieve, since the Easy level is almost never considered. Good luck then, you will need it. I dream of California Apart from a few pleasant quotes, the links with the old Atari classic are completely absent, but Killspace's stylistic reinvention work is in any case worthy of applause. As already mentioned, the protagonist is no longer the strange fly of the original, but a charming manga-inspired warrior, equipped with six limbs and technologically advanced armor. Curiously, the developers seem to have been inspired more by the Armitage III anime to characterize the heroine, but everything else is no less. The action alternates with a series of enjoyable comics to follow, describing the unfolding of the story, while the levels are visually beautifully staged, between menacing alien wastes and space stations. The enemies are also splendid, although present in limited types, they are always valid and stylistically inspired, in a balance between organic and technological, this too easily attributable to the typical oriental style. Where Yar's Revenge fails in emulating the Japanese school it is precisely in the spectacularity of the levels, there are no moments and situations capable of capturing the viewer's attention and remaining etched in the memory, eventually resulting in a rather boring linearity. Multiplayer via co-op is supported, but only locally, while once the adventure is over we can try our hand at challenges subject to certain conditions, such as retracing the levels with infinite ammunition or the obligation to keep the multiplier active. Live is only supported for online leaderboards.", "date": "2011-05-06", "grade": "5.0"}
