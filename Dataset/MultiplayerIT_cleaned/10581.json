A plot that may not be innovative but full of twists and above all with a well-marked charge of irony was embellished by the fervid imagination of the LucasArts developers, who gave life to an authentic masterpiece of the genre. Today the American house has decided to re-propose that milestone, with a remake that - together with PC and Xbox 360 - also reaches iPhone. The whole story has Guybrush Threepwood as its protagonist, an aspiring pirate landed on Mele Island full of hope and desire to do. At one point the story will change direction towards the classic pursuit of a phantasmagorical enemy, guilty of the kidnapping of the beauty of the moment and fleeing towards the mysterious Monkey Island, an island as unknown as it is fascinating. The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition for iPhone brings with it a few but juicy novelties, starting from a complete graphic restyling and ending with the implementation of speech, unfortunately (or fortunately) totally in English; all moving from a gameplay system leaning more towards a ~drag-and-click~ than point and click. Updated back The pointing method is in fact perhaps the most controversial novelty included in this iPhone version: the player is asked to drag a small round icon through the various parts of the scenario and select the desired area with a simple touch. Indeed, the solution adopted becomes too cumbersome e less intuitive than a more immediate direct tap in the place concerned, and above all it risks becoming frustrating especially in the phases in which one is forced to act quickly, as for example happens in some topical moments of the plot. Who does not remember the acrobatic passages of grog from one mug to another to free the caged Otis or the jump into the cannon as the useful shot towards Monkey Island is about to explode? The graphic design leaves behind the pixelated squares of the time in favor of a more refined high definition design very reminiscent of the cartoon style: colorful and bright, The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition boasts a harmonious and at the same time really well-finished line especially regarding both environmental and character details. Nostalgics, on the other hand, will be able to play with the original version simply by swiping two fingers across the screen: in no time at all, the scenario will transform into the original retrogame, with the menus completely in English and the exclusion of speech. The audio sector has been completely modernized with the aim of making the soundtrack as pleasant as possible but still remaining faithful to the original, always exceptional. The same treatment was reserved for speech, an absolute novelty for this episode of the Monkey Island series: the voices marry perfectly with each character, even if to tell the truth Le Chuck could have deserved a more frightening and gloomy tone. The tested version is 1.0.0", "date": "2009-08-10", "grade": "9.2"}
