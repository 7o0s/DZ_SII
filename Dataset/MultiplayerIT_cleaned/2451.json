{"name": "Anarchy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/anarchy-problematicamente-online.html", "text": "Brave New World Anarchy Online is a wonderful game. Set on the inhospitable planet Rubi-Ka (which means ~red and dry~), it presents itself to players as an immense, extremely rich and varied three-dimensional scenario (almost four hundred thousand square meters divided into ~zones~), in which genetically mutated humanity fights for territorial domination. Entering the world of Rubi-Ka means creating an alter-ego and deploying it on one of the two sides of the ongoing war between the dictatorial regime of the Omni-Tek Megacorporation and the anarchic disorder of the rebel Clans. A war that will last four years and will end with only one winning faction. EverQuest in Space Thanks to the lightning-fast Ludostore import service (https://www.ludostore.it), a few days after the release of the game in the United States we received a freshly printed copy. We have already talked about the game itself in detail in a previous article, but now that Rubi-Ka's doors have opened to the public (75,000 copies of the game were sold in one week) we can give a more definitive judgment. Apart from the science fiction setting (the year is 29475 AD), the features that distinguish Anarchy Online from other games of the same type (EverQuest and Asheron's Call, above all) are numerous, but we certainly cannot speak of a revolution. The basic mechanism is the classic one, based on a grid of attributes that define the capabilities of one's character in interactions with the world around him. The Anarchy Online system provides four races, twelve professions and a large number of ~skills~, the value of which can be increased every time a sufficient number of experience points are accumulated to gain a ~level~. Experience points are obtained above all by hunting the multitude of monsters that populate the planet, but also by completing missions of various kinds and exercising one's abilities (by breaking into a door, for example). It is a system that offers infinite possibilities for customization, but which requires drastic choices, forcing each player to specialize in a narrow area of capabilities. Fortunately, each account allows the creation of eight different avatars, with which you can experiment with different paths without giving up your favorite alter-egos. I Want to Bake Bread What is different is that there are almost no dungeons to explore. The world of Rubi-Ka is huge and full of beautiful and adventurous places, demonstrating the talent of Funcom. But the only dungeons in the game, with a couple of insignificant exceptions, are those generated at the request of the players. From special ~dispensers~ you can choose your own personal mission, defining its objectives, difficulty and type of reward. The advantage of this choice is that you never run out of adventures, the flaw is that these dungeons, despite the great variety of textures, all look alike (a bit like those of Bethesda's old Daggerfall). Luckily the outdoor scenarios are actually very pleasant to explore, and in any case Funcom has promised that the ~static~ dungeons will be added at a later time, when the player characters have reached a medium-high level (the limit is 200). However, nano-technology, bionic implants, robotics and countless other sci-fi gadgets make Anarchy Online a joy for the sci-fi fan, who can really immerse himself in the classic roles of Asimovian (or Gibsonian if you prefer) imaginary. Compared to the beta version of the game, seven types of vehicles have been introduced to travel on land, water and air; a virtual cyberspace, the Grid, to gather information and move to various places on the planet, depending on one's computer skills; ~amusement parks~ equipped with everything necessary, including guides, for novice players; an apartment for each player, to be customized with furniture and furnishings ( la The Sims!); innumerable varieties of food and drink, with no real use beyond the possibility of others seeing us while we drink and gorge ourselves on bronto-burgers. A Bug's Life Everything perfect, then? Let's hope! If during the beta version - with a few thousand players - the game showed worrying symptoms of instability and unfamiliarity with the dreaded lag, since Anarchy Online opened its doors to the public the situation has plunged into an abyss that still does not seem easily bridgeable . Simply put, the game crashes all the time, won't let you connect, freezes players in endless waits as it frantically wades through the flood of data it receives. Unfortunately Funcom does notit is Microsoft or Sony, and it has demonstrated this not only with the precariousness of the means available, but also with some omissions that could have easily been avoided, first of all the delay in armoring the payment system. All players who signed up for the game during the first few days (since June 27 Funcom has made a paid download version of the game available on the Internet - $49.99 and a 600MB download - in countries where the game is not yet officially distributed) risked having their credit card number stolen by some hacker. In short, the definitive judgment is suspended. On the one hand there is a wonderful game, a breath of fresh air compared to the usual dragons and ogres, on the other there is a mediocre service to say the least. If Funcom can quickly solve the serious problems affecting Anarchy Online, the world of Rubi-Ka will quickly become the favorite destination for all virtual adventurers. 7 Making a video game set in a persistent online world is a titanic undertaking. After five years of hard work, false starts and second thoughts, the Norwegian software house Funcom has recently completed its mammoth work, the sci-fi role-playing game Anarchy Online.
