{"name": "The Survivalists", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-survivalists-recensione.html", "text": "As we will see in the course of the review, The Survivalists is yet another reinterpretation of the survival genre, the one made up of materials to collect, projects to build and very dangerous places to visit, alone or in company. Developed by Team 17, a very active software house since the days of the Amiga 500, it sees us in the role of a shipwrecked person (whose gender can be decided at the beginning of the adventure) who must survive the perils of an island populated by all kinds of hostile creature. How he got there is not important. The only certainty is that by now our boat is only useful for fire. Gameplay The first moments of the game also serve as a tutorial. The system teaches us to find the raw materials we need to build the essential tools: a club to defend ourselves, a multipurpose tool to work, and a sharp stone to cut trees and break rocks. With a certain speed we also manage to build the first essential furnishing objects: a bed in which to sleep and save the game and a bonfire on which to cook delicacies based on berries, petals, meat and bat wings. Eating and sleeping are essential actions to perform, because they allow you to recharge your energy bars. In particular, eating is used to recover from particularly difficult fights or exhausting journeys. But let's go back to our camp, which is taking shape. Building is very simple: selected a project, just have the necessary materials and you're done. By equipping ourselves with work furniture such as forges or various tables, advanced projects are unlocked which allow us to transform our makeshift home into a real fortress, equipped with all comforts. As always happens in survival, it is precisely the projects that push us to explore the island, because building advanced objects often requires materials that can only be found by entering very dangerous dungeons or in the most remote places on the map. Of course, as the game progresses, we will also have more powerful weapons and more effective protections available that will greatly facilitate our work. Like monkeys Central to the entire game economy of The Survivalists are the monkeys, i.e. the classic survival servants. Convinced a monkey to join us, perhaps with a gift, we will have to train it to do a job, be it resource gathering, object production or actual combat. The monkey training system is very simple: first you have to put them in learning mode, then perform the task you want them to imitate. Everything is easily manageable with mouse and keyboard, but a little more cumbersome using a controller. This last statement is generally true: nothing too penalizing, but by trying both control systems, making comparisons becomes inevitable. After all, the same is common to practically all survival games, where the presence of very large inventories slows down certain operations a bit if managed via joypad. Also in this sense the title of Team 17 does not differ much from the other exponents of the genre, Minecraft in the lead. The monkeys complement the presence of other players to share the adventure with and make the otherwise immobile game environment vital. In fact, when you play in four and there are many monkeys around, it seems to be in a kind of village. Graphics The world of The Survivalists is drawn in a pleasant pixel art, well animated and full of effects. The graphics are quite sophisticated, despite following the style of many other productions. If we want, it is in line with the rest of the game: well done, but without particular flashes. The island where the adventure is set is large and full of different biomes, including lush valleys, semi-desert areas, lava caves and so on, which differentiate the different areas that we are going to explore. The environments are procedurally generated, so each game will be slightly different, at least in the hunt for valuable items and resources. The creatures that populate the island are many, including bats, wild boars, cannibals and other not exactly friendly beings, in addition to the aforementioned monkeys. The structure of the island very much reflects one of the backbones of the gameplay: leaving the player free to explore as he wishes, making his own adventure... which, if you like, is the very essence of the survival genre. A slightly larger inventory would have been useful, but we are in the standards dictated by the aforementioned Minecraft. So you go around, you collect materials, maybe you infiltrate some abandoned temple or you argue with the natives, then you go back to the base to furnish it using what you have found, until you have the desired result. Too derivative? The Survivalists is made very well overall and works in all its parts... and if we want this is its biggest problem: it is a coherent but all too mannerist interpretation of a genre that now has dozens of exponents. Inside it has the sum of all the elements most loved by players, but nothing that makes it take even a single step forward or that differentiates it substantially from the competition. It is made with great professionalism, but, to put it as a young philosopher from the world of video games, it lacks a bit of enthusiasm, that is, that pinch of otherness and madness that would have made it sublime. Let's be precise: we're not talking about a bad game, but simply one that will please survival lovers without exalting them, unable as it is to alter its rhetoric despite its extreme solidity.", "date": "2020-10-09", "grade": "7.8"}
