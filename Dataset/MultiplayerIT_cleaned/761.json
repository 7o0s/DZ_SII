{"name": "Rebelstar Tactical Command", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rebelstar-tactical-command.html", "text": "Distinguished ancestors The mystery is soon revealed: behind the little-known CODO Games development team lie the brilliant minds responsible for the creation of a masterpiece of the tactical genre such as X-Com, the undisputed milestone that originally saw the light on PC the beauty of ten years ago. Although slightly stained by a series of not exactly unforgettable sequels, the image of X-Com still reigns among fans of the genre as an absolute cornerstone in the field of turn-based strategy, and the fact that this Rebelstar Tactical Command draws the play structure itself is already its first strong point. All this despite a completely non-existent hype and a global presentation of the product, it must be said, even embarrassing at times. Flying over the horrible image that stands out on the package, Rebelstar Tactical Command can boast a very unflattering record in terms of introduction, narration and quality of the storyline. Described through poor static images accompanied by lines of text, the plot of the CODO title certainly cannot be defined as exciting. In an unspecified future, the Earth is invaded by the alien forces of the Arelians, who with the help of the brutal Zorn warriors manage to subjugate all of humanity, implanting chips in the heads of newborns and making all those who pass the thirty threshold mysteriously disappear. 'years. In this apocalyptic scenario, the only faint hope is represented by the protagonist Jorel, a young man with mysterious powers who joins the human resistance. The treatment of the story is generally hasty and superficial, and the technical sector of Rebelstar Tactical Command certainly does not contribute to improving the situation in terms of impact on the player: graphically the CODO title is functional, but decidedly poor and stylistically mediocre, while on the level sound is distinguished by an incredible flatness of the musical accompaniment and by the scarcity of effects. In short, Rebelstar Tactical Command more than clearly shows its nature as a low-budget title in these areas. Fortunately, everything changes from a gameplay perspective. Ten years and not hear them Building on the legacy of X-Com, Rebelstar Tactical Command offers the user decidedly technical and refined turn-based battles, which at a basic level, however, do not differ much from other similar titles. The player therefore always assumes command of a small handful of soldiers, each of which is equipped at the beginning of the turn with a certain number of action points that can be spent on movements (based on the classic squared grids) or actions such as shooting, using objects, etc. The process is dynamic, so it is possible - having enough AP - to move, shoot and then take cover, and so on. Rebelstar Tactical Command then includes a whole series of characteristic elements, always inherited from X-Com, such as the morale factor of the troops, the presence of a considerable number of weapons and armor, the different shooting opportunities offered based on the type of rifle used , the panic states that soldiers may encounter in stressful situations and much more. As in X-Com, then, in the CODO title the fights are more tense thanks to a playful device that does not immediately make all the enemies visible on the map, but which shows them only if they fall within the visual range of their fighters. It is therefore necessary to proceed with caution within the battle scenario, always paying attention to possible attacks from behind by the enemies. In short, Rebelstar Tactical Command confirms and reiterates the absolute goodness of the X-Com game formula despite the years it carries on its back, establishing itself as one of the most tactically profound strategists available for GBA. Too bad for that look so bland ... Comment Rebelstar Tactical Command is an excellent strategic title, which succeeds well in re-proposing the playful heart of the X-Com masterpiece, streamlining it to the right extent to adapt it to the dimensions of the GBA. Tactically deep and extremely enjoyable for lovers of the genre, the CODO title cannot however totally dispense with a rather poor presentation and technical sector, which combined with the lack of a serious multiplayer mode and a non-exciting longevity, slow down the rise of Rebelstar Tactical Command to a higher overall rating. Pros: Refined and engaging gameplay Complex and deep Good variety of missions Cons: Trivial and approximate storyline Technically very modest Longevity not very high Strategy titles are certainly not a rare commodity on GBA: just think of high-sounding names such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Advance Wars and Fire Emblem to get an idea of how the genre is asoly well represented on the Nintendo handheld platform. Despite this, there is no shortage of room for new entries, as evidenced by the release of this Rebelstar Tactical Command. A product of limited appearance only, but in reality the healthy bearer of one of the most precious legacies in the history of video games...", "date": "2005-11-11", "grade": null}
