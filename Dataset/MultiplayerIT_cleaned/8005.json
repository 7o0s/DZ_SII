Money on a desert island In the best Kairosoft tradition, Beastie Bay offers little or nothing as regards the storyline: the user must guide the actions of his digital alter-ego, who ended up on a desert island together with his pet, initially taking care of their survival and then help them manage the economic empire derived from the tourist exploitation of the place. The impression derived from the first bars of the game does not seem to reveal a revolutionary title for Kairosoft standards, for better or for worse: if therefore it is pleasant to find here too the ironic imprint typical of the Japanese software house combined with a deliberately retro graphic style , on the other hand it is annoying to note how the developers themselves have not yet learned to create a tutorial as God commands, or to make the various game menus easier to consult. In short, put down like this, the situation would not seem so different from the illustrious previous ones, yet it can be said that the focus this time has been shifted more towards a Pokemon-style rpg gameplay rather than towards the classic management structure. An aspect that is far from absent, mind you: as mentioned at the beginning, following an initial interlocutory phase, the user will soon find himself busy building and improving structures and buildings, accumulating money and resources and attracting tourists on the island, using mechanics that will immediately appear familiar to anyone who has already dealt with Kairosoft's offer. However, the strongest emphasis is placed on another phase, the one in which the player is engaged in discovering new areas of the scenario, an operation that goes hand in hand with a turn-based combat system directly inherited from Pikachu and company. Exploring an unknown area, a percentage counter is activated which is randomly interspersed with discoveries of treasures or resources and clashes with local creatures, during which the animals that have been managed to tame during the course of the game take the field. 'adventure. As in the Pokemon series, each little beast has unique abilities that can be enhanced as experience levels increase, and each enemy you face can be brought to swell the ranks of your small army through the use of special baits. It is undoubtedly a full-bodied addition to the more classic management activity, capable of making the gameplay of Beastie Bay more varied than other Kairosoft titles, which however is not perfect in its implementation. In fact, the combat system can prove to be repetitive from the start as far as it is anchored to the most ancient standards of Japanese RPGs: there is an option to make sure that the battles are managed autonomously by the AI, but in doing so you end up losing a real slice consisting of the play offer. Final note regarding the free nature of the application: Beastie Bay can be played easily without paying anything, provided you tolerate a constant advertising banner at the bottom of the screen: paying 4.49 Euros, instead you can completely eliminate the commercials and unlock the option to play in landscape mode as well.", "date": "2013-02-14", "grade": "7.2"}
