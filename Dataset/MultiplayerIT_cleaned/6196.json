We remind you that on PC the release of the DLC is temporarily suspended due to the poor state in which the conversion was released on the market, the subsequent criticisms and the suspension of the sale. Developed by Warner Bros. Games Montral based on the Batman: Arkham Knight engine created by Rocksteady Studios, Batgirl - A Family Matter offers an all-new story set long before the events narrated in Batman: Arkham Asylum, a new location plus some secrets . Without going into too much detail, also because there isn't much to say about the plot, let's say that it tells of yet another crazy plan of the Joker, who takes Jim Gordon hostage and keeps him imprisoned inside the Seagate Amusement Park together to other police officers. Built on a platform over the sea, this abandoned nautical-themed amusement park is also the only scenario in the game (no excursions to Gotham City, unfortunately), whose dimensions roughly resemble those of Ace Chemicals. To try to save the commissioner and his men, his daughter Barbara intervenes, in the role of Batgirl, and Tim Drake, in those of Robin, the third robin. By joining forces, the two young heroes will have to face the crazy clown's henchmen until the final showdown that could cost the prisoners, the two boys and the entire city dearly. A Matter of Family puts players in the shoes of Batgirl for the first time in the Arkham series Playstation 4 trophies A family matter offers players eight Trophies, six of which are Bronze and two Silver. To get them, just progress in the game or satisfy some requests such as successfully performing a particular sequence of moves against at least four enemies. Young heroes Since its announcement, to many the expansion had seemed like a sort of response from the development team to all those fans who have always asked for something more full-bodied and intriguing, even as a story, which is linked to the popular Batman action game . Unfortunately, and we say it right away, things are not quite like that, and on balance the product is something in itself. That is, it does not lead to any interesting narrative implications with regard to the main saga or the prequel (unless a sentence in the finale is connected to a possible Batman: Arkham Origins 2 in the future). The overall duration of the adventure itself is just over an hour, net of some solved puzzles and a couple of deaths. A little more if you decide to collect all the objects, trophies or mess around with the Joker's henchmen who reappear in their places after completing the title. But apart from wandering around the locations, perhaps in search of the classic easter eggs such as the balloon that pays homage to Tim Burton's Batman (it is the same used in the film during the Joker parade), or the figure of the super criminal Starro, which they will make all Bat Man fans happy, always attentive to these particular quotes, there is no New Game Plus or anything like that. In any case, moving on to analyze the playability, this is obviously similar to that of Batman: Arkham Knight, with Batgirl who in fact has, as a perfect student, a set of moves equal to that of the Dark Knight. Compared to the champion of Gotham, however, the young woman is less powerful and resistant (but only slightly), also because the DLC does not include upgrades to the suit or techniques, but at the same time more agile and elegant in her movements. He can also count on his hacker skills to manipulate some elements of the areas in which he is located to exploit them to his own advantage. With the Remote Infiltrator, Barbara Gordon can in fact bypass the security systems, but also control the electrical systems to darken a room or activate generators and mechanical ~fortune tellers~. In this way he can take advantage of the darkness to eliminate enemies more easily, making them momentarily blind, or distract them with sounds by attracting them to a point far away from where he is. It goes without saying that this is the winning combination to get to the bottom of fights without risking getting hurt. As happens in the main adventure, even in this additional content the developers have given space to the Dual Play functionality, that is, that system that allows the gamer to be able to fight alongside an ally, specifically Robin. The dynamic duo During battles it is possibletake control of the robin with a simple press of the L1 backbone, leaving Batgirl to be managed by the game until you decide to swap them again or a duo combo is achieved. Batman's sidekick uses his high-powered baton to deal heavy damage to enemies, but also to shield himself from their attacks. For the rest, the dynamics of the couple are the same as already seen in the main game, which in some ways is not exactly an advantage, since once the novelty of the new protagonists is exhausted, a certain sense of dj vu makes its way into the player. The difficulty level is not very high, and the only times you can die is in a couple of circumstances in which you have to eliminate a certain number of enemies and defuse bombs within a specific time frame, otherwise the bomb will explode. offending area and game over. In these cases, in fact, often you don't have time to find the right combination (Harley Quinn has also created fake passwords) that you blow up and you have to start over the fight and attempt to defuse. On balance, therefore, Batgirl - A family matter is not a wicked DLC, but perhaps not even what many fans expected. On the positive side, it has the presence of Batgirl, a character much loved by the public, the possibility of still being able to have fun in the universe of the Arkham series and the return of that fascinating lunatic of the Joker, plus a fair playability (nice idea of enhancing the of Barbara's hackers even in combat). When compared to Harley Quinn or Red Hood DLC, by the way, it looks like a masterpiece of longevity and beauty. On the negative side, however, we point out above all the overall duration of the adventure, not particularly smart enemies and a trivial plot that seems to be put there just to justify the presence of the protagonists. And it is perhaps from this point of view that an important opportunity was wasted to offer the owners of Batman: Arkham Knight a concrete addition to the main story, or to the general narrative universe of Arkham, perhaps by telling the growth of Barbara as Batgirl, or the tragic events that would later force her into a wheelchair to become the Oracle. For the moment, also in relation to what we have seen so far regarding the extra contents released at the launch of the ~Knight of Arkham~, we are satisfied, even if we recommend the purchase of the expansion only to enthusiasts. But we are convinced that starting with the next DLCs, Warner Bros. Interactive and the developers will have to do much better if they want to deserve favorable reviews, truly satisfy their fans and justify the huge costs that gamers will have to pay for them.", "date": "2015-07-15", "grade": null}
