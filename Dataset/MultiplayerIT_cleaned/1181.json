{"name": "Wreckfest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wreckfest-recensione-ps5.html", "text": "The review of Wreckfest for PS5 ideally represents the closing of a circle for the ~motor combat game~ developed by Bugbear Entertainment. Originally released on PC in 2018, the title actually boasts a much longer history, which even began in 2013 with a Kickstarter campaign. It is therefore completely natural that the experience fielded by this original racer on PlayStation 5 appears for many ~traditional~ verses, devoid of particular cues or solutions that we have been able to appreciate within more recent productions. However, what does not change is the substance, thanks to the excellent physics engine and its ability to effectively represent the deformation of vehicles after a series of violent impacts. Structure Wreckfest will have you driving lawn mowers on more than one occasion. So let's start from the numbers, which describe Wreckfest as a full-bodied and interesting experience. The heart of the game is represented by a career mode composed of five championships that become accessible as we complete the races and earn experience points, each divided into various events, whether they are single races or tournaments. The crazy and goliardic spirit of the title is clarified right from the start, when we are put on board a lawnmower and launched into a completely insane demolition derby, in which the objective is to devastate the opponents by charging them at maximum speed and inflicting significant damage in an attempt to prevent them from our own vehicle explodes. Wreckfest has three-wheeled vans at heart, but they tend to tip over when cornering. The most eccentric part of Wreckfest remains a constant presence within the career, between minivan and bus races, combine harvesters facing each other in the arena and even speed competitions held on ... sofas with wheels. However, these are ultimately fun parentheses compared to more normal events, if you will, in which you get to drive muscle cars, compacts and estates. There are numerous challenges in which you simply have to cross the finish line first, and which therefore require adequate investments in terms of enhancements, an aspect that revolves around not only improving performance but also the resistance of the bodywork and aesthetics, with a small but nice editor for paints and liveries. Wreckfest, a traditional circuit race. But watch out for the cars against traffic! However, variety is king and so we will also be able to try our hand at crazy races in which the circuits cross or even share sections in which we drive in both directions, giving rise to spectacular accidents which will sometimes force us to reset the position of the car to be able to get back on track and try to catch up. In addition to the career there are weekly or custom events, as well as an online multiplayer mode for twenty-four players full of options, with the possibility of finding a quick match, selecting a specific server or controlling the list of lobbies. The presence of Wreckfest in the PS Plus catalog has helped to increase online users, so you won't struggle to find someone to challenge. Gameplay Wreckfest boasts a great physics engine for body deformation and impacts. So let's get to the gameplay, with an important premise: if you play Wreckfest leaving the lowest difficulty level among the three available, set by default, you'll just take long walks on the track, overtaking anyone without any effort. Therefore, it is better to opt for the intermediate degree of challenge, which gives the right importance to the upgrades and can certainly commit you a little more. The strength of the Bugbear Entertainment title is, as already mentioned, the physics engine: the rendering of impacts is excellent, the vehicle bodies deform dynamically up to unthinkable levels (and you can decide how much this damage affects the functioning of the car) and also on the driving front this system produces very pleasant sensations. Wreckfest favors dirt circuits, and via countersteering and drifts. Racing on mostly dirt tracks, you will in fact have to perform continuous drifts and counter-steer to manage the direction of the vehicle in order to face the curves, avoid devastating front-ends at the last second and maybe give your opponents a nice nudge so that they have a close encounter with one of the trees at the edge of the track. There is no shortage of options to customize the experience, from the macroscopic ones (manual or automatic gearbox, any electronic aids, the aforementioned degree of difficulty) to the smallest nuances, within a driving model yesstill confirms today solid, fun and very well balanced. The DualSense adaptive triggers do the rest, simulating the weight of the accelerator and brake during the various phases. Technical realization Wreckfest, a nice racing sequence at sunset. Probably the aspect that feels the weight of the years the most, the technical realization of Wreckfest can count in this next-gen version on the rather stable 4K resolution and 60 fps, but at the same time shows the side to a series of ingenuities that betray the real age of the product, see for example the ~fake~ clouds and the smoke generated by the tires on the asphalt. That said, there are elements that still hold their own, such as the general degree of interaction with the environment (the fences that disintegrate when we overwhelm them, the tires on the edge of the track that blow up, the tracks on the ground), the accompanying objects (including the public) and a lighting system that colors the events that take place at dusk in splendid shades. Loads are slower than average on PS5 and some things can only make those who own the game on PS4 turn up their noses (the saves are not compatible and the upgrade is not free, but you pay 9.99 euros). However , if you are a PlayStation Plus subscriber, the problem does not arise: download and enjoy all the sincerity of this crazy and noisy experience. Because, in hindsight, there's still fuel in the old Wreckfest engine.", "date": "2021-05-08", "grade": "7.5"}
