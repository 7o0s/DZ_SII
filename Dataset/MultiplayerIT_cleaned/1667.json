{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker.html", "text": "Buy one play three The Wind Waker is a huge game in itself, but it comes to an end sooner or later. So why not dive back into the magical atmosphere of Ocarina of Time or, better yet, the never-before-marketed The Master Quest, a revised and corrected version of OOT? And you don't need to dust off or buy a Nintendo 64 for the occasion, but just get your hands on the limited edition of TWW which includes, in fact, a bonus mini-DVD containing the two aforementioned games that run perfectly, in emulation, on GameCube. The differences from the original are minimal, high resolution screen rendering and a bit more stable frame rate, and the GC pad adapts beautifully to the OOT control system. The game remains an unmissable classic, a milestone that is a pleasure to rediscover and that any gamer worthy of the name should at least try. Master Quest, known in Japan under the name of URA Zelda, while not offering particularly marked differences compared to OOT is still a welcome addition. The only notes: in order to play OOT and Master Quest it is necessary to have a TV that supports 60Hz and both games are in English, French and German. Unfortunately no Italian. With the wind at your back Ocarina of Time was undoubtedly perfect. But Wind Waker is better, and as such it easily grabs the title of best Zelda ever made. There, I said it. And now I have to go through the rest of the review to convince you of this statement. A task that is not really difficult given the caliber of the last born in the Nintendo house. The Wind Waker is genuinely Zelda, 100%, from the first pixel to the last. Even more than Ocarina of Time, especially from a visual point of view. Miyamoto's choice to opt for a pushed cel shading and for an extremely caricatured graphic setting has divided audiences and critics, causing waves of indignation and vehement protests at the time of the first presentation of the title. And what was Miyamoto doing at the time, while half the world's forums were shouting sacrilege? He laughed mockingly, already knowing that he would be right. Eh, well, he was right, as always after all. In fact, once you try The Wind Waker there is no turning back: goodbye to the more adult look of Ocarina of Time, this is the real Zelda, not 'that'. TWW is the perfect, genuine transposition of the two-dimensional Zelda classics into the three-dimensional realm, with Link in the historic green suit, with a fluttering hat and brown boots. It is A Link to the Past, but polygonal. A certainly courageous choice that of Miyamoto and Aonuma, director of the game, but perfectly consistent with the spirit of the saga, and able to restore to the series all its highly symbolic meanings that the excessively realistic setting of OOT and Majora's Mask risked making to fade. An approach of this type, in addition to making The Wind Waker the first truly interactive cartoon, allowed Miyamoto to take the expressiveness of the characters to the extreme, accentuating their emotions, playing on feelings, making them come alive. The game also features clear homages to one of the people Miyamoto most admires, the Japanese animation guru Hayao Miyazaki. The Maestro has a sincere and deep love for Miyazaki's work, which he does not hesitate to celebrate through more or less direct quotations, which any admirer of the great Japanese director will not fail to grasp. With the wind at your back The plot from which the game starts is typically Zeldian. It is simple and immediate, it involves the player without ever taking over the gameplay and without ever bridling him, always leaving him with maximum freedom of movement and action. The theme is once again the eternal struggle between good and evil, which sees Link, personification of the hero par excellence, oppose the forces of darkness. We start on a happy island lost in the middle of the sea, it's our young hero's birthday. It's a day of celebration, but something goes wrong: the shape of a huge bird appears in the sky, chased by a pirate ship. Struck, the bird drops a blonde girl, Dazel, commander of the pirates, on the island. Unfortunately, instead of Dazel, the ferocious bird of prey decides to kidnap Link's sister Aril: needless to say, our hero won't waste time and will set off in pursuit of the mysterious bird. In order not to spoil the surprise, we won't reveal anything else, but know in any case that all the classic Zeldian clichs are respected and that there are a couple of twists that can leave you speechless. But now it's time to set sail... GBA Connection Also in The Wind Waker it is possible to use the GBA, suitably connected to the GameCube with the appropriate cable, in order to access an interesting modaltwo-player cooperative gameplay. While one player uses Link, the other directs, through the GBA, the elf Tingle, who is able to help Link in various ways. Tingle has a map of the play area at his disposal and can give Link useful advice, as well as being able to support him in combat, for example by throwing bombs on enemies. Be warned though, some of Tingle's stock costs rupees. Be careful not to run dry! Co-op gameplay via the GBA is somewhat limited, but a welcome addition nonetheless. set sail! We don't tell you how and why, but you'll soon find yourself aboard a sailing boat of your own. A rather unique craft, endowed with a head and able to speak, helping Link in his adventure with valuable advice. The world that the player is called to explore is truly boundless this time: forget the Hyrule Fields to travel on the back of Epona, here we are talking about an entire ocean, a huge expanse of water dotted with islands, other ships, submarines. The game structure closely resembles that of the previous Zeldas, but in The Wind Waker everything is vaster, everything richer, and the gameplay, with its countless layers of interpretation, is of a disarming depth. You can get lost for hours immersed in the world of The Wind Waker, always discovering something new to do, marveling at the infinite amount of gimmicks, tackling the large number of mini-games perfectly integrated into the main game structure and enjoying the incredible variety of facets of the new Miyamotian birth. There are so many goodies to mention, starting from the direction of Link's gaze which acts as an interactive hint system to get to the interesting treasure hunt system, but space is tight. However, we cannot overlook one of the most amazing aspects of TWW, namely the incredible coherence of the world and the game environment, made possible by perhaps the best engine ever developed in the history of video games. Nintendo has eliminated the meaning of the word pop-up and has effectively removed the virtual barriers that too often limit the player in three-dimensional games. Once you set foot on an island, often of considerable size, the entire island and all the elements that compose it are managed in real time by the 128bit Nintendo, regardless of Link's position. For example, using the telescope, one of the objects available to our hero in the green overalls, it is possible to indulge oneself in observing the movements of enemies who are on the opposite side of the stage, or admire, from unthinkable distances, expanses of blades of grass and flowers swaying in the wind. The world is real, tangible, and all the elements that compose it are always present. And they are influenced by our actions. For example, Link in TWW can manipulate the wind at will (hence the title of the game), and every single variation interacts with all the elements of the game environment. The grass sways sadly in the direction of the wind, as do the flags, Link's green hat. And the news in heaven, the smoke and the blades of grass, cut by the sword, faithfully follow the breeze. They seem like little details, but a world so coherent in its construction exponentially increases the feeling of immersion for the player. set sail! Accompanying us on our long journey is an almost perfect control interface, a natural evolution of the excellent one introduced by Ocarina of Time, a superb, spectacular and complete combat system, and sublime camera management, even if there is sometimes some uncertainty and jamming, however minor defects that can be easily solved by resorting to the manual orientation of the virtual camera. The difficulty level is really well calibrated: the game is not too difficult, but there is no shortage of tough passages and puzzles to solve that require adequate use of gray matter. Some dungeons are designed to give even the most savvy players a hard time, offering an always adequate and stimulating level of challenge. The length of The Wind Waker is very remarkable, the main adventure alone is able to keep the player glued to the screen for a large number of hours and offers a longer life than Ocarina of Time. If you then get carried away and start exploring every single island hunting for items and minigames, get ready to say goodbye to your social life for a long, long time. Excellent, as always, the sound commentary, signed by the great Koji Kondo and the audio effects, of the highest level. Link, as per tradition, never speaks, but every single line of text on the screen is translated into excellent Italian. Hats off and adeserved applause to Nintendo and the translators: playing The Wind Waker in the language that once belonged to Dante Alighieri is a real pleasure. Comment Every game has a story, only one is a legend. Never was the slogan more appropriate for a video game: The Legend of Zelda  The Wind Waker is an absolute masterpiece, one of the best games ever made for any platform. A concentrate of pure playability and adventure, a killer application that cannot be missing in the soft library of any player worthy of the name. The Maestro and his right-hand man Aonuma hit the bull's-eye once again. And there was no doubt about it. Pros: Pure gameplay Long and addictive adventure Stellar technical realization Stylistically impeccable It's Zelda Every time a new Zelda comes out, the world of video games stops with bated breath. Because Zelda is the perfect work, the sum of the video game, the title that more than any other sums up the very concept of video game. It is the complete experience: adventure, action, atmosphere. Always with the player at the center of the scene, always proposing new ideas, new design cues, new approaches and new, ingenious solutions. Always doing school and laying down the law. Zelda is Miyamoto's dearest creature, even more than Mario: because it exemplarily sums up the concept of Miyamoto's video game and because more than anything else it comes close to the Maestro's childhood fantasies, made up of imaginary fantastic journeys and incredible adventures in the woods behind his home. The premises are these, and the raw facts tell us that Miyamoto has never missed a beat with the Zelda saga (let's leave out the chapters on CD-I, they don't count), raising from time to time, at the exit of each new chapter, the concept of video game. Could Wind Waker perhaps be outdone? Short and concise answer: no.", "date": "2003-05-02", "grade": null}
