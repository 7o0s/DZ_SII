{"name": "Raid: Shadow Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/raid-shadow-legends-la-recensione.html", "text": "If you have followed the mobile panorama of recent years at least, you will surely have got an idea of how the RPGs specially developed for Android and iOS have configured: they are substantially all pertaining to a rigid canon which constitutes one of the sub-genres of most successful these days, at least from the point of view of the amount of games released within it. Just remaining on the pages of Multiplayer.it, in recent months we have reviewed Valkyrie Anatomia: The Origin, Epic Seven and Brave Frontier: The Last Summoner which basically represent quite precisely what we are talking about: role-playing games with turn-based combat, quests consisting of waves of progressive enemies, deep management of characters and an emphasis on collecting them, through a summoning system with expenditure of in-game currency that corresponds to the typical ~gacha~ mechanic. It's amazing how this list of features corresponds extremely accurately to a now endless amount of mobile RPGs, as well as Raid: Shadow Legends, the protagonist of this review. Plarium's game is a really good sample of this video game genre, indeed the problem is that it is too much so: there is absolutely nothing new proposed in this title, which also resorting to a decidedly standardized setting such as classic fantasy it cannot even count on a strong and specific identity. However, there are also several compelling aspects to Raid: Shadow Legends, in case you're still willing to spend some time with this type of game. Arriving in a period of total saturation of the gacha-RPG market, whose play offer is now clearly offering its side to other less inflated game solutions, it must be said that, at least, the Plarium game does its duty honestly , starting with a truly impressive graphic design. Heroes collection The story speaks of the crisis of the world of Teleria, now on the verge of collapse due to the continuous wars carried on by the dark forces of Siroth, against which the Arbiter tries in every way to put a dam. Within all this, we find ourselves having to compose an army of fighters and free various areas of the game world by carrying out the campaign quests, structured as simple sequences of progressively difficult fights. As you progress through the game, you also unlock other modes such as Dungeons (substantially similar to quests), Arena, Clan Boss and Faction Wars which also involve PvP, but as a structure you remain anchored to the classic turn-based RPG where all the gameplay revolves around to character management. Just to clarify: autoplay is activated by default and is actually the best choice to adopt, considering the extreme repetitiveness of the fights and game situations. The aspect on which we find ourselves acting, more than anything else, is therefore the construction of the army and its management. The first aspect is based on the acquisition of new characters as game rewards or through the summoning system with the expenditure of gems, which triggers the typical gacha dynamic with integrated micro-transactions. Raid: Shadow Legends is not among the worst pay-to-win cases seen on this front, it must be said, but the rate of high-profile summons is so low that the use of some in-app purchases to get something more substantial it seems practically inevitable. On the other hand, the continuous and exhausting pop-ups that draw attention to the various packages on offer to buy are decidedly explicit on how the game's economy is set up. The balance of power between the combatants is regulated by the classic rock-paper-scissors circle even if the reflexes of this system are almost imperceptible in combat, where equipment management instead acquires great importance. On this front, Raid is rather deep and complex, with the possibility of combining weapons and objects with common characteristics to obtain related bonuses, with interesting and rather varied chain effects. The problem, in this sense, is represented by a rather confused and uncomfortable interface, with extremely small elements (at least on smartphones) which can complicate the precise understanding of the functioning of the equipment and the various upgrades.", "date": "2019-08-02", "grade": "7.0"}
