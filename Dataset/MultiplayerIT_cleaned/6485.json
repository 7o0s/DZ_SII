And also in the case of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 we have come to the test of the last installment. A particular episode, which had to answer several ~whys~, deepen some narrative elements related to its characters, including the antagonists, and put an end to the events narrated in recent weeks. In reality, we anticipate it immediately, the feeling we had after the end credits is that with this fourth episode a door has been closed, but a window has also been left open for a possible third chapter. However, the episode opens with the arrival of Claire and Moira in the ~lair~ of their tormentor, which turns out to be very different from how they probably imagined it. This first part of the game can almost seem like a joke, since it doesn't last very long. Instead it is authentic, and despite being short and linear in its unfolding, with a classic final situation of a desperate escape, it probably contains one of the most dramatic moments of the whole story. Two, actually, if you evaluate another element altogether. However, after having explored the area, the couple of girls find what they were looking for, and after a long discussion with the so-called Guardian, a fact occurs that will lead to the scenario described above. The final act of Revelations 2 reveals all the background of the cases of Claire and Moira, and Barry and Natalia The cave of the beast The act with Barry and Natalia is instead much longer, and is once again the best for variety, scenarios and situations. Former member of S.T.A.R.S. he goes through a very difficult moment both emotionally and physically, and even finds himself having to go down into the bowels of the mines to try to find the despicable person responsible for all the events that have involved him, his loved ones and the inhabitants of the island. A far from easy undertaking given that the hunt proceeds through tunnels full of poisonous gas, pseudo zombies and creatures of all kinds affected by the mutagenic virus known as t-Phobos. There will also be a welcome surprise for all Resident Evil fans, up to the awaited, pyrotechnic final, where the design of the boss and the long, particularly difficult battle that will characterize his appearance are very successful, and which at a certain point will lead to an interesting variant in the mechanics of the battle, also involving a second character. The only drawback of this second part, in our opinion, is the fact that in terms of history at a certain point it expires a bit in certain clichs. Not that the plot is bad, mind you. It was only legitimate to expect a little more than in certain fairly obvious situations. Above all, the figure of the Guardian could have been better valued, giving him more space even before the final stages. Be that as it may, going further, from the point of view of the game mechanics in general, given the unfolding of the two acts, we can basically only speak of those of Barry and Natalia, which confirm the good things we had already written in the course of the previous reviews, in detail of the third episode. If initially we had indicated the one made up of Claire and Moira as the best matched couple in the game, subsequent events made us change our minds by tipping the balance of our preferences in favor of the bearded ex S.T.A.R.S. and his young companion. Also in The mutation, in fact, Natalia's powers are decisive for the purposes of the adventure because perceiving the presence of the creatures that populate the island, especially that of the Revenants and their weak points, greatly facilitates the player's task in get around them or in eliminating them often avoiding face-to-face confrontation. But even the simpler dynamics, like switching between the two characters to pull down a set of levers or the like, seem to work better with this pair. Also interesting is Capcom's idea of trying to update some classic situations by adding small but significant variations, such as the presence of toxic substances in some tunnels which forces the gamer not to dwell too much in certain environments, on pain of death. But also to move in a certain way to look for points where the characters can breathe, while avoiding being trapped in the clutches of some monster hidden behind the gaseous vapours. Moira and Natalia Before moving on to analyze the technical part, we want to focus for a moment on two extra contents available individually or with the Complete Season of the game. In addition to the Raid mode, which we extensively dissected in the review of the first episode, and the possibility of replaying the individual episodes with different options, such as Invisible Enemies and Countdown, Revelations 2 offers two additional episodes focused on the stories of Moira Burton and Natalia Korda. One, titled The Trial, puts the player in Moira's shoes and partially delves into a certain point in the story. Unfortunately, as with other situations, we cannot explain in detail what it is because it is closely related to the main adventure and therefore the topic is at risk of spoilers. The other episode, Little Woman, lets us get to know the character of Natalia better. Accompanied by a mysterious figure, the girl is here ~officially~ engaged in finding her favorite teddy bear, lost in the sewers. Officially because reality is not always exactly as it appears. The episode with Barry's daughter has slightly more action gameplay, with even hunting phases, while the gameplay of Natalia's story is more of a stealth type. Having closed this parenthesis dedicated to this pair of extras that benefit the longevity factor, we close as mentioned before by talking about the technical part. The fourth episode also confirms what was said in the previous review, namely that thanks to a couple of small changes and optimizations made by Capcom with the 1.0.1 patch, the general image has certainly been made more stable to the advantage of playability and visual system, even if we still have to report some sporadic slowdowns, especially in structurally more crowded areas full of monsters and fog effects. But everything disappears before the atmosphere. In particular, the indoor scenarios are able to return evocative glimpses from a horror point of view, especially inside the caves of the mine, helping to make the figures of the creatures that infest those areas more frightening. Above all the Rotters, that is to say those pseudo zombies almost completely consumed and skeletal by now, and the ~silenthilliani~ and disturbing Revenants, with their bodies battered by the effects of the Uroboros virus and variants. Audio works the same way. The music increases the player's involvement with some tracks that are activated in the most horror and dramatic situations, without forgetting the excellent sound effects.", "date": "2015-03-17", "grade": "7.5"}
