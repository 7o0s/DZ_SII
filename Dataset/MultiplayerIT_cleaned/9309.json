{"name": "Section 8: Prejudice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/88139-section-8-prejudice-orgoglio-e-pregiudizio-e-tizi-in-armatura.html", "text": "Version tested: PC~Launch, land and fight!~: this was the title of our review of Section 8, the TimeGate Studios FPS released in 2009 for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game put on the table a classic gameplay, vaguely inspired to Halo as regards the settings but characterized by some strong ideas, of great impact. In the first place, and it was really about impact, the player burst onto the scene: equipped with a powerful battle armor, our character threw himself from a height of fifteen thousand feet and impacted the ground like a meteor, and then raise your head and open fire on the enemies that infested the scenario. A rather linear single player campaign, devoid of memorable moments and basically short, was accompanied by a multiplayer full of modes but without acute ones, often confusing and not very rewarding. It is therefore pleasing to see that things have changed for Section 8: Prejudice, given that the developers have understood which were the weakest elements of the experience and have made an effort to revise them, enrich them or both. At the price of only 12.99 euros, therefore, it is possible to buy a fun title on Steam, well made and equipped with respectable numbers. But first things first... The protagonist of the story is once again Alex Corde, commander of the Eighth Armored Infantry, who after the events of the first episode finds himself facing a terrible and unexpected threat. Nothing that a lot of weapons and ammunition can't solve however, and so here we are again in the Corde armor, immediately in the heart of the action after a short tutorial and subsequently fired from above as usual, with the aim to track down and eliminate our enemies thanks to the support of some companions. Shoot what happens to you The first difference between Section 8: Prejudice and the first chapter of the series lies in the structure of the single player campaign. In fact, if previously the missions appeared disconnected from each other, in this sequel greater importance has been given to narrative continuity, which is not broken even by the launch we mentioned earlier. Almost always supported by companions equipped with a moderate artificial intelligence, Alex Corde finds himself facing quite varied situations, while remaining within the linearity of an ~obligatory path~ such as the one shown on the map (even going outside his confines for a few seconds translates into a game over...), and must eliminate the numerous enemies that appear in front of him using a respectable arsenal, which includes assault rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, pistols but also vibrating daggers, grenades of various kinds and so on. The supplies are guaranteed by special devices present within the maps, and although it is difficult to run out of ammunition, the possibility appears much more concrete than the original Section 8. And speaking of possibilities, the supply units allow us not only to reload the equipped weapons, but also to change them with those available in the database, as well as to manage a certain amount of ~armor points~ to emphasize one skill of our character rather than another. We can therefore increase the resistance value of the armor or improve the efficiency of the shields, increase the shooting accuracy or enhance the penetration capacity of the bullets, and so on. There are predefined classes to choose from, with different sets of weapons and skills, but it is a speech that finds its own dimension more than anything else in the multiplayer modes. Using an Xbox 360 controller, the game immediately offers a classic layout, with the left trigger to aim and the right one to open fire, the X button to reload the equipped weapon, the Y button to switch between primary to the secondary one, the left stick pressed on its axis to run (with the ~boost~ mode which, if desired, is activated automatically, and sees our character rapidly dash forward, switching to a third-person view) and the left backbone and right which are used respectively to operate the jetpack and to use the special weapon (be it a grenade or a dagger - by the way, the close and silent kills now translate into spectacular ~fatalities~). Star Wars After the story mode, which also in this case is made up of eight levels for a duration of about five hours, but which boasts numerous good ideas (such as the possibility of using vehicles), Section 8: Prejudice offers us two online multiplayer mode which also multipliessoon, and which see teams made up of sixteen players fighting for the conquest of the territory (Conquest) or a team made up of four people who face together ever more menacing hordes of enemies (Swarm). We tried both modes during a session organized by TimeGate Studios, and we were favorably impressed by the quality of the experience, by the almost total absence of lag and above all by the presence of very engaging and exciting mechanics, which encourage you to play that ~extra game~ ~ which is generally the prerogative of only the most famous titles. The Swarm mode hasn't impressed us for the moment, considering its basic simplicity and the not flawless artificial intelligence that moves the enemies and often pushes them to expose themselves dangerously to our gusts, seeking shelter only when it's too late. The matter relating to the Conquest mode is very different, which appears incredibly multifaceted thanks to the extension of the maps, the presence of numerous extra devices (by acting on the d-pad it is possible to use the ~credits~ available to buy and place support units, turrets of attack, anti-aircraft batteries but also air sleds, armored vehicles and mechs) and to the dynamics of conquest and defense of the various positions. In short, it was decided to summarize the online sector of the game, rightly focusing on the most successful things and eliminating the superfluous. Moving on to the purely technical topic, even here we must recognize the developers for an excellent job in terms of optimizing the graphics engine: we tried the first Section 8 on a PC equipped with an ATI Radeon 4870 video card, encountering numerous uncertainties and slowdowns, so much so that we often had to lower the quality of the effects, while the sequel runs at 25-30 FPS without any particular drops, with all effects maxed out and at a resolution of 1600x900 pixels, on a mid-range notebook. Quite a difference, I must say. The design of the game has generally made substantial steps forward, with scenarios much richer in elements and plausible from an architectural point of view, even if the choice of colors often leaves something to be desired and the special effects remain weak (see the explosions ). The sound sector is discreet, even if we would have liked a more present musical accompaniment.", "date": "2011-05-03", "grade": "8.3"}
