{"name": "Oxenfree", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/162693-oxenfree-inquietanti-frequenze.html", "text": "Starting from its strange, untranslatable title, Oxenfree presents itself as a very particular game. The little material released before its launch only hinted at something of its composite nature, but there is much more than it might seem at first glance in this game, which seems to escape even a standard cataloging according to the consolidated system of genres. It is an adventure that in many respects brings us back to the new trend of ~walking simulators~, yet its continuous reference to excursions on the map, the particular mechanics introduced by the radio and the lateral scrolling shot make it something unique, without even taking any consider the story. The narrative is the backbone of Oxenfree: there is a well-defined story and a complex interweaving of events staged through an extraordinarily mature exploitation of the expressive capabilities of the video game, an expert use of its narrative potential that is not surprising that much if you think that the Night School team is made up of former members of Telltale and Disney. In addition to all this there is the particular atmosphere of a teen horror movie in the style of the 80s, however filtered through a more modern taste and sensibility, in a hodgepodge of suggestions that recalls Amblin's ~Spielbergian~ films of about thirty years years ago, Stephen King and J.J. Abrams, Scooby Doo, old LucasFilm adventures and the classic branching structure of Telltale stories. In short, Oxenfree has a story to tell, and it does so in its own particular and incisive way, also lending itself to stratified readings between the horror surface and the underlying coming-of-age story. He easily manages to get inside if we allow him, and to stay with us even after the end credits close, leaving us in the company of a trail of thoughts and ghosts as only good stories can do. On the other hand, several strange and small details along the way leave many questions open, which prompt us to return to the game to experiment with new paths and further readings. Between melancholy, classic teen comedy and horror, Oxenfree is a splendid narrative experience The hidden truths A group of guys is preparing to spend a night on the beach of Edward's Island, a small and charming island to which they are all a bit related for various pasts, but of which no one has ever been able to understand exactly the mysteries hidden inside. There is no need to delve into the plot too much, being the fulcrum of the gaming experience, but suffice it to say that what was supposed to be a simple party evening in view of the conclusion of high school and the classic ~prom night~ turns into something far greater, disturbing and dangerous. Dark secrets and ghosts entangled in the radio frequency network that seems to surround the island, a former military training centre, burst into reality when the boys open it, tuning a simple portable radio to a forbidden frequency, a sort of dimensional passage which forces them to investigate the unsolved mysteries of the place. There is an episode that can explain the choice of the bizarre title and something about the whole underlying theme: in a particularly disturbing moment, one of the characters pronounces the phrase ~all the outs in free~, which derives from the ancient formula ~Olly olly oxen free~ used by children to ~free everyone~ during the game of hide and seek. It is a symbolic phase of the entire game because it reveals a whole hidden theater of relationships, memories, secrets and anxieties that are hidden under the apparently peaceful surface of the island and of the same relationships between the boys. There is not only a good horror story at the base of Oxenfree, which also has the advantage of maintaining a difficult coherence between the mystery and the ability to reveal well and progressively what is happening on Edward's Island, but through the continuous and tight dialogues, never dull, the game also manages to perfectly stage the difficult teenage relationships. Therefore, the typical rigidities that derive from the sedimentation of bad moods emerge, the difficulty in opening up to others, the blocks and feelings of guilt linked to mourning and priceless losses and fear together with the urgent need for change. From this point of view, the race against time to get out of the nightmare of the island becomes a cathartic moment and a real rite of passage towards maturity, of which the player can be partially the architect through the numerous possible choices in the dialogues and in story branches, leading to different endings. Among other things, the game is full of secrets placed on different levels, from Morse messages that can be picked up with the radio to readings of different plot elements and stratified, it seems that the more disturbing elements of the story are not detected in a normal play but need more insights and probably to conclude the game multiple times. To get an idea of what is emerging you can read what has emerged so far on the dedicated subReddit, it would not be surprising if something new were to appear in the next period because there are several strange and still incomprehensible elements hidden inside, which could also postpone to some particularly twisted ARG (alternate reality game). An interactive story A narrative system of this magnitude is counterbalanced by a rather bare-bones play structure, this being essentially an interactive story rather than a real graphic adventure. The interaction with the scenarios is limited to a few possible actions within the numerous and fascinating screens, so much so that for a good part of the time we simply find ourselves wandering around the map and following the dialogues between the characters, with moments of ~ game~ focus on topical events around the island. All this leads to a rather diluted pace of the action, which is why Oxenfree recalls the staid and reflective style of walking simulators and the puzzles present are somewhat guided, while the entire gaming experience is necessarily concentrated in a few hours (around 4 hours game), still having to keep the story compact and the narrative on a good pace. The importance of the choices entrusted to the player, which progressively lead to ramifications of the plot through the behaviors taken in various situations, the constant answers to be chosen during the dialogues and the way in which some questions are resolved, lead however to want to experience all the various possibilities, therefore the replayability rate is still high, beyond the inevitable collectibles to be found scattered throughout the settings. The two main modes of interaction are offered by the possibility of choosing whether and how to continue the dialogues with the characters and by the particular use of the radio, not surprisingly both highly narrative mechanics. The radio is a constant throughout the game: by pressing the appropriate key it is possible to extract it and try to tune it to numerous frequencies, thus obtaining information on the tourist attractions of the island or picking up transmissions capable of revealing memories and secrets related to the various places in which it is located. The radio is also essential to activate some mechanisms and to ~tune in~ with the dimensional anomalies and communicate with the metaphysical presences of Edward's Island. Xbox One goals In the game we find 13 unlockable achievements for only 1000 points to collect. Almost all of them are conquered by carrying out some particular actions throughout the game, collecting collectibles and reaching the various endings. This means that to get the complete collection you need to replay the story multiple times and try out all the different story branches. Melancholy charm Another characterizing element of Oxenfree, the graphic style also demonstrates the team's experience and confidence in their expressive abilities, so much so as to give the game a sweet and romantic, almost childish, trait that seems to clash with the dark elements of the plot. Among mists, soft lights and soft twilight colors what emerges is a dreamlike and melancholy picture that well underlines the nuances of the story and associates perfectly with the atmosphere, giving the game a very peculiar and defined identity even compared to the numerous productions from the strong graphic characterization on the market, especially in the indie arena. Also from this point of view the potential expressed by the Night School study is remarkable, moreover with an excellent use of the ~lo-fi~ style graphic distortion effects to highlight the ~strange~ moments which recall, also in this case, the vintage VHS grain. This stylistic coherence is further underlined by a musical accompaniment that ranges from ambient to electronic, managing to optimally support the rhythm of the narration between moments of relaxation and more intense sequences. On this front, we must also mention the excellent dubbing which further enhances the dialogues, although there are also some possible problems for Italian users to note. The game is entirely in English, both speech and subtitles and given the small size of the latter and the fast pace of discussions between the characters, which often tend to overlap each other while talking, it is often not easy to follow everything perfectly which is said and the thing is particularly problematic given alsoand the speed with which it is necessary to choose the different options with which to carry the dialogues forward. Furthermore, strangely, the radio broadcasts, which also contain interesting information and details for the story, are not subtitled. It is therefore necessary to master English and have a slightly trained ear in order to fully appreciate all the nuances of Oxenfree's narration.", "date": "2016-01-29", "grade": "8.5"}
