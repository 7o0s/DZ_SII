As you are about to read in the Transformers: Tactical Arena review, the strategy developed by RED Games takes its cue from that formula to involve Hasbro's transformable robots in exciting battles. The game is exactly as you imagine it, with six arenas that can be unlocked gradually that we level up and the various Optimus Prime, Megatron, Soundwave and Bumblebee to play the role of unit to be launched on a battlefield that develops vertically and which requires the destruction of enemy towers within a strictly competitive context. Gameplay Transformers: Battle Arena, robots battle it out in the second unlockable scenario If you have played even a short time with Clash Royale, you will have no problem familiarizing yourself with the mechanics underlying the gameplay of Transformers: Tactical Arena, since they are exactly the same. Having found an online opponent thanks to a rather quick and effective matchmaking system, we will be projected into a scenario and we will have the dual task of protecting our towers and destroying those of the opponent. In the lower part of the screen we will notice an indicator of the action energy that fills up as seconds go by and allows you to deploy more or less powerful units, which behave differently once activated. Bonecrusher, one of the Constructicons, for example plays the role of the unstoppable tank placed there to absorb the blows, while Optimus Prime makes his way with his ax and can also be launched in vehicle mode if desired: a feature not common to all characters, Unfortunately. Transformers: Tactical Arena deck screen with upgrades Soundwave shoots forward, then stops and throws his transformable audio cassettes to make their way up to the enemy's main tower, and so on for a total of twenty different robots to which are added various minions, emplacements and special attacks. Furthermore, once one of the side towers is destroyed, the range of action of the player with the advantage widens and the fight becomes even more frenetic. Each victory corresponds to obtaining chests which, however, can be opened instantly, without the waiting times typical of freemiums: a clear sign of how Transformers: Tactical Arena has been modified for the debut on the Apple Arcade platform, which does not allow microtransactions. The cards obtained in this way, just like in Clash Royale, allow you to enhance the various units and thus obtain an even more competitive deck, using three slots to have as many sets available. Clearly there is no risk of pay-to-win implications, given that it is impossible to make purchases and therefore the progression only follows the rules of constant commitment. The three-minute time limit makes the games fast and exciting, perfectly suited to a in mobility: should there be no clear winner at the end of the countdown, the number of towers still standing will be evaluated to eventually decree a draw. It is also worth pointing out the excellent use of haptic feedback, which on the iPhone makes the traditional unpacking between one match and another very pleasant. Graphics and sound Transformers: Tactical Arena, a fight sequence It is a pity that RED Games did not procure the rights to play the theme music from the Transformers animated series, which would have added that extra nostalgic touch to the game's introductory sequence, winning over longtime fans of the series. In any case, the solutions adopted by the developers for Transformers: Tactical Arena are interesting. The design of the characters is in fact predominantly that of Generation 1, albeit with some changes (see for example the appearance of Bumblebee) that try to mix the style classic with the most modern interpretations. Once launched into battle, the various robots have a decent set of animations and move convincingly, while the six unlockable scenarios appear well differentiated.", "date": "2021-11-15", "grade": "7.8"}
