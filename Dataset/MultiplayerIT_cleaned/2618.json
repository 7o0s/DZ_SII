{"name": "Grandia 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grandia-2.html", "text": "A fight continues... Grandia2 is a classic RPG, which tells the story of a battle between good (Granas), the one who gives light, and evil (Malvar), the one who spreads the darkness. Hundreds of years ago they clashed in battle and as evidence of this struggle there is still today a huge crater, which runs the circumference of almost the entire planet. As you could imagine, it was good that won that war, and evil disintegrated into 4 distinct parts, which were delivered to the priests of Granas and kept in the four corners of the world. In this way the world would have been saved and peace would have reigned. Unfortunately, due to an accident, the seals are destroyed, in this way evil could return to the world, questioning the peace reigned up to now, and the fate of everyone. And so you come into play, Ryudo, a GeoHound (planetary traveler and mercenary, in a nutshell) who is not at all scrupulous and with an impulsive character. During your usual adventures alongside your faithful companion Skye, a falcon, you will be tasked with bodyguarding a priestess who is a follower of Granas. Her name is Elena, a frail blondie who wouldn't hurt a fly, Final Fantasy VII-style Aeris. However, the two will go against something much more special than they think, and Elena will be possessed by the ~Wings of Valmar~ or the wings of evil. Thanks to them, in moments of difficulty, the girl will take on the appearance of Millenia, a beautiful girl with red hair and a dazzling gaze, who has immense powers which, when she manages to tame, will be lethal for most (if she is not careful they could even be for you). During the adventure you will meet the young Roan, a boy with a calm and delicate character who will join you after helping him find something dear to him, to move on to Mareg, who will join the party after fighting with you. He is a half-lion, half-human man who can smell the ~evil~ before it's too late. A ~Grandia~ graphic The characters have a splendid characterization, the speech is able to enhance this detail even more, and they will almost seem to live, each with its own character, its ideas, its fears ... which will also be transmitted to you, which only a few games in the world are capable of doing. How can we not mention the death of poor Aeris? You will see your friends laugh, cry, get excited and angry during the adventure and battles, with twists and turns that follow each other at a rapid pace. During the game you will go from a mild remote village to huge cities, from flying ships to underground labyrinths, to reach the great cathedral of Granas where the Pope will finally be able to reach conclusions and explain to us what lies behind all this ... or at least this it is your goal, since once it has been achieved it will only make us face new and distressing questions. GRANDIA2 graphics are among the most detailed ever seen. You will move in a 3D environment that you can comfortably rotate with the change of shot, which is excellent in the exteriors but a little more ~pressed~ in the interiors, in which it will hardly be needed. All the backdrops are so detailed as to make you lose yourself in admiring them, and what will you encounter on them if not primarily numerous enemies? Be careful with the words! The Final Fantasy-style random encounter system has been eliminated and now you will see the enemies directly on the screen, and only after interacting with them will the battle begin. Avoiding fights against monsters is not recommended at all, given that at the end of each one you will receive numerous experience points (For the LEVEL UP of the characters and therefore the acquisition of power and special attacks), for money (How do you buy things without money ? You wouldn't think you'd steal them, would you?) and special and magic coins, useful for making characters acquire special abilities and spells in the LIMIT BREAK and GUARDIAN FORCE style (More like FF9's Eidolons, since we'll waste MP using them, and the same goes for the special attacks that we will carry out by consuming SP ~special points~). Fortunately in the game we find a remarkable balance between battles, exploration, mystery, dialogues, cutscenes and even parts in FMV or cartoons. Just one problem: Oni ~little guy~ living in every city of GRANDIA2 seems to have a Shakespearean novel to tell you! But what will these little men have to say so complex? Well, sometimes they will give you important indications, others they will becomeor unbearable. In conclusion... Ultimately I can say that with the adventure in question you have a lot of fun and for a long time, given that you will need 80 hours of actual play to finish it. If you've finished FINAL FANTASY or you're bored by now, this is a valid alternative. Soon, however, that colossus of SKYES OF ARCADIA will arrive (at the levels of the Square masterpiece if not higher) and according to Ubisoft it will be translated into our beautiful language. Fingers crossed, meanwhile have fun with GRANDIA2. pros: well-characterized characters engaging story fast game system cons: lack of Italian localization poor originality Dreamcast planet calls rpg! The playstation has been up to now the most suitable console for those who live on bread and rpg, and an example can be Final Fantasy. The Dreamcast, on the other hand, is popular for having a catalog of simpler and more immediate games. Until now, RPGs for the console in question hadn't been seen, when at a certain point Game Arts thought of those players who still enjoy ~living~ real adventures, with girls to save, monsters to kill , treasures to find and a whole world to explore, RPG lovers. And here comes this Grandia2, sequel to a long saga that began on Saturn, to then pass on playstation in a beautiful conversion, and now on DC with a completely renewed look.", "date": "2001-03-16", "grade": null}
