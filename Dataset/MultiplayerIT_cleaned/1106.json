{"name": "Prince of Persia: Spirito Guerriero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prince-of-persia-spirito-guerriero.html", "text": "Prince of... Persia?!? In the previous adventure we had left the good prince apparently safe from any further complications with the sands of time, however it was only a vain illusion. Like any person who makes use of the power to control time, a ferocious curse has fallen upon him, unleashing the demon Dahaka on his heels and thus forcing him to an unbearable existence, made up of fear and constant escapes for survival. . The only solution is to go to the place where the sand was created, traveling through time to prevent this cursed artifact from seeing the light, in order to definitively put an end to all the troubles. And guess who will have to accompany the prince on this perilous journey? Ubisoft seems to have taken into consideration the (few) criticisms made by the public and the press of the previous episode, proposing in this sequel a slightly revised game mechanics, especially as regards the combat system. With the intention of making it more varied and engaging, a whole series of novelties and improvements have in fact been introduced, increasing the number of moves and introducing a particular ~combo~ system to chain them together, capable of giving extremely lethal attack sequences and spectacular. The unprecedented possibility of holding two weapons at the same time (with the second however subject to rapid deterioration with use, in order to force the player to use it wisely, although the replacements are abundant in case of breakage), together with the renewed powers manipulation of time, further increase the combinations available, giving the player considerable freedom in managing the fights. To this must be added the introduction of a new and more varied range of enemies to face, now decidedly more enterprising and organized, including the very welcome end-of-level bosses, who, although not shining for originality, turn out to be pleasant diversions , to the advantage of the variety of game. However, all this has a cost, and the greater attention paid by the developers towards the combat system is paid for with a different approach to the experience, now much more ~action oriented~ and less linked to exploration (and this, for the writer , it's not really good news), consequently proposing a setting that has gone from the fairy-tale and arabesque tones of the previous episode (and of the whole series in general) to the darker and bloodier ones of this new chapter. The progression of the adventure is now decidedly more open than in the past, allowing us a certain freedom of movement within the world which is the background to the events, which can now also be explored in two different temporal locations, thus introducing a 'another variable to consider when tackling the puzzles (for example, if you cannot continue in a particular room because an element blocks your passage, it is possible that by traveling in the future this obstacle will no longer exist). However, the player is not left with total freedom to move from one era to another, limiting this possibility only in certain locations on the map, limiting part of the experience to simple backtracking within the game area, which helps to give a few more hours of longevity, but it inevitably ends up boring the player. The prince on a war footing However, purists of the series do not have too many fears: although the exploratory component has been reduced to the detriment of the fighting, it in any case represents an important slice of the playful package offered by this Prince of Persia: Warrior Spirit. We will therefore find ourselves having to find an escape route again from huge rooms full of platforms, grips and infernal machinery, articulated with the same class in level designing that characterized the previous episode. Furthermore, the powers for time control conferred by sand cannot be missing, which allow us to rewind or slow down the flow of time in order to gain a second chance after some risky move, or to facilitate our way through exaggeratedly fast or complicated passage. From a graphic point of view, this new chapter in the saga is once again excellent. The differences between the various versions are limited (see the dedicated box in this regard), and the engine manages to move environments with always very high detail, both in terms of the number of polygons and the quality of the textures, proposing rooms and landscapes able to truly leave you speechless. A particular note should also be made to the animations, as per numerous traditionime and beautifully made. The only comment that we really feel like moving to him is for the stylistic choice of the setting, far too dark and gloomy, in our opinion less fascinating and in keeping with the canons of the series than the one seen in the previous episode. Unfortunately, the same enthusiasm cannot be repeated as regards the sound sector, characterized by an exaggeratedly ~rocking~ musical accompaniment compared to the splendid one heard in The Sands of Time, and by a dubbing which, while boasting the participation of Gabriel Garko as the voice of the prince, disappoints both in terms of interpretation (in particular the horrible voices of the enemies) and in terms of content, offering us often trivial exits from the protagonist and not very suitable for his characterization. Comment Prince of Persia: Warrior Spirit certainly proves to be a sequel worthy of the name it bears, however tainted by some lightness that prevent it from overcoming its predecessor and inevitably relegate it to a step lower. Ubisoft, in the valuable attempt to improve the combat system, ended up giving it too much space to the detriment of the exploratory component, historically the fulcrum of the game, also distorting the setting which, always fairytale and dreamlike, finds itself much darker and bloodier . Mind you, this sequel remains a very valid title and worthy of being included in the soft library of every self-respecting gamer, however it has lost some of that magic that had made The Sands of Time, and in general the whole series, so special. Pros: Excellent graphics Improved combat system Excellent level design Cons: Mediocre sound Less glamorous setting The fights have stolen room for exploration The multiplatform corner The various versions of PoP: Warrior Within do not differ substantially in technical terms: on PS2 the game appears even more gloomy and suffers from a slightly shaky frame rate, which translates into some snaps in the most agitated situations, while on Xbox and GC is practically identical. However, the Xbox version stands out for the presence of 2 additional game modes: Race Against Time and Arena. In the first we will have to cross paths built ad hoc within a pre-established time limit, while in the second we will have to defeat three waves of enemies of increasing difficulty within an arena within the time limit. For these modalities, the possibility of publishing one's records online is foreseen, together with the presence of future downloadable contents. The previous chapter was one of the best titles of last year, and the saga is one of the most famous and long-lived in the entire gaming universe. Ubisoft certainly could not neglect a franchise of such importance, and therefore here we are with the new episode of the Prince of Persia saga in hand, this time subtitled Warrior Spirit. And you, are you ready to spend Christmas again in the company of the prince?", "date": "2004-12-02", "grade": null}
