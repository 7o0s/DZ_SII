{"name": "Assemble with Care", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/assemble-with-care-recensione.html", "text": "Freshly included in our list of the ten best games available on Apple Arcade, the time has come for Assemble with Care to go under the lens of the review, in which we will try to explain the particular nature of the Ustwo work. Not categorized as a puzzle game properly speaking but not even characterized by a narrative component strong enough to take the limelight, Assemble with Care is the typical case in which the final result is greater than the sum of the parts: read on to find out why . Mary fixes everything The user takes on the role of Maria, an object repairer who travels the world making her skills available to all those who need to put something back on track. We meet her as she arrives in the coastal town of Bellariva, where she soon begins to get jobs from various clients: between one errand and another, however, Maria will find herself busy putting together not only the personal belongings of the inhabitants, but also their relationships strained by small or big problems. It is certainly not a plot that will make you lose sleep, but that of Assemble with Care is an absolutely functional narrative to the gameplay, which it overlaps almost perfectly. The 12 stages that make up the title correspond to as many objects to be repaired which in turn have a profound meaning for the people who own them, who will gradually reveal their difficulties in Maria's eyes. To open and close each level there are static sequences that carry the story forward, characterized by a clean and refined design and by an audiobook-like English dubbing, while the musical accompaniment proves to be absolutely functional in giving the whole a relaxed and pleasant. Two adjectives that can also be applied to the playful component of Assemble with Care, which does not aim to commit the player too much but prefers to give him a light experience, which lasts less than two hours but which proves to be decidedly satisfying. In the 12 levels that make up the title, you will find yourself having to repair watches, statuettes, cameras, portable consoles and so on, but without things ever getting too complicated. Maria always has the right tools and spare parts for the occasion, so the fulcrum of the gamplay is all about identifying the screws to loosen, disassembling all the necessary parts, replacing the broken elements and putting everything back together for the happiness of the customer. shift. In terms of controls and interface, the game works perfectly: a touch on the desired object is enough to bring it to the foreground and be able to rotate it at will, with circular movements you turn the screwdriver while a prolonged tap allows you to act on the components that can be removed or moved. The challenge rate is indulgent to say the least, considering how repairs are never particularly complicated from the start and how prodigal the software is in making the right pieces fit perfectly as soon as you put them into contact. However, we must give credit to the developers of Ustwo for having been good at proposing rather differentiated situations, peppering each stage with small touches of class that can be noticed as Maria's work continues. There is no game over, there is no possibility of failing a level, nor are there time limits to respect or scores to obtain: in Assemble with Care the pleasure simply derives from the act of putting objects back, a procedure that is unlikely to meet the favors of those users looking for action and demanding challenges but which at the same time will certainly not fail to intrigue those who aspire to try something different from the usual mobile game.", "date": "2019-10-25", "grade": "8.0"}
