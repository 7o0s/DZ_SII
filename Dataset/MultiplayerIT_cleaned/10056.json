And instead, while Xbox360 and PS3 users anxiously await the porting of the first chapter, here comes a spring-loaded No More Heroes 2 and far from intending to live off the success of the prequel. Super classification show Like its predecessor, No More Heroes 2 is not too formalized when it comes to the plot: Travis Touchdown therefore returns to the stage to avenge the death of his best friend, a consequence of the escalation of violence that has followed his ascent to the number one in the Santa Destroy assassin rankings. Old acquaintances from the past return to the scene (first and foremost the sexy Sylvia), but the narrative component still remains a mere glue between one bloodbath and another, which will surely make the fans of the prequel happy: the dialogues are full of sharp catchphrases but often and willingly do not have a real and proper sense, while the cutscenes make exaggeration their main purpose of life, the first visible signs of how Goichi Suda's work is an explosive mix aimed at the extreme in all its forms. Fortunately, however, the Grasshopper team didn't limit itself to heating the soup of a first chapter that literally inflamed the more hardcore fringe of Wii users, but was able to fill a good part of the gaps that had been identified in it, bringing No More Heroes 2 to be an overall better product. The basic play structure has obviously remained the same, and therefore finds the user committed to playing the role of a Travis once again forced to climb the ranking of the most dangerous killers in the city, starting from the lowest step: this translates into a series of stages full of enemies to be sliced with the lightsaber or to be knocked out with wrestling moves, which end with the inevitable boss fights, the number of which has been increased to 15. First of all, the support for the Classic Controller should be noted, a solution decidedly preferable for those who are willing to sacrifice the (few) commands delegated to the motion sensor in favor of greater precision and convenience. Again, the lock-on system has been streamlined, and the user can benefit from a few more cards to play in the heat of battle: not only can you change weapons on-the-fly, but the prequel's power-up system (based on a slot machine that was activated with every kill and which rewarded Travis with a temporary special ability in case of a winning tris), is been integrated with a sort of temporary god mode that can be activated following a continuous series of hits. However, there is a sore point: the virtual camera has obviously not been included in Grasshopper's to-do list with this No More Heroes 2, reconfirming itself as unreliable especially in the presence of a large number of enemies. A welcome return is instead represented by the chests scattered within the scenarios, which may contain money, health bonuses or the lightsaber battery, or magazines and gadgets to then be examined in the comfort of your own apartment. Here, in addition to selecting the clothes and amusing himself with some minigames, the player can try his hand at the insane activities related to the slimming of Travis's cat, who has grown enormously fat in the time between the two chapters: an aspect as marginal as it is pleasant, which easily manages to get some smiles. Robot ninja wizard As mentioned in the opening, No More Heroes 2 is superior to the prequel in substantially all aspects, and the developers have achieved this goal not only by adding new meat to the fire, but also by taking the trouble to eradicate certain elements that had not worked properly in the first chapter. So let's say goodbye to the useless and boring free-roaming component aboard Travis' motorcycle, replaced by a simple menu that allows you to move to all the points of interest of Santa Destroy, whether these locations are linked to missions, shops or jobs useful for scrape together a few extra bucks. Precisely the latter have undergone a very heavy restyling: where in the previous episode they resolved themselves into not particularly exciting activities such as cutting the grass or collecting coconuts, here they are represented in the form of real ~games within the game~, distinguished by and play mechanics ispirate to the glorious 8-bit era. A winning choice, which makes these sections genuinely pleasant and does not reduce them to an age-old task that is essential for buying new objects and clothes. Another aspect of the first No More Heroes that had aroused some perplexity was related precisely to the boss fights, one of the focal points of the playful experience: on balance, these fights in the prequel followed rather conventional patterns, without ever really pushing the player to adopt particular strategies to get the better of the opponents. This time the discussion has definitely changed, first of all because the bad guys appear tougher and have more diversified sets of moves; moreover, there is no shortage of acrobatic design solutions that sometimes transform battles into something more than simple sword duels. Without wanting to spoil the surprise too much, let's just mention one of the first scenarios we come across in the adventure, in which Tavis and the boss on duty board two gigantic robots to beat each other in beat'em up style at meetings (with lots of of energy bars and super moves) against the backdrop of a panicked city. In short, No More Heroes 2 lacks a creative eye, even if there is no doubt that, in principle, this sequel lacks some of the touches of class that had made the first chapter famous: the result is inevitably a product less disruptive, but at the same time more concrete, given the greater attention paid by the development team to the more tangible gameplay elements. Nonetheless, the Grasshopper work fails to shake off some negativity apparently intrinsic in the very nature of Goichi Suda's creation: the adventure is therefore rather short (it ends easily in ten hours), punctuated by stages that -except Outstanding Events - Don't break away from a repetitive mechanic that requires you to kill all enemies in an area, move on to the next one, and repeat until the boss fight. On the other hand, the restyling made to the visual sector is excellent: the HUD is cleaner and more stylized, while the entire graphics engine of the game has undergone visible tweaks capable of placing No More Heroes 2 among the top of the category as regards the platform Nintendo.", "date": "2010-04-23", "grade": "8.6"}
