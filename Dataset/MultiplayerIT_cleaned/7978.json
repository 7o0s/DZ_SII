For example, one can start from a mysterious plot, just mentioned; witness a series of events through the eyes of the protagonist, without knowing who he is. It is possible to skilfully mix graphic style and sound accompaniment to create a sense of tension, and perhaps draw from an exotic imaginary myths, legends and old stories, the ones that kids tell by illuminating their faces from below with a flashlight. Stories of sacrifices, of abandoned children, of forests that come to life under cover of darkness and swallow anyone who ventures there, of benevolent and other evil spirits, born from the desperation and madness of men. In the case of Year Walk, the developers of Simogo started from Swedish folklore, from the concept of ~year walk~, a sort of mystical journey that the inhabitants of the cold Nordic villages sometimes subjected themselves to, estranging themselves from their friends and imposing some rules for a set amount of time, such as staying away from a fire while wandering aimlessly through a wood. The goal of the experience was to obtain visions, perhaps about the future or about a particular person; but, as we will discover in the game, sometimes these visions could be anything but reassuring. Glide on the snow The gameplay of Year Walk is very simple, but it has been implemented in an original and fascinating way, with a great attention to detail and art direction, omnipresent throughout the adventure. We see the action from the point of view of the protagonist, who ventures into the trees of a snowy forest to find answers but is faced with something unexpected. In practical terms, exploration takes place through a sort of ~layered~ navigation, as if from above the path were similar to that of a labyrinth. Experienced in first person, however, it translates into lateral scrolling of the scenario, with a ~parallax~ effect to give the background a sense of depth, and forward or backward movements depending on the presence of paths that allow us to move in these directions, indicated by small vanishing arrows. It is enough to come across the first puzzles to understand that, however, the interaction does not have precise rules, and that therefore it is necessary to work with the imagination, trying to get into the head of whoever conceived the various puzzles in order to be able to solve them successfully and therefore access otherwise unreachable areas. In the early stages, for example, you enter a wooden house with a ~hanged~ doll inside, whose head is screwed onto the body for a strange ~ballet~ to start. Well, the movements of the doll's arms must be memorized because they are the key to solving a subsequent puzzle. In the second half of the adventure we are asked to find the spirits of four children and lead them to the river bank, but how can we imagine that to locate the first one we would have had to mimic steps on the screen to move the view beyond the limit usually allowed? The mechanisms from which Year Walk draws with both hands are therefore simple but obscure, thus obtaining a double effect: the most savvy adventure enthusiasts will complete the game in a very short time, while the less experienced could give up the experience on the umpteenth attempt failed.", "date": "2013-03-06", "grade": "8.3"}
