{"name": "Shadow Zone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shadow-zone.html", "text": "In 1986, the fourth reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded. As a precautionary measure after the disaster, an area called Refuge was created, 30 kilometers wide and suitable for isolating the origin of the radiation from the rest of the world. Since then no one has entered the Refuge. In 2008 it was learned that animals in the area had undergone strange mutations. In 2010, adventurers from all over the world challenged each other to explore the isolated area, with the aim of recovering living species and objects to be sold. In 2012 the Refuge began to repopulate in a stable way, many explorers made it their base, got married and built their homes. In 2014 things began to change, the level of radioactivity in the Sanctuary mysteriously rose. Our task is to find out what happened near the fourth reactor. We will have to face not only the mutated creatures born in the isolated area but also a sect that wanted the apocalypse and the destruction of humanity. This is the summary of the plot of this interesting RTS published by Ojom GbmH. The game follows the tradition of two-dimensional strategy, with movements and fights that take place in turn. We will thus find ourselves moving Robot Warriors and brave human fighters in the wastelands devastated by radiation. We will be able to occupy the buildings that we will encounter both to defend ourselves and to form bases, in which to build new robots that will help us in the exploration. First we will move our ~pawns~ deciding which area to explore and once ~the turn is over~ we will wait for the reaction of the enemy troops. Warriors will level up by completing more fights and their skills will improve accordingly. Basically in Shadow Zone we will be able to carefully plan every move before acting, a sort of virtual chess game in which we will not have pawns and bishops but robots and guerrillas. The plot that we have only mentioned is actually quite complex and fully involves the player. From a technical point of view we have nothing to complain about the Ojom title, the sprites are well defined and full of details, the game engine is stable and manages to give away some small pearls such as the effects dedicated to explosions. Shadow Zone is completely adapted in Italian and in this way the experience is certainly more engaging. The only real flaw that we have found in the title published by Ojom GbmH, except perhaps for the poorly set difficulty in certain situations, is its poor suitability for quick and concise games as usually required by users of the mobile world. We recommend it. PRO Good graphics Localized in Italian AGAINST Not for a ~fly game~ Difficulty sometimes badly calibrated", "date": "2007-10-01", "grade": "S.V."}
