{"name": "La Cosa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-cosa_a.html", "text": "Innovative gameplay! Assuming that someone may not have seen the film (run to rent it as soon as possible!), I remember that the story is set in Antarctica where a group of scientists, following the discovery of a real unidentified object, made the terrible knowledge of a disgusting alien race, called ~The Thing~. The game begins right where the film ends and, in the role of Captain Blake, we will be engaged in the recovery of any survivors and the elimination of possible threats. Despite the fact that throughout the adventure we will have control of a single character, the fundamental aspect of the game, as well as a great intuition and merit of the Black Label Games developers, is the interaction with the other members of our team, who can react according to our actions or the situations that arise, in a different and often even unpredictable way and in many cases they will be indispensable to allow us to continue in the adventure. This means that the gameplay is not limited to simple exploration, puzzle solving and the elimination of ~Things~, but the constant attention in maintaining relationships with our fellow adventurers, who enjoy own emotions. Let's control the emotions! There are 3 different types of companions for our character, each equipped with a particular ability: engineers, skilled in carrying out complicated repairs that Blake is unable to carry out on his own; the soldiers, useful in combat and in the use of weapons; and finally the doctors, the only ones who can treat us and the other team members. It goes without saying that it will be essential to make the most of the 3 different types of companions, otherwise it will be really difficult to progress in the game. Earlier we talked about emotions and interaction: another fundamental aspect of ~La Cosa~ is in fact the relationship with our companions, which can get worse or better based on our behavior and therefore the degree of trust we are able to convey. In fact, a companion may be afraid after seeing a terrifying scene or may not trust us even suspecting a possible alien infection. These emotions can even lead to anger on the part of one of the members who at that point could even threaten and kill you or your partner. To prevent this from happening we will have different methods available. First of all it must be said that we can monitor the emotional and physical state of our companions at any time through a menu that can be activated by pressing a button. At this point we will decide how to ~calm them down~: we can provide them with one of the weapons at our disposal, cure them if they are injured, inject them with an adrenaline rush or even carry out an antivirus test on us to prove they are not infected . Obviously all these actions will have a positive reaction which will serve to create a serene atmosphere among all team members. All this should make you understand how thick the gameplay of La Cosa is made, which thanks to this decidedly innovative system completely differs from all the titles of the same genre that have appeared to date. Atmosphere The settings are reproduced with great effectiveness and perfectly convey the feeling of cold and destruction experienced in Carpenter's film. Outside the run-down buildings, it's about 40 degrees below zero which doesn't allow our character and our team to spend too much time outdoors. A bar placed on the lower part of the screen will constantly indicate our state of frostbite; once the bar is exhausted, the frost will begin to seriously affect the state of health, so it will be good to worry about finding a warm shelter for us and our friends. During the adventure we will find numerous weapons and tools of various kinds such as torches, smoke bombs, medikits, fire extinguishers and more, useful for completing the objectives, yes, because I almost forgot to say that the game is developed in a series of objectives to be achieved term, the completion of which will be made increasingly difficult by the enemies, or by the ~Things~. They vary in size: the small ones can be eliminated with the simple use of firearms, while for the larger ones it will not be enough: in fact, once their level of life has been reduced, it will be necessary to use incendiary weapons to give them the definitive blow of grace. Technically speaking... If of the gameplay we are fully satisfied, from a technical point of view La Cosa instead shows ups and downs. In fact, despite the considerable care taken in the creation of the characters, all the rest of the settings leave something to be desired when compared with some recent titles. The game does not use any particular graphic effects and the realization of the aliens could have been more accurate. Nonetheless, the final result is not bad at all and the atmosphere of the film is perfectly reproduced. Worth noting is the very welcome presence of the 50/60 Hz selector in the options menu, accessible at any time, which unfortunately must be adjusted every time you play and not even the saves during the game will serve to maintain the setting. It has often happened to me to resume a game and play for some time completely forgetting to select the 60 Hz mode. The sound department of the game, on the other hand, is fantastic, which despite a decidedly poor soundtrack, can instead count on a very high level dubbing and above all completely in Italian! Lots of bad words that you will hear, many also violent and disgusting scenes. In fact, some of your companions, in the presence of mutilated corpses or decidedly gruesome scenes, will vomit without too much hesitation, others in the throes of panic attacks will point the gun at their temples and then commit suicide and so on. In short, there is no shortage of raw and very strong scenes and fear will keep you company in many situations, just like in the most classic survival horror. Longevity is unfortunately not a strong point of La Cosa, and even once the adventure is over there are no real reasons that will push you to replay it a second time with the same initial transport. The latest ~Things~ In conclusion, despite some defects, we are still faced with a pleasant surprise. The Thing is a game that can easily satisfy both lovers of third-person adventures and those who adore classic horror games. The innovative gameplay is certainly the most important aspect and the effort of the developers who have succeeded where many other colleagues have failed miserably, that is to bring a good video game based on a fantastic film to the console, should therefore be underlined! Pros: An excellent example of how to make a video game based on a film Innovative gameplay Great atmosphere and always high tension Completely in Italian and very well done dubbing Complete control system Cons:  but a bit too cumbersome initially Graphically not surprising Longevity not very high From cinema to console after 20 years! As fans of both genres well know, cinema and video games don't always get along and we often found ourselves having to bluntly nip a video game inspired by a famous film or vice versa. Most of the time this happens because the development turns out to be a simple commercial move, intent on exploiting the ~name~ of the product. Now, however, calm down, because all this was used to say that ~The Thing~ is absolutely not part of this trend and indeed, represents one of the few video games inspired by a successful film worthy of praise. The idea that this game could promise well had immediately jumped into my mind, since the day of its announcement, for the simple reason that it is based on a film that is not exactly current. The Thing, better known in Italy as ~La Cosa~, by John Carpenter, and which I personally consider one of the best cinematographic works ever to appear on the big screen, dates back to 1982, the year in which a good part of today's gamers, or at least the youngest, most likely she wasn't even born and therefore would hardly have been attracted by the name of a game inspired by a film from 20 years ago.", "date": "2002-10-07", "grade": null}
