{"name": "GTFO", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gtfo-recensione.html", "text": "Cooperative games are all the rage, especially the children of Left 4 Dead, and it's increasingly difficult to choose the best one since, apart from the different setting, the formula always remains more or less the same. The most popular, thanks also to the simultaneous arrival on consoles and Xbox Game Pass, is undoubtedly the one most linked to Left 4 Dead, also in the name, or Back 4 Blood, but for some time PC users have been losing their minds behind to another game, still little known but in the process of consecration. GTFO's review will explain why. Superior cooperatives GTFO: Shooting is satisfying, but most of the time you'll have to resist the temptation... Once again we are dealing with a game designed for four players, exclusively PVE so you won't find competitive modes against other people, despite this GTFO hides a small big difference compared to other similar products: to win you need a level of cooperation, an ability to keep a cool head and a superior tactical vision. This isn't the game you load up if you don't want to go all out on it, those nights when you don't even feel like putting on headphones or even yelling orders with a burning mouse and keyboard. Meanwhile, four players are needed, then three more friends, and everyone must have the same approach otherwise disaster is assured; then the hardest work passes to the nerves, they must be firm because GTFO not only requires the utmost attention, to make things more difficult it loves to disturb you terribly scaring you. Prisoners! GTFO: With each update the developers change the levels in the game and the previous ones are permanently removed. At least until they make a super mega collection to make money The incipit is simple and enigmatic, like the whole plot, which however always remains relatively on the sidelines. The group of four players is made up of prisoners who are sent on missions, mainly patrolling, inside a decrepit and sprawling underground structure full of ferocious creatures that could recall some of Clive Barker's nightmares. These monsters are vigilant but in a sort of stasis waiting for their next victim, and since resources are not found everywhere and it takes a moment to be overwhelmed by a horde, it will often be necessary to move with extreme caution, without be seen or make noise. You probably won't succeed the first time, nor the second or third time, but it's part of the game to repeat the already present levels several times, moreover GTFO will change the position of the enemies with each attempt, enhancing the players' ability to adapt and survive, which they must also think about improving their equipment along the way and stock up on ammunition as much as possible. During a game, it is also possible to come across special disposable abilities that can be used during the next attempt, and more rare cosmetic elements to customize our prisoner. Shoot... silently GTFO: Version 1.0 has undergone some good graphical tweaks and now the game is flashier and more appealing than ever There are many firearms in the game and, trigger on the finger, they all perform quite well even if GTFO is certainly not the best shooter out there. Most of the time you will spend walking in perfect coordination and in perfect silence, mainly using one of the numerous melee weapons you can get your hands on as needed. Some creatures, if alerted, can wipe out a well-matched group in a few seconds, even if they consume their entire supply of ammunition, an event that can be enough to irreversibly jeopardize a mission. GTFO however is not only extreme stealth, there are numerous situations along the ten missions present where we will inevitably have to set fire to the powder. Even in these cases, however, a large dose of strategy and tactics is essential: you need to know how to position yourself, concentrate the shots on the enemies, respond to any unexpected surprises, use elements of the scenario to our advantage. Bots and Checkpoints GTFO: if you have noticed similarities it is no coincidence, since several GTFO developers come from the Payday team Really, we're not just telling you this just to say, or because the hard game has been getting attention lately: GTFO is really badass. In this latest version they have added bots that can help stretch our legs in the first few games, but their company will not be enough to complete even the simplest mission. You need real people and you need to communicate, if you're lucky you'll find valid players throughthe renewed matchmaking, but the advice is to organize yourself in time. Another great novelty that has made the game slightly more forgiving than in the past is the halfway checkpoint inserted in the missions, which has horrified the most square fans, and enjoyed those who could not figure it out. We usually don't like these concessions, but GTFO also needed them for the simple fact that the ten levels that are in the game today, won't be the ten levels that those who buy it will find after the next big update. Each major update of GTFO replaces the existing levels that from that moment on can no longer be visited with new missions, new settings and new opportunities. A hardcore choice that doesn't really make sense but which, perhaps for this very reason, we love so much.", "date": "2021-12-25", "grade": "7.7"}
