We do this whenever possible, using tools that allow you to watch shows in a (slight) time delay; and as soon as the WWE Network also lands in Italy, we will certainly be among the first subscribers, given that the current television offer (to which we are subscribed, mind you) only partially satisfies our needs. We were saying, let's watch wrestling in fast forward and we do it for a purely practical matter, since we don't materially have the time to watch five hours of broadcasts a week (between Raw and Smackdown, with a few visits to Total Divas because they interest me the ~behind the scenes~ and everything that revolves around the ~shoot~ analysis of the industry). The alternative would be to completely skip certain meetings, angles and promos that are of no interest to you, but this would somehow mean distancing yourself from the product, becoming an occasional spectator whereas I'm always ready to re-evaluate storylines or gimmicks that I may not have initially I would have bet a cent. Well, how does the ~simulation~ twist made by the WWE 2K15 developers fit with my preferences? In a word: bad. Suplex city, bitch Preamble: Yuke's has been transforming the best-known sport entertainment in the world into a video game for many years, and with the arrival of 2K Games, the team has been joined by the experts of Visual Concepts to get that extra idea, especially under the technical profile, which should have accompanied the debut of the series on next-gen platforms. The landing on PC, as often happens lately, was only a natural consequence: the architecture is the same as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, conversions require little work and there is a large portion of users out there , who has been waiting for this moment for years. For wrestling fans who play on Windows, and who have never owned a console in their life, we are talking about the realization of a dream and there are no opinions or numerical judgments that hold: they have to rush to buy WWE 2K15 and spend dozens and dozens of hours between random encounters, storylines, more articulated modes and, above all, the editor. As always happens, the game arrives late compared to the current situation of titles, stables and face/heel alternation, but the game allows you to remedy in a few minutes and even change the appearance of the superstars so that they reflect the their new style (see Sheamus' twist). Of course, there are elements that somehow remain ~stuck~, in the sense that some group choreographies were designed for when certain tag teams or alliances were still active, and if this ~lag~ was already felt when the console was released, on PC the thing is inevitably more marked. To alleviate the suffering of purists, the publisher has seen fit to include all the DLC released so far in the package available on Steam, with very few exceptions. This means that we will be able to immediately control (or unlock in-game) the likes of Sting and Hulk Hogan, as well as download packs with other superstars and the NXT roster for free soon. WWE 2K15 debuts on PC with an average edition, rich in content but in some respects controversial Calm chaos We said: wrestling fans who play on PC and have never tried an episode of the WWE series, can proceed with the purchase of WWE 2K15 without thinking twice. But the others? What will users who cyclically invest their money in the franchise face, expecting the revolution every time, especially now? One of the historical problems of Yuke's management concerns the gameplay, a far from negligible aspect of the experience, and over the last few years we have tried to explore the possible alternatives to the traditional setting, involving more the analog sticks, fielding a selection of quick time events to branch out certain situations and resorting to the usual trigger (systematically not very reactive, given the stroke of the key) for countermoves. In this new edition, unfortunately, the intention to speed up the action leaves room for frankly cloying simulation ambitions, with characters who remain on the ground more than necessary but without introducing the necessary distinction between the consequences of a blow (least the question of the feasibility of certain moves, such as a gorilla press slam on Big Show). Lying on the ground for two minutes after taking a triple power bomb on the announce table is perfectly natural, in fact, but passing out from a semiplice body slam or even a punch combo does not correspond in the least to the choreographic reality of wrestling. You know the fast forward we were talking about? Here, in WWE 2K15 this feature is missing (obviously!) and it is therefore necessary to compromise with what is proposed, both in terms of standard maneuvers and ~old school~ fights, with Chinese pen-style systems determining the success of some attacks and a pin management that too often gives rise to sudden and surprising victories, but in a negative sense. The ~wood~ of the series has unfortunately remained there, to mark the distance even more clearly with respect to classics such as WWF Superstars or WWF Wrestlefest, less varied but at the same time more immediate and satisfying. If Yuke's and 2K Games' dilemma was therefore between creating a sports entertainment simulation or a mark-style wrestling game, there is no doubt as to what the writer's preference was. But the numbers are there The moral of the story is that WWE 2K15 undoubtedly stands as an episode of the series that is solid and particularly rich in content; not only for the aforementioned presence of DLCs, but also and above all for the pillars of the product, in this case two distinct storylines for the 2K Showcase mode (with the historical feuds of CM Punk Vs. John Cena and Shawn Michaels Vs. Triple H ), career (in which you have to create a wrestler from scratch and advance him to glory, starting from the Orlando Performance Center) and the WWE Universe, in which you practically play as Vince McMahon and manage the shows from all points of view, be it matches, feuds, turns and events. For more details on the structure of the game you can take a look at the review of the console version, of course. Here, however, all that remains is to analyze the technical aspect, which as previously mentioned represents the real ~turning point~ of the product, considering the inability of the developers to positively renew the gameplay. The superstars underwent a more advanced physical and facial scan, and the difference compared to last year's episode is evident: there are moments where it really seems to be in front of a WWE TV show. Unfortunately, however, a situation a la Gran Turismo 5 has arisen, with premium wrestlers and standard wrestlers, and the divas in particular seem to belong to a previous generation in terms of polygonal modeling and animations. It goes without saying that a meeting between two characters, one ~modern~ and the other ~old-fashioned~, gives back bad, bad feelings. On PC there are extra adjustments for antialiasing, audience composition and overall quality, but the rendering is very similar to that seen on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, including the frame rate which remains pegged at sixty fps (albeit, it seems, with some uncertainty too much on the mid-range configurations). Asking more of a product making its debut on the Windows platform would perhaps have been excessive, but it is clear that there is still ample room for improvement, not only as regards the polygonal models (which will all have to be brought to the same level of detail) but also and above all the lighting system and the effects, which in many situations appear obsolete and give an idea of emptiness and ~fake~. Making convincing fireworks for Batista and Ryback's entrances didn't require who knows what effort, for one thing, and instead we are still there to remember the graphics of Here Comes the Pain. Finally, the sound sector seemed clearly insufficient to us: the commentary edited by Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole is too repetitive and essential, while the use of an anonymous announcer has a very negative effect on the suspension of disbelief. With Lilian Garcia and Tony Chimel still in the WWE force we wonder why such a questionable choice was made.", "date": "2015-05-05", "grade": "7.0"}
