{"name": "The Matrix: Path of Neo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-matrix-path-of-neo-2.html", "text": "Walking with Neo Without going around too much, Path of Neo is a stark action-game. Remember God of War? Perfect, that's the idea and, moreover, it is clear how Shiny was abundantly inspired by the Sony masterpiece to program the ingenious combat system of this new immersion in the Matrix. Basically, the system is context-sensitive and this means that despite the few keys available to act, Neo will perform dozens and dozens of different attacks depending on various factors: your position, the position of your enemies, any weapons you are wielding or from your opponents, the previous animations, the activation or not of the Focus (or Concentration) system... All these variables will affect the combat, making every frantic pressing of the same single key effectively spectacular. It is in fact a single button dedicated to the attack, another button will be used to direct your shots towards opponents who are not the main target (to attack them simultaneously), another button will be assigned to jump, one to dodge and one to I shoot. Firearms play an absolutely secondary role in Path of Neo, despite their presence being really massive, especially in the final stages of the game: much better to dodge the bullets while returning the lead in slow-motion and getting close to your targets to fill them with papagni. The Concentration function is optional, but it is in practice the power-up that allows you to carry out the most devastating attacks or the most spectacular actions (such as the anti-gravity jump or telekinesis): by consuming a special bar, it is possible to ~slow down time ~ so as to be able, for example, to dodge the bullets or even stop them in mid-air to send them back to the sender, or to enhance the damage of our attacks (which will turn into real super-shots) or even to perform stunts as well inaccessible, such as wall running or the most spectacular dodges. In short, if you've seen Neo do something ~cool~ in the film trilogy, you can repeat it here: Shiny has introduced in Path of Neo even the slightest element that could contain that ~Matrix Style~ that was so fashionable a few years ago. Everything is therefore transformed into close action and unbridled fighting and made even more spectacular by the almost total predisposition of the surrounding environment to be reduced to crumbs by our actions. ... Shiny has introduced in Path of Neo even the smallest element that could contain that ~Matrix Style~ that was so fashionable a few years ago... Walking with Neo As varied and fun as it is, the combat system is however made repetitive in the long run by the almost total and forced linearity of the playful experience. Path of Neo recreates the key events of the cinematic saga, starting with the discovery of Mr. Thomas Anderson that he is actually the One to the final battle with his diabolical digital alter-ego, Agent Smith. However, each event follows Neo's point of view, consequently each stage is based on Neo's direct experiences during the original story, sometimes even expanded too much, for gameplay purposes. For example, the training that in the first film took place through the ~download~ of simple data into the brains of the protagonists and which allowed Neo to learn Kung-fu in a few seconds, here occupies the very tedious initial levels of training, in which we we will find ourselves controlling Neo grappling with ninjas and samurai in environments that are so reminiscent of Bushido Blade. Or again, totally invented events make their appearance for the occasion, such as the rescue of Captain Roland in a factory or the exploration of a bizarre and labyrinthine world in an attempt to snatch the Keymaker from the Merovingian. Sometimes these stages simply involve the beating of a zillion opponents, in other cases they are real mini-games (like the first person shooter with the helicopter machine gun), in certain moments you still have to solve very simple puzzles to continue in the adventure: the variety of the game enjoys it, but at the same time the stages are either too short or too long and often repetitive in themselves. Groping in the Matrix As already mentioned, Path of Neo proposes the plot of the film trilogy from beginning to end, expanding it with unpublished events written by the Wacho-bros. in order to make it clearer, more precise and more detailed. The result is a total flop. The first problem is represented by the absurd editing of the various original scenes of the film, which acting as an interlude between one stage and another should give a logical sense to the adventure. The fact is that the various ifQuences are not only mounted like trailers or video clips, but they are glued completely haphazardly! As if the original plot weren't already bizarre enough, for those who have seen the films it will already be hard to reconnect the events placed in this order, while for those unfamiliar with the history of the Matrix it will be practically impossible to understand anything. And if this narrative havoc weren't enough, the last stage is nothing short of worrying: the Wachowski brothers explain to us (in the form of colored pixels...) that the ending of the trilogy was too pathetic for a video game, so they well thought of inventing a special ending, which translates into an incredibly crude final showdown and a trashy conclusion to say the least, where the film's ending takes on a completely different meaning when accompanied by Queens' ~We're the Champions~... Not to mention that nothing is clarified at all, and fans of the original dramatic ending will still be waiting to discover all the mysteries of The Matrix. The spoon does not exist To make Path of Neo, Shiny seems to have wanted to squeeze every potential of the PlayStation 2 to the core, with unfortunately fluctuating results. The first thing that catches the eye is the impressive quality of the environments: while not reaching the heights of excellence of God of War, the locations in Path of Neo deserve praise for the enormous amount of detail and for the painstaking care given to the lighting , in order to reconstruct the places already seen in the film in the best possible way, or to create new equally spectacular ones: clear examples are the bell tower (where the light that filters through the barred windows creates impressive plays of light on Neo and the Agents in combat) and the cinema where Neo and Seraph continue their fight, in front of a screen where sequences of the same cinematic battle are projected at the same time. The care reserved for the polygonal models of the various characters is much more unbalanced: if the main ones (Neo, Morpheus or Smith for example) are extremely accurate especially in the reproduction of the face, the same cannot be said for the almost sketchy opponents, who present a number of decidedly lower polygons. In general, there is one thing that intersects with locations and models: the abuse of special effects of various kinds, motion blur in the first place, but also luminous particle refractions and distortions in all ways, which should make the action extremely spectacular. The target is hit in full force: each stage is a concentrate of spectacular action sequences that seem to come out of a film, but is simultaneously a perpetual slow motion without using the Concentration button anyway. In other words, the frame-rate tends to drop dramatically with a depressing frequency that doesn't do justice to the work done by the graphics. On the sound front, the choice of music is mostly spot on, especially in the moments in which the musical tracks that accompanied the films are reused; sometimes instead this choice is inexplicably not adopted, so during the penultimate fight with Smith, which in The Matrix Revolution was accompanied by the enthralling and beautiful ~Neodammerung~, in Path of Neo an oriental-like music flows instead which is not associated in the least to the 'action. The dubbing also fluctuates: the voices of the main characters belong to the same voice actors who oversaw the film trilogy, while those of secondary or less important characters are often poorly selected and not very appropriate, and the bad acting in some cases does not help. It must not have been easy for Shiny to deal with God of War, which less than a year after its release is already considered a sacred monster in the PlayStation 2 toy library: this would certainly explain the predilection for the spectacular and for the excess, in that which could have been a very good title, were it not for the minor inconvenience that the PlayStation 2 is not the PlayStation 3. The amount of visual data programmed by Shiny to make Path of Neo a fireworks display hopelessly clashes with the limits of the hardware, affecting the performance of the gameplay itself, which however does not shine for its originality but certainly offers a good variety and an enjoyable frenzy. Fans of the saga and fans of Neo will undoubtedly still love this entertainment and the greedy opportunity to impersonate the Chosen One in all respects (come on, who has never been fascinated by Neo's omnipotence?), to those who have finished God of War several times and looking for a new action-game to have fun it must be said that Path of Neo deserves at least one try, and coming to terms with the slowdowns one can also be satisfied with it. Pro You can finally impersonateare the charismatic Neo Fun and varied combat system Spectacular graphics... Cons ... at the price of a sometimes outrageous frame-rate Fluctuating audio Unstable camera The other versions The PS2 and X-Box versions share the same flaw: frame-rate drops, excessive and frequent. The PS2 version supports widescreen, strangely unlike its Microsoft counterpart, where frame-rate drops seem to occur more often. Separate discussion for the PC version, programmed with greater superficiality: not only more than 5 GB of free space on the Hard-Disk are needed to install the game, but this does not seem to enjoy any benefit on the more powerful machines, so much to show the same slowdowns observed in the home versions. Some recent patches have fixed some bugs and improved its performance, but the PC version is still a cut below the console ones. The bizarre commercial operation of the Wachowski brothers continues, parents of the science fiction trilogy which in a certain sense has influenced the productions of the genre in recent years, or The Matrix. Composed of the films The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, the series had the merit of giving life to what have become true generational icons, of introducing special effects (such as bullet-time) that we could now define obsolete for what other directors have abused since then and to have also been at the center of numerous controversies on the business, more than on the art, of making cinema. In fact, it is known that the Wachowski brothers didn't stop at films, but wove a web of related productions of various genres. Starting with the series of animated shorts that make up The Animatrix collection (among which, it is fair to point out, there is also a computer-graphic short made by none other than Square Enix), to continue with comics, various gadgets and, of course, video games . At the release of The Matrix Reloaded, a mediocre multiplatform action-game was developed, Enter the Matrix (made even more anonymous by the two protagonists, Neobe and Ghost, certainly not among the most loved characters in the saga); later, some time after the end of the film trilogy, an MMORPG was even put on the market, The Matrix Online, which in the intentions of the brothers Andy and Larry should have continued the already convulsive history of the films, this time based on the actions of the gamers, that would influence its course. Easier said than done, even the MMORPG, albeit not without decidedly original ideas, suffered from what The Matrix had actually really become: a fad. And fashions come and go, and if the first film remains indisputably a ~classic~, the two sequels already suffered from a certain fatigue at the launch (separated by no more than six months, moreover). It is therefore bizarre to find ourselves here, after years, reviewing Path of Neo, which incredibly is the first video game to put the user in the shoes of the saga's most loved character, that Neo to whom the good Keanu Reeves lent his face.", "date": "2005-12-07", "grade": null}
