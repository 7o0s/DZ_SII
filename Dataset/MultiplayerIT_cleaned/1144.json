And it shows significant differences compared to that of the first Halo. First, there is no trace of the old pistol and assault rifle. The first has been replaced by the magnum, a pistol without a sniper sight that is no longer surgical and lethal like the one in the first chapter. Instead of the assault rifle we find instead the battle rifle, with a sniper sight and capable of firing bursts of three shots, and the machine gun, deadly in terms of rate of fire but very inaccurate. The rocket launcher is now equipped with heat-seeking missiles while the sniper rifle remains the best weapon for sniping. On the Covenant front, we note the needler, decidedly more powerful especially when used in pairs, the new carbine, very precise and quick to reload and the particle rifle, the alien equivalent of the sniper rifle: excellent rate of fire, but be careful not to overheat it. Interesting but difficult to use the Brute rifle, a kind of portable mortar equipped with shells that ricochet once off each surface before exploding. And the Covenant sword? Turn the page... Better alone... Let's start with the single player, one of Bungie's best kept secrets over the years. With Halo 2 the attempted approach is rightly conservative: we started from Halo, expanding and perfecting the already excellent base and inserting small variations on the theme. Halo 2 plays like Halo, bursting with Halo at all polygons, but delivering an experience elevated to the nth degree, in every single aspect, while maintaining the fantastic overall balance of the game. It only takes a few minutes to feel at home: same sensations, same controls, same mechanics, same feeling. But just get to the first firefight to realize how much the game has been refined and to be amazed, struck by the naturalness and realism of the situations. Thanks above all to the incredible artificial intelligence of enemies and fellow soldiers, here further improved and simply on another level, and to the interaction with the scenarios. Halo 2 plays like Halo, it oozes Halo from all polygons, but delivers an experience elevated to the nth degree, in every single aspect Better alone... The Covenant give no respite this time: expose yourself only for a few moments and they will continue to fire in your direction, even after you have taken cover behind a wall, while other members of the group are coming to flush you out. Advance too boldly and here are the Elites leaping, pure Matrix-style, in your direction and swooping down on you from above, or climbing crates and other ledges to put themselves in a more favorable line of fire. Or take cover, realistically flattening your back against the wall. Although more aggressive, the AI is at the same time more realistic in reactions and, above all, in perception. As long as they don't actually see you moving, the enemies will assume that your position has remained unchanged and, with adequate precautions or taking advantage of the covering fire of your companions, it is possible to go around the enemy lines to kill the components of a patrol one by one by hitting them from behind : An aspect that adds a new dimension to the stealth components of the game. A similar argument applies to the interaction with the scenarios: although not exasperated, the step forward compared to the first Halo is marked. Walls that crumble under fire, glass that shatters, cars and trucks that explode, objects and bodies realistically bound to the laws of physics, projected into the air by detonations. Seeing a Hunter charge into it and throw a box into the air with a shield blast is a thrilling experience. And terrifying. Better alone... Physics likewise affects the behavior of vehicles, now much more realistic. The driving model of the various vehicles has been further improved and made more immediate and fun: for example, with the Warthogs it is possible to perform more accentuated drifts, with the Banshees launching into spectacular aerial acrobatics. Ghosts and other Covenant vehicles have the ability to boost, increasing in speed to hit opponents harder. The vehicles suffer localized damage by literally falling to pieces, which remain choreographically scattered on the battlefield, and explode causing considerable damage: the carcasses of the downed Ghosts, for example, explode a second time, after a certain amount of time following the initial explosion, with devastating effects on everything around them. It is also possible to seize on the fly a vehicle driven by an opponent, simplyapproaching you and pressing the X key. Easy to say, much more difficult to do: you try to jump on a Ghost who is about to run you over at full speed. The action is incredibly satisfying and able to overturn the balance of power in battle in an instant. Yes, it is now possible to approach an enemy tank and take possession of it, flushing out the occupants with a grenade after punching the entrance door open. If you have the guts to do it The action is incredibly satisfying and able to overturn the balance of power in battle in an instant. Better alone... Of course, your opponents also have the same chance. So be prepared to be suddenly thrown from your vehicle or to see three Covenant wreaking havoc aboard a Warthog. And your fellow soldiers can now get behind the wheel and whisk you around the battlefield. Intelligence in these cases shows some gaps and too much uncertainty, with a certain difficulty in getting around some obstacles or in the tightest curves. But it's really great fun. Compared to the first Halo, and to every other fps on the market, the most incisive change is the total elimination of the energy bar. The Master Chief can now rely only on his rechargeable shield, depleted of which a couple of hits are enough to get to the fateful game over. A risky choice but one that works wonders, eliminating the need to go to the tedious, and often full of backtracking, search for med kits. It is then possible to wield two weapons in one hand at the same time, a solution already seen in other games but implemented incredibly well in Halo 2. Using two weapons, in any combination (it is also possible to wield two different weapons), increases exponentially its own power and rate of fire, but you have to submit to much higher reload times and give up the use of grenades and melee shots. Furthermore, when switching to the secondary weapon, one of the two weapons in hand is dropped to the ground automatically. Perfect balance then: carrying two weapons has great advantages and at the same time great disadvantages. It's up to you to evaluate how to behave, depending on the different situations and your style of play. Now add one and one, and imagine all this in a large-scale, open field battle with dozens of units involved, a couple of Warthogs, several Ghosts, Scorpion tanks and Banshee fighters attacking. It is a difficult experience to explain in words, it must be lived in person, above all to be able to appreciate the incredible variety of situations live: even repeating the same sequence several times and performing the same actions is practically impossible, thanks to the advanced artificial intelligence, that events unfold in exactly the same way. Careful tactical planning is not enough to continue, you have to adapt to what happens on the battlefield and react as quickly as possible to cope with the changed conditions of the clash. All supported by one of the most advanced technical and artistic sectors ever: the Xbox hardware is squeezed down to the last megahertz, it is difficult to do more. The polygonal detail, the textures (the use of normal mapping is spectacular), the animations and the effects are simply the best we have seen so far on consoles, and the frame rate always remains stable and high, even in the most chaotic and in open battlefields. The only graphical defects are to be found in a slightly too marked use of the LOD management, the system that decreases the polygonal complexity of the models in relation to the distance, in order to render the more distant objects and characters with fewer polygons in order not to weigh too much the console. Unfortunately, the transition from less defined models to more detailed ones is very marked and takes place too close to the player and with little gradualness. The same goes for textures, which change in resolution too abruptly. The effect is visually unpleasant, especially if we consider that it also occurs during the cut scenes, all rendered with the game engine. Music, a captivating mix of symphonic and rock, and sound effects are of the highest level, as well as the dubbing, excellently made and entirely in Italian. In short, Halo 2, as was to be expected, does not disappoint expectations, although it fails to reach the very high peaks of its predecessor. That's right: the single player mode is better in everything, yet it remains a step below the prequel. Paradoxical? No, it's just a matter of sensations. Halo 2 fails to have the same innovative charge and to propose equally epic moments, however much, much goes thereclose on more than one occasion: the incipit of The Silent Cartographer still remains an unattainable peak. And, although filed and partially resolved, many of the defects of the first Halo are proposed again in this second chapter. The level design is more varied and effective, but the structure remains very linear and there is no shortage of very repetitive sequences with corridors and symmetrical and all the same environments in which it is even difficult to orientate. Of course we are far from the prequel Library. But not enough. Then there is the plot, one of the most important aspects of the game, on which Bungie has kept the utmost confidentiality. Much more developed than that of the first chapter, it has truly surprising implications, a compelling and well-structured development and offers brilliant dialogues. But, let's say it openly without obviously revealing anything, it may not be liked precisely because of its particularity and unexpected turns. How can you not like the ending, which will surely be one of the most controversial aspects of the game. The campaign mode isn't terribly long - 10-15 hours of gameplay is enough to see the credits. However, replayability is guaranteed: the two-player cooperative mode is a little gem, even if unfortunately it is not possible to play via LAN or Xbox Live but only in split screen. And the multiple difficulty levels offer a lasting challenge, not only increasing the AI and strength of enemies but also changing their type, number and arrangement. But forget the Easy and Normal modes, really too simple: enjoy the game at the Heroic or Legendary level, absurdly tough, and you will have no regrets. And then, to increase longevity, multiplayer takes care of it. Give me a sword... The most fun weapon to use is the energy blade, aka the dreaded Covenant sword. It is certainly the most powerful weapon, capable of killing any opponent with a single well-aimed shot, but it requires practice and a good deal of coolness to be used to its full potential. Pressing B delivers a single slash, but pulling the right trigger, aiming at any enemy and staying at the right distance, launches into a devastating leap attack, which can be performed in any position, even when jumping, or from top to bottom . A lethal technique that radically changes the way you play. ...that badly accompanied? Okay, Halo 2 single player isn't perfect. Multiplayer, on the other hand, is: Bungie's new effort is simply the most complete, satisfying, advanced, varied multiplayer experience currently available, on any platform. Whether online or offline, the line between the two modes is blurred as never before, while allowing for an amount of customization rarely seen before. In fact, it is possible to connect up to sixteen Xboxes in the local network, for a titanic LAN party, or play in four, on a single console in split screen. And connect to Xbox Live, even with multiple players on a single console, to dramatically expand the possibilities and finally offer everyone the experience of playing Halo in multiplayer as it was originally conceived: in sixteen, on a map huge, with vehicles. A possibility that few have been able to enjoy in the first chapter of the series and which is now within reach of any ADSL. Online, as offline, the game engine is solid as a rock: the action remains fluid even in the most chaotic situations, with sporadic and minimal slowdowns that absolutely do not undermine gameplay, and the response of the controls is always optimal. The experience is fully customizable, combining the dozen maps present - to which others will soon be added for download - with any of the seven basic game modes, which in turn are further equipped with sub-variants and can be customized. The classic modes (Slaughter, King of the Hill, Juggernaut, Capture the Flag, Skull) are joined by the new Assault and Territories. In the first you have to deposit a bomb in the headquarters of the opposing team, in the second to conquer and keep certain areas of the map under control for a certain amount of time. The map designs are fantastic, often with asymmetrical elements to offer players more possibilities: ranging from smaller ones, suitable for a small number of players, to huge battlefields suitable for unleashing two teams of eight in a real and its war without quarter. In any case, the game is always masterfully balanced and offers everyone, thanks to its complex structure, the possibility of customizing their own style of play to the maximum. Perhaps only the Covenant swords, which are so fun to use, are slightly too powerful: unlike the single player mode, where you can", "date": "2004-11-10", "grade": null}
