If you are one of the four million Italians who follow the quiz conducted by Gerry Scotti every evening, know that the transposition on NintendoDS follows the formula word for word, with the necessary precautions. Faithful to the TV format in terms of graphics, jingles and music, some necessary changes have been made to the aid system. But at this point it is necessary to take a step back to explain the rules of the game to the few still immune to the dictatorship of TV. ~Who wants to Be a Millionaire?~ is a typical general knowledge game based on fifteen multiple choice questions of increasing difficulty. For each correct answer, the stake doubles, if one answer is wrong, everything is lost. There are two intermediate milestones, placed on the fifth and tenth questions, which represent sure wins. If a question appears difficult, it is allowed to withdraw, thus winning the quota reached, or to ask for one of the three available aids: the help of the public, that of an external opinion and that which removes two wrong answers. The fourth aid is missing here, the switch that allows you to change one question with another, a novelty of the latest television edition. But there are other discrepancies between what the game looks like on TV and what it looks like in video game form, beyond the obvious brownout due to the absence of an actual prize. The difficulty curve of the questions has not been calibrated in an optimal way, so that reaching the finish line of the fifth question (500) may not be as obvious as it happens on TV, where the first questions seem clearly formulated to allow the competitor to solve ice. If I could have a (virtual) Million a month For a game of general culture like this one, first of all, an abundant and varied bouquet of questions is asked, in order to avoid repeating the same questions during two different games. Unfortunately, in this NintendoDS edition of CVEM, since the fourth or fifth game the questions will tend to recur, identical or reversed in form; ~What is the capital of Germany?~ while a few games later they might ask ~Berlin is the capital of which state?~. It goes without saying that in these conditions the challenge factor dramatically decreases, especially as the game support prevents any online update of the question database. Nothing to complain, on the other hand, as regards the variety of questions, ranging from geography to politics, from sport to science to current events, etc. Despite the above problems, reaching the final milestone of one million euros is not easy. The aforementioned aids come to the player's aid; where the so-called 50 and 50 presented no problems in being translated into the video game, a simulation was opted for to help probe the opinion of the audience present in the studio (Bulgarian percentages to the first questions, homogeneous distribution to the more advanced ones ). The help that on TV allows you to consult a family member by telephone, here is reproduced through a selection among four people, whose main interests are listed. Consulting the one that seems more knowledgeable in the subject in question, you will obtain confirmations that leave no room for doubt, or misleading hesitations. It's up to you to understand if there is room for trust or not. And once the milestone of one million euros has been reached? No big deal. You can simply start another ~climb to the million~. From this point of view the game suffers from an absolute lack of depth: there is no space for data or statistics of any kind. It is possible to participate in games with two players, who will alternate with the answer, but it is not possible, for example, to make cross-comparisons between the game data of two different players (who on average wins the most money? Who is better at answering questions of history? Just to give some examples of information that would not have hurt). You play, you answer, you win or lose, you start again. Stop. And bearing in mind that, as mentioned, the questions will soon begin to repeat themselves (without even changing the arrangement of the answer options), you will understand why the juice of this title is a rather thin soup. Comment All in all, a few things are expected from a general culture video game, but they are essential: many questions, in the first place, and then a good variety of the same. If these foundations fail, as in this case, the title can only be deficient, with the natural consequences in terms of appeal. It must be said that once the questions in Italian get bored, you can address those concerning the English or French cultural sphere (formulated in the respective llanguages, mind you), but how many are interested? Pros A game suitable for everyone (or almost) Six languages and their respective questions The questions cover many thematic areas... Cons ...but they will tend to repeat themselves too soon Difficulty curve of questions poorly calibrated No options or statistics available ~Who wants to Be a Millionaire?~ is available for GameBoy Advance, Nintendo DS, Windows PC, mobile platforms and will be available for Nintendo Wii. The version tested in this article is the one for Nintendo DS. The invention of television formats, i.e. the conception of standardised, pre-packaged programs sold to all networks in the world, is one of the practices which most characterizes the so-called neo-television. Reality-shows, sit-coms, heartbreaking meatloaf and, last but not least, quizzes; a rigid formula conceived ad hoc to work in any context, an alchemy that allows only minimal variations to adapt the transmission to the local language and culture. Evidently they were not satisfied with exporting them from the Alps to the pyramids, from Manzanares to the Rhine, thus explaining the videogame genesis of the most famous quiz in the world.
