{"name": "Tropico 6", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tropico-6-recensione.html", "text": "Tropico 6 is the new chapter of one of the most popular city management series in the PC environment, characterized by a tropical setting and by being essentially a South American dictatorship simulator, albeit with extremely relaxed tones. In the old editions this theme was treated in a much more serious way, but for some incarnations in this part El Presidente, that is the player's avatar, as well as governor of the small nation that we are going to manage, has become more of a folkloric figure. Not that there are no references to real themes, but they are much more nuanced and influence the gameplay in a lesser and more amused way. For the rest, factions to be satisfied, political criminals to be arrested, opponents to disappear, elections to be bought, constitutions to be tightened, riots to be put down in blood and the other typical elements of the series are all there. The main objective of the player remains to make the nation of Tropico prosper, accompanying it through four eras. Basically, the basic mechanics are the classic ones of the genre: buildings are built with an eye to the resources available, you check that there are no problems using the numerous summary screens and you intervene where it is most necessary, following the wishes of the citizens or the demands of realpolitik, trying not to bankrupt the nation by too much magnanimity. In the meantime, we must also carry out a series of missions that are assigned to us by allies and advisers, which usually require the construction of certain buildings or the development of a certain sector. For example, we may be asked to produce a certain amount of tobacco (one crop among many available), which requires the appropriate plantation, or to conclude a trade route with a certain faction, or even to send pirates to make raids, or to send El Presidente to visit a certain building, or to enhance a certain tourist site and so on. In general, the tasks that are assigned to us establish the pace of the game, also because they are a great way to accumulate resources or favors and, in missions, to progress everything. In total, Tropico 6 is spread over four eras, ranging from the colonial to the contemporary, each with its own problems and buildings to build. Particular applause goes to the interface, always clear and functional despite the many things it has to manage. Here you can clearly see the experience Limbic has gained with other strategic games, in particular the Might & Magic Heroes, from which the Tropico 6 interface inherits clarity and legibility, with all warnings placed in the right place and no possible misunderstanding. The tutorial is also excellent, which explains well the main functions of the game, as well as some of the advanced ones. Single player missions Tropico 6 doesn't have a real campaign like Tropico 4 and 5, but a series of narrative scenarios similar to those seen in Tropico 3. In total there are fifteen of them and, simply put, overall they stage the problems related to the development of our dictatorship in different eras and in various socio-political contexts. Among the fifteen missions there are some more focused on economic development, while others will take the population control and repression systems foreseen by the game to the extreme consequences. There are also missions more focused on international relations and others in which more modern themes such as sexual freedom or freedom of expression emerge. Obviously everything is expressed with that irony which has always characterized the Tropico series and which in a certain sense represents its signature. After all, in which other game is it possible to rig elections, send the military to hunt for dissidents and simultaneously declare themselves friends of democracy at the same time? Tropico 6 is equipped with a series of tools that allow us to tell a wide range of possible developments of our small dictatorship, without ever weighing down the gameplay and, indeed, making it interesting in every possible way. It is difficult to calculate how many hours it can take to complete all the missions, given that the type of game not only allows you to play them several times by tackling them in different ways, but also because once you have run out of scenario objectives, you can continue playing as if you were in sandbox mode. The latter then increases longevity dramatically, given that it allows you to play free scenarios that can be customized by difficulty, size, economic availability and aggressiveness of the factions. In terms of actual content, Tropico 6 offers a good amount of buildings, edicts to develop and objectives to achieve, as well as a large variety of possible eco developmentsnames, ranging from wild industrialization to extreme ecology. Unfortunately, these days it is difficult not to make comparisons with the previous chapters which, DLC after DLC, usually overflow with content. Tropico 6, from this point of view, represents an excellent starting point, which is already perfectly enjoyable. Obviously those coming from the previous Tropicos have to accept that it still needs to grow a bit. In any case, considering the duration of the missions (more than five hours each for the advanced ones) and considering the possibilities offered by the sandbox mode, it is easy to assume that the most passionate players can get dozens and dozens of hours of gameplay out of Tropico 6 . No multiplayer Tropico 6 will lack multiplayer at launch, or at least the review version we were given did not. The developers have promised that they will launch it at a later date, because they are still testing it. In truth, the mutiplayer was included in the beta of the game: evidently including a refined version in the finished product would have led to a delay in the launch. Defects Tropico 6 basically has two major flaws. The first is a certain lack of personality, which, if you like, is paradoxical for one of the best-characterized series ever in the world of management. Debuting in the series, Limbic Entertainment seems to have wanted to risk the minimum, creating a fruit salad with some of the most loved features of the third, fourth and fifth chapters. The result, as often happens, is not as exciting as it should be. It works, yes, but it's the classic top-of-the-class theme that seems to have understood perfectly what the teacher wanted from him, without however having put anything of his own into it. The result is in a certain sense more aseptic and detached than necessary and lacks strong characterizing elements. The second flaw, this one more substantial, concerns the economic system. It is true that in recent years the mobile world has forced all management systems to make management of the economy less complex, so as not to frustrate too much players who come from dull and flat experiences such as Clash of Clans and similar, but the trend it's getting worrisome. The economy of Tropico 6 - although it offers interesting elements such as pirate raids, trade routes, diplomatic relations that can yield aid or penalize a little, ties with factions, which can lead to crises and unexpected expenses and how much 'other - appears too simplified and little influenced by the way of conceiving the city, which should instead be the fulcrum of the game. It's incredible to see how the simulation level has been so simplified compared to the first Tropicos, where it wasn't just the presence or absence of certain buildings that mattered, but also their relative positioning to that of all the others. In this sense Tropico 6 is closer to the philosophy of Two Point Hospital or Jurassic World Evolution, i.e. the one that does not penalize the player for how he builds, considering only the presence or absence of certain buildings, although Limbic has not completely given up on certain more deep, which however emerge only by selecting the highest level of challenge, especially in the sandbox mode. In fact, it is interesting to note that the maximum difficulty of some modern management software corresponds more or less to the average one of the old titles. A world not so alive One of the most controversial aspects of Tropico 6 concerns the technical part. We are not talking about the graphics themselves, excellent for a management system, but about the vitality of the city. Unfortunately, the inhabitants of Tropico often behave in an unnatural way and stopping to watch them as they live their lives shows puppets that move like automatons, going from one place to another without criteria and without their choices really influencing the gameplay. Let's say that they are mere decoration, where the pulsating arteries of our work should be. The buildings themselves are well made and well characterised: Limbic was able to clearly show the transition between eras in the architecture of the various homes and production buildings. Too bad that, for example, some remain the same regardless of the period in which they are built. Thus a colonial-era prison is identical to one from the modern era. Of course, redoing all the buildings for each era would have meant a huge increase in production, but a few minimal changes would have been enough to be satisfied. Finally, the soundtrack is excellent, made up of Latin American songs with an enthralling rhythm, which greatly increase the pleasure of playing.", "date": "2019-03-29", "grade": "7.5"}
