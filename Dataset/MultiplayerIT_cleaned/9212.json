Because I've canceled plans for you! You and I will have a great time!~ The first encounter with Pagan Min in the Far Cry 4 campaign may not be on the same level as the famous monologue by Vaas Montenegro, but it comes close enough. Clearly thanks to the interpretation of Troy Baker, impeccably dubbed in Italian by Claudio Moneta, who has given the antagonist of the fourth chapter of the Ubisoft series a surprising depth, going to outline the character and peculiarities of this violent figure, sometimes crazy and at the same time mysterious, to lead her to the Olympus of the most famous villains of Always. Pagan: Control, the beautiful scenery of the DLC Far Cry 6's second DLC puts us in Pagan's shoes, in the context of a roguelite-style adventure fundamentally identical to the one we played under the command of Vaas: a skill challenge for those who appreciate the genre, but also and above all a concentration of fanservice for those who want to find out what is behind the purple suit and peroxided hair of the dictator of Kyrat. Are you therefore ready to return to the valleys at the foot of the Himalayas, or rather within the mental representation of this place birthed by the ruthless villain? Dead or alive, depending on the choices you made in the Far Cry 4 ending, Min is determined to reunite his family regardless of the trials he will be subjected to: we tell you about his obsession in the Pagan: Control review. Setting Pagan: Control, the Photo Mode allows you to take great photos If you have read the review of Vaas: Insanity, which is the first of the three peculiar DLCs of Far Cry 6, you will know that the developers have thought for these post-launch contents to explore the mind of three of the most famous villains of the Ubisoft series, precisely Vaas Montenegro, Pagan Min and Joseph Seed. The setting for each of them refers to the main scenario of the respective games, and in this case projects us into a reduced but visually very fascinating version of Kyrat. The landscapes that we face once the DLC has started, which can also be played alone or in a cooperative with a friend, are magnificent in terms of architecture and colors. The figure of Pagan is reproduced on huge golden statues and tapestries that grace the rock walls, as we travel through hills surrounded by magnificent pagodas, lakes and hints of forest. The Photo Mode allows you to portray this splendor with the help of filters and visual effects, and the result is really interesting shots. Gameplay Pagan: Control, another look at the scenario Regardless of the scenario, the incipit is always the same: Pagan awakens in this sort of dreamlike dimension and the voices in his head suggest what to do, specifically look in the mirror to eventually unlock some permanent traits, which therefore will not come lost in game over, and check the weapons closet to buy and perhaps upgrade pistols, assault rifles, machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles and grenade launchers. We will be able to make our purchases using the only form of currency present, the Respect , obtainable by opening certain chests scattered within the map, eliminating the enemies who guard it and passing tests which also correspond to extra rewards, in this case the unlocking of new guns to enrich the arsenal. Compared to Vaas: Insanity, the developers have included a pinch of puzzle solving, but in general the two experiences are superimposable. Pagan: Control, a huge tapestry depicting the dictator There are therefore five cycles, gradually more difficult, that we will be able to face within the same map, completing the same challenges but maintaining from time to time the equipment and skills obtained up to that moment. Also in this case the value of the prize reserved for those who have the patience and ability to get to the end will be directly proportional to the passion nurtured towards the Far Cry 4 lore. Moving by day or by night, in the latter case with the continuous appearance of annoying ghosts who will try to explode after reaching us, our goal will be to complete three missions in particular (plus three more to witness specific memories of the protagonist), then reach Pagan Min's palace for one last challenge horde-style, with a certain number of waves and bosses to be eliminated in order to ~go beyond~. Unfortunately, the well-known gunplay problems that we talked about in the Far Cry 6 review are also present here and that in a context based exclusively about combatare emphasized. It happens in Pagan: Control to aim at an enemy's head, open fire and miss it sensationally, or to shoot at point-blank range with the grenade launcher and see the bullet pass through the target without any effect to explode a little further on. Pagan: Control, one of the visions that can be unlocked by completing challenges These are no small flaws for a shooter, clearly, and which the guys from Ubisoft Toronto have not yet fixed. It is possible to remedy the inaccuracy of the hitboxes by activating aim assistance, especially by playing with the controller, but this feature is also broken and full of glitches since it often does not correctly hook the opponent we are framing. The emphasis on some RPG drifts as regards the type of shots and the impact areas also end up creating situations of great frustration, in which shooting the body of an enemy produces laughable effects compared to a headshot. And it's a real shame, because with a more solid and reliable shooting, the run & gun approach of these DLCs could really give life to exciting and spectacular situations, even net of such a poor and repetitive structure: in our opinion, the cycles went gradually enriched with new elements to justify its formulation. Graphics and sound Pagan: Control, a vision from the character's past Let's start with the element that we usually leave for last, the sound, which in the case of Pagan: Control can count on discrete effects but in reality is based almost exclusively on the excellent interpretation of Troy Baker, who apparently had a lot of fun dressing once again as Pagan Min. Of course, reading once again that the game has been dubbed in English, French, German, European Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian and even Japanese but not in Italian makes us angry, and we imagine not be the only ones who would have liked to listen to Claudio Moneta again. Thinking about budgets in relation to individual markets and not to the totality of production is, in our opinion, a short-sighted way of doing things, which will only further penalize these stocks in Italy. That said, as far as graphics are concerned, the DLC can count on an extremely fascinating setting, as already mentioned. The extension of the map is not particularly large, but here the sense of progression that is obtained through the unlocking of new equipment appears more concrete than in the pluricited Vaas: Insanity, perhaps also due to the fact that you start already knowing the formula and the its facets. The location includes some reflective surfaces, in particular lakes and shiny objects, but it is not known whether or not ray tracing was used: those types of effects could have been achieved with traditional screen space reflection. In any case, the weight on the GPU is felt, and in fact to maintain 60 fps at 4K with all effects at maximum with an RTX 3070 you must necessarily activate the Super Resolution and select the ~balanced~ preset. In conclusion Pagan: Control continues the discourse that characterizes all three Far Cry 6 DLCs: a journey into the mind of the villain of the moment in which to explore a dreamlike version of the respective scenarios, eliminate ~shadows~ and bosses, unlock new skills and equipment, and finally complete three missions preparatory to the final challenge and the completion of the five cycles that make up the experience, identical to each other net of an increasing degree of difficulty. The positive evaluation is intended only for Far Cry 4 fans who interesting to find out more about Pagan Min, because unfortunately the well-known problems with the gunplay of the Ubisoft title and a limited and repetitive structure do not speak in favor of this package.", "date": "2022-01-10", "grade": null}
