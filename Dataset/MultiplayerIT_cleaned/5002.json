{"name": "4Chan culture club", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/180893-feminazi-the-triggering-4chan-culture-club.html", "text": "Leni Riefenstahl (1902 - 2003) is remembered in particular for two films: ~The triumph of the will~ of 1935 and ~Olympia~ of 1938. The first tells of the Nazi party congress held in Nuremberg in 1934, while the second is a documentary on the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Both films were steeped in Nazi propaganda, but both were at the same time sublime from a stylistic point of view, to the point of creating a big short circuit in contemporary or later critics and directors. Many still today try to reduce the weight of her political choices in her works. It is probably a way to combat the sense of guilt in having to admit that many of the cinematographic forms invented by Riefenstahl are still used today because they are very effective, above all for propaganda purposes (but not only). In short, his films were ~beautiful~ from a technical/stylistic point of view, despite the ideology they dragged behind them. Obviously Riefenstahl, first dancer, then actress, then director, had her own personal vision of the world to support her, due to studies and knowledge. From this was born the rhetorical force of his films, certainly not from Nazism, which is a consequence rather than a condition. Why mention it at the beginning of the review of a miserable title like Feminazi: The Triggering? Perhaps to make people understand, even before describing the game, that it is important to equip oneself with cultural means that support what one wants to express, regardless of the ideology that is its background. But let's take a moment to examine the title: ~Feminazi~ is a neologism created to describe some extreme forms of feminism. In the Urban Dictionary it is well explained, just in opposition to feminism itself: ~a feminazi is not a feminist. Feminists believe in equal rights for all, while feminazis just want to make us look stupid~. However, certain web environments have made this differentiation decay and many simple minds use the term as an offense to feminists tout court. Soon the word took on a strictly political value and was taken up by environments that belong to the extreme right. The Triggering, on the other hand, literally stands for ~trigger~, and is a term frequently associated with feminazis, who figuratively flare up immediately when they see something that doesn't suit them. Already from this you should have understood that Feminazi: The Triggering is a mixture of clichs from forums, in particular from 4Chan and derivatives, where the anti-feminist rhetoric is very strong. But how was this kind of ideology translated into videogames? Feminazi: The Triggering makes us realize how difficult it is to translate idiocy into a video game Feminazi: The Triggering It's obvious that hyperboreanGames and Svarog Studios forgot they were working on a video game when they came up with Feminazi: The Triggering. That is, they had the various internet jokes about feminists in their head, but they didn't know what to do with them. So they created a 2D action with a bird's eye view in which, in the role of a feminazi, you go around a very small map and, in order: accuse white men of every possible wickedness, attack women with children following for their social conformism and to demonstrate benevolence towards blacks, who are all refugees without distinction. Each of the actions described is linked to a key. If you press the right key when you are close to one of the categories listed above, you will get Triggering points or Tolerance points, represented by two bars located in the upper right part of the screen, which add up to the feminism points, i.e. which is the overall score. The goal of the feminazi is not to drop the two bars to zero (it has no real enemies except inactivity). While we go about offending white males and hugging black men, we can do other things, like writing slogans on walls, doing vandalism, collecting tampons, birth control pills, sweets, and so on. Obviously, to the cry that it is always better to add as many clichs as possible, never be that whoever plays misunderstands the speech, by eating the feminazi becomes increasingly fat and ugly (there is a special bar dedicated to its weight in the upper part to the left of the screen). What's the point? Nothing, but it doesn't matter. By entering some buildings it is possible to participate in mini-games, such as a rythmn game set in a disco where you have to make the feminazi dance to the rhythm of music; a shooter where as a policeman you have to shoot white criminals, making refugees pass; or even a kind of ultra-simplified Japanese role-playing game in which you have to summon knights of feminism, i.e. men dressedi improbably and of dubious sexuality, to pit them against the bad whites. Obviously everything is seasoned with a certain amount of sarcasm against feminism and, more generally, social justice warriors, another much-hated category on 4Chan. That's all Feminazi: The Triggering ends here. The game demonstrates everything it has to offer in about twenty minutes, ten of which are spent cursing the control system. It is true that it costs little, but it is worth much less: stylistically it is obscene (a kind of South Park in pixel art), the map is very small, the people all look alike, there are few things to do and, even admitting to being completely harmony with his ideological vision, the whole thing lasts the time of a couple of jokes. The rest is really of a bleak poverty, unable as it is to arouse reflections or to strike hard at its polemical object. Oh yeah, even looking at it from the point of view of a progressive individual, you can't feel any anger playing Feminazi: The Triggering. On the contrary, the more you play, the more you feel a strong penalty towards the authors, evidently disadvantaged poor people with great expressive difficulties. The best part is the editor, who by exploiting a few icons of militant feminism, starting with sexuality, manages at least to elicit a few smiles. Of course, it must be said that even here we are in the order of two minutes of content and that, if you think about it, there are some memes circulating on the web that are much more fun. In fact, even ultra-right games, which never declare themselves as such, there are many and better ones. It is not clear why anyone would want to throw ninety-nine euro cents on this stuff.", "date": "2017-03-13", "grade": "1.5"}
