{"name": "Guild Wars: Factions - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guild-wars-factions-recensione.html", "text": "Alone or badly accompanied? The aspect of Factions that most bewitched me is the extreme simplicity with which in a very short time you will become an integral part of the battle, without power players in the middle of the boxes, useless frustrations or evenings spent studying ranting statistics such as ~I noticed that since the last update the crits have decreased by 0.2%~ (ah sure, give me my money back). Since it is a title focused on almost forced sociability and on the union of autonomous guilds, you will hardly find yourself waiting for hours because someone is on the other side of the world lighting a small fire for his battle panda. A small note to point out the possibility of teleporting automatically to any outpost visited; say no more to scenic travel. However, returning to our proud entry into the Guild Wars universe, the best way to introduce you to the lands of Cantha is to follow the path offered by NCSoft, also for our review. Then we insert the game code, register an absolutely free account, without any additional monthly expense (I must have already said it but I never get tired), and here we are before the first crucial choice. In reality, although nothing forces you in one sense rather than the other, between the possibility of creating a character for pvp or starting from scratch with the role-playing game, we strongly recommend the second. In the first case, in fact, eager to throw yourself into the fray you will be offered a maximum level adventurer, with a set of skills pre-determined with ancient wisdom (and many weekends spent in the office) directly from the developers. You will thus reach the Archipelago of Hostilities, a name that leaves no room for doubt, to rage in the competitive fury of PvP, even if you will not be able to visit the world of Cantha in any way, losing many of the possibilities that this can actually offer you. Not only by participating in the adventure you will enjoy the history and background of Guild Wars, but you will also be able to unlock new skills and powerful weapons that will then be available later in case you want to create a character dedicated exclusively to PvP. Let it be said very clearly that Guild Wars does an absolutely excellent job of integration and from the world of Cantha, if you walk the path from scratch, you will of course be able to access the Archipelago of Hostilities, join a guild and much more, which we are going to dive into on the next pages. the main campaign becomes only a small part of the rich pot offered by the NCsoft Koreans End of the preambles, after all there is a manual specifically to explain certain things to you, even if I promise to provide figures and a list of game modes offered by Factions in the appropriate box. So, you have created your own villager of the lowest rank, what will happen to you once you set foot in the monastery? Worried that other players will take you to an alley to get robbed? If you're shy, overcome your insecurity by joining a guild immediately. In the globalization policy operated by the shrewd Korean house you can access the playing area in the world region that best suits you and if you long for a neutral ground in which to meet the Indian friend you haven't heard from for so many years, simply select the option ~international~ in the window visible on the screen. A matter of a click and you will catapult yourself with foreign players. However, we remain among our brothers and speak of the guilds, the true heart of the game. If this is your first time taking part in these kinds of challenges you may feel like you want to be alone, but rest assured that it is in everyone's best interest to have new players to help grow into joining a guild. In many hours I've met very friendly and helpful players, well disposed towards newcomers, something that doesn't often happen in other online RPGs, especially thanks to the system designed for Guild Wars, in which even a weak character can make the difference. I know that you don't give a damn, you want to be very strong, alone and surrounded by corpses but in the arenas your blood tribute for the team will not go unnoticed, especially in the eyes of non-player spectators who follow the clashes to learn your homicidal techniques. Warriors you become If you've joined a guild that's it. At this point you can focus on the aspects of the game that appeal to you the most, seamlessly switching between phases, as everything is connected in the world of Guild Wars. In fact, the role-playing game has the task of narrating the story of Cantha and making you grow as characters, offering you gold and precious objects, while unlocking new skills, hundreds to tell the truth. The characterThe main feature that distinguishes this Korean epic is the possibility offered to each player to tackle the missions alone, loading a private instance for each adventurer. Assuming that however powerful you cannot venture alone, within each city or outpost (unique places shared by all players at the same time), you will be given the opportunity to hire computer-controlled non-player characters, who will fight at your side. In this way you will solve many of the problems related to the search for companions in the flesh (even if linked to you by a telephone cable), even if the limits are imposed for the more difficult missions. In fact, it is not possible to implement any strategy with the computer-operated unfortunates, who suffer from an incurable stupidity. Since you can't really enjoy Factions without a group, ask the guild for help and they'll most likely gladly accompany you, if not consider spitting on their cloak and selling yourself to another captain. the peak of its exclusive content is reserved for the players most dedicated to the clash Warriors you become Few worries then and even death only means a retreat to the reset point, with temporary penalties, so that you can revise your plans for a moment, as the now totally flexible skill system is the key to understanding the sweet juice of Guild Wars: Factions. Nothing is irreversible, not even the faction that will choose your guild, but we will come back to this later; what matters most as a player is the choice of eight skills to take with you before each mission, selectable only within a city. Even the points to upgrade your character are completely reassignable, just as the second profession can be modified by continuing in the game, in the face of realism but with great satisfaction for each player, who can thus study different cooperation plans and even beat the adventurer more powerful by grouping the right skills. The game plays its part well in taking you along the mysteries of Cantha, giving you all the rules you need to learn the rudiments of pvp and teamwork, since Factions still strongly emphasizes the social and cooperative aspect of the game. game, so that the main campaign becomes only a small part of the rich pot offered by the Koreans of NCsoft. Guild Wars: Factions is accessible, streamlined, and straightforward Warriors you become Although the far-eastern mythical tradition of this expansion enriches the Guild Wars universe with a melancholy and undoubtedly exotic flavor for us Westerners, it certainly cannot be said that the narrative is up to its background. Most of the areas don't offer great interaction elements and the general aspect is pleasant but not very believable and engaging. The buildings are all impassable except for the imposing staircases and large courtyards, so that even the presumed life of the non-player characters is barely a side element. Factions unfortunately does not offer the pleasure of being able to immerse yourself in an epic quest, sliding very quickly along the levels until you are ready for PvP, the main element in this second expansion. Brothers in Arms Guild Wars, and especially Factions, doesn't let you get lost in one big seamless world populated by hundreds of players. In this other titles succeed much more effectively and when compared with the NCsoft saga they easily outclass it in terms of adventures, objects and ~things to do~ in general. However, if we think of the drums of war, the Colosseum of gladiators or the arenas where the knights fought for their lives, then it is the Korean flag that flies high on the tower. Once you have decided to open the doors of PvP, first going through the excellent tutorials that will allow you a less traumatic baptism of fire, there will be no turning back. Like soldiers who fail to resume civilian life, you too may begin to miss the battlefield. From this point of view the sense of glorious conquest is assured, because you will have to start from the bottom and demonstrate what the lineage to which you belong is made of in order to access higher competitions. The first step is to learn the basics in the Shing Jea Arena, and then fight in the Random Arenas, scattered around Cantha, where the team of players is randomly assigned by the computer. If you manage to accumulate ten consecutive victories you will move up in the group and you will be able to move on to the maps dedicated to the Team Arenas, where your teammatesof sword you can choose freely, so as to set up a real strategy. It goes without saying that from here on, up to the Olympus of Heroes, the conquests are worth not only titles and awards, but also new insignia for the headquarters of your guild and even access to two exclusive adventures (to find out what it is take a look at the box dedicated to Factions missions). Final comment Guild Wars: Factions, like its predecessor is accessible, streamlined and immediate for any player. Elegant in the scenography and at times impressive, when cherry blossoms rain in the background, it is undoubtedly a title full of style. Unlike the first chapter, which we recommend to anyone approaching this saga for the first time, it runs a little too fast in the main campaign and then expands and flourishes in PvP, the true heart of this expansion. A greater sense of immersion in the history of Cantha and a more refined interface would certainly have made it even more satisfying. Unfortunately, the peak of its exclusive content is reserved for players most dedicated to the fight, if not in terms of hours certainly from the point of view of passion and will. However, it remains a refreshing experience for those who love competition and a new adventure for those who have consumed Prophecies and have a thirst for Guild Wars. Pros Intriguing combat system Flexible and open to anyone Tons of interrelated game modes Inspired and impressive to watch Cons Most exclusive content is elitist Weak storytelling Class struggle Guild Wars: Factions adds two new classes to the six already seen in the Prophecies campaign, the Assassin and the Ritualist. The first is naturally aimed at those who love close combat and base their luck on the series of chain attacks and defensive spells, in order to be able to move between enemy ranks and retreat to catch their breath. The Ritualist, splendid in the graphic realization, is instead a shaman in contact with the world of spirits, which he can evoke around him until he creates a real army. As attractive as they are, they are no stronger than the previous six classes, having been cleverly balanced. Quite a feat The world of Cantha offers a huge amount of quests, which differ in type and difficulty. The most common can be obtained by talking to non-player characters and are worth experience points and rare items. The adventures, on the other hand, are key enterprises for the continuation of the story and in the event of death they will force you to undertake them all over again. It goes without saying that they are also more demanding and exciting. For those who enjoy cooperation with other players, Factions offers countless Choice Adventures for large groups of players who have reached high ranks. However, that's not all because certain areas can be explored by multiple teams at the same time but we don't want to spoil the surprise. Note that the two most exclusive adventures can only be unlocked by obtaining the favor of the gods in the Olympus of Heroes, an area dedicated to high-level pvp. One Guild Wars leads to another Having both Guild Wars campaigns installed on your computer gives you the advantage of being able to explore two communicating worlds. Although the two new classes introduced by Factions cannot complete the Prophecies campaign, the possibility of exploring the vast lands of Tyria still remains open, from which you can also access different Random Arenas. Wherever you decide to start, both chapters offer a gaming experience that is worth exploring in its entirety, composing the first two pieces of this expanding world. While on the one hand the maps dedicated to PvP are varied and interesting, on the other hand it certainly cannot be said that it is easy to get organized with your own team; at some level it becomes necessary for you and other team members to use a hands-free microphone, so that you can dictate commands to each other without wasting time with the keyboard. Up to this point, however, PvP does not intertwine with role-playing and does not represent the real novelty of Factions, which instead consists in the struggle between the two factions, the Luxon and the Kurzick, in which each guild must at some point take part . The choice of deployment not only modifies the type of adventures available during the campaign, but catapults you directly into the clash between alliances, which can also include several guilds together, determined to wage war under the effigy of a faction rather than for the 'other. Beyond the methods offered, there are real practical implications that determine the mapping of the world.
