{"name": "The Surge 2 - The Kraken", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-surge-2-the-kraken-recensione.html", "text": "The review of The Surge 2 - The Kraken highlights the most substantial part of the Season Pass dedicated to Deck13 Interactive's action RPG, in this case an expansion that takes us to visit an unpublished scenario located on the edge of Jericho City: the aircraft carrier VBS Krakov, apparently ended up in the hands of an artificial intelligence that threatens its inhabitants. Used as a refuge for a handful of survivors, in fact, the ship was attacked by a robotic collective: a small but lethal army coordinated by a huge octopus that wraps a large part of the structure with its metal tentacles, threatening anyone who moves freely. To reach this place we will have to return to Port Nixon after completing the campaign or at least defeating the boss Major General Ezra Shields. News, enemies and equipment Once we have traveled the cable that separates us from the VBS Krakov aircraft carrier, in The Surge 2 - The Kraken we will find ourselves in an apparently peaceful garden, so much so that a local inhabitant is cooking meat on the grill. There is a Medbay available for the inevitable upgrades, the only one in the new scenario: as we proceed to complete the mission, new paths and shortcuts will open up which will allow us to get back there quickly, so as to store any credits and scrap in order to level up, build new equipment or upgrade the one in our possession. Crossing the threshold of a garage, we will be able to find out what the new enemies of this expansion consist of: generally not too clever androids, which we can eliminate without particular problems, but also large robots, armed with spears that hurt hell if they get hit. As usual, we will be able to hook specific parts of the body as a target and cut them away with a spectacular finisher when the opponent's health is running low, so as to obtain extra loot to be used at the first useful save.Among the new objects, the components of the armor of the Collective, which incorporates the vaguely Brainiac-style aesthetic of the new enemies and, once adequately enhanced, provides excellent defense and efficiency values, without disturbing the heaviest armor at our disposal. Furthermore, once the mission is completed, we will also be able to bring home new appendages for the drones, in this case a grenade launcher and a missile launcher, and some further extra components. Playstation 4 trophies The Kraken adds ten Trophies to those already present in the main campaign of The Surge 2. Getting them is quite simple, just complete the expansion and the two side quests available, build the DLC-related equipment and defeat a certain amount of enemies. Structure and bosses The Kraken expansion is certainly not huge, on the contrary: the setting is actually divided into four or five watertight compartments, which are unlocked as we progress and come into contact with the woman who sent us the request for help. His goal is to stop the advance of the artificial intelligence that keeps VBS Krakov in check, and it's funny that at the end of the assignment it is possible to make two distinct choices that lead to as many endings, but which annoyingly don't warn from the possible implications of our decisions, even tending to deceive us a bit: a bad way to manage crossroads. In general there are challenging and spectacular fights, particularly when you are at the back of the drive in and try to activate switches while the enemies do not stop appearing, actually giving us a lot of trouble due to numerical inferiority. The boss fight, on the other hand, is not particularly difficult: just keep your distance, wait for the enemy to start ~bouncing~ and ring combos by aiming at his arms, perhaps helping us with drones to inflict as much damage as possible. His spear is lethal, but you can parry it without too much trouble. Ultimately The Kraken doesn't come with who knows what ambitions: it's an extra pleasant mission and with some nice enemies, although the aircraft carrier scenario doesn't offer who knows what glimpses and the final boss turns out to be less fascinating than it was reasonable to expect. Those who enjoyed the basic campaign will certainly be able to invest 11.99 euros for a few hours of extra entertainment, provided obviously that they don't expect great things.", "date": "2020-02-12", "grade": null}
