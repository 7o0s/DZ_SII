In this case we are dealing with a title for iOS and Android developed by Creative Mobile Games, which can be downloaded for free thanks to the freemium format but characterized by mechanics that quite often recall a rather pushed concept of monetization, even introducing a monthly subscription for more passionate. A choice that leaves us a little perplexed, if we consider that the game allows you to participate in online multiplayer speed races for up to eight participants, races that could be affected by the shadow of pay to win from a certain point onwards . Set in a distant future, where technology has managed to create very fast Hot Wheels on a human scale, Hot Wheels Infinite Loop puts us at the wheel of some of the most famous models of the line, who compete in circuits that often include jumps and loops of the loop: this is also a trademark. However, the first impact with the experience is a bit rough, given that the control system only provides a touch option (with buttons or levers) and there is no alternative based on the accelerometer. It is an approach that inevitably simplifies everything and prevents you from ~brushing~ the curves, even if you soon realize that this is not the focus of the game. Gameplay and structure Hot Wheels Infinite Loop uses a solid and interesting progression system, which thanks to the continuous unlocking of prize boxes (which, however, require some time to be opened) allows you to obtain virtual currency and, above all, components that allow you to enhance the cars we already own or buy new ones, thus enriching our garage and opening up new possibilities. The vehicles are in fact characterized by different values and behave in a peculiar way depending on the track, giving us concrete advantages when we compete with someone who is at the wheel of a vehicle that is not very suitable for the context. You can access leagues with different degrees of difficulty depending on the level of experience and a series of special events that require the use of expendable tickets, which are restored only after a while. Once on the track, the gameplay is confirmed as devoted to immediacy and spectacularity rather than realism, as evidenced by the possibility of ram and eliminate civilian cars that are in our trajectory or the opponents themselves, although in that case a simple bottarella is not enough . In short, during the race, a bit of everything gets blown up but you have to try to concentrate on the track, which offers crossroads and shortcuts that are useful for building a bit of an advantage, even just by avoiding contact with others and collecting the usual items that allow you to fill up the nitro bar. The latter must be launched at every useful opportunity to increase the speed of the car and make that last overtaking before victory, with a view to an approach very similar to the Asphalt series. From the point of view of solidity and finishes, however, the Mattel production certainly cannot boast the same care as the Gameloft racer. In fact, we encountered problems with the servers that also cause performance to decline, making the action jerky and unmanageable on the iPhone, and graphics that are pleasant but a little dated as regards the effects, limited to a few particles and motion blur. Finally, the soundtrack discreetly accompanies the action while being repetitive in some moments.", "date": "2019-09-06", "grade": "7.0"}
