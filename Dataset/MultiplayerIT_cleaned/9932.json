Whether you're adults who grew up watching them on television, or youngsters fresh from Michael Bay's films, it's impossible you don't know the transformable robots that have influenced the world's imagination since the 80s. Not to mention the toys. After all, how can you resist those plasticky robots that become vehicles and vice versa? Yet the Transformers have not been doing very well lately. While Hasbro continues to successfully produce toy after toy, the most recent animated series, Transformers Animated, tumbled in the space of three years and the second film directed by Michael Bay, Revenge of the Fallen, it is better to draw a pitiful veil. Video game tie-ins? Forget it. Then Activision and High Moon Studios arrive and decide to leave everything behind, start from scratch, literally, and challenge fate with a title that can do justice to the Transformers universe like never before. Will they have succeeded? The Campaign Mode The plot of the Campaign all revolves around the famous civil war that rocked Cybertron long before the Transformers ever arrived on Earth. In summary, Megatron, leader of the Decepticons, is looking for an energy source thanks to which he will obtain enough power to defeat the Autobots, among whom Optimus obviously fights. The script, proposed through real-time sequences and non-interactive cutscenes, offers truly epochal moments. How did Optimus and Bumblebee meet? Who was Starscream before becoming Megatron's treacherous toady? When did Optimus earn the rank of Prime? Transformers: Battle for Cybertron answers all these questions in the dozen hours required to complete the only single-player mode available, consisting of ten chapters, five for the Decepticons and five for the Autobots. You are free to choose which faction you start with, but the events of the Autobot Campaign actually occur after the Decepticon Campaign. In each chapter the player is called upon to interpret one of the three pre-established characters, each with specific abilities, while the other two will be managed by the CPU. It is possible to face any chapter of the Campaign in cooperative mode, in which case obviously the other characters will be managed by as many players. The level design of the Campaign is more than satisfactory, generally each chapter requires the player to reach a certain location to press a switch or access a new area. However, the variety of situations is such as to make the process less repetitive than it seems; the type of enemies and firefights alternate enough to maintain a certain variety and the proposed bosses, albeit few, are extremely tough and imposing. The transformation into a vehicle, which can be activated by pressing L3, is not a feature linked only to some game sequences but is in fact an integral part of the action and is useful for covering long distances in a short time or quickly escaping enemy fire. The vehicular mode also has specific weapons and magazines that can be used to save the precious shots of our two main weapons: in fact, the game is stingy with ammunition, forcing the player to hit with greater precision, take advantage of the alt-mode to fire whenever possible and use the unlimited short-range weapon. Full of goodies and memorable sequences, such as the siege of Iacon or the escape from the prisons of Kaon, the Campaign of Transformers: The Battle for Cybertron is a true homage to the fans of the original series, but also a highly enjoyable game mode that complements the Excellent Multiplayer mode. Playstation 3 trophies Transformers: Battle for Cybertron offers 51 Trophies: 37 Bronze, 12 Silver, 1 Gold and 1 Platinum. Variety is guaranteed: some Trophies simply require you to complete the Campaign mode or win battles in multiplayer mode, to conquer others you will have to perform specific actions, killing enemies, both in Campaign and Multiplayer mode, by satisfying certain conditions. Multiplayer mode Transformers: The Battle for Cybertron also offers a full-bodied Multiplayer mode, perhaps not particularly original but certainly full of content and possibilities. The cooperative mode Escalation immediately catches the eye, inspired by the Horde mode of Gears of War: in Escalation up to three players can use the characters already present in the Campaign mode to face a series of waves of enemiesThere to increasing difficulty, trying to survive as much as possible. However, there is an extremely tactical component in Escalation mode, consisting of terminals that allow you to extend the map and buy weapons, ammunition and energy at the cost of ~credits~ released by killed enemies. The possibility of contributing to the purchases of teammates gives the Escalation mode a considerable depth, as we will be called to decide whether to keep the credits for ourselves or use them to help a companion: communication and collaboration are therefore fundamental elements to prevail. In addition to Escalation, Transformers: Battle for Cybertron also features the most typical game modes of the shooter genre. Unmissable is the free-for-all and team Deathmatch, which is accompanied by some fun modes such as the Code of Power and Conquest. However, it is the entire structure that makes the Multiplayer mode decidedly satisfying: each player can in fact ~create~ his own Autobot or Decepticon alter-ego by choosing from the ~frames~ of the game characters, slightly changing their color. It is possible to play games as four different ~classes~: Scout, Scientist, Leader and Soldier. Each class has unique weaknesses and advantages, which require a totally different approach. The Scientist, for example, is the only class capable of healing their teammates and darting in flight assuming the form of an aircraft. On the other hand, the Leader is much tougher than the Scientist and is able to boost the damage of teammates and use much more devastating weapons. Each class gains experience points from game to game, leveling up as in an RPG, thus acquiring new skills and bonuses to be equipped wisely in the available slots. Ample freedom is therefore guaranteed in customizing one's style of play, to which a system of ~perks~ similar to the one proposed in Call of Duty also contributes, defeating multiple enemies without being killed. In all this, the intuitive transformations into vehicles and aircraft fit perfectly, which guarantee exhilarating chases through the complex maps but also as spectacular as lethal firefights. That said, it must be said that the Multiplayer mode is not free from defects, especially of a structural nature, probably due to unsatisfactory server management. For example, the lack of a ~host migration~ which involves the sudden closure of a game when the host leaves it is really frustrating: you therefore find yourself suddenly thrown back to the main menu and goodbye to the adrenaline. Also, it is almost impossible to join games of contacts in the Friends List, who for some reason are inaccessible most of the time: i.e., you can join a totally random game in any mode but often you will not be able to play it with a friend . High-Moon Studios seems to have already taken action to correct these problems (for example, a sudden patch released a few days after the game's release corrected the loss of experience points in case the connection to the host crashes) but at the moment the Multiplayer mode of Transformers: Battle for Cybertron is as fun as it is buggy. More than meets the eye, or almost... It is particularly difficult to judge the technical department of Transformers: The Battle for Cybertron, as it is full of merits but counterbalanced by as many defects. The restyling carried out by the artists of High-Moon Studios was phenomenal and managed to bring all Transformers fans together, a more unique than rare event. The design winks both at the first generation of robots but also at the most recent animated series and films by Michael Bay. The ~new~ Transformers are mighty, and the vehicles they transform into are alien enough to remind us that we are not on Earth, but on Cybertron. Their polygonal representation thanks to the usual Unreal Engine is precise and massive, full of animated details such as panels and wheels that continuously move and shift during the action. The transformations are incredibly fluid and fast, it's a pleasure to literally become a robot or vehicle in an instant, in a harmony of panels and pieces that break down and reassemble. Sure, more enemy variety would have been welcome, but that's no complaint, thanks in part to the unwavering 30fps in every situation. As for the settings, the first thing to underline is that if you are looking for sun, sea and rainforests you will have to go elsewhere: Cybertron is a dark planet, composed mostly of metal and gas, but fortunately the variety of locationsion compensates for the remarkable chromatic monotony. Autobots and Decepticons will wage war between orbital stations, spaceships, ancient pipelines and ruined cities: some panoramas are literally breathtaking and the effort made in the reproduction of the capital Iacon, in which some chapters of the Campaign are set, is commendable; in cases like those, the developers of High-Moon Studios have managed to make the guerrilla feeling that characterizes the entire game very palpable. As already mentioned, however, there is no shortage of sore points, which above all concern the aforementioned lack of chromatic variety, which also extends to the customizable frames of the Multiplayer mode, but also and above all the quality of the textures, in low resolution and often rough and not very detailed , despite trying to mask these imperfections with a ~worn~ rendering of the robots' frames. It's really a shame because, especially during close-ups, they leave a lot to be desired. Finally, the audio sector: the music in Transformers: The Battle for Cybertron perform their duty without infamy or praise, accompanying the player during the Campaign or Multiplayer mode with appropriate and energy-rich tracks. On the other hand, the dubbing, completely in Italian, which makes use of the talent of actors such as Marco Balzarotti, former voice actor of Optimus Prime in Transformers Animated but also of other historical animated series, deserves praise, and which is always enjoyable, flawless.", "date": "2010-07-02", "grade": "8.0"}
