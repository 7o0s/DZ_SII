Obviously the multiplayer part is more complex to finish, as well as the 3 most profitable of the single player. To unlock them all, it will take several hours. Comment From the first minutes of the game we can see that Blitz: The League is neither a true sequel, nor a title developed with the Xbox 360 hardware in mind. Rather we can consider it as a port of the Xbox version released some time ago, with few changes to the game mechanics, and a rapid optimization of the technical sector. As far as the single player is concerned, the major flaw is represented by the poor AI implemented, on the other hand, those who have never played the previous title in the series, like those who are not familiar with the NFL, will be able to quickly learn the most suitable strategies to win, and therefore to have fun from the very first games. Thanks to the Clash-mode and the multiplayer mode, which eliminates the AI problems, Blitz: The League remains a sportsman to take into consideration, especially for those who want to get out of the box of a classic American football title. Pro Clash Mode Different from the classic NFL title Excellent multiplayer Cons Not quite next gen graphics Weak Artificial Intelligence Blitz begins with some very successful video sequences, which serve as an introduction to our arrival as a team guide. After some disappointments of the previous season, our team is being rebuilt practically from scratch, so it will be up to us not only to reshape a team and make it successful again, but also to choose starting staff and players. Basically you will have to choose which player will be the most representative: our choice is the most trivial one, i.e. the quarterback, what type of management our team's doctors will have to use during player training, whether our tactics book will be richer in strategies for racing or throwing, the type of stadium, and a few other options as well. No problem for those who don't like this kind of options and simply prefer to play football, the selection process is managed by a few screens, even if you select all the default choices without even reading the information boxes, you will remain competitive during the season. Intelligence? Artificial... The control method is rather simplified, even for those who are not familiar with the sport. The only exception are the combos that can be achieved through movements of the analog sticks during the Clash-mode, a feature that we will describe shortly. Blitz is divided into a series of championships, each consisting of 10 games plus the final, thanks to the completely arcade approach that is used, it is not difficult to get into the action, and have fun from the first matches. Unfortunately one of the major flaws of the title lies in the implementation of artificial intelligence. The matches vary from the too simple of the first championships, and relative victories with huge gaps in the scores, passing to the almost frustrating of the higher championships, in which certain teams systematically block our every racing action. An event which, combined with the frequent mistakes of our players, does not encourage career replayability. In Blitz the best tactic is always to be daring, even on fourth down in a practically impossible position, just as it is advisable to attempt 2-point conversions. For example, matches are often decided by constantly throwing our players in depth, using Clash Mode at the right time, and once the ball is hooked, just use the sprint button to get to the end zone almost undisturbed by opposing defenders. Clash & Unleashed The focus of the game mechanics is represented by a sort of bullet time, to be used in combination with particular blocks or feints to discard the opponent. These Clash-moments are regulated by an indicator that is recharged by performing the previously mentioned combos, and concluding the action positively. By activating the Clash mode, time slows down, we can aim for phenomenal launches, or make tackles well beyond the regulation limit, which often and willingly manage to injure the opponent. Even if it can make many football purists turn up their noses, this invention is effective in increasing the spectacularity of the action, as well as allowing Blitz: The League to differentiate itself from the other competitors of the lot. The problem is that on many occasions you go out of balancechange the balance of the game, especially given the ease with which the indicator is recharged during the attack phases. The maximum effectiveness of this feature can be found as soon as the indicator is filled, calling up the Unleashed mode. In these moments all our attack or defense actions will be performed in the best way, providing the possibility of making sidereal throws, or blocks worthy of a professional wrestler, making the opponent's opposition almost irrelevant. Among the most curious features in Blitz, in addition to the choice and customization of the Cheerleaders, we cannot fail to mention the intervention of doctors to treat injured players. The peculiarity of this implementation is the type and quantity of illicit substances that can be used. The more doping substances or steroids are used to speed up recovery times, the more the chances of being discovered at the controls and removed from the league increase, increasing the suspense at the end of the game. Blitz: The League is undoubtedly one of the most atypical transpositions of the football world: obviously you will never hear about the NFL in the game, since the related rights are in the hands of EA, on the other hand there will be references to the real world via the always useful fictitious names and brands. The soul of the game is not exactly attributable to the motto ~the important thing is to participate~: in Blitz the important thing is to win, by any means, including all the resources that have very little of a sport. We will find at our disposal medical staff equipped with prohibited substances, to heal faster or increase the performance of our players, we will see bonuses that can be won through particular combos during important actions, we will be able to place bets on matches, as well as in the interludes there will be some easy ladies costumes to revive the morale of the team. Technically speaking... From a technical point of view Blitz, with the exception of the CG videos and a good realization of the atmospheric effects, does not offer a rendering worthy of the Xbox 360. Models and textures are very reminiscent of those of the Xbox version, simply increased in resolution and partially retouched. Also as regards the animations, much praise cannot be wasted, excluding some defensive blocks, which are appreciated in the Clash-mode, remain rather anonymous. The frame rate remains stable as well as a good cleaning of the image, unfortunately they are not enough to improve the final result, which is absolutely not suitable for a next gen console. The section dedicated to audio makes a better impression, the soundtrack tracks are numerous, and the in-game effects are also quite accurate. Blitz has manual and packaging localized in Italian, unfortunately the rest of the texts and speech within the actual game have remained in English. For those who are familiar with football or even better, for those who have already played the Xbox version, it will not be a problem. For all the others it represents one of the major obstacles for the complete learning of the various strategies, game tactics, and selectable features. Online and Extras Through online support, Blitz: The League becomes much more palatable. Here you can use your own developed team in single player mode, and the problem of badly balanced AI disappears altogether. Leaderboards aside, 1vs1 matches are supported online, and there is support for any additional downloads. Unfortunately, championships or leagues cannot be held, but only quick or personalized clashes. A curious note can be seen in the extra section, where in addition to the various trailers and bonus material dedicated to the world of football, there is an atypical section called Cheerleaders. Through our performances on the playing field, it will be possible to unlock a series of high-resolution images taken from the photographic services of American magazines such as FHM, dedicated to the real NFL cheerleaders. No complete nudes mind you, but the shots are definitely worth a viewing.", "date": "2007-04-20", "grade": null}
