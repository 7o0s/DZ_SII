{"name": "Far Cry: Vengeance - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/far-cry-vengeance-recensione.html", "text": "The game Good old Jack Carver, star of the series since the very first episode, thinks he can hang out on a tropical islet for a while...until he finds himself, as usual, in trouble of enormous proportions. And so he has to go back to his old habits, take up the first weapon available and make a clean sweep of anyone pointing a rifle at him. There aren't many innovative elements in the plot of Far Cry: Vengeance, and watching the cutscenes that tell it is worth it only for the good level Italian dubbing... In any case, the game mechanics are always the same, that of a classic first person shooter which has its strong point in the possibility of using two weapons at a time, interfacing them with the Wii-mote / Nunchuck control system in the most natural way: you aim the viewfinder with the first one, but it is possible to fire with both by pressing their respective triggers. Each stage includes a certain number of missions to be completed, and where there are doubts about what to do, textual suggestions appear. This proves to be particularly useful after a few hours of play, as the settings become increasingly vast and sometimes the crux of the matter is somewhat lost. What is certainly not lost is the action, given the amount of enemies present in each location, which certainly sin due to the poor artificial intelligence but which make up for the lack with strategic positioning and good aim. You can pick up weapons dropped by eliminated opponents or find new ones inside houses and buildings, so it's hard to run out of nothing to fight with. The matter of medikits and armor is different, which at first are offered in an exaggerated way and then are abruptly cut, leaving us dry for a long time.

Fortunately, the Wii-mote's motion detection is now available. quite accurate. [/C] Technical realization As mentioned at the beginning, Far Cry: Vengeance is one of the titles that do not exploit the technical potential of the Wii. To be honest, it's probably the technically worst game available for this console so far, and there's really no reason to be happy about it. The graphics are mediocre, with low-level textures, very old-fashioned polygonal models and practically non-existent special effects, apart from the redundant ~glow~ effect applied in many situations. The sad thing is that so little can't move even at a constant 30 fps, because on more than one occasion the engine produces glaring uncertainties. The icing on the cake is represented by the cutscenes, really below the standards we have been used to for some years now. The sound sector also has obvious problems: on the one hand we have a good level of Italian dubbing, well acted, on the other hand we have normal sound effects and music that would be fine if it weren't for a bug that makes them ~jump~ often and willingly. The control system is the most successful thing about Vengeance. Using the Wii-mote and Nunchuck together, it is possible to move within the locations (proceeding standing, crouching or crawling  even if often and willingly it is not necessary to do so) in a rather rapid way and to fire promptly, given that the detection and viewfinder movement are well managed and are accurate enough. However, there are some flaws, represented by all the actions that can be done by moving the controllers: jumping (pulling up the Nunchuck quickly ...), using the machete (~hitting~ with the Wii-mote) and restoring energy by drawing to the rage gauge (by moving the Nunchuck in a sort of circle). There are games that have managed to take advantage of these movements well, above all Marvel: The Great Alliance. In Far Cry: Vengeance, such movements are poorly handled and even worse detected. Comment Despite being all too classic in its setting, Far Cry: Vengeance is a valid FPS and can be fun, above all thanks to its peculiar control system and its precision. Unfortunately, however, it is impossible not to take into account a really, really low-level technical realization, which deeply undermines the enjoyment of the experience. It's really strange that the developers of UbiSoft have not managed to do better, and we can only hope for a much higher level in the event of a possible next chapter in the Far Cry series on Wii. Pros: Precise control system Good quality Italian dubbing Quite playable Cons: Unwatchable graphics Some ~bugs~ in music playbackPoor enemy AI Primal instincts Far Cry: Vengeance offers a below-average longevity as regards the story mode, not so much for the number of levels as for the linear setting of the same and for the lack of competitiveness of the enemies. However, the game also features a multiplayer mode for two players, where you can engage in two different types of death matches. With the screen divided by a horizontal split screen, no further defections are noticed in the graphics, which move as if you were playing alone, but the visual cut makes life really difficult: you have half the vertical space to direct the Wii-mote , and this creates significant problems in the movement of the character. Although the Wii launch has been supported in an excellent way in terms of numbers and variety of genres, the same cannot be said of the average quality of the titles. And this is not an easily digestible situation, because if it is true that each new console requires a certain period of time for the development teams to learn to exploit its capabilities, it is also true that the Wii architecture takes up that of the GameCube and therefore it was reasonable to expect a quality level at least up to the latest releases of the previous Nintendo console. Zelda: Twilight Princess demonstrates this thesis, yet there are many games that do not do justice to the potential of the Wii, and Far Cry: Vengeance is certainly one of them. [C] By charging the rage bar, we will be able to enter a mode; ~primordial~... It happens quite often that you get behind the wheel of several vehicles. In the game you have at your disposal a good number of different weapons. [/C]", "date": "2007-02-20", "grade": null}
