Today one might think that these technical limitations are excessive, but at the time they represented a sort of virgin canvas on which to create infinite digital universes, things absolutely never seen before. It is therefore normal that the arcades of that era are close in atmosphere, and that their union can result in a project with a certain coherence, despite the historical heterogeneity of the series taken into consideration. If in the 80s someone had proposed a merger between Space Invaders and Arkanoid it would perhaps have seemed a sort of sacrilege, but today we can appreciate such an idea also thanks to the nostalgia filter to which the historical fanservice can appeal without having anything to be ashamed of. On the other hand, it is always Taito, and the operation recovers a good part of the original graphic style by inserting it in a decidedly modern and colorful context, perhaps even too much. Square Enix has built a sort of science fiction story around it that is not easy to justify, interpreting the horizontal arm of Arkanoid as a spaceship called Vaus and launched against hordes of invading aliens. Yes, apparently there is no redemption for the latter, so the Space Invaders are being revived in exactly the same role they had almost forty years ago. The intersection between the mechanics of the two games feels extremely natural, with the ability to freely move the bar at the bottom of the screen to bounce the shots fired by the aliens at themselves, meanwhile knocking down bricks and eliminating the invading formations before they can time runs out. Odds Nostalgia level over 9000 with Arkanoid vs Space Invaders! A finger life In a very Japanese style, a sort of young soldier guides us from mission to mission within a strange space war against alien invaders, in which a large number of different characters participate. By advancing in the game it is in fact possible to buy and unlock new heroes (about 40 at the moment), each one equipped with peculiar characteristics, special moves and also drawn from different series, such as the Bubble Bobble dragons, just to further increase the hodgepodge of memories this title draws on. Each level lasts a few tens of seconds, usually less than a minute, and the timer proves to be the main enemy to fight against, because to eliminate all the enemies on the screen it is necessary to act quickly in the first levels, and with ever greater precision in subsequent ones. Being able to count for most of the time only on the ricochet of the enemies' bullets against the bar, it becomes essential to be able to direct them in the most targeted way possible, and this proves to be more difficult than expected. The variables that intervene in the dynamics of the rebound, given the free movement of the Vaus, make the mechanics strongly linked to a certain randomness, therefore it is often easy to abandon oneself to chance, also given the presence of numerous bricks to be knocked down before being able to have free space to hitting enemies, which further amplifies this challenge. However, the collection of power-ups and the growth of special energy bars represent an element of strategic depth, allowing you to increase firepower and unlock special weapons, providing different and more complex solutions to be exploited to tackle the levels, including also the need to master some more advanced techniques such as push bouncing and other maneuvers. Arkanoid vs Space Invaders could perfectly accommodate the typical system of energy bars, advertising and various monetizations of free-to-play but fortunately Square Enix has decided to follow the classic path of the Premium game, with purchase price and go, and for this almost comes as a thank you, although the cost is not the lowest.", "date": "2017-05-25", "grade": "8.6"}
