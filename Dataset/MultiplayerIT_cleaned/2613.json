{"name": "Zone of the Enders", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zone-of-the-enders_a.html", "text": "One child against all The short preface introduces us to the new extraordinary adventure produced by Hideo Kojima (the one from Metal Gear Solid!), Zone of the Enders. In recent months, all the attention of the media and gamers has focused around the development of the game. The first images of the game gave us emotions that were difficult to explain except with the language of the heart. The dream of millions of boys, or those who are no longer boys, was coming true. Our robots, the invincible heroes that accompanied our childhood, the most spectacular battles, the fight for good... all of this is materialized in Zone of the Enders. Influenced, to the right extent, by the legendary Japanese productions of the various Grendizers, Daitarn 3, Mazinga Z and company, the story develops whose protagonist is Leo, a 14-year-old boy, the only survivor of the attack by the rebel Orbital Frames. It will be up to you to take the form of this miniature hero, who, needless to say, is the only one capable of saving Antilia. Now I'll fix you! A long introductory sequence, accompanied by an amazing soundtrack, immediately throws us into the heart of the action. Fleeing from the destruction of our home, from the killing of our friends, we almost by chance find ourselves in a hangar where, without even realizing it, we are thrown into the cockpit of Jehuty, majestic Orbital Frame. ADA, this is the name of the computer that moves the robot, leads us without too many words to the training that will allow us to face even the toughest fights. Action, lots of action and only action. Therein lies the core of the game. Although it is an RPG, the elements connected to it are reduced to a simple discovery of new weapons and features of Jehuty. We will find ourselves facing, through the numerous settings (all very similar to each other), hundreds of Orbital Frame enemies who will become increasingly fierce and resistant. Our task, let us not forget, is to save the colony, and it is certainly not the insidious enemy robots who prevent us from doing this, but the classic end-of-level bosses who will cross our path at regular intervals. The size and weapons of these alone are enough to make us desist from our heroic intent. Do not be afraid! It won't take long to get rid of them too. Viola... how I hate you! It is not the classic phrase of contempt towards Fiorentina, but instead refers to the bad girl of the game, Viola precisely. This nasty woman, after having killed our friends, will persecute us throughout the game with her beautiful big robot trying to eliminate us from the face of the Earth... or rather Jupiter. But as they say, ~women at the wheel are in constant danger~ (does this also apply to robots?), and so not even she will be able to stop this terrible boy. The first two hours of the game go by like a pleasure. The frenzy of the fights and the spectacular weapons at our disposal will give us healthy and very intense fun. Proceeding in our adventure, however, things begin to change. The plot, compelling but a little poor in content, fails to give us the variety of situations that we would have expected to find. Thus we will always find ourselves performing the same actions, with very few variations on the theme. That doesn't make it boring. Without words From a technical point of view, there are very few notes that can be moved to Zone of the Enders. The mechs are crafted with great detail. The settings, although not very varied, are distinguished by the sharpness of each element and by the almost complete interaction they offer. The explosions, as well as all the effects are simply screaming, such as to often leave us speechless. Everything moves at a stratospheric speed, taking advantage of a robust graphics engine, capable of guaranteeing an impressive frame rate. Even the sound excels, thanks to the splendid music (first of all the soundtrack), and the sound effects of great depth. In short, we are faced with an audio / video show that very few rivals can find among the titles available for PlayStation 2. Long live Z.O.E! Despite the drawbacks relating to the repetitiveness of the actions, Zone of the Enders rightfully enters the Olympus of the best titles for PlayStation 2. Z.O.E manages to reach levels of graphics, sound and playability of absolute excellence. Also, the relative brevity of the story (I recommendto play it hard), is definitely mitigated by the versus mode, made available once the game is completed, well done and which could have been a game in its own right. In conclusion, I would recommend the purchase of Zone of the Enders unreservedly to all mech enthusiasts. For all the others, in case the game alone is not attractive enough, perhaps it is useful to remember that the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo was also included in the package. Need anything else? pros: Splendid technical realization Guaranteed fun! Hideo Kojima doesn't miss a beat against: A bit repetitive Up there in space... Year 2172: Planet Earth has now become too small. Overcrowded, exploited to its depths, it is no longer a welcoming place for terrestrial species. Intrepid travelers leave for new worlds in which to build colonies, and where to start a new life. In one of these colonies, Antilia, there is a majestic station orbiting the planet Jupiter. Life flows smoothly, children play in the meadows and a light breeze shakes the branches of the trees.... Ooops! I forgot that we are under a dome that protects us from space. Let's do without the breeze... Suddenly a roar breaks the silence of the colony. An army of rebels aboard combat Orbital Frames (robots) attacks Antilia, to bring you death and destruction.", "date": "2001-04-03", "grade": null}
