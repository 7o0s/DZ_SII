{"name": "Shovel Knight Dig", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shovel-knight-dig-recensione.html", "text": "Yacht Club Games has managed to maintain a remarkable quality level for its Shovel Knight series, despite the numerous and risky digressions into areas that are also very different from the original one: as further proof of this ability, as we see in the review of Shovel Knight Dig, also the conquest of the roguelike (or rather of the roguelite) can be said to be complete. The game mechanic is apparently very different from that of the original, which was based on the tradition of the action platform in the style of the ~proto-metroidvania~, so to speak, but in truth you can find several points in common with the first chapter also in this new production. It is above all about sensations, linked to the movements of the protagonist and the way in which he responds to the controls, because for the rest the level design is profoundly different, as is the gameplay loop. This closeness is also surprising considering that Shovel Knight Dig is developed by Nitrome, but evidently Yacht Club has carried out a very careful supervision job given the feeling very similar to the original, despite the structural diversity. Also in this case it is a question of controlling the mythical blue knight armed with a shovel, able to jump, hit enemies and collect treasures, but inserted in a very different context from that of the origins: it could be defined as a vertical roguelite, in the sense that the everything takes place in a top-down motion, with the protagonist essentially digging his way to the bottom of a dungeon while simultaneously trying to collect treasures and defeat enemies. Although the idea may seem more limited compared to the classic setting of Shovel Knight, with the loop mechanism imposing the constant restart of the action which can become frustrating, the overall result is really successful and provides a new innovative push to the series in a new and pleasant direction. A knight with a shovel in a bottomless pit Shovel Knight Dig, a screenshot from the game In several respects, Shovel Knight Dig is a braver game than the original, because instead of relying on the nostalgic recollection of obsolete gameplay (albeit well reinterpreted in something original anyway) it brings together different elements to propose a rather unique game mechanic. The result could be seen as a cross between Shovel Knight, Dig Dug, Mega Man and a roguelike RPG dungeon crawler, but the whole manages to exceed the simple sum of the parts, also thanks to the usual irresistible characterization. All the gameplay is focused on the descent along dungeons that develop mainly vertically, with the protagonist intent on jumping on platforms and digging his way using the shovel, avoiding obstacles and fighting enemies but also trying to escape a sort of furious driller that he chases everywhere and forces him to act quickly. Which is not easy considering that the levels, generated in a procedural way, but following some specific patterns within the four progressive levels, always offer different possible paths. In addition to the constant descent, which then becomes a question of survival, the aim of the game is also collect gems found along the way, with collected treasure being a lingering item even after death. Shovel Knight Dig, the surface offers a moment of relaxation Precisely the conquest of the loot, indispensable for the progression of the character from game to game, becomes an important push in the search for new ways to go: while developing practically in the width of a screen, with vertical scrolling, the levels always offer different paths, from choose quickly but also with a certain logic, usually by contrasting greater risks with the possibility of obtaining better bonuses. In addition to this, it is also necessary to keep an eye on any secret passages (always suggested by small signs and scratches on the surfaces of the dungeon) that can lead to side rooms, containing particularly coveted treasures or NPCs with which to interact to trade or obtain bonuses. gems can be invested to restart from the point where we lose our lives or to buy upgrades that last from game to game, once we go back out of the well / dungeon and interact with the bizarre characters who populate the world on the surface. Permadeath, although partial as a rule in roguelites, can easily be frustrating for players less accustomed to this style of play, but Shovel Knight Dig always manages to remain rather balanced between rewards and punishments, resulting in a progression that keeps us eager to return to explore its underground.A well-kept retro style Shovel Knight Dig offers different variations to the scenarios, in the constant descent The graphic style fully incorporates what is now a trademark for the series and, despite the change of hand to Nitrome, we find here a remarkable coherence with the imagery built for Shovel Knight. On the contrary, in some respects Dig's 2D is even more accurate, rich and colorful, while remaining perfectly in line with the vintage reminiscences that are fundamental characteristics of the franchise. The style drawn in pixels is always very evident, but with a richness in the representation of sprites and animations that stands out perhaps more than seen in other chapters, probably also because the level design is simplified here, being generated in a partially procedural way, therefore relying on fixed elements arranged in different ways. The game performs well on iOS devices, where it is available through the Apple Arcade subscription and represents a really valuable introduction compared to what we have seen recently. There is some drop in frame-rate in the most agitated situations on older hardware, but nothing compromising. On the other hand, as expected, the control system via touch screen is problematic, which uses a mixture of virtual keys on the screen and swipes, without however ever being as convincing as a real controller, which is why the latter is highly recommended.", "date": "2022-09-30", "grade": "8.0"}
