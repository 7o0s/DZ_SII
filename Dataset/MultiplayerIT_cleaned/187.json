The beginning of the game is quite original: a nice questionnaire that recalls the most classic RPGs will establish, based on the answers, what kind of ~Pokmon~ you are, and later it will be possible to select an adventure companion from a dozen pocket monsters, including Pikachu. Once both choices have been confirmed, the story will begin: the protagonist, a human being, wakes up in the forest with the appearance of a pokmon. The reason for the transformation is unknown, and how can we become human again? The answers will come by continuing in the plot, but obviously don't expect metaphysical revelations: the incipit is just a pretext, the adventure really begins after a few seconds, when we will have to save a pokmon lost in an underground labyrinth. We will be joined by the teammate we had chosen, with whom we will form a ~rescue team~, a rescue team for little monsters in difficulty. Exciting, huh? In reality, the story is quite original for the world in which it takes place: no humans around this time, and therefore no tournaments, no medals, no pokballs. Set in the society of pokmon, Mystery Dungeon offers a new conceptual approach to the series, starting with the fact that this time it is possible to understand the language of pokmon. The problem is that the ingenuity of the plot is reflected in an apparently deep gameplay, but in reality decidedly incomplete. Basically, Mystery Dungeon resolves everything in a repetitive succession of missions, which will force us to explore large labyrinths in search of little creatures in danger, collecting objects along the way and, obviously, defeating the pokmon that will attack us. Unlike the traditional series, the fights in Pokmon Mystery Dungeon take place in a mix between turns and real-time: there is no transition between exploration and battle, just stand next to an enemy and call up the commands with the stylus or menu to attack the target. There is obviously no shortage of special attacks from the series, which can only be used a certain number of times, and the possibility of combining them to make them more effective is a welcome addition. On paper, the mechanics seem interesting, but the defects are quickly identified: our teammate is controlled by a decidedly mediocre artificial intelligence, which makes him easy prey and a decidedly useless aid, furthermore every fight is slow and cumbersome. even if a certain strategic ability is required to get out alive from the most difficult battles against, perhaps, multiple opponents. Mystery Dungeon intentionally proposes itself in this way: it is a ~dungeon-crawling~ type RPG dedicated to those who perhaps enjoy making a dungeon every now and then, improving their pokmon with the skills found, continuing the short storyline at will. Or maybe leaving the DS on in your pocket, hoping to meet another player who receives the wi-fi signal and welcomes our pokmon so that they can explore new dungeons and tell us about their adventures... um... yes.. . Certain. GBA to DS Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Team is, clearly, the twin of a title of the same name, however, subtitled Red Team, in pure Pokmon tradition. The difference this time is that while Red Rescue Team is available for Game Boy Advance, Blue Rescue Team is available for DS. That's all? Well, almost. Technically there's no change: the game looks exactly like the GBA on the DS, and that's not exactly a good thing. The chromatic variety makes Mystery Dungeon really pleasant to look at, but we soon notice an extreme repetitiveness in the realization of the environments and above all of the dungeons (which sadly are the focal point of the gameplay) and the pokmon sprites don't enjoy particularly brilliant animations. In general, graphically Mystery Dungeon recalls the GBA games of a couple of years ago, and although the realization is functional, acceptable on the Game Boy Advance, it is really depressing to see it revived on the Nintendo DS, without any additional features. Megaman Battle Network Double Team, port of the double Team Colonel / Team Neo version for GBA, was full of goodies made especially for the DS version, such as digitized speech, an introductory movie and an animated polygonal Megaman in the lower screen with menus navigable via touch-screen - all this in Mystery Dungeon was not even remotely thought of. The only added feature concerns the use of the touch-screen to control your pokmon and navigate through the menus, but this possibility soon proves to be uncomfortable and inaccurate, referring to the ancient directional cross. It's a pity, given that perhaps the infamous ~voices~ of the pokmon who became celebs could have been introduced on DSre with the cartoon... Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team will appeal to pokmon fans or those who enjoyed the original series but are perhaps looking for something different. However the decidedly reduced target does not justify a port of such a low caliber, Chunsoft has not in the least undertaken to make this cartridge attractive for DS owners, given that the differences from the Red Team for GBA are practically non-existent: the touch-screen is very uncomfortable , and the wireless option useless to say the least. How is it possible that a multiplayer mode hasn't even been thought of? All that remains is to wait for the local edition of Pokmon Diamond & Pearl, or perhaps Pokmon Ranger, which as a spin-off designed specifically for the DS certainly deserves more attention than this unsuccessful porting. Pros: Original concept Pokemon are always fascinating Cons: Crappy GBA port Technically mediocre No multiplayer mode Rescue Mission? A feature that is worth mentioning for its incomprehensible usefulness concerns Game Over: basically, if you are defeated in a dungeon, you can ask for help by turning off the DS, inserting our Red Team cartridge for Game Boy Advance, and going to the search of our Blue Squad team missing with GBA cartridge characters. Who would buy such a repetitive game in two versions and play it at the same time, frankly we would like to present it. Pokmon Mystery Dungeon is part of that group of products called a little improperly ~spin-off~: it has to do with Pokmon, but it is not part of the main series, the one that has been raging on Nintendo portable systems for a decade, enthralling millions of players. Nintendo's idea in general is to entrust the brand to a software house that can produce an ~interval~ title between the chapters of the mother series, to fill the void that is created, marching on one of the most famous franchises of the globe: Pokmon Colosseum, Pokmon Dash, Pokmon Ranger, Pokmon Pinball, and so on... countless ~minor~ productions based on the Pokmon phenomenon. Donuts, so to speak: some succeed with the hole, others don't. All in all Pokmon Mystery Dungeon is a decent donut, but Chunsoft probably wouldn't win at ~La Prova del Cuoco~...", "date": "2007-01-03", "grade": null}
