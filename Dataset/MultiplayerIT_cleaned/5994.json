{"name": "Commissariato sotto chiave", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/157041-commissariato-sotto-chiave.html", "text": "The additional content of Batman: Arkham Knight up to now have greatly disappointed fans of the Rocksteady Studios and Warner Bros. Interactive series. And this above all because many rightly expected much more in terms of content from the various DLCs, which had been announced with great fanfare a few months ago. In fact, exciting story missions, perhaps involving new super villains, at the moment we have seen practically nothing, while the character skins and alternative cars, plus the new drivable circuits for the Batmobile, have proved to be little. Who knows then that things will not start to change positively with the second additional content related to the story, this time dedicated to the character of Nightwing. The product has been available for a couple of days on PlayStation Network and Xbox LIVE, free for season ticket holders, at a price of 1.99 for everyone else. Entitled Police station under lock and key, the DLC offers an unpublished story set after the events narrated in Batman: Arkham Knight, precisely after the conclusion of the Knightfall protocol, within a scenario that provides for a single mission. This consists of trying to stop the Penguin's escape before it occurs through the use of a helicopter on the roof of the Gotham police station. Police Station Locked Up puts players in Nightwing's shoes against the Penguin A joke? From the outset, the new extra content almost seems like a joke: no introductory movie, no particular scene, perhaps with some reference to the events following the completion of the Knightfall protocol. The game begins with Nightwing who, after collecting an important clue in the very short prologue in Bldhaven, arrives in Gotham, where he makes radio contact with Lucius. It is therefore in this way that, in addition to learning the details relating to the mission, the player understands that he is in a moment following the ending of Batman: Arkham Knight. For the record, and without anticipating anything, at a certain point, in one of the radio communications with the CEO and President of Wayne Enterprises, we will learn some nice news concerning Barbara Gordon and Tim Drake. Returning to talk about the DLC, the ultimate goal is, as mentioned at the beginning, to prevent the Penguin from escaping from the prison of the Gotham City police station, helped by his henchmen. The latter must then be shot down one after the other before getting to stop the super-villain. The playability is obviously that of the original title, with Nightwing offering a set of moves not unlike those of Batman, obviously customized according to his skills and gadgets, to be combined with the usual stealth techniques and with the various forms of KO silent, and to be alternated with open face attacks depending on the area. Once the work is completed, Batman's former sidekick must then go up to the terrace, the same one that users have come to know in Arkham Knight. In a situation analogous to the one that in the main adventure saw The Bat fight against the Arkham Knight's men who were trying to break into the police station, Nightwing must eliminate the last members of the Penguin's gang before they let him out of the police station. elevator he was stuck in. A far from difficult undertaking, especially if it comes to the clash with the immediate possibility of performing a multiple Terror KO to eliminate half of the attackers. That's all: once you've freed yourself from the classic pair of intermediate bosses, the guys with swords and shields, as well as another five-six armed with clubs or with bare hands, a short cutscene starts that closes the story (well yes, no fight with Mr. Cobblepot), leaving a sour taste in the player's mouth and the feeling that at any moment a sign with the words ~you're on Seriously!~ The disappointment, in fact, is great for those who, after the DLC with the story of Batgirl (which we, apart from the duration, had in any case quite liked as a whole), and the subsequent accompanying ones, hoped to have something from Warner Bros. decidedly more full-bodied in terms of duration and content. Instead, if possible, it was done worse, with an even shorter product than the previous extra dedicated to the stories of Arkham, and with little bite in terms of gameplay. The overall duration of the mission is, at least for more experienced users, just over a quarter of an hour, net of a couple of deaths due to distraction towards the end. Considering that the DLC offers only one trophy that is unlocked on the first pass, and that there are no objects to collect or easter eggs to discover, there is not even an extra incentive to replay it at least a second time and make it light.longest-lived. In short, Commissariat under lock and key represents another missed opportunity for the developer and publisher to further expand the Arkham universe. Instead, as it was conceived, it becomes only the latest exponent of the questionable aptitude for easy profit on additional content.", "date": "2015-10-06", "grade": null}
