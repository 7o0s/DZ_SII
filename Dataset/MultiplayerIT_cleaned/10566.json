Three ways of seeing the world and thinking about war that represent the extremes of the three great movements that underlie modern society. Axis, Allies and Comintern, the Communist International. Only a few countries are already gathered under the aegis of these three factions and they are the ones that cannot do without them in order not to undermine the foundations of history. The other nations, a hundred countries assorted in resources and philosophy, are contested militarily and politically. Indeed, it is possible to use diplomacy to convince governments to join the faction we have chosen while artificial intelligence will take care of diplomatic relations with the others. Obviously, this possibility too must take into account the historical events that will punctually take place and will maintain a certain ~path~ on which events can proceed. Despite this the player maintains a fair amount of control over what happens and for a history buff it can be interesting to see what could have happened if Holland or France had resisted the German invasion. In short, the attempt is to allow a fair choice while maintaining a certain historical coherence that allows you to shore up the gaming experience with events that really happened without this causing inconsistencies. An understandable choice considering that a large part of the appeal of Hearts of Iron III is linked to the atmosphere of the period and to the events that shaped the fate of the planet. Just complex Hearts of Iron III is an authentic strategy game. A huge gameboard full of provinces, regions, nations and alliances that fight each other along a staggering number of borders. There is talk of over ten thousand areas that frame all the capitals of the world or almost. The initial menu offers us the possibility to start the campaign from specific moments ranging from the period before the war up to the last year of the conflict. It is also possible to customize the campaign or choose one of the four pre-set scenarios. Fortunately for us, the classic and complex nature of the title did not prevent the Paradox guys from making access to the game mechanics less elitist and cumbersome. The interface is the same as Europa Universalis, much more rational and easy to navigate than the previous ones, and also for Hearts of Iron the time has come to adopt three-dimensional models for troops and vehicles, a factor that makes reading the interface much more pleasant and understandable. map. Furthermore, with the new interface it becomes much less tiring to manage financial contracts, loans, production capacity, energy resources and the possibility of providing reinforcements to your troops. Diplomacy, research, espionage and politics also return, completing a potentially terrifying picture for anyone who is not a micromanagement fanatic. Potentially we said, because Paradox allows us to delegate the responsibility of each individual sector to artificial intelligence. The sustainable lightness of artificial intelligence The most intriguing aspect to manage is certainly the research that traces the history of sometimes interesting, sometimes terrible discoveries that play a fundamental role in the unfolding of the war. On the contrary, intelligence seems to be too careless and too effective, so much so that in the long run it seems more like a waste of time than entertainment. Among other things, when the automatic management of the AI intervenes, the actions of the spies seem to have better effects, a factor that further demeans their role. On the production side the artificial intelligence does a magnificent job and saves us from going crazy in the myriad of values and variations. A task that is sometimes too demanding even if the control of the production factors is one of the points that make this series unique. On the contrary, internal politics are simple and easily manageable. Each character grants some bonuses to production, armies, the economy and other aspects of the game and also influences the consensus. [img id=290534 pos=d ,=not_so_big text=] Obviously it is possible to replace the characters in charge to change bonuses and increase consensus which, together with war victories, increases the unity and therefore the health of a nation. But the management depth of the Paradox game goes far beyond that. For example, producing a large number of units of a single product will allow workers to accumulate experience related to the assembly of the object, increasing the production speed. Another variable is represented by the climate which not only influences the condition of the troops but also theproductivity of the affected regions. A fundamental factor given that without supplies it is impossible to support the troops engaged at the front. Over ten thousand zones From a strategic point of view Hearts Of Iron III remains a beast to tame. The possibilities and battlefronts on which to apply them are countless. The impressive number of territories, almost 15,000, and of troops to manage forces the player to pay close attention to how to deploy the troops, so as not to leave any gap for the enemy. Fundamental to this aim is the use of the air forces which can carry out reconnaissance, defend a portion of the sky or bomb enemy troops or strategic installations. The dominion of the seas also maintains a fundamental importance, especially for England and the United States who find themselves separated by the conflict and separated from each other. Unfortunately this seems to be the only heavy Achilles heel of artificial intelligence, with entire fleets that are sometimes sent to fight without worrying about defending the mother country or the most important routes. Thankfully in most cases the inconvenience does not occur, especially after the 1.1 patch, and it seems that the ground troops are completely immune to these madness attacks. The management of the land troops is as complex as it is simple: each unit has strengths and weaknesses to be used according to the case and a set of tasks to be performed automatically, to which is added the troop ranking system for which the survival of the units it allows them to increase in degree and therefore in effectiveness. It is possible to send a general to conquer a front and all his troops will follow him, it is possible to directly control one or more contingents or give orders to the single troops that are part of the contingents and it is also possible to delegate the management of the troops to intelligence artificial. Obviously, even if the supreme domain remains in the player's hand, this last possibility is only recommended for those who made a mistake in buying the game but intend to finish it anyway. A handful of graphics, plenty of sound. The graphic upgrade is a big step forward for the series even if the few polygons used for the three-dimensional component are certainly not a miracle. Paradoxically, the transition to 3D has instead dramatically increased glitches, bugs and hardware requests. Over-increasing game speed appears to be a major factor in the incidence of graphical glitches and crashes. Unfortunately the first patch didn't produce great improvements from an optimization point of view but it is foreseeable that these problems will be solved as soon as possible. The restyling of the icons and menus is impeccable starting from the unit's micro menu which allows you to automate upgrades and reinforcements up to the global interface which is slim and compact but also extremely clear. The sound system welcomes us with the classic Cavalcade of the Valkyries and worthily accompanies us along our military campaign with symphonies, fanfares and military marches of extraordinary quality. The sound effects do just enough to frame what is happening on the table.", "date": "2009-08-26", "grade": "8.4"}
