This is not to say that with a traditional pad it would not have been better, mind you, but between double jumps, walljumps and mid-air kicks, the player moved from one level to another with a reactivity and coordination that few platformers on devices mobile can boast. Many fans therefore hoped that the small Canadian team, starting from such a solid and appreciated base, could offer a much richer title in terms of content and ambitions. With a decision that predictably dissatisfied some of the users, the small group led by Derek Doucett took the motto ~the winning team doesn't change~ literally and returned to the App Store with a sequel that smacks a lot, perhaps too much, of more. of the same. Change of look For League of Evil 2, Ravenous Games has teamed up with graphic designer Jeff Hangartner and his label Bulletproof Outlaws. It is not the first time that the two indie realities have collaborated, although last year they made Elusive Ninja, an unknown and very mediocre mobile project. It must immediately be said that the main novelty of League of Evil 2 is represented by the aesthetic restyling by Hangartner, who has brutally replaced the characteristic pixel art of the original with lively and colorful cartoon graphics. At this point, a parenthesis should be opened immediately: it is clear that with this move Ravenous Games wanted to bring both the fans of the first chapter closer together, and above all a user with a less refined palate and who can hardly digest excessively retro aesthetics, yet, more than an evolution, this drastic drift towards vector graphics without any bite represents in our opinion an unfortunate step backwards. The same goes for the soundtrack, which has abandoned the chiptune songs to be consistent with the visual component. For the rest, like it or not, League of Evil 2 is exactly the same and identical platform game appreciated last year, made up of small levels full of traps to avoid and enemies to punch in the face. Between huge hammers, deadly spikes, laser cannons and heavily armed soldiers, the aim is once again to jump from one platform to another trying to reach the other end of the scenario as quickly as possible, perhaps collecting the hidden briefcase to get the highest rating. While never slipping into frustration, the player soon finds himself repeating the same level over and over again, dying and starting over at a much more frequent pace than seen in the first League of Evil. In fact, while on the one hand the design of the levels and traps is now more sadistic than in the past, on the other hand the introduction of new dangers, such as laser barriers and heat-seeking drones, make things much more complicated. The goodness of the controls has fortunately remained intact, although the impression is that the beefy protagonist is now slightly faster and less glued to the ground, an element which, as it has reactivity and control, predictably has its pros and cons. The only criticism from this point of view we would have made to some unfortunate changes in the double jump, but in the course of our test and following the complaints of the players Ravenous Games hastened to publish an update that brings everything back to how it was before . If we exclude the graphic restyling for scenarios and cutscenes and a handful of alternative costumes for one's alter-ego, the only other relevant novelty is represented by the battles with the bosses that occasionally break up the action along the five different settings that make up the 100 levels currently available: a pity that these clashes are so slow, repetitive and not very engaging as to represent a useless and annoying drop in pace.", "date": "2012-03-15", "grade": "7.0"}
