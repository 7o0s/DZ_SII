Infinite credits, very close checkpoints and above all the main characters evidently unbalanced in the strength or resources available risk transforming any title into a walk between one scene in computer graphics and another. This leveling down has led to the paradox according to which, in the presence of a slightly more difficult game than the average, we find ourselves having to speak of ~risk of abandonment~ by the player and, in some cases, even of frustration. Hiroshi Iuchi, the creator of Kokuga, certainly didn't understand the trend of the moment and proposed a title that, as we will see, doesn't really wink at anyone. Kokuga doesn't shine for its originality but it will delight old fans of scrolling shoot'em ups A tanker for a friend In Kokuga therefore you will find yourself, just like in the old days, alone against everyone to sow chaos and destruction. An unspecified galactic war, unleashed by two rival civilizations, is the faded context in which the game events take place. Obviously, no thinking human would dream of reading the English subtitles of the Japanese text that tells the story so, once you quickly press the Start button, you will see the game menu, with options, single mode and the two multiplayer modes co-op, one for four players all equipped with the regularly purchased title and another, which will require more time and some more limitations, always for four players but with only one copy of the game shared at the moment. The purpose of the twelve missions, as already mentioned, is always the same, that is to make a clean sweep of every structure or enemy vehicle present. A simple concept, however, declined not with an invincible super robot or with infinite deadly weapons, but with a self-propelled tanker, a sort of modern tank, massive but slow, equipped with a simple and solitary turret capable of firing a single shot at a time. Poorly armed, certainly not fast and, icing on the cake, with totally manual aiming: these are the characteristics of your vehicle, aggravated if you like by the discreet general ugliness. And yet, the feeling of disadvantage (which is not actually a sensation but almost a certainty) is the spring that can, under certain circumstances, unleash the true player's adrenaline, the one buried under layers of dull Artificial Intelligences and dull fights. more than symbolic. Surrounded by enemies of all kinds and workmanship, better armed and sometimes even faster in movement, the clash becomes a game of chess, the result of a necessary tactics if you don't want to die in seconds. The pace is necessarily slow, due to the shortage of fire from the supplied weapon; but in this case it is strategically necessary to keep it low, precisely in order to be able to face the enemies one at a time, calmly, dodging their blows and counterattacking with the right timing. The control system helps in these maneuvers up to a certain point, since it relies on the analog stick or digital cross for movements, on the shoulder straps for turret orientation and on the B button to shoot; therefore no touchscreen or accelerometers, no facilitation, here we shoot hard the old-fashioned way! The 3D effect Given the almost retro nature of the gameplay and the focus on destruction, we didn't expect Kokuga to have a particularly brilliant and effective 3D effect. In light of the facts, the forecasts are spot on, but in any case the ~dark~ depth effect in some situations, which seems to envisage an intergalactic abyss under the game plan, manages to give a pinch of extra visual emotion. Your ticket please! Given what has been said up to now, the Kokuga player almost seems like a masochist ready to suffer, with no way out. Fortunately, even in this case the hope of help can peep out, without warning and in a totally causal way, in the form of bonus tickets to be spent during the missions. In fact, the lower touch panel of 3DS is home to four virtual cards, each with a particular bonus function for defense or attack. The player is given free choice of use, simply a touch on the chosen one is enough. As mentioned, however, the tickets cannot be chosen and are replaced at random: it will therefore be luck to make appear, depending on the case, an enhancement for the shield, an extra momentary barrier, a laser ora very powerful bomb, double or triple cannon and so on. The experience will guide the player in the most suitable selection from time to time among the tickets present, contextualized to the level of play: playing with a very powerful weapon in a moment of calm, for example, could cause a resounding defeat even with the shield at maximum of the power. The available resources have to be optimized up to the highlight of Kokuga, i.e. the extraordinary end-level boss battles. Extraordinary, it should be specified, not because they represent who knows what revolution; on the contrary, they are super ~final monsters~, as they were once called, to be faced by discovering the proposed routines every time, dodging successive blows and attacking in moments of discovery. Extraordinary, because authentic, truly fought and because if you die, you have to start all over again. In this riot of explosions and war, there is a certain repetitiveness in the level design and sound, but it matters up to a certain point, as does the not excellent general graphic quality. What matters is that, finally, victory is not a duty, but you have to really sweat it out.", "date": "2013-07-25", "grade": "8.0"}
