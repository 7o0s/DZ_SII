{"name": "Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/marvel-ultimate-alliance-3-the-black-order-recensione.html", "text": "Video game tie-ins inspired by the Marvel universe are nothing new and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance series dates back as far as 2006, or 2004 if you consider X-Men Legends the real progenitor. Although all these years have passed, the right time had come to resurrect that old brand. Cinecomics have been very strong for some time now; Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame grossed zillions of dollars, fielding a number of superheroes that had never been seen before, except in some crossover comics. In short, it was logical that someone would take advantage of this propitious moment to take the path of video games once again, but no one expected that it would be Nintendo, together with the Japanese developer Team Ninja, and exclusively for Switch: a bizarre combination that raised more than one eyebrow. And while all eyes turned to the Avengers project by Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics, which later revealed itself with a controversial trailer during the recent E3, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 took on ever more convincing contours, until it became an unmissable title for anyone who loves comics and film of the House of Ideas. All against the Black Order That an expert screenwriter wrote the story of the campaign is understood within minutes. Marc Sumerak, already known for having worked on famous magazines such as Avengers, Fantastic Four and Thor, knows and understands the characters and their motivations perfectly: the dialogues are flowing, full of quotes and references to events that fans remember well, and the author wastes no time explaining who these heroes are and why they know each other, except for the concise and ironic descriptions that accompany each entry into the scene. Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 assumes that it's a fan holding the controller, not necessarily just from the comics or movies, although the game is mostly inspired by the former: although it exists in a universe of its own, the title Team Ninja draws heavily on decades of paper stories both in the narration and in the design of the characters. This makes each famous hero or foe instantly recognisable, but the cartoonish style ensures that each one has an authentic and decidedly cartoonish personality. The story begins with the Guardians of the Galaxy detecting a very powerful energy signal coming from a Kree spaceship: Star-Lord and the others discover that Ronan and Nebula have found the Infinity Stones, and while fighting to get hold of them they are interrupted by the Black Order of Thanos, a team of alien assassins who intend to bring the gems to the Titan. In the commotion, however, the gems go missing and end up on Earth. Having warned the Avengers, a treasure hunt begins that will bring together the most powerful heroes on the planet: even the worst super villains are looking for the gems that cannot and must not fall into the wrong hands. In the end, the gems are a pretext for heroes and villains to meet and collide, but Sumerak writes a flowing and not at all forced script that leads the protagonists from one chapter to another, passing through the most famous scenarios of the Marvel imaginary: the Raft, the X-Men mansion, Wakanda, Asgard, the Dark Dimension, and so on. Divided into a total of ten chapters, at the standard difficulty level - there are initially two, but another higher one is unlocked - the campaign is completed in about ten hours or so. There are no dead moments or interludes. The campaign is like a long film in which we gradually recruit more and more characters, to the point that already halfway through you can draw on a roster of twenty heroes out of the thirty-two available at the conclusion, to which are added four more to be unlocked with the Infinity trials : Elektra and Magneto, but we already knew this from the beginning, and two more surprises that we don't want to reveal here. In some moments of the game, you catch your breath, near a checkpoint, and you can talk with the heroes nearby: they are short exchanges that offer some more details on the story and the characters and that tell small but interesting anecdotes. The most interesting thing, however, is the way in which Sumerak manages the narration: rather than crowding the shots with the boundless roster of characters, the Cleveland screenwriter chooses the most significant ones in the context of the moment and, in doing so, manages to give space to practically every hero, both through the cutscenes and through the dialogues during the action. The direction is intelligent, self-deprecating and well-kept: it really seems to be playing one of the best superhero crossovers ever. The synergy of heroes Despite all the trailers and information spread in the past months, up to thelast minute it was hard to pinpoint this Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3. An action game? An action RPG? A strange hybrid like the previous iterations? Joy-Con in hand, within a few minutes we had no more doubts: the new Team Ninja title is, essentially, a scrolling fighting game of those which, played in company, seal unforgettable evenings. The mechanisms are immediate and intuitive, you learn to play literally in seconds. Each hero has a light attack, which can be chained into quick and effective combos, and a heavy attack, more damaging but also slower, which mainly serves to reduce the stun meter of some enemies: once it is reset, these Opponents are paralyzed and take more damage for a few seconds. One key allows you to jump - and fly, in the case of certain heroes - and another to parry enemy blows: by holding down this last button while moving the analog stick, our hero will dodge in the direction concerned. So far everything seems very simple, and in fact it is, but then the special moves take over to complicate the dynamics a bit. Each hero learns up to four of them, one every five levels, and although they are customized, these moves fall into several categories. Executing them is very simple, just hold down the backbone R and press the front button assigned to each move. It is not possible to use them indefinitely, since they consume a special indicator that regenerates over time or with the blue orbs that drop some enemies. A last yellow indicator is charged by attacking and, once at most, allows the use of the Extreme Technique, practically a spectacular and devastating area super move, which moreover can be launched simultaneously by multiple heroes. As we said, they are simple dynamics that are assimilated in a few minutes and translate into extremely scenographic fights that recall the deeds of our favorite heroes on paper and in the cinema: Cap throwing his shield, Iron Man firing missiles and proton beams on the right and left, Spidey swinging and ensnaring enemies in his webs, Hulk smashing and so on. The huge roster of heroes - to which others will be added in the autumn with the DLC already on sale - guarantees an already wide variety of situations and techniques, but it is destined to improve with a very important mechanic which, as the campaign progresses, it becomes fundamental to learn: synergy. Some heroes, in fact, can combine their special moves to inflict greater and different amounts of damage. Doctor Strange can project his Flames of the Faltines on the vortexes of Storm or Star-Lord to generate real fiery tornadoes, while Iron Man can shoot his beams at Captain America's shield who will think of deflecting them against surrounding enemies such as in the iconic scene from the Avengers movie. There are hundreds of combinations that don't just add up the damage of special moves, as you may have guessed, but in some cases also change their elemental attributes. In this sense, it becomes more and more fun not only to change the heroes to learn how to play them, but also the combinations of the team, made up of up to four characters, to take advantage of the best synergies depending on the situation. Co-op: guaranteed fun Using synergies is very easy even when playing alone. There are two ways, actually. The first occurs whenever a nearby hero uses a special move that can be combined with one of those characters you are controlling, and which you can change at any time by pressing the corresponding buttons on the left Joy-Con: for a short moment, the The interface will prompt you to press the A key and if you are quick enough, your hero will use the appropriate special move together with his ally. The other way instead allows you to decide for yourself when to use a synergy and with whom. Just press the ZR key to see what special moves you can currently combine with nearby heroes, then press the corresponding key to unleash hell upon your enemies. The artificial intelligence, actually very good, will always respond to your orders and in this way you will be able to shred the enemies or the special barriers that guard chests and other collectibles and which can only be knocked down by specific synergies. It is clear, however, that the synergy in single player is not nearly as satisfying as that in multiplayer, especially if you are playing together with someone who is physically next to you, whether he is playing on the TV screen or on his Switch connected to your in wireless. Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 can be gAlso played online, but we haven't had a chance to test this feature; having said that, it was invaluable to face the more difficult Infinity tests by perfectly coordinating the attacks, perhaps by placing a nice fiery tornado in the point where a new boss would appear a moment before it appears, or by splitting up to revive the fallen comrades - you can do a maximum of three times per fight, and not always - while our partner keeps the enemies busy. To make the experience even more fun, we think about the way in which not only the various stages are designed, which sometimes require the resolution of simple environmental puzzles, but above all the battles with the bosses themselves which, in terms of dynamics, are very reminiscent of those of MMORPGs , complete with telegraphed attacks to dodge and weak spots to hit at the right time. GDR dynamics However, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 is not just an ignorant scrolling beat 'em up, as it includes some rather simple but significant RPG dynamics. We have already told you about it in a special special a few days ago, but let's sum up the issue. In summary, you will have to manage essentially four RPG components. The first is level up, and that's an easy one: your heroes gain experience points and level up, by doing so they learn new special moves and unlock new Iso-8 slots. They also earn Technique Points that you can spend together with other consumables to enhance individual special moves: fortunately, you can also reset them and change the distribution at any time. Unfortunately you will have to grow each character individually, but luckily there are ESP cubes that help fill these gaps and that the game generously lavishes both in the campaign and in the Infinity trials. Then there is the Alliance Boost, accessible from the laboratory, where you can spend the earned Boost Points, together with the credits, to unlock various passive bonuses that will affect the whole team, regardless of the heroes you have chosen. Considering that certain combinations of heroes guarantee further bonuses, it is important to choose the path to follow carefully, because the initial hexagon branches into further hexagons which allow you to orient more precisely the choice of the attributes you intend to improve. Staying on the subject of attributes, the last RPG component is made up of the Iso-8, special crystals that you will begin to find after a couple of chapters of the campaign and that you can equip as if they were normal accessories in an RPG. They improve the specific attributes of the heroes or guarantee bonuses of various kinds, but above all they can be broken down into primary materials which you can then consume to enhance your favorite Iso-8. Ultimately, the RPG component of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 becomes more and more interesting as you progress through the game, but you don't need to master it perfectly to complete the campaign. However... The Infinity Trials The RPG components take on a much greater relevance when you decide to face the Infinity trials, essentially the endgame of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3. You will unlock them in different ways: automatically by completing the chapters of the campaign, by finding the breaches in the stages or some hidden special chests. Accessible from S.H.I.E.L.D. checkpoints or from the main menu, the Infinity trials re-propose some objectives of the campaign, which can be brief glimpses of stages or real bosses, with very specific rules and variants: sometimes you will have to fight alone, in some cases you will have to defeat a certain number of enemies in the shortest possible time, sometimes you will face two or more bosses together at the same time, perhaps losing health points over time or inflicting damage only with a certain type of attack. The purpose of the Infinity Trials is pretty obvious: they not only grant longevity that extends beyond the campaign, but also allow for lower-level heroes to grow with or without XP cubes. They also unlock numerous rewards: Iso-8 crystals, unlimited ESP cubes, illustrations and information to consult in the appropriate gallery, alternative costumes for the various heroes and even some more playable characters such as Magneto or Elektra. Each Infinity test also offers up to three specific objectives and by accumulating a certain number of successes, other costumes are unlocked. Not all Infinity tests are available immediately: you will have to find some of them, then you can only face them if you have passed at least one of the adjacent tests, going up a kind of pyramid from the easiest to the most difficult. It is clear that the structure implies a certain level of rip", "date": "2019-07-19", "grade": "8.5"}
