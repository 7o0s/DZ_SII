The city that forms the backdrop to the entire title is a real concentration of restaurants and gastronomic venues to be discovered. The mission is simple: explore it to the end, cross the six districts that compose it (each depicting a state of the world) and demonstrate their culinary skills. As in a sort of ~game of the goose~, the players (two to four) roll the dice and start their journey, box after box, on the city map; the stations where you can come across are many: from the Greedy Surprise (a sort of bonus) to its opposite, the Spoiled Food, passing through the Taste test in the dark, in which bonuses and penalties are attributed by fate, choosing a card from the deck. However, the most interesting stops are quite different: those of the Maestro di cucina competitions, in which two competitors challenge each other in a culinary skill competition with the aim of obtaining a recognition star, and the Arcade competitions, authentic frenetic mini-games always set in the cuisines of the world! In this gastronomic journey, players will gradually unlock more recipes, which can then be found individually in the Quick Play mode, and will get star points as recognition. But if that weren't enough, to celebrate the glory of the winner, here is the last section, dedicated to the ranking of the best chefs. So, let the challenge begin! Challenge to the stove The element of the challenge is the absolute protagonist of the title: here the player will have to demonstrate his culinary talent... and his ability to sabotage the opponent's recipes! The structure of the duels is well articulated, with an introductory panel which explains the main steps of the recipe and the movements to be performed with the WiiMote to complete the various actions. After the initial ~smattering~, you can finally start. A peculiarity that immediately catches the eye is the presence of a time bar: it is not in fact sufficient to execute the commands in the best way, but it is necessary to do them with certain times. iare. Based on the precision of the individual steps, a score will then be assigned, which can be viewed in real time in a pie chart in which each color corresponds to a specific value. Once the recipe is complete, the chef of the district will judge the challenge and award a reward ~star~ to the chef who has obtained the most points. However, the mode of the Arcade Races is quite different: the various mini-games offered are characterized by small and fun objectives, all based on the speed of the individual players. An example of this is the ~ravioli competition~, in which the cooks will have to find the most delicious of the ravioli, the one with the spinach filling. Or again, the fun ~cake throwing~ team challenge: while a player tries to keep his tray in balance, the teammate must defend his position from a real attack... caloric! As they say, in war and in the kitchen, anything goes! Only in company The structure of Cooking Party, which is somewhat reminiscent of the old board games, is absolutely spot on and the gastronomic journey through the streets of a city is an excellent pretext for meeting and unlocking the many recipes on offer. The game mode is also a lot of fun and the use of the WiiMote as if it were a real kitchen utensil, even if it has already been seen in other well-known titles, never tires. Unfortunately, however, all this is overshadowed by the only great flaw of the game: the need for at least two. In fact, if you face the challenge alone, only the ~Quick Game~ section will be playable. Since most of the recipes are unlocked in the multiplayer race, the quick play section will contain only a very few executable recipes. It is therefore clear how you enter a vicious circle: if you don't have a partner to play with, goodbye culinary challenges! Having said that, the game is instead perfect for two or more people: simple and captivating graphics, nice characters and cartoon-like settings make the title a winner. The difficulty is minimal (the movements to be performed are very simple and often, it must be admitted, repetitive), but the real challenge is actually what is created between the different participants. In short, much more satisfying in company!", "date": "2010-01-11", "grade": null}
