To achieve this goal, our hero will be forced to face levels full of pitfalls and enemies, in the meantime collecting flowers to offer as a gift to his beloved. So let's see if, in addition to the feeling, the Namco Bandai product manages to field a sufficient dose of fun. Bread and Tulips The thing that immediately strikes you about Rakoo's Adventure is the long one-off loading necessary for the download and installation of all the game elements excluded from the weight of the application downloadable from the App Store: a vice, that of the above average waiting times , which the title also carries with it later, taking into account a few seconds too many every time you switch from one stage to another. Speaking of the more strictly playful component, Rakoo's Adventure borrows numerous elements from various leading exponents of the ~endless runner~ category, although it is not part of it in all respects. So here is that the protagonist moves forward independently, with the user having the task of moving him along the game plan simply by dragging a finger on the touch screen: a procedure necessary not only to avoid the obstacles and opponents that appear along the path, but also to define a trajectory that allows you to collect as many flowers, medals and bonuses as possible. At the end of each stage, in fact, a score is obtained that takes into account all these factors, which is then converted into coins to be spent to purchase a vast series of objects that can vary from simple visual frills (such as hats and various costumes) to power -up capable of greatly facilitating the progress of the match. In short, the Old Skull Games title brings into play all the right elements of the modern mobile game, showing off a mannerism that brings both positive and negative aspects with it. Starting from the first ones, Rakoo's Adventure is undoubtedly a well-made game, starting with a truly excellent graphic component: the tasty cartoon style of the characters is accompanied by very fluid and varied animations and vibrant and bright colours, for a product which can be among the best two-dimensional cosmetics recently seen on iOS. Nothing to say even on the design front: the scenarios are built with skill, and there is no shortage of bonus stages and a fair number of upgrades that modify the gameplay to some extent, giving a pinch of variety to the whole. Rakoo's Adventure is an honest title that lacks the personality to aim for the top of the category With such a series of assists, the pleasure of the playful experience comes almost by itself: Rakoo's Adventure runs off as smooth as oil, thanks also to a control system that is precise enough and to a duration of the perfect level for quick games in time scraps. All nice except that the Old Skull Games product struggles a lot to show an iota of personality, putting on the plate elements that inevitably know they have already been seen. Virtually everything that the title offers has been widely proposed and gutted in the past by other games, often with globally higher values. Furthermore, it doesn't help that, for the price at which it is offered, Rakoo's Adventure offers an all too modest amount of content: the thirty stages present in the package are therefore little, and you don't need to make too much effort to find applications capable of ensure greater longevity at equal or even lower costs. Anyone who wants to give the work of Old Skull Games a chance will have to make a real leap of faith towards the developers, given that some components of the main game menu are blocked behind an enigmatic ~coming soon~ sign: it is therefore legitimate to expect new contents with future updates, but currently it is not known the nature of these updates.", "date": "2013-10-28", "grade": "7.3"}
