{"name": "Haegemonia Collector", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/haegemonia-collector.html", "text": "Singleplayer where are you? When a game is successful, its fate is sealed: inevitably, after a few months, an official package will come out. What do you generally expect from an official expansion? First, no revolution; secondly that at least revives the gaming experience you had with the original. Haegemonia represented, for fans of real-time strategy set in space (and not only for them), a breath of fresh air. It has been since Homeworld that a game like this has not managed to win the hearts of fans despite the fact that attempts to ~clone~ the original have not been lacking over the years. In truth, the major flaw that could be attributed to the title of Wanadoo was just too much resemblance to Homeworld (despite the more serious style). Despite this, some elements made Haegemonia a great success capable of remaining installed on fans' hard drives for months. These elements are the absolute spectacularity of the fights and of the graphics engine in general, the excellent structuring of the management part (research and construction of new vehicles or buildings) and, not secondary, the fun that was obtained in taking the side of the earthlings or of the Martians facing one of the two excellent dedicated campaigns. So we come to examine what this expansion has to offer that Digital Reality has prepared for all enthusiasts. Once you start the game, you are immediately quite taken aback: a single-player mode worthy of the name is almost completely missing. In fact, only the skirmish option is present which, as everyone more or less knows, is rightly considered a mere training for clashes with other human players found on the net. The lack is rather annoying, especially for the many players who do not enjoy multiplayer clashes by remaining tied (either by time, by costs, by taste) to solo mode alone. An extra effort in this direction could definitely be made. For the rest, the options are identical to those of Legions of Iron and, therefore, there is nothing left to do but choose a map and ascertain whether the innovations introduced at the level of units and game options are worth the purchase or not. Home Sweet Home As we said above in an expansion there is no need to make any revolution. But some substantial changes and some obvious additions would have been welcome. When playing The Solon Heritage, the novelties run out very quickly. Understood that the greatest effort has been made to try to better balance the already decidedly balanced multiplayer clashes and understood that every (small) addition has been made to achieve this goal there would be very little left to comment. The fifteen new maps are excellently made and present many very entertaining game situations. But, by virtue of the release of the very complete development tools to all interested players, by themselves they do not represent too palatable a dish (some amateur maps are decidedly of equivalent quality and, in some cases, superior); the new spaceships are nice additions but don't guarantee anything but a little more variety. Moreover, this certainly does not upset the balance that the most savvy players will have already reached in the original game, forcing them only to make some small adjustments to their strategies. Final comments Drawing the necessary conclusions, some considerations emerge that must be made. Weighing everything, it is clear that the expansion alone does not contain elements that can make it considered attractive for those looking for an addition to their single player gaming experience. On the other hand, those who live on bread and multi will find some pleasant adjustments in the product that could make them consider buying. Those who have not yet tried the game remain, so the advice is to buy this special edition with which they will take home the original game and the expansion; thus being able to experience one of the most beautiful (if not the most beautiful) strategy set in deep space. Pros: Great if you haven't tried Haegemonia yet Essential for multiplayer players Fun and long-lived Cons: No new single player campaign Those who already own the original have very little reason to buy it No substantial new features Gift box The Collector's Edition of Haegemonia looks like a typical special edition DVD package (like ~The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~ for instance) and contains the full version of Haegemonia: Legions of Iron (updated to version 1.04 ) and the official add-on reviewed in this article:The Solon Heritage. The package appears decidedly sumptuous in its overall realization including a map of all the discoveries available in the game plus the complete manual completely in Italian. A bargain if you haven't bought the original game yet.", "date": "2004-01-13", "grade": null}
