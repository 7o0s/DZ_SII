This is exactly the primary objective of the title, being able not to bore the player through a vast choice of well over 25 games, managing the individual games in a few minutes with the immediate achievement of steps to take to reach the finish line. In fact, the structure of the game provides for the choice in Viale Centrale of over 25 new games of luck and skill with winnings equal to prizes that can be worn by our character and special missions to complete. Nuovo Carnival always gives an excellent presentation of itself: all the step-by-step explanations, the characters that we can shape in our image and likeness and a kind ~magic hatter~ who helps us in every Mission Impossible by giving us tricks, advice and tips. Fluidity and energy remain the strong points of this interesting title. Those who love the dimension of the amusement park can choose to immerse themselves in this amusing virtual reality which guarantees high-level content thanks to the choice of subjects belonging to the mini-games. It's time to play! In Nuovo Carnival the console is exploited in every single peculiarity: in Blowpipe - one of the minigames - the microphone of the console is used where, by blowing into it, the darts are thrown making the balloons burst. Not to mention Maintain the Note where the aim is to reproduce the musical note by singing into the microphone: by keeping it for a long time the glass will break, thus passing the test. Starting with order, however, the first move to make is to choose a character that represents us between boy and girl and customize it to our liking. Once this choice has been made, we can move by choosing our personal game route: we have the entire Luna Park at our disposal and the freedom to decide where to move freely within the whole map, therefore not having a mandatory itinerary. The game possibilities are vast and all different, but the ones that perhaps attract the most attention are East Food and Ritmo Yeti. In East Food, speed is king; being smart means victory! The structure itself is very simple, in fact it is based on the reconstruction of a picture divided into 4 fragments to be joined with the DS stylus, which represents the orders to be composed in puzzle mode and delivered with a simple slide to the correct person waiting at the counter opposite to us. In just 60 seconds we must be able to prepare as many orders as possible. Ritmo Yeti instead exploits our ability not so much musical-percussive, but mainly visual memory: the Yeti will beat its drums and wait for our correct reproduction. Fortunately, the hits consist of different colors and you will thus have the possibility of remembering the sound combined with the color, facilitating the rendering. The pace will increase and will be increasingly complex, but as already mentioned, the mini-games often resort to short plays but with different steps in tow. Luck is skill! Oh yes, it's really true, there is no luck without skill and skill without luck! In fact, the beauty of the Luna Park is precisely this trying and having fun yes, but practicing to win is even more attractive! New Carnival: Luna Park is coming! for Nintendo DS has a really bizarre gem: by getting enough points you win a prize in many games and in the face of this you can hear the shutter click, in fact the victory will be immortalized by the console camera. Of course, here too there are multiplayer games to have fun in company even with a simple portable console. The range of possibilities is manifold, in New Carnival we also find classic games such as Target shooting, Baskets, Tiramisu or the Turbo bingo where you can measure your skills just like in a real amusement park.", "date": "2010-12-20", "grade": null}
