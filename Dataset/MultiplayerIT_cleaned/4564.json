Before the latter there had been two other chapters with a ~historical~ setting, that is, focused on air battles on the fronts of the Second World War, so ultimately it is a series that is now well established in the mobile panorama, which already has a good base of longtime enthusiasts. The main source of inspiration is clearly the famous Bandai Namco's Ace Combat, with its mix of simulation (few) and arcade (many) elements in a hybrid between flight simulation and shooter that makes action speed and immediacy of its strengths, with some realistic ambitions in the behavior of the aircraft and in the control system. In this case we find ourselves taking control of a pilot of the Sky Gamblers squadron, who finds himself involved in some sort of international intrigue with the need to act quickly to avoid an escalation towards the Third World War, or something like that. To tell the truth, the story is not exactly incisive, between stereotyped characters and rather obvious events, providing simple pretexts to advance from one scenario to another by cleaning the skies, lands and seas within 14 missions on different real scenarios, ranging from San Francisco Bay to Greenland, crossing Brazil and various other countries. However, the game does not end with the Campaign, also offering various multiplayer solutions that expand its potential, also thanks to a progression system that allows you to unlock new planes with ever greater capabilities, making us ever more fearsome and competitive for missions and dogfights with other players. With Sky Gamblers: Infinite Jets we bring Top Gun action to your pocket Air control The main problem, for games with a traditional ~console category~ setting that come out on mobile platforms, is always the fact of finding a control system that isn't emasculating. Sky Gamblers: Infinite Jets continues with the excellent solution already used by Air Supremacy alongside others and thus allowing you to better customize the gaming experience. The main system is the one based on motion sensors, which allows rolls, nose-ups and dives simply by tilting the device with a truly satisfying command response, combined with tactile controls with which to adjust speed, flaps and activate various weapons and systems. If this doesn't satisfy (but it really seems the best solution) it is possible to use the virtual controls on the screen or adopt a mixed solution, so on this front there is little to complain about. Always keep in mind that it is more of an arcade shooter than a simulator, so for the most part we find ourselves shooting industrial quantities of missiles against a myriad of enemies on the screen in a rather unrealistic way, but precisely for this reason a system of reactive control is necessary. The main problem of Sky Gamblers: Infinite Jets is perhaps precisely the historical defect of this type of game: the variety of situations in which we find ourselves is rather scarce and the ability to drive the plane does not seem so decisive in most part of the cases, essentially finding ourselves circling around like obsessed shooting tiny red dots on the screen from afar without understanding exactly what's going on. However, it must also be said that the medium difficulty level also offers demanding and stimulating challenges, especially considering the fact that it is a mobile title. The technical realization of Infinite Jets is simply impressive: continuing in the tradition of the series, the game offers an excellent reproduction of the planes and detailed and complex scenarios, so as not to disfigure in front of the console productions of the same type (with the due proportions). The downside is that to make it work you need a device capable of exploiting the Metal framework, and sincerely having tried it on a 2017 iPad, noting some performance drops, it is likely that on older devices it will be a bit too indigestible.", "date": "2017-11-10", "grade": "8.6"}
