Observing the characteristics of an athlete is not enough to decide how to exploit him; on the other hand, you must also have in mind how you want to tackle a stage, what kind of specializations are required and if a rider can serve in a different role than the one suggested by his profile. Leader, follower, sprinter or free? At first everything is hazy, but as you get to grips with the game and watch the behavior of the riders during the races, everything will slowly become clearer. everything has a cost and, needless to say, you have to be careful not to throw away a season Management Obviously, the pre-race management of the cyclists is only one of the many aspects taken into consideration by the simulation. What would a management game be without a budget to manage? Nothing, and in fact you too will have to deal with the classic economic problems that have tormented (and delighted) the sleepless nights of management enthusiasts spent in front of their computer monitors since the dawn of time. Do you want the best for your team right away? Unless you have a large initial budget, be prepared to see the color red overshadow the company's bank account soon. Everything has a cost and, needless to say, you have to be careful not to throw away a season. The best training courses cost money, as does equipment. Do you want an efficient technical staff, with doctors who know how to refurbish even a cyclist found in a landfill? Do you want to include the most promising young players available on the market in your team? Get ready to shell out money at will or, otherwise, to have it shelled out by the sponsors. But the sponsors, especially at the beginning, are not very willing to shell out big sums. They want results before they open their wallets, they can't afford to put their brand on the shirt of a team of underdogs. And here comes the real races, the moment in which the goodness or otherwise of the choices made previously is decided and in which everything must be done to try to win. The race If, obviously, all the micro and macro management screens are represented with aseptic windows in which the clarity of the data matters more than the visual beauty, the situation changes for the races which are represented with a three-dimensional engine capable of moving a large mass of runners at the same time, faithfully simulating the feeling of a real race. Actually Pro Cycling Manager: Season 2007 does not shine for particular visual qualities and, despite the good care of the cyclists, with different shirts according to the team and the sponsors and with good three-dimensional models, the scenarios are rather dull. Even some tricks, inserted to try to give the product a little spectacularity, such as the possibility of modifying the point of view of the race through a simple camera management menu, soon turn out to be superfluous because, apart from the initial curiosity that can justify a bit of healthy tweaking, it makes no sense to keep shots that don't allow you to understand what's happening. So in the end we are led to choose and keep the most functional shot for the action, also because otherwise it becomes difficult to play our role. As a manager you don't take part directly in the race, but you have to learn by heart how to manage the actions of the runners. It's up to us to decide the effort, the sprints, how they have to manage their teammates, if they have to provide cover, if they have to chase and, in short, if they have to carry out all those actions that we normally see carried out during official competitions. From this point of view Pro Cycling Manager 2007 is very complete and offers a remarkable range of options. During the races, then, the work done in the preparatory phases is evident. Pro Cycling Manager 2007 is available for PC. Defects Obviously it's not all rosy and there are several small defects, some of which have already been mentioned in the previous paragraphs but which are worth returning to. The interface, for example, is very cumbersome and, despite the considerable progress made by the previous chapter, it still feels that it lacks ~leanness~ because it forces the player to click too many. Compared to the previous chapter, the steps forward are there and can be seen and, finally, we have a complete title in our hands and not a beta awaiting accommodation, but something more can still be done. have we chosen to use a rider for a stage that is not congenial to him? Bad, let's get ready to see him trudge to the bottom of the ment raceking curses his bad manager Defects Another defect, more annoying in this case, is the length of the loading times of the races. We are talking about tens of seconds for each stage loaded which, given the 2 GB of the test system, will make life difficult for those who have only the 512MB of RAM required by the game to run. Frankly we wonder how, in 2008, a game that occupies only one CD-ROM can take so much time to load each scenario, much more than extremely heavy titles (the first that comes to mind is BioShock) which instead go smoothly and do not fall asleep between levels. Third and last flaw is the soundtrack which is unworthy: the sound effects are almost non-existent and the accompanying music seems to come from a bad TV show, mercilessly clashing with the theme of the game. Did it take so much to treat her more? System requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 3 1.0 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: DirectX 9.0 compatible and equipped with 64 MB (GeForce 2 and up) Disk Space: 2.0 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3 4GHz RAM: 2GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment Pro Cycling Manager 2007 Season is a well made product that manages to keep what it promises, improving various aspects of its predecessors from many points of view and solving problems and imperfections. Of course, it remains recommended for cycling enthusiasts, since others may find it too difficult. For the rest it is a complete and enjoyable title, which can give many months of entertainment. Pros Careful and very deep The racing interface is excellent Many variables to consider, longevity is assured Cons Cumbersome management interface There is no tutorial for the management phase Excessively long uploads The first warning that can be given regarding Pro Cycling Manager: 2007 Season is to steer clear of it unless you are a cycling enthusiast. This is a game designed for fans of two-wheeled pedals and not for a vast and heterogeneous audience. So, if your maximum aspiration is to sit in front of the PC and play in complete tranquility, without making any effort to understand what is in front of you, turn away. Cyanide's work aims to be exhaustive in the matter it addresses and, to do this, it does not compromise. This does not mean that it is unplayable, but simply that its gameplay is designed in such a way as not to sacrifice details in favor of immediate usability. Once the context has been specified, it remains to be said that it takes more than a few hours to learn how to master the myriad of menus that make up the game. The included tutorial, related only to running, does not help to juggle the options, while some extra in-game explanations are missing. The manual does not help much due to the small amount that does not allow him to dwell too much on the various aspects. In short, you really need a lot of passion to get started (and you also need a lot of free time). Our role will be to administer a cycling team trying to bring it to win the most important European competitions (Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and many others) to make the riders affirm themselves at an international level. We will therefore have to continuously make management choices ranging from the planning of training races, in which we will not only have to decide the place, but also the team to send, to the micro-management of each individual rider. To give an example: rider A is a specialist in time trial races but performs poorly when called upon to face uphill stages, how to manage him? Try to improve his performance in all areas, or make him focus on his specialty by making him snub the other specialties? Depends.", "date": "2007-10-11", "grade": null}
