Ship Simulator, coincidentally, will allow you to board as many as eight different ships, ranging from the tiny ship of the coastguards, up to the mammoth merchant ship, facing different scenarios prepared ad hoc by the developers, where you will have to demonstrate all your ability to sailor Man. The variety offered, while not particularly vast, is accentuated by a superficial characterization of each vessel, and therefore, while driving a motorboat in a crowded port will be relatively simple, getting our cargo out, being careful not to run over other vessels, will be a real challenge. business. Essentially each ship will have its own speed, weight and handling values, and we have never happened to move a tugboat as if it were a real yacht, although the goal of simulation realism is still far away. In fact, the latest VSTEP effort, despite bearing the name of Simulator, absolutely cannot be classified as such, given the ease and immediacy with which you will be able to move the boats: through a comfortable console, obviously graphic, you can decide the navigation speed , going to act on the levers, while with the directional arrows you will limit yourself to rotating the rudder, establishing the direction; if, in reality, it takes a captain several decades to learn every deepest secret of the sea, it will only take you seconds. No parking on the Titanic If reality isn't Ship Simulator's strong point, fun is even less so: all the scenarios you'll have to face, for a total of about 40, are all exactly the same; it doesn't matter if you have to take the Titanic to a port, or lead a merchant ship somewhere, or still inspect a water area with the patrol boat, because essentially, all you have to do is reach a destination, conveniently represented by a showy buoy green (they put them everywhere, even in the middle of the ocean). the tragic lies in the fact that the developers have not provided a key to speed up the game time, forcing you to sit in front of the screen even when you have nothing to do No parking on the Titanic Obviously, the substantial difference between one scenario and another lies solely in the time it will take you to reach your destination: while a fast motorboat will take a few minutes to cover a given distance, the colossal Titanic will take a good hour. The tragedy lies in the fact that the developers have not provided a key to speed up the game time, forcing you to sit in front of the screen even when you have nothing to do and, frankly speaking, the moments of action are practically reduced to zero. except taking the tedious task of setting a course, where the classic straight line practically always works. The idea of earning credits by completing scenarios, with which to buy decorations for your port, could sound interesting: unfortunately, this is absolutely an end in itself, given that having a beautiful red or green crane available, or a parked car on the dock, in essence, it proves useless. Sweet is my sailing Discarded realism and fun, little remains but graphics from the beginning of the millennium: despite the fact that the water has been created with a wise use of shaders, strictly in their first version, the rest appears rather dull and flat, a sign that the developers have not cared this aspect at all: the models of the boats are quite similar to each other, while the static boats, i.e. those not in motion, are covered with low-resolution textures: the environment of the Titanic appears emblematic (of which you can observe a image on this page), where the walls seem to be repainted by very efficient painters every few minutes, given the unnatural white color that characterizes them. Sweet is my sailing If the water is saved, the same cannot be said of the rest: forget any type of particle effects, such as smoke or flames, even if your gigantic merchant ship hits a small fishing boat; therefore the much vaunted (on the case of the game) dynamic atmospheric weather are also useless, which in addition to being absolutely terrible to look at, with raindrops that look like Doric columns, is also absolutely useless, given that it will not affect any element of the gameplay, except for the visibility: however, in case the fog scares you, from the game menu you can quickly change the weather conditions, setting the ones you prefer. Furthermore, the sound aspect of the title also disappoints, presenting ambient sounds reduced to the bone and son effectsdecidedly poor quality sources, also not allowing you to activate the first versions of Dolby Surround. Final comment Bad graphics, frustrating gameplay and non-existent simulation: these are the elements that characterize this Ship Simulator. If you love water and boats, save your money and put it aside while waiting for some other software house to decide to produce a serious, or at least, decent simulator: there is, in fact, no reason why we can recommend the purchase of the title, if not the ability to control the Titanic, even if after five minutes you will have exhausted all the positive aspects of the game. And no, there are no icebergs with which to emulate the feats of Leonardo di Caprio. Pros There's the Titanic Cons Graphically terrible Absolutely boring A thousand blue blue bubbles The sea has always exercised a certain fascination: after having conquered the sky with Flight Simulator and having dominated the asphalt with rFactor, now it's the ocean's turn, and this time it's VSTEP to give it a try with this Ship Simulator 2006, which will probably never see 2007.", "date": "2006-10-16", "grade": null}
