The kind that starts with ~I just watch one episode while having breakfast~, and you find yourself at dinner time looking for news about the next season. The fact is that, since last October and after a crescendo that lasted thirty-one episodes, fans of the series created by Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland are now in abstinence. Zero information on the return to TV and the special episode released on April 1st, Bushworld Adventures, was too short, atypical and adulterous to quench the thirst of fans. Instead, Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality succeeds, a VR experience that takes the sandbox structure of Job Simulator and puts the characters, tones and unconventional writing of the cartoon into it. Wubba lubba dub dub! The comparison with Job Simulator is no coincidence, since the two games share the developer (the Texan Owlchemy Labs), the mechanics and the technology behind them. Arrived on PlayStation VR a year after its PC debut, Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality starts from a very clever narrative ploy: the player does not play the role of one of the two protagonists, but of a clone of Morty left in the home garage cleaning while the unlikely duo are on the road. Those who know the series will probably have turned up their noses at the idea of being segregated at home. After all, born as a parody of Back to the Future, part of the charm of Rick and Morty lies precisely in the journeys of the two protagonists between parallel universes, distant planets and past and future eras. Virtual Rick-ality is instead a collection of small puzzles and household activities that ask you to interact with the inventions and junk that Rick keeps in the garage. There is a lever that opens a dimensional portal, a shrinking ray, a device that mixes materials to create useless objects, up to a box that materializes Mr. Miguardi, a character that mimics the player's movements in every detail. Every wardrobe and every shelf hide references to particular episodes of the animated series, and the most avid fan will find himself spending most of his time browsing and interacting with everything that comes to hand. As in Job Simulator, the most successful element is in fact the sensation of presence within the virtual world, given that every single object can be picked up, turned over in the hands, used in some way or simply thrown in the air. It is therefore a pity that with PlayStation VR the experience is more cumbersome and less intuitive than the Vive version of the game: in particular, when you turn your back to the TV or try to reach objects on the floor, PlayStation Camera tends to lose seen the Moves, forcing a few more attempts or unnatural movement. Where the game shines though is in the way it manages to replicate the comedy of Rick and Morty. As in the animated series, the writing is pungent, foul-mouthed, aware and, between a curse, a gag and an insult, also philosophical and meta-referential. Through a wrist device, the player is always in contact with the characters, allowing Rick to tease and mistreat him whenever he makes a mistake or performs a stupid action. The collaboration with Justin Roiland then makes Virtual Rick-ality an authentic interactive episode for any Rick and Morty fan, or at least for those who follow the series in the original language (the game is not localized in Italian). There are some slowdowns and some less sharp gags (after all, most of the jokes were improvised by Roiland himself during the recording), but overall the game manages to entertain for its entire duration, and it is a pity that the conclusion arrives after not even a couple of hours. In a final gag, Rick and Morty even joke that there isn't much else to do in the game, eliciting one last bitter laugh before realizing it's all over.", "date": "2018-04-27", "grade": "7.0"}
