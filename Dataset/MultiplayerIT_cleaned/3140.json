Even if it seems less past, it was in fact March 11, 2014 when the developers of Warcraft, Overwatch and company decided to officially jump into the world of card games, managing to become very popular within this genre also thanks to the use of the World of Warcraft setting to appeal to fans of the latter. The result of the operation obviously speaks for itself, through a success that still continues today despite the competition is increasingly ruthless and numerous with the arrival of new titles such as Legends of Runeterra. To bring a breath of fresh air to Hearthstone that goes beyond the addition of new cards that takes place punctually every four months, Blizzard's idea for Ashes of Outland was to introduce the new Demon Hunter class, the first ever to be added to those already present in the game since its launch. For us too, the curiosity to know the hero played by Illidan Stormrage was high, and after trying a couple of weeks ago we were finally able to do it together with all the other players, with the arrival of the expansion which took place last 7 April. After a week of playing with the new decks, here's our verdict! The new class: the Demon Hunter Beyond the characteristics related to the one hundred and thirty-five cards of Ashes of Outer Lands, it is therefore the Demon Hunter who dominates, at least temporarily obscuring all the other classes. An effect that made itself felt strongly immediately after the launch of the expansion, with the new Demon Hunter tested by many players. However, there were problems: partly the novelty, partly the terrible effectiveness of this class against the others, led in the first hours to ensure that there was nothing but mirror matches. of this kind was predictable, on the other hand the success of the Demon Hunter also in terms of win rate rang an alarm bell, associated with the doubts of the more experienced players who saw in the excessive power level of some of the new cards introduced from Ashes of Outland a threat to the balance of Hearthstone. Blizzard responded with a practically immediate nerf, which actually took place after about twenty-four hours. Cards like Gul'dan's Skull and Inhibited Antaen ended up costing a mana crystal more than originally planned, while durability was decreased in the case of the Aldrachi Warblades weapon. taking the situation, lowering at least for the moment the desirability of the Demon Hunter who still remains a fun class to play thanks to the dynamics of Repudiation, which guarantees additional effects to cards played from the extreme left or right of one's hand. After the rotation that inaugurated the Year of the Phoenix, it will be up to the other expansions to be able to enhance the new class, in the hope that immediate nerfs will not have to be resorted to in the future as well. The other news: inhibited minions and ~prime~ cards The arrival of the Demon Hunter undoubtedly deserves its space, but Ashes of the Outlands still contains other news. We have already mentioned one of these and it is linked to inhibited minions, which come into play as sleepers and then activate after two turns, in most cases giving rise to particularly powerful effects. These are undoubtedly cards to be played with particular care due to their delayed effect, thus subjecting themselves to a temporary disadvantage before obtaining the boost. It's worth keeping in mind that cards like The Incredible Reno don't cause inhibited minions to disappear, which are therefore immune to this card in use in several Wizard decks. Italian) scattered among all the Hearthstone classes. In this case, they are minions who come into play with a certain characteristic, and then insert an enhanced version of themselves into the deck of the player who controls them with their death rattle. In many cases these are particularly valid cards to be played, such as the Supreme Reliquary of the Priest (6/8 with taunt and vital theft, targetable by spells only by whoever controls it) or Solarian Supreme of the Mage, a 7/7 with +1 magic damage and a chance to cast five random spells targeting enemies when possible. However, their effectiveness is currently limitedby a fairly fast meta, which prevents in many games from resorting to the characteristics of the ~prime~ cards. It will therefore be necessary to return to evaluating them when the decks move a little more towards a type of control. A similar discourse concerns the novelties of the Paladin, pushed by Blizzard in its pure version thanks to the introduction of Libram. Barring shocking news in the meta (which could still happen, given that the expansion has been out for a week), this set of cards, while presenting itself with an interesting guise, will probably have to wait for the next expansions to spread more. Compared to the meta prior to the exit of Ceneri delle Terre Esterne it must be said that the new archetypes are all struggling to establish themselves a bit. Undoubtedly thanks to the effectiveness of Galakrond and the cards linked to it. Be that as it may, among the new decks the spell mage stands out at least for the moment, i.e. a deck made up only of spells for the Magician. The secret rogue is also particularly interesting thanks to the presence of the Dark Jeweler Hanar, through which you can obtain secrets of other classes once you have played one of the new ones concerning the Thief.", "date": "2020-04-14", "grade": "7.8"}
