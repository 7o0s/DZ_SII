The different modes, including multiplayer, all revolve around this formula that has spanned almost all gaming ages and boasts excellent representatives such as Death Rally, Chase HQ and Twisted Metal. The Classic mode is partially an exception, useful only for the first few games and to be able to compete in the other modes, which includes some bonuses and mines, but not the weapons mounted on the vehicle. Gameplay Vs Design It starts the old-fashioned way with guns and cars locked down and an awkward grind to do battle with the world. Initially the fight is bound to what is found along the way, i.e. it is bound only to the Classic mode which, as already mentioned, differs from the Battle and Elimination modes by focusing more on the race than on the fight. By unlocking the following contents, you get upgrades, new vehicles, weapons and 15 types of ammunition. A tested formula, at least on paper, which however does not work if the time to unlock new elements is excessive. Well, in the case of Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage hours of grinding are needed to gain access to the second machine which, given the need to keep progression constant, is certainly not a fireball. If nothing else the gameplay is quite enjoyable even if the shortage of weapons and upgrades dulls the experience at first. As for the driving system, simple and intuitive, there is a slight latency on the controls but the vehicles turn easily. A design choice that is certainly not new which fulfills two main tasks, namely that of increasing the difficulty, making timing and knowledge of the track fundamental, and that of giving a greater sense of realism to driving without encroaching on simulation. Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence is not particularly brilliant and the opposing vehicles are unable to recover the lost ground to revive the challenge. In any case, the antagonists are fast and, not too good, have a car that seems to be made of lead. Basically, if we find ourselves behind the opponents, a wrong clash can make us lose an entire race and in a title where drifts, collisions and explosions are the daily bread, forcing the player to run embalmed is not a good choice. In truth there is an element that allows you to recover and that is the turbo which depends on a classic energy bar and is recharged by throwing yourself against vehicles and objects. But the thrust of the turbo is weak and the need to impact to charge it is paradoxical. Fortunately there are elements of the scenario, such as cacti, which do not cause slowdowns but overall the best strategy remains to go straight on one's own path, especially since going off the road does not cause any slowdown. As far as driving is concerned, therefore, the degree of challenge does not appear particularly balanced even if things change when, after a bit of tiring grinding, shields and weapons to be installed on the car are finally unlocked and it is no longer necessary to rely exclusively on mines found on the street to attack and slow down your opponents. The weapons, which fall within the classic offering of the genre with rockets, mines, machine guns, also include a shotgun that requires some skill in aiming even if this is slightly assisted. As a bonus, the shotgun returns a very high potential damage provided, of course, that all shots from the rose are successful. In short, to have fun it is necessary to escape at high speed from the races in Classic mode by unlocking the initially precluded elements, but this is where the biggest problem of Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage emerges. Making weapons, machines and upgrades available takes so long that by the time the gameplay finally completes, the title has already become boring. In fact, the tracks, although set in various locations, are not particularly inspired and the limited design of the tracks is also the main problem of online multiplayer. Sinuous metal sheets and flashes in the dark The graphics are modest with fluctuating textures and a limited polygonal mass. But however poor the aesthetic component of racing Gamepires has character. The mix between realism and arcade sought by the developers works above all thanks to the vehicle models which, although not particularly complex, are nevertheless equipped with an excellent yield. The Gas Guzzlers to which the title of the game refers are the petrol-eating cars, that is the heavy ones, with excessive injection and with engines optimized only with performance in mind and without taking any account of consumption. A category che doesn't only include sports cars but also much more ungainly vehicles such as SUVs or generously sized American dumpsters. In short, vehicles that are decidedly suitable for aesthetically enriching a title with always different and often generous forms. The tracks are placed in rather varied and well-characterized settings even if not all of them enjoy the same quality. The town where it all begins, for example, is rather flat, even in terms of technical performance, while one of the most inspired tracks is set along a series of deep canyons, with large crevasses and suggestive tunnels. Overall we are faced with a visually enjoyable title although it cannot be compared to the great pillars of racing and does not even remotely exploit the hardware of current PCs. But Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage also sports elements of value such as variable weather conditions that give a sense of remarkable depth to winding roads, desert plains and snow-capped mountains. The rendering of the lights at night is particularly pleasant while flames and explosions are not of the same quality. As a side element, the title embodies a healthy dose of humor, with demented names and easter eggs, which fits particularly well with the chaotic and burglary formula chosen by Gamepires. The adaptation in Italian is unfortunately absent but in a guide title this is undoubtedly a marginal defect.", "date": "2012-08-09", "grade": "6.0"}
