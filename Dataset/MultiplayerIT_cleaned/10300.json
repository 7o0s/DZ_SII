{"name": "Age of Wonders 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-wonders-4-recensione.html", "text": "When it comes to 4X turn-based strategy, the reference point can only be Civilization VI. The one signed by Sid Meier, in fact, is not necessarily the best experience on the market, but it is certainly the most famous and the one that has traced the path that all the others have begun to follow in terms of accessibility and legibility. The game interface designed by Firaxis, for example, is not only one of the smoothest on PC, but has allowed the genre to land without major problems on consoles and mobile devices. Starting (also) from this model, Paradox and Triumph Studios have decided to pack the latest chapter of the Age of Wonders series, an interesting fantasy variant of the classic formula that asks you to explore, expand and exploit the game map and exterminate enemies to lead your own faction to glory. After a digression into science fiction with Planetfall, the Dutch studio dusts off dragons, magic wands and ogres: this is how it went in the review of Age of Wonders 4. What is Age of Wonders 4? A city from Age of Wonders 4 We could describe Age of Wonders 4 as a 4X strategy game with RPG elements and a turn-based combat system. A sort of fantasy-style Humankind given that Amplitude's work shares many elements with that of Triumph, or perhaps it is vice versa, given the longevity of the Dutch series. In other words, the player's task will be to interpret the leader of one of the many factions present in order to lead his people to victory, whether magical, domination or any other type. The objective must be achieved on the one hand by growing one's empire, managing cities, building upgrades and founding new outposts, on the other by expanding one's army, recruiting new heroes and exploring the territory in search of treasures with which to dress up one's famous warriors. Obviously, there is also a sort of technological progression, in this case linked to magic, which allows you to progressively obtain stronger spells to use on the map or during battles, new units or upgrades for old ones. Finally there are improvements to the empire, thanks to which you can specialize your domain according to personal needs or those of the game. The fights do not take place directly on the game map as in Civilization or Stellaris, but are resolved within an independent instance in which all units within the range of the battle are brought, for a maximum of 3 armies per side. Before leaving you can choose whether to have the computer manage the combat or directly control the different units. In this case everything takes place as a turn-based strategy where the two sides alternate in moving each single troop trying to win by registering the least number of deaths possible. Victory can only be achieved by making the most of the characteristics and abilities of all troops and heroes, a pity that the arenas in which everything takes place are not very elaborate and all look alike. A greater variety of geographical elements (bottlenecks, high points from which to strike) or situational (in addition to sieges, perhaps clashes with ~bosses~ or timed missions) would have made these moments more interesting, especially in the long run. For now it's always about frontal clashes between two well-organized sides, without covers, or variations of any kind. A bit of an RPG Age of Wonders 4 hero inventory management One of the distinctive elements of Age of Wonders 4 is the presence of heroes. These are special and particularly powerful units to put in command of your armies and your own cities. Each of the heroes can count on a greater number of skills than ~normal~ troops, but above all they can grow in a very similar way to that of classic RPGs. In fact, each hero has an experience parameter that grows after each battle and allows him to become stronger and gain new skills, but above all he can be equipped with weapons, objects and armor capable of greatly enhancing his statistics. These objects can be recovered around the world by defeating the independent creatures that populate it or can be obtained by interacting with the other factions on the map or by solving some particular missions. The RPG nature is also seen in the characterization of the various factions. There are those who prefer a certain type of magic and those who love being underground, those who specialize in warriors and those in healing magic. This good characterization of the different races gets watered down a bit by the possibility to create your own: it is certainly a fun option for those who want maximum customization, a little less for those who like to be faithful to the mythology of Age of Wonders 4. A basis on which to start one of the rare cutscenes of Age of Wonders 4 At the beginning we talked about cleaning up the Civilization VI interface. Firaxis' work, in fact, guarantees a practically uninterrupted game flow, easy to read and above all that always pushes you to take ~one more turn~, as a famous trailer of the series said. Despite trying to replicate the scheme, with a large button in the lower right corner of the screen around which all notifications are concentrated, playing Age of Wonders 4 is less fluid than the game signed by Sid Meier: it's not always easy select units on the map and switch between them, the game doesn't automatically switch between troop management and empire management and stuff like that. Obviously nothing dramatic, the experience is absolutely enjoyable, but the feeling is that you always make those 2-3 clicks more than you could have. Even looking at the other game systems, the feeling is that Triumph has always stopped one step away from excellence, leaving ample room for improvement on which to base future expansions. The diplomatic system, for example, is functional, but a little too schematic and predictable, the fights work well, but lack variety, the role-playing part is present, but some missions that are a little different and a little more complex could have been implemented. The impression is that like it or not you always end up fighting and there is no effective alternative way to achieve victory. Firmer than expected Combat in Age of Wonders 4 is turn-based Despite the somewhat alarming initial reports, our experience with Age of Wonders 4 has been very good. The game runs smoothly on an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 4750U with integrated graphics and during our tests we ran into a couple of crashes that didn't do much damage, given the very punctual autosave system. This allowed us to appreciate the design of the different creatures and the game world a lot, while the music didn't particularly impress us. Longevity depends on many factors, as each match can be shaped according to your needs and, in case you have already explored all the available content, there is always the online, where you can find other players to challenge.", "date": "2023-05-07", "grade": "8.0"}
