In Max Payne's case, the brutal murder of his wife and daughter transformed an honest, law-abiding cop into something of a psychotic night watchman, a force of nature in a leather coat who finds solace only by placing a few bullets in head to criminals like the ones who destroyed his family. Over the years, however, even the most ardent fire ends up going out, resignation takes over and it is precisely a resigned Max Payne who we meet in the awaited third episode of the series, developed by Rockstar Studios instead of Remedy. A passing of the baton that implies profound changes in the nature of the product, which has found itself having to conform to the ~Rockstar style~ without losing its nature as an extremely spectacular third-person shooter with a high adrenaline rate. We were talking about resignation: Max knows it well and by now his life is a sort of limbo in which track of time is lost, with the evenings following one another, punctuated by alcohol and pills. Things don't change when Passos, Payne's alleged old academy buddy, finds him in a bar in New Jersey and convinces him, albeit at the end of some rather agitated phases, which leave little room to decide with a cold mind, to work together to him as a bodyguard for the rich and famous, especially the prominent Branco family, who do business around So Paulo, Brazil. Different scenario but identical underlying situation, and so Max does nothing but carry out his work completely drunk, to then finish the work once back in his apartment, holding the photo of his late wife in his hand as he guzzles whiskey until he loses his senses and finally find the longed-for embrace of Morpheus. The protagonist's decadence will gradually grow and be well represented thanks to a narrative made up of constant flashbacks and flash-forwards, in which we will find ourselves reliving and playing through periods prior to his assignment in Brazil but always following what was told in the first two Max Payne, with only a few references to the troubled past of the protagonist, so as not to inhibit the involvement of those who may not know the origins of the series. And in this continuous game of references it is the figure of our avenger who literally pierces the screen, thanks to an enviable charisma and a real aesthetic progression, able to perfectly represent the desperation of a human figure who is extremely torn internally because he is able , apparently, to bring only death and destruction. Armed and drunk Taking care of the security for a wealthy family in a scenario like that of So Paulo, where the line between rich and poor is incredibly clear, is not a simple undertaking as Passos wanted us to believe. And soon the situation begins to deteriorate: it becomes clear that someone has targeted the three Branco brothers and the wife of the older one; and we are not dealing with gangsters from the favelas, but well organized people, armed to the teeth and with their backs covered. Max's perennial drunkenness ends up playing a precise role in the picture of the absolutely excellent artistic direction of the game, with the images that often double for a few moments and give us the idea of how this character, destroyed by personal events, by the war with gangs and advancing age, he drags on despite everything and is still able to give a hard time to a small army of hooded guerrillas. Bullet time is always there, a real trademark of the series, and is at our disposal with the classic adrenaline gauge that fills up as seconds go by, remaining in cover if subjected to enemy fire and killing opponents. It is activated manually by pressing the right analog in the default configuration, or automatically by activating the so-called shootdodge, or by making Max dive in some direction with the pressure of the right backbone. You also enter bullet time by suffering a mortal blow but still having at least one painkiller available: in this situation we will have very few seconds to hit the person who mortally wounded us and, if we succeed, Max will automatically take on a painkiller to return to the center of the bullet. action as if nothing had happened. Often, however, it is the events themselves that trigger the slow motion, thanks to a scripting able to offer us some of the most spectacular sequences ever seen in an action game, which never end up being trivialized as sometimes happened in the episodes treated by Remedy. The diffDifferent thickness of the production, now passed into the hands of Rockstar, is also noticeable in these situations. And so Max leaps from a roof to hit a bandit who is holding a person hostage on the fly, or he breaks through a window to catch a handful of criminals by surprise, or he leaps onto a cart to hit a string of opponents stationed in the 'building opposite the one in which it is located and, as if that weren't enough, we see him fall from a balustrade into a warehouse, slowed down only by a chain, while unloading dozens of magazines on the poor unfortunates below. Sometimes these moments are not forgiving, in the sense that it is not possible to make a mistake under penalty of game over. It is certainly a solution that will lead you to experiment with new and more articulated ways to cite some divinities, but which on balance is absolutely in line with the decisions taken by developers in other sectors as well. Among other things, very often there is not even the time to freely explore the game areas, cleaned up with great effort, in search of the numerous collectibles and clues capable of saying something more about the story, given that we will often find ourselves chasing characters or escorting Passos or someone from the Branco family, and not continuing with a certain speed will mean seeing our ally dead. Playstation 3 trophies There are forty-nine Trophies contained in Max Payne 3, and as per tradition, obtaining them implies completing a mix of objectives. Some of them must be achieved by force of circumstances and involve, in most cases, the completion of the individual levels as well as the single-player campaign in the five available challenge levels. Other Trophies are obtained by completing much more complex missions, such as killing a certain number of enemies with various weapons and methods, as well as finding objects or, finally, completing stages without ever resorting to painkillers. A hardcore experience? Wanting to combine the gunplay of the original Max Payne with an eel and that of Grand Theft Auto IV with a piece of wood, we can say that Max Payne 3 brings together the best of the two experiences and succeeds in offering great gameplay value, engaging and solid. The character controls himself very well, can use various objects in the scenario to take cover during firefights and the player is left with the most complete freedom in terms of adjusting the difficulty, not only thanks to the three different levels of challenge available (with an additional two which are unlocked later) but also to setting the aim which can be automatic, semi-automatic or manual, and which obviously has an important influence on what our approach to fighting will be. Opting for manual aiming means remaining faithful to the feel of the series, given that it involves greater difficulty and the need to adjust the crosshair with great precision in order to place some headshots during bullet time, while the semi-automatic option allows you to lock the target by simply pressing the left trigger of the controller, to then adjust the aim on the fly and peck the opponent between the eyes. The importance of accurate shooting increases as the story progresses, with new enemies entering the field with heavy weapons and protections that make it really difficult to take them out with a single shot or a burst of machine guns. A little above we also mentioned the covers, which obviously could not be missing in Max Payne 3, as in any self-respecting third-person shooter. They are of the active type and obviously allow you to lean out and aim with a hint of extra relaxation; however there are some elements in the game that actually make them unusable, almost a side dish to the action experience even at the highest difficulty levels. First of all there is a very aggressive artificial intelligence, which will always try to exploit the large number of contemporary enemies that we will face in every firefight to get around and track us down; in addition, most of the guards are destructible when subjected to repeated stresses. But most of all it is Max's nature that stimulates us to go ahead with guns blazing, almost going against the trend of what shooters of this generation have accustomed us to. The ex-cop is basically a tamarro worthy of the best Die Hards, who can never be knocked down with a couple of bullets and for this reason the game encourages us to jump into the center of the action, armed with bullet time and maybe with a pistol and a machine gun shouldered together, to sow death and destruction in the center of an office or among the abandoned shacks ofi Sao Paulo. Admiring the scene of devastation created with our leaden fury in retrospect will produce great satisfaction. Tough but fair Another important step taken by Rockstar Studios in the direction of the most appropriate balancing concerns the management of ammunition and the famous painkillers that Max must hire to restore his health. Both elements are far from frequent in the game, placing themselves in antithesis with respect to productions in which one never runs out of shots in the clip or a certain sequence is never replayed due to repeated game overs. In Max Payne 3 you die all right, much more frequently than you might expect: there are moments that you will have to face over and over again before being able to overcome them successfully, but at the same time the presence of relatively numerous checkpoints (even if in some situation we noticed an excessive distance from the save point) manages to sweeten the pill just enough to avoid branding the game as ~frustrating~. The organization of the arsenal is also very convincing and plausible, with the character holding a holstered pistol and a second pistol (or small-caliber machine gun) in his right hand, while holding a rifle in the other hand. assault or shotgun. It is possible to wield two light weapons at the same time, for example two pistols or a pistol and an uzi, but this choice implies the abandonment of the heavy weapon. Everything occurs before our eyes, allowing us to check the current composition of the equipment at a glance, while an indicator placed next to that of vital energy informs us of the rounds in the chamber and the total ammunition for the weapon we are using . Let me be clear, there are some edges to remind us that even the most accurate videogame production can show the side of oversights, and in this specific case it sometimes happens that at the end of a sequence, or after a load, the game puts the pistol, perhaps unloaded, instead of the machine gun we held up to a second before (the priceless act of leaping into the air, bullet time activated, perfectly framing the enemy's forehead, pulling the trigger and hearing the unmistakable sound of the unloaded weapon) , which can give us some headaches if we immediately end up in the middle of a new shooting. The cliques A real element of interconnection between Max Payne 3 and future Rockstar titles, including Grand Theft Auto V, the ~cliques~ are nothing more than the reinterpretation of the guilds of any self-respecting MMO by the American developer. Created and customizable through the Rockstar Social Club, these particular groups allow you to unite friends and acquaintances by stimulating teamwork towards the ultimate goal of growing your crew in terms of experience and making it rise in the world rankings. The system is completely automatic: ending up in a game where there is already a member of our group we will automatically be placed in a team with him and we will start earning extra bonuses by collaborating in killings and achieving objectives. Furthermore, over time, real feuds will begin to be created between cliques, which will stimulate players to kill opponents belonging to the enemy group. All in a sort of meta-game that goes beyond the single video game, servers or modalities. Not just single player Once the fourteen chapters that make up the single player campaign have been completed, and which are unlikely to keep you busy for less than ten hours, Max Payne 3 remains able to offer another nice handful of content. To begin with, there are two arcade modes that allow you to retrace the levels and events narrated in the story mode with two variations on the theme: on the one hand, the classic Score Challenge, which allows you to earn points and unlock gradually increasing multipliers based on the type of hits inflicted on the enemy and the amount of damage taken; on the other hand the titled Ultimo Respiro, a real race against time where we are given only one minute to complete the various chapters of the game but by killing the opponents we can gain precious seconds. Obviously both of these modes focus everything on the challenge with your friends and with the whole world, and in fact the various rankings are the masters, which can be immediately consulted at the end of the match, as well as a series of in-game overlays that show us a at a glance how the best in the standings fared. There is also a full-fledged multiplayer mode, which promptly disproves the commonplace of the uselessness of this feature in such a distinctly historical-centric title.
