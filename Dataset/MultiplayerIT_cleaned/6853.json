All presented through the increasingly popular free to play formula, which once again ends up proving to be a proverbial cross and delight... Sniper and sniper yes Kill Shot doesn't get lost in chatter, practically completely renouncing a plot that forms the background to the action: the protagonist is therefore an anonymous sniper who must complete missions on behalf of an unspecified military unit, killing enemies he ignore the identity. Far be it from us to be indignant about the absence of an elaborate story in such a product, but a minimum of contextualisation would certainly not have been unpleasant. Wanting to see the glass half full, everything goes in favor of a truly extreme immediacy, given that the tutorial phase is completed within a couple of minutes after which you can already say you are in full control of the features offered by the game . As mentioned at the beginning, Kill Shot is a sui generis FPS, characterized by a greater static nature than the norm: you can therefore only move sideways, as if you were on a track, while the playful emphasis is placed entirely on the act to take aim and eliminate the number of enemies required by the mission. Dragging a finger across the screen shifts the view, and two primary virtual keys allow you to switch to the equipped weapon's optical sight and fire. To overcome a gameplay that is basically rather limited, the developers of Hothead Games have tried to focus on the variety of situations, actually succeeding only in part: therefore if the parameters, objectives and type of opponents change during the different stages , the presence of only four settings and the rather passive attitude of the enemies' artificial intelligence make Kill Shot struggle to rise to something more than a mere military-style target practice. Even from a technical point of view, the game does not show exceptional qualities: the polygonal models appear squared and devoid of great details, and even the shot in slow motion that marks the last kill (with the camera following the bullet in the journey that takes her from the barrel of the rifle to the body of the enemy) certainly does not shine for spectacularity. Lots of in-app purchases and little gameplay make Kill Shot an easily forgettable target practice While not a gameplay champion, Kill Shot doesn't give up on a truly massive amount and incidence of in-app purchases, such as to seriously affect the enjoyment of the product for those who don't want to spend money on it. There are all, absolutely all the tricks typical of free to play titles: the dual currency system (banknotes and gold bars, with the latter only purchasable by credit card and necessary to access the juicier upgrades), the energy indicator that drops every time you participate in a mission, entry barriers to access certain events and a whole series of consumable items capable of giving significant advantages on the battlefield. Large doses of patience and a marked predisposition for grinding are therefore necessary for anyone wishing to approach Kill Shot without necessarily spending a fortune on packets of virtual currency: and even if you want to pursue this path, you still have to dodge the constant - and really annoying - pop-up screens advertising one or another offer from the in-game store. It is evident that the developers of Kill Shot have focused more on this aspect than on the quality of the product's play offer, however obtaining as a result a shooter that is simply not interesting enough to justify large investments of either time or money .", "date": "2014-10-09", "grade": "6.0"}
