Mainly because of Bowser's Fury, a carefree experimentation - and courageous, and interesting - as one rarely sees in such important brands nowadays. This work essentially contains two games: the revival of a classic from 2013 and an adventure that, while recycling its engine, could not head to more distant territories. They are two conceptually distant platformers, and the fact that they are paired generates an offer, as we said, rather bizarre. But, as often happens in the case of the plumber, of unquestionable quality. Let's go in order, and let's start with Super Mario 3D World. The original was presented at E3 2013, and the debut wasn't exactly fulminant: whether it was for the rather anonymous polygonal models (in Mario Party style, to be clear), whether it was for the isometric shot, whether it was for the waiting of a messiah who avoided the premature death of Wii U, the project was not acclaimed by the fans, who expected anything else (something more similar, let's imagine, to the future Super Mario Odyssey). Despite initial doubts, Super Mario 3D World turned out to be an outstanding platformer, which we ourselves strongly praised. The concept of the game was an extension of the one already introduced in Super Mario 3D Land, also developed by Nintendo's edochian division: an attempt to bring the classic mechanics of 2D episodes into three dimensions, sacrificing exploration and putting the conclusion of the course, the overcoming of the obstacles placed between the hero and the flag at the end of the stage. With the intention of making the adventure more accessible to everyone, so that parents and children, enthusiasts and newbies can play together: it is no coincidence that this is the only Super Mario (and not just 3D) in which multiplayer, on Switch enriched by the online mode, it is so important that it has influenced the modeling of every single level. A concept recently taken up, more or less explicitly, by Sackboy: A Big Adventure Super Mario 3D World is now more than seven years old, and Nintendo - with several changes made here and there - has decided to ferry it to Switch, hoping that it will obtain a commercial success greater than that - however good - achieved on Wii U: let's find out together how , and how much (and if) it has aged. Super Mario 3D World, controls and pace As we said, Super Mario 3D World is a three-dimensional episode very different from all the others. More linear, and consequently different - forcibly - also in other areas. Starting from the shot, which tends to be isometric, in this adaptation on Switch slightly, almost imperceptibly more squashed than in the original, so as to emphasize the raising of the general pace of the adventure. Even the commands have anomalies with respect to the norm, amply justified by the concept of the title. The control system is not analog, but structured in eight main directions, so as to simplify the maintenance of a straight trajectory. The race is not managed by the inclination of the control stick alone, but - as in the two-dimensional episodes - it is activated by pressing a button: there are two distinct phases of acceleration, an initial one and a more powerful one which is activated after a few moments. The same jumps are different from the usual: the long one remains, the triple one disappears, and the rebound one is quite important, which can be activated by hitting the ground with the buttocks and, shortly after the impact, by pressing the appropriate button. In general, they are leaps aimed more at practicality than at freedom, functional but far from the depth of Super Mario 64, still a reference in this sense, and from the softness and heterogeneity of Super Mario Odyssey. As you may have read, the dynamism of the characters has been altered, which on Switch have been made - all of them - faster than in the past. This choice, implemented because someone had complained that the action was too slow, generated pros and cons. Playing with Mario, Luigi (faster, acrobatic and imprecise than his brother) or Peach (the slowest, but capable of short glides, suitable for less expert users) is more rewarding, while Toad, the fastest and most agile protagonist, is too dynamic. Attention, we are not saying that it is difficult to control. Simply, since only the characters have been accelerated, without the proportion of the levels or the movement of the enemies being adjusted, Toad has become slightly ~too~ fast in certain stages. A bit like the 200cc mode of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: nice, appaying for expert players, but evidently not harmonized with the level design of the tracks which, initially, did not include it. Super Mario 3D World, levels and content The linear levels of Super Mario 3D World are a pyrotechnic, continuous, uninterrupted level design lesson. Similar to the sonata form adopted by Mozart, each stage proposes an idea, complicates it, and develops it in relation to the setting. For example: is the theme of a journey the sharp spears thrown by the spikes (historic enemy mariesco)? Well, first they are thrown flat, so as to introduce the obstacle. Then they are proposed uphill. Subsequently, tilting planes appear between one platform and another. Finally, each ingredient is placed in the blender: the result is tilting surfaces covered with prickly rods, no longer stuck on solid ground but pile-dwelling. This modus operandi is repeated in each stage, throughout the game. There are more or less successful episodes, but the overall creativity is astonishing, as is the perfection of the execution. The standard stages are interspersed with more anomalous challenges, such as clashes with enemies, rides on the saddle of Plessie (the nautical dinosaur, of a genuine and radiant sympathy, which you can jump on top of if you want to feel guilty), and the Captain Toad puzzle, which even spawned a title of its own (also born on Wii U, also available on Switch). A myriad of ideas, to which we can find only one flaw: although the maps of the various worlds are thematic, in the best two-dimensional tradition, the setting of the individual stages is not influenced by them. This means that in the desert map you could find a level set in a swamp, or in a forest: from this point of view, there is no consistency. Power-up management is very different from other three-dimensional Super Marios. If in the latter the norm is that the upgrades are areal, therefore operable in a single territory, in Super Mario 3D World they can be transported, if you are not hit, even from one level to another. You could end the entire game as a Tanuki, in theory. More similar to the usual power-ups are the headgear, blocks to be placed on the head that allow you to rise in the air like a helicopter, or to shoot; these, unlike the costumes, disappear at the end of each stage. We underline how, certainly not in a hidden way (it is advertised everywhere, including the cover), this game has come closer than any other three-dimensional Mario to creating a symbolic power-up like the classic ones (mushroom, flower, star and leaf), namely the bell that transforms into Cat Mario: the feline suit allows you to claw at enemies, but above all to climb (on Switch more than on Wii U) every wall in the game... including the final flag. The quality of the levels, and the amount of content, is amazing. There is ingenuity from start to finish, and the difficulty itself is developed in a perfectly harmonious way. Why, then, do you read a lower grade at the end of this review than that attributed to other three-dimensional chapters? For a matter that is difficult to objectify, which also involves personal taste. Although it has been sped up, Super Mario 3D World still remains a long way from the adrenaline peaks, immediacy and stentorian rhythm of the best two-dimensional chapters. At the same time, the structuring of the stages, linear and never so evidently ~levels~ (enclosed, circumscribed, clearly there to be crossed and detached from a world that can be perceived as real) makes it less cosmogonic and bewitching than any three-dimensional cousin: the same Super Mario Sunshine, although qualitatively inferior (and not just), is superior in this aspect. Super Mario 3D World, graphics and multiplayer Visually Super Mario 3D World, despite being seven years old, is still very nice... and the resolution raised to 1080p (however more than appreciated) if played with the Dock has little to do with it. Stylistically, this chapter almost coincides with the ideal look of Super Mario, far from the courageous quirks of Super Mario Odyssey: soft and clean, bright, consistent from start to finish. If we have to find a limit to this chapter, it must probably be found in the animations of the protagonists: never poor, but at the same time far from the splendid ones of Mario admired in Odyssey. The game is always fluid at 60fps, perfect, even in the most excited moments: and, we assure you, there are many. Especially in multiplayer. The multiplayer mode, as we anticipated in the introduction, in this title is not a mere kit: on the contrary, it is so important from aver marked the development of each individual internship. Which makes the work done in terms of level design even more amazing: each course can be traversed by one to four players, without the rhythm being damaged. Obtaining such a result requires extremely refined craftsmanship, a rare mastery. The multiplayer is inserted to have fun together: it can be tackled in a more or less competitive way, but it is certainly not addressed, nor designed, for a record race. Rather, it is structured to guarantee a pleasant experience playing with friends or family, therefore with the simultaneous presence of expert users and novices: it is one of the reasons why, for example, it is not allowed to select four Toads (each player must choose a different character ). In certain internships it is even essential, to continue, to communicate live: something that, at times, could complicate the online experience, absent on the original for Wii U. In this regard, we participated in two online sessions organized by Nintendo. The first one didn't go very well; the second, let's imagine after some changes to the code, went smoothly (both took place in four players). We tested one of the fastest stages in the game, and we didn't notice any particular problems, apart from a minimal input lag. Even on the net, the dominant spirit of multiplayer, rather than competition, remains that of crossing a level together in a light-hearted way. The saves, as we had already highlighted in the preview phase, are recorded only by the user who opened the room. Bowser's Fury, genesis and structure Super Mario 3d World has been adapted to Switch in collaboration between various teams: EPD 8 (responsible for the original), 1-Up Studio and NST, an acronym for Nintendo Software Technology, the US division of the company, engaged in similar projects in recent years ( had already converted, for example, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker). We're guessing that the same group worked on Bowser's Fury, which would explain various anomalies. Firstly because, although the game is essentially an open world, it uses the Super Mario 3D World engine (the most linear in the series) and not that of Odyssey. At the same time, despite the background quality, Bowser's Fury has some imperfections that the works developed in Tokyo have never highlighted: not only does the title go (at the moment) to 30fps if played on a laptop, but it is also the victim of some slowdowns, and of a rather annoying pop-up. In short, it is probable that this experiment too was carried out in collaboration between the United States and Japan. We don't know if Bowser's Fury represents an impromptu episode, or could constitute a clue to the future of the three-dimensional saga: perhaps Nintendo has dared to take a small step towards this path, waiting to find out how it will be received. Net of the imperfections we wrote about, ignoring the small size of the project and the almost totally recycled content from Super Mario 3D World, we were thrilled. Literally enthusiastic. Bowser's Fury could be the right formula to project Mario into the next decade, to make him the protagonist of another era of video games. The open world has been the dominant setting in recent years, and many series have embraced it too lightheartedly. The way it fits into Bowser's Fury, however, is extremely interesting: we enjoyed what we played, but we were even more enthralled by the prospect of what could happen if Nintendo committed its best minds to making a great new Super Mario who follows in his footsteps. Bowser's Fury is essentially a world of Super Mario Bros. 3 translated into three dimensions: in this case, given the setting, the best parallelism could be with the aquatic world (the third). The open map replacing the one from above; Plessie in place of the raft. And the paths, the ~levels~, indicated at the entrance by the presence of a feliform arch: linear paths inserted in an open context. The possible sublimation of each step of the over thirty-year career of the Italian-American plumber. Bowser's Fury, the making Avoiding the future talks about the potential of this structure, Bowser's Fury turns out to be an excellent miniature game (whose duration, based on your needs and your ability, could vary from four to ten hours). Apart from the movement of the shot behind Super Mario, the engine and the contents are taken entirely from Super Mario 3D World: the controls, therefore, are in eight directions. A seemingly inadequate choice for an open world adventure, but which is functional once you enter the effects", "date": "2021-02-10", "grade": "9.1"}
