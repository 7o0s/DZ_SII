{"name": "TOHU", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tohu-recensione.html", "text": "Fireart Games, former authors of Spirit Roots, and the publisher The Irregular Corporation take us to a new world that blends technology and nature. Let's talk about TOHU, a point and click adventure with a delicious style. Is good graphics enough? Find out in our TOHU review. A simple story in a beautiful world TOHU accompanies us in an archipelago of flying fish-planets. One night, while everyone is sleeping, a strange light descends from the sky and, when it goes out, a shadowy figure appears and destroys the Sacred Engine, a machine that protects the world of TOHU. We will guide the two protagonists of the story, the little girl Puff and her robotic friend Cubus, who will try to repair the contraption. To do this, they will need the help of Uncle Scrap, who however lives on another fish-planet. Puff is able to talk, climb and pass in tight places, while Cubus is strong and can therefore marry large objects. By adding the capabilities of the two characters, we will advance from planet to planet. The plot of TOHU is very simple, a small unpretentious fairy tale, illustrated to us through a narrative voice in the passage from one island to another. The really interesting part is the world created by Fireart Games. The developers have in fact taken care of every environment down to the smallest detail. The world of TOHU is an interesting mix between technology and nature that reminded us of Machinarium (with a much sweeter style). In each screen there are dozens and dozens of details: small robotic animals move around the environment (most of which also react to touch, with dedicated animations), the rooms are filled with absurd-looking objects, furniture and characters . Indeed, TOHU never tries to be realistic and upsets gravity, time and spatial dimensions, creating visually elaborate and extremely enjoyable environments for the eye. The animations of the characters, in particular, are very accurate. For example, the protagonists interact with objects differently depending on the distance. Cubus, instead of approaching and activating a switch, will throw its head, while Puff will use a cable to pick up objects. Graphics are for sure TOHU's biggest selling point and every play area is very different from each other. Also on a musical level, Fireart Games has worked hard to give a strong identity to each section as well as to take care of the sound effects of objects and animals. As is typical of the genre, if you get stuck in a screen there is a risk that the constant repetition of some sounds may start to annoy you, but it will be more the exception than the norm. Point & Click unpretentious but with problems But let's talk about the gameplay. As mentioned, TOHU is a point and click adventure, and from this point of view you shouldn't expect anything strange: each section of the game is divided into three screens and, often, they must be tackled one at a time in a linear way. It's a very simple game that won't challenge veterans of the genre. Using Puff and Cubus' abilities, we will basically have to collect objects and solve small puzzles and quick mini-games. It will never be necessary, for example, to combine part of your tools to create new ones, so the interactions will always be very clear. Furthermore, even the less experienced need not fear: each game area offers help that can be activated from the menu via a simple mini-game (a sort of quick time event with infinite attempts), so even in case of doubts it will be impossible to get stuck. Some interactions aren't exactly logical, but the limited number of possibilities will allow you to complete each section without too much hassle. Now let's talk about the TOHU input system: the commands, on Nintendo Switch, are double. You can control a pointer using the Left Stick or you can interact via the Touch Screen. Unfortunately the latter has some problems with the interaction of certain elements, especially in the case in which they must be dragged. The pointer, on the other hand, is very slow and often inaccurate, so we'll have to switch from one system to another trying to make life less complicated. Of course, the best solution is to play TOHU on PC. The real problem is that TOHU suffers from multiple technical problems. On a couple of occasions, for example, the characters froze: it was impossible to activate any command. It's enough, most of the time, to save in place and reload, but in one case we had to use an autosave and repeat a section of the game in order to get past the block. However, towards 80% of the game, we encountered a bug that prevented us from continuing. The only solution was to start a new game. At the same point, problem nonot reoccurred, so we can assume it was a random bug that could be completely fixed with a patch. In any case, it is our duty to point it out to you and warn you. There are also some graphical problems: TOHU allows you to activate zooms with R, in order to interact more precisely with some smaller elements, but in some situations the screen goes black and it is necessary to reset the area in order to solve the problem . Clearly, the aforementioned issues are related to the Nintendo Switch version - we have no way to verify the other versions of TOHU. As far as longevity goes, expect a maximum of six hours of gameplay on your first playthrough. The more experienced will certainly need less time: in about three hours they could finish the whole adventure, if they never get stuck in front of any puzzle or mini-game. In the title there are also a whole series of collectibles: these are robotic animals scattered throughout the screens, always very visible, and a click will be enough to unlock a small dedicated drawing. They are very easy to find and most players will find them all from the first game: moreover, they will hardly want to replay just to recover the lost ones.", "date": "2021-01-28", "grade": "6.0"}
