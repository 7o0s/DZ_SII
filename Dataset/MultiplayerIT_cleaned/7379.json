If you're wondering if it was worth waiting all this time, we'll solve the dilemma right away. Yes, Notch's masterpiece retains its charm even in this incarnation, thanks to the fabulous conversion work carried out by 4J Studios. However, the wait has brought a series of pleasant surprises that can increase the interest of those who approach the game for the first time. Minecraft keeps its charm unchanged even in its Playstation 3 edition How do you change 4J Studios wasn't joking by stating that they would update the game to make it more and more similar to the PC counterpart. The times of Beta 1.6.6 are long gone, which despite the many limitations gave a particular charm to the Microsoft version. The Playstation 3 edition natively integrates many of the features introduced with the Update Adventure, technically called Beta 1.8. The additions are not few, starting from the possibility of running with two quick taps on the analog stick, the introduction of an experience level system, the appetite, many new objects, the creative mode and a real final boss represented by the dragon Ender. The product therefore takes on connotations more similar to a finished game, while not losing the abstract and alienating effect of a world completely in our hands. If we have to think of something more similar to the experience proposed by Minecraft it is impossible not to mention the legendary LEGO constructions, only that in this case our unbridled imagination has to deal with a universe that thrives on precise dynamics. It is in fact a true ecosystem where flora and fauna develop over a (unfortunately) limited area, the first and greatest distinctive sign compared to the boundless version for Personal Computers. There is also a very important day/night cycle for the game's economy, since the fall of darkness favors the appearance of very dangerous lethal creatures for the protagonist, who must be ready to repel the threat by exploiting natural resources and crafting objects. If the first hours are particularly difficult, the subsequent accumulation of precious material allows you to build weapons, armor and, better yet, shelters capable of guaranteeing nights without nightmares. But the enormous customization of the game is able to meet the needs of anyone, so much so that you can completely eliminate the presence of monsters to enjoy the map and your creations. From this point of view, the Creative mode becomes crucial, where we rise (literally!) from any physical limitation to set up the world of our dreams. In the grove of my fantasy Technically Minecraft maintains the essential retro style that we all know by now, with a three-dimensional world represented in pixelated blocks and characterized by uniform colors, as if it were a gigantic toy. Despite the childish and ~playful~ aesthetic aspect, the game still stands out for its toughness, with the protagonist losing all the objects and the experience accumulated in the event of death, making it necessary to return to the place of death to recover at least the 'equipment. An eventuality that is far from rare if the presence of the ~mobs~ is activated. The programmers have tried to smooth this aspect by adding the possibility of being reborn alongside a chest containing essential items, but it is a benefit that is only offered once, proving to be scarcely preferable to loading the last save. The splendid atmosphere remains unchanged, in many ways guaranteed by the soundtrack by Daniel ~C418~ Rosenfeld, faithfully reproduced here. The German musician enchants again with his ambient electronic compositions, so we will hear again Sweden's magnificent piano, with its melancholy veins that have made it a timeless classic. Unfortunately, the music of the Playstation 3 version has been encoded at a decidedly low bitrate, a factor that introduces a series of sound artifacts that do not do the songs justice at all. It is also possible to load personalized soundtracks, drawing from the songs present on the console. Playstation 3 trophies Minecraft for Playstation 3 features 29 trophies to conquer, some really hilarious like those that require you to mistreat a poor pig by riding it with a saddle, or the crazy feat of building a huge rail that crosses the entire map. It will be really fun: good luck! The light at the end of the tunnel As mentioned, the main advantage of this edition is again attributable to the skill of 4J Studios,who have made the most of the experience accumulated on Xbox 360. The interface has been completely redesigned from a console perspective, resulting incredibly simple but at the same time complex enough to guarantee considerable decision-making power to the player. The limited area itself sacrifices the idea of a world without borders, but at the same time increases the importance of contextual dynamics. It is therefore an interpretation of the original game before a direct porting, a path that through compromises has found an unexpected synergy with the pad. All this has been perfectly transported in the Playstation 3 edition, obviously including the possibility of playing both in local split screen with friends and online, inviting them to our game session. However, we are less satisfied with the lack of implementation of additional skins and texture packs - although the game is updated to support them, there is still no trace of them on the store. We hope that the problem will be resolved soon.", "date": "2013-12-30", "grade": "9.0"}
