Not so much the events as the sensations, the ones one felt in front of an illustrated book, perhaps the ones with three-dimensional paper constructions that unfolded with each new page. It wasn't yet the time of video games as we know them today, and thinking about it, no one would have ever imagined applications such as augmented reality, controllers that transform on the screen into magic wands and a book of spells that magically comes to life. It is precisely on these sensations that Sony has focused with Wonderbook: The Book of Spells; and he didn't bet little on it, on the contrary: he reserved large spaces for the product during his conferences, perhaps making core gamers turn up their noses but undoubtedly winking at fathers, mothers and invariably very young users, those who would not hesitate to buy (or, better, to be given as a gift) a PlayStation Move and a PlayStation Eye video camera to be able to sit on the carpet, in the living room, in front of the TV, with this book of wonders on your lap and the possibility of seeing your fantasies come true. We've seen plenty of video demonstrations, but we can assure you that they don't make the first-person experience in the slightest, extraordinarily full of potential when observed through the eyes of a child. Let's get ready for the magic The package of Wonderbook: The Book of Spells includes the Book of Spells, a large volume of twelve pages, with a rather robust rubberized cover, evidently designed for intensive use by a very young user, and the game disc. After the partial installation of the data, a simple guide to the configuration of PlayStation Move and PlayStation Eye starts, with the latter preferably placed under the TV screen and oriented downwards so that it can film us while we are sitting on the ground, with the book on the legs. Obviously the more light there is in the room, the better the video performance will be. After that it is possible to create a new profile by taking an ~animated photo~ similar to those seen in the Harry Potter films (this is very funny). This profile can optionally be linked to a pre-existing account on Pottermore.com, the interesting mix of social networking and adventure created in collaboration with J.K. Rowling, an author who Sony strongly wanted to link to the Wonderbook franchise and who for the occasion made the universe she created available, with the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and its four ~houses~: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw , Hufflepuff and Slytherin. Unlike Rowling's novels, in the game it will not be the Sorting Hat who assigns us to a house, but we will be able to freely select the one we want to be part of and therefore opt for a different choice in the future, so as to dissect the experience in all its facets . Pampulu, pimpulu, parimpamp The ~campaign~ of Wonderbook: The Book of Spells consists of five chapters, each divided into two parts, and is structured in many ways like a real educational course, in which we are taught magic and we have to face exams to demonstrate that you have learned them. As mentioned, the ~visual~ functioning of the game is completely based on augmented reality, and in fact on the TV screen the Move controller becomes a magic wand, in this case the one we have chosen among the available ones, and the book comes alive and is colored each new page, revealing surprising content and often entertaining us with interactive fairy tales that tell anecdotes related to the spells we are about to learn. The interface is also based on this system: you have to touch the center of the cover with the wand and press the T trigger to open the chapter menu, then indicate the one we want to try and open the book. The sequence of the pages assumes regular connotations, in the sense that it always starts from an introduction and then moves on to the didactic phase, with the verbal pronunciation of the spell and the learning of the gestures that we must perform with the controller to recall the magic in question by holding down the Move key. There's something for everyone: spells to emit water or fire from the wand, to levitate objects or change their size, to raise barriers or open padlocks, fix something broken or clean up a dirty room, and so on. Playstation 3 trophies Obtaining the thirty-six Trophies contained in Wonderbook: The Book of Spells is a fairly simple operation, given that most of the achievements are linked to learning the spells and completing the various tests.For the little ones, but who are tenacious From a structural point of view, the London Studios title does not disappoint expectations and is exactly the casual production we expected, a real dream come true for children, even more so if they are fans of Harry Potter. It could perhaps have been richer in long-distance content, but in the end the offer is adequate for the sale price (39.90 euros for the stand-alone package, 69.90 euros for the bundle with PlayStation Move and PlayStation Eye) and there is talk of continuous support with new adventures and, perhaps, some variations on the theme. In any case, the experience appears really well represented and the tests we are subjected to after learning the spells are not even that trivial, boasting a fair degree of challenge in the more advanced stages. In these situations the camera ~plays~ with our shot, making our living room appear as a sort of ~window~ that opens onto a magical world to interact with, and at the end of the test some sequences of our actions are even saved. There are some uncertainties, for example on a couple of occasions we noticed bugs that prevented us from continuing (an object that didn't catch fire as it should have, an event that didn't occur) and which fortunately disappeared simply by retrying the ~mission ~, but in general the technical realization seemed well cared for, with an excellent narration in Italian (essential for a title of this kind) and an excellent musical accompaniment, capable of contributing substantially to the creation of the necessary atmosphere. It was natural to be skeptical about Wonderbook: The Book of Spells, because clearly it is not a product designed for adult users. However, if you have a small child or a grandchild and you don't know what to get them for Christmas, well, the package packaged by Sony approaches the concept of ~perfect gift~, it intertwines very well with the contents of J.K. Rowling and even boasts some educational implications, which never hurt.", "date": "2012-11-13", "grade": null}
