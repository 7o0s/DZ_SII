The concept, born with the parallel series Touchgrind, in which, however, stunts were performed aboard a skateboard, sees the player use two fingers on the screen to control the ends of a BMX inside courses full of ramps from which to stand out spectacular jumps. Once in the air, you can move your fingers through the most varied combinations to perform a large number of tricks: turns of the handlebars or the ~tail~ of the bike, full forward, backward or sideways rotations; but also and above all multiple manoeuvres, to be performed while the BMX is upside down in one direction or the other, or carried out in rapid succession. Succeeding in these feats is clearly not very easy and the difficulty increases according to the complexity of the stunt, with many factors that come into play: the arrival speed on the ramp and therefore the effective ~flight~ time, the promptness of the input and its speed, as well as finally the ability to stop the movement in time for the bike to land correctly, thus avoiding wasting the effort with a disastrous fall. The formula still works very well, we said, and builds the progression of Touchgrind BMX 2 around a series of challenges. In fact, each scenario boasts its own set of stunts which, once performed, give us experience points useful for leveling up and unlock boxes in which we can find purely aesthetic upgrades, with which we can have fun customizing our two-wheeler. Quail jumping The developers of Touchgrind BMX 2 have done an excellent job of enriching the experience compared to the first episode, increasing not only the acrobatic maneuvers at our disposal but also the scenarios, which go from the original six to nine locations in total. An asynchronous competitive multiplayer has also been added to the structure, in which one takes turns with the tracks in search of the high score, as well as the replay sharing function on Facebook. However, there is a small problem: if the original chapter could be purchased for 3.99 euros to obtain the complete package, this sequel adopts a freemium model which in fact allows you to unlock only the first three routes (the medieval Highland Ruins, the dizzying The Ridge and Devil's Leap, with its urban views), while all the others must be purchased separately. And how much do they cost? From 2.29 to 3.49 euros each, although there is the possibility of buying them all in a single solution at the discounted price of 8.99 euros: figures substantially above the average for productions on the App Store and Google play. From a technical point of view, the game boasts fairly well-made polygonal models and a certain variety in the characterization of the scenarios, as could be expected, but also some camera going crazy when you collide with an obstacle or fall at the end of a jump. The replays themselves are pleasant to watch, although boasting only two possible camera angles and the lack of a 'virtual athlete' on the bike, which would certainly have made the recorded sequences more spectacular. Little to say instead about the audio sector, reduced to a minimum.", "date": "2018-04-24", "grade": "7.0"}
