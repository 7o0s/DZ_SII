The transition to the current generation of consoles as regards Pro Evolution Soccer has been quite traumatic in this sense, because the series has veered towards an arcade vein and carried ~historical~ defects on its back which over time have become less and less bearable. It has never lost that component of fun especially in offline multiplayer, but it is clear that these days and in the light of an annual release there is a need for something more, a change that can bring the series back to the highest levels of a time. PES 2011 seems to want to head in this direction, at least all the new features are spot on and we can finally look to the future with optimism. Customization issue This year's testimonial could only be the flea Lionel Messi, protagonist of the introductory film and background for the main menu, which as per tradition has a new, very stylish graphic design. The more curious can find all the news of the game in a full-bodied movie that starts occasionally when you leave the title on the home screen, in any case the features that catch the eye are represented by the confirmation of the Champion's League and the introduction of the Santander Cup Libertadores and Master League Online. We will return to the latter later, the first two certainly represent some of the factors that increase the atmosphere and identification, as in PES 2011 these two competitions are reproduced in all respects starting from the logos, passing through music background (even the ode to joy in the case of the Libertadores), sponsors in the stadiums and the graphics that illustrate the formations on the field rather than statistics and results. A painstaking and truly appreciable job for those who follow football live and on TV, and a good ~excuse~ to increase hard and pure longevity. In support we also have the European Super Cup and the Europa League, similarly equipped with their own initials and outline graphics. Before approaching the playing field, it is good to note which are the most interesting options that PES 2011 makes available, beyond the installation on the hard disk (optional and it takes just under 7 minutes), the possibility of using the music from own dashboard, the language of the commentary and a six-page long statistics section that expresses in detail everything done with the various game modes. The section called extra content is potentially interesting and first of all allows you to download the updated squads (for the record, in our review copy the latest transfers were not yet present, such as core 'ngrato Quagliarella from Napoli to Juventus) and to access a sort of internal shop through which you can buy hairstyles, even irregularly shaped balls (like a barrel!), boots, classic players and teams up to retro music and special liveries for stadiums through the use of GP that you accumulate by winning matches and more. You read that right, this year the PES 2011 editor is extremely complete, starting from the creation of new players or the customization of existing ones without restrictions, passing through the name of the leagues and their logos. In the latter case it is possible to build it from scratch with a special interface or take a picture with the camera or even import images from disk. The stadium editor is equally complete, it is possible to create one from scratch but with a fixed form; the interesting thing is the choice of the type of grandstand among those available, the livery of the roof, ceiling and fences, the color of the seats, the benches, the type of lighting and the background. All liveries can be customized with images imported from the hard disk while, as mentioned, there are also funny and retro ones such as those of Gradius and Castlevania, which can be purchased in the extras menu. Imagine a game with your pumpkin-headed players in a brightly colored stadium with a spaceship in the background. Playstation 3 trophies PES 2011 offers 28 trophies, of which 5 gold and 11 silver. To get them all you obviously need to win the Champions League and Copa Libertadores on any level of difficulty, while the longer ones are linked to the perfect season in the Master League rather than obtaining recognition withme best player in the world in Become a Legend. The most difficult online instead involves being able to get 75% of victories in the last 20 ranked games. The pre-game You're dying to know how the game is, right? We're getting there! Once a match of any kind has been selected, based on the mode chosen, it is as always possible to manage all the parameters related to the stadium, balls and weather conditions. The management of your team has undergone heavy changes in the interface and Konami has done an excellent job to make it more intuitive and immediate, according to the drag'n drop concept. In the half of the screen used for personal information there is in fact a miniature playing field with dots inside that represent the owners and on the side instead the exploded and completely visible list of players on the bench and in the stands. At this point, any modification of the formation, position or other is done with a free cursor which allows you to make substitutions quickly and intuitively, a decisive step forward compared to the previous edition. At the base of the field shown, it is instead possible to set up the strategies to be recalled on the field, the management of ball possession and so on; particular mention should be made for the management of the feints so dear to the most savvy players. Their use is delegated to the right analog stick, the interesting thing is that they can be completely customized and linked together according to the four cardinal directions, relative to the player's position or fixed. Thanks to a special editor, it is possible, for example, to associate the double step followed by a dry dribble to the left and then the elastic to the right, up to a maximum of four feints per direction. There's also simulation, but every time we've tried it in a game we've been inexorably booked. Free passages The Pardo-Altafini couple, although divided in reality due to the transfer of the first to Mediaset Premium, is once again waiting for the players on the playing field and does its honest job. From a technical point of view, the transitions from one comment to another have improved and everything appears credible compared to what happens on the screen, even if there are some blunders which apparently after so many years are impossible to eliminate. Speaking of the actual gameplay, Konami seems to have largely captured the problems that characterized the previous chapters and first of all the pace of the game has dropped significantly (in any case it is possible to reduce or increase the speed by two points) and the differences among the various players they are marked in fundamentals such as dribbling and reactivity, but are less unrealistic or tending to the arcade. To give an example, Messi can only have the upper hand if launched at speed with sufficient space and in counter-time with respect to the defender, because now it is no longer possible to buck tens of meters using only speed, but he is caught up quite quickly by the opponents. To support this new type of gameplay there is also an excellent physicality in the game contrasts, clearly perceptible and linked to the size of each player. The clashes without the ball are now punished more and finally even the obstruction does not go unnoticed by the referee as well as the pressure of X and square to call the pressing, which if obsessive or in any case out of time leads only to the whistle of the foul. Another rather important novelty is represented by the 360-degree passages: now it is finally possible to make the passage in the desired direction, also having to dose the power according to the distance. A step forward that allows you to increase the variety of the game produced and experiment with previously inaccessible solutions for the series, which also for this reason was pointed out as having too much arcade mold in its fundamentals. In any case, Konami has opted not to give the player the choice on the degree of freedom of the passes, routing him instead where he deems best, reaching a compromise between automatism and complete manual ability and making up for the imperfect precision of the analog in relation to the view: so just frame well the area where you want to direct the ball, and if there is a teammate the pass itself will be quite precise. The moment of the goal Last but not least, the animation system has been completely rewritten and now we have some really beautiful ones to see and more blended together than in the past, even if we are not yet at the level of the competition. In any case, it is enough to scrutinize any replay to appreciate its quality and variety which is not an end in itself because the reactivity of the players on the pitch also benefits from itand ~waiting times~ during tackles or other situations that require a minimum of automation. In this regard, there remain some panic situations such as tussle on the line or undersized deviation: in this case the defender will most of the time sweep the ball perhaps in a corner kick, an ~imposed~ automatism but which seems acceptable to us from the point of view of wanting simulate a football match and not a race between supermen. All these modifications and novelties give a decidedly fresh sensation to PES 2011 and make it finally turn towards simulation, given that it is necessary to set up the action in a maneuvered way more than before considering that the artificial intelligence of the opponents covers the field in better way. To compete at high levels it is also absolutely necessary to use various strategies and tactics to allow the team, for example, to better manage the counterattack or to widen when the opponent is very closed; to make a comparison in the previous episodes the need to have to deal with the directives and other things we had felt much less. However, what brings the series back to earth and in canons that have become bored by now are those infamous tracks that do not allow complete control of the player. Even if they have been reduced or eliminated in some situations, in others they remain and are downright annoying, such as at all lineout lines, but also in the presence of loose balls that have to be chased by both teams. A real pity because the total control over the players would have allowed to further increase the variety and the simulation vein of the title, probably it would have really been the discriminating factor for a complete revolution of the saga for which we will have to wait a little longer. Another heavy defect, this time conceptual, is the little effort made by Konami with regards to the licenses of teams and consequently of the players. For example, seeing Serie A without an official name and logo in 2010 rather than the English championship decimated by the lack of teams with official names and uniforms is frankly unacceptable. A few other European championships would not have hurt, even if thanks to the Libertadores cup new teams have been added which in any case have less appeal for our local gamers. Clarification relating to our championship, Zamparini's Palermo seems to have given many headaches to both Konami and Electronic Arts, as they do not have the official uniform in any of their productions. A note of merit instead on the technical aspect, where Konami has once again managed to do an excellent job in the creation of jerseys and players' faces, which are impressive for their resemblance to the most famous ones and good for others too: see a Grava of the Perfectly reproduced Naples is indeed quite striking. The rest of the technical sector is good as mentioned in the players and in the textures, the direction linked to the salient moments or to other things such as substitutions, fouls and in general the whole outline of the match is very well done and certainly helps to increase the identification, this However, this year Konami introduced a blur effect that is applied, for example, when reviewing a shot or in celebrations; it would also be nice if it weren't so accentuated in some cases, ~practice~ that makes us think of a use to mask some imperfection in the frame rate. All online! We have left out the Master League and Become a Legend mode as they are largely similar to previous versions except for some extended options and refinements such as the Europa League license rather than more complete transfer management and international call-ups. In the first case, however, there is the completely new online version, where it is possible to challenge other players with your team and access a transfer market that ~fluctuates~ based on the movements of all the participants. For example, if a Messi is bought by several players, its value rises more and more, making it more difficult to buy. Unfortunately, as always happens every year for both PES and FIFA, during the review phase we were unable to fully test the online and ascertain the presence or absence of lag with many players. We will leave this analysis to a future special, in the meantime we can continue our description with the possibility of playing with your own created player or even organize, thanks to the community option, real championships where you can access the statistics, the calendar, the rankings various among friends and in general all the players who join it. A final method that we have found but not tested is called ~synthesis of the final~,", "date": "2010-09-28", "grade": "8.9"}
