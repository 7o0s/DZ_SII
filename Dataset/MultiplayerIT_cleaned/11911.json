{"name": "GRIME", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grime-recensione-metroidvania.html", "text": "Metroidvanias have curiously gone from an endangered genre to the heart of independent production, so much so that today they are seen by the public as ~easy~ projects, almost as if they were ideal shortcuts for new teams eager to enter the market. Nothing could be more wrong, since, although not particularly demanding from a purely technical point of view, they are games where a map design of insufficient quality or poorly designed mechanics can immediately destroy the entire structure. Therefore, although it is a road often traveled by minor software houses, the appearance of titles of this type capable of dealing with the progenitors of the genre remains rare to say the least, and a new attempt always deserves a little curiosity from part of those who work in the sector. The case of GRIME undoubtedly falls within what has been described, but this work created by a small Israeli development house has actually captured our attention more for its very particular graphic style than for the structure. In fact, the game sees you in the role of a strange stone individual grappling with an abstract world full of dangers, and initially it seemed to be something extraordinarily original in its field. However, it is not the case to be deceived by a superficial glance: the work of Clover Bite is in fact a production with a unique look, but mechanically and structurally it actually represents a mixture of elements taken from much better known games. So get ready to read our GRIME review, where we tried to figure out whether or not the final result is worthy of the Olympus of the genre. A dark story A GRIME boss fight GRIME begins with two alien humanoids copulating in the cosmic void, and as you can well imagine this is certainly not a common starting point for a video game. The nature of the deed and any meanings are not explained; you simply immediately find yourself in the shoes of an individual carved in stone (literally), who appears out of nowhere in the depths of a dark world entirely composed of rock and organic elements, with a sort of black hole instead of a head. In short, if not was clear, it is not the case to expect a crystalline and understandable narrative from the work of Clover Bite and Akupara Games: the underlying story is as abstract as the world that the player crosses, and many of the most important explanations are left to the player's imagination . It doesn't mean that everything is done at random, mind you: the game has an overall understandable background storyline, and its world is curiously populated by sentient characters able to communicate with the protagonist; the developers have simply opted to go the ~Miyazaki way~, creating a narrative that can only be justified by paying attention to the details and covering the holes with their own theories. This solution, in our opinion, is more than suitable for a game with a similar universe. The works of From Software, however, have not only inspired the team's approach to the story. The underlying title remains a metroidvania with a more linear than average structure, but the influence of Souls is obvious and has taken root in almost every constituent element, primarily in the gameplay and in the progression of one's alter ego. The difficulties of a chiseled stone The fights in GRIME are particularly challenging The characteristics common to the From works are evident from the first minutes of the game, and not only for the presence of monoliths that act as checkpoints and lead to a reappearance of enemies when used, or for the existence of a resource that replaces experience and is achieved by eliminating enemies called ~mass~. Precisely the entire growth of the protagonist is built around the same foundations of those titles, with statistics that - although less numerous than those of the From Software games - directly influence which weapons are usable, and the variable bonuses that make them more or less suitable to each specific build as the damage increases differently based on which stats you focus on. The ~corpse run~ has also been recovered, but here it is in a different form. In fact, the mass to level up is not lost once killed, and recovering one's body allows one to obtain a few life points and part of one's ~ardour~: a resource that speeds up the recovery of experience and multiplies based on how long will you survive with limited damage. Further similarities? The general difficulty. GRIME boasts varied and rather aggressive enemies - even if the patterns of many of their types are similar - and forces you to advance cautiously, as overdoing it quickly leads to death. Checkpoint rather distancesyou (difficult to find more than two per map) and really difficult bosses obviously don't help you to advance without thoughts. Overall however, it is precisely this high level of challenge that raises the quality of the game beyond what we would have expected, as it forces you to make the most of the intuitive combat mechanics, and significantly increases the overall tension as you explore. Rocky gameplay A wonderful scenery of GRIME Basically, GRIME's battles are quite basic: the Clover Bite title provides a large number of weapons equipped with specific move sets, and big differences in the timing of the blows and range, but any tool has available two attacks on the ground and two on the jump and consumes part of a inevitable stamina bar. The only extra maneuver outside of the jump is a quick dodge, which in turn depends on the remaining stamina. To really distinguish the system from the crowd is only one mechanic: a counter that you are introduced to already during the prologue. It is a defensive power that remains active for a fairly large window, but it doesn't just repel enemy attacks, but damages them to the point of being able to absorb them. Once we have sucked enough creatures into the black hole that replaces the protagonist's face, we will be able to activate special passive powers with often extremely beneficial effects (including stamina regeneration or maneuver enhancements). attack animations and using it with the right timing is practically always central both to make the slower weapons less risky to use, and to respond to the offensive patterns of the more unpredictable enemies. Really interesting to see how a simple well-applied defensive move manages to improve everything else. Returning instead to the absorption of powers, we are not faced with a revolutionary gimmick, for heaven's sake, yet it gives a discreet variety of approach that goes well with everything else. In addition, the exploration is quite satisfying due to well-designed maps and the presence of powers related to their crossing, usually obtainable after eliminating the bosses. In GRIME it is possible to strike from above Now, we are not in front of a metroidvania whose labyrinthine locations will leave you speechless; as previously mentioned, GRIME's progress is very linear, and takes place mostly for very diversified macro-zones, usually characterized by enemies of specific types and by a limited number of crossroads containing various secrets or important shortcuts. In general, however, the developers have managed to create intelligent and quick maps to navigate when necessary, not to mention that a little spice is added by the need to find crystals to be able to make them appear on the screen, otherwise a blind advance similar to what seen in Hollow Knight. This last element probably won't go down well with everyone (as happened for the pearl of Team Cherry), but it's a conscious choice and it didn't bother us too much during the campaign. In short, GRIME is a tangle of ideas borrowed here and there, but it is still a product capable of skilfully mixing its ingredients, accompanied by an exceptional technical sector. The surrealist inspiration of the game is evident, yet that of Clover Bite's work is a more contained surrealism, which never indulges in excesses and follies despite the fact that it manages to be as disturbing as it is inspired in certain moments. The artistic direction of the game is moreover concrete and devoted to gameplay, therefore we are more often approached by the cold plasticine of stop motion films than by the unpredictable creativity of Dal's works, despite the fact that the inspiration of certain locations is absolutely undeniable. Undoubtedly passed with full marks from this point of view.", "date": "2021-08-09", "grade": "8.0"}
