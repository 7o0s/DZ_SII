In recent times, however, developer Omega Force has had the opportunity to work on world-famous brands - such as One Piece, Ken the Warrior, Berserk or Dragon Quest - which have helped to spread the musou culture more. Generally considered titles with repetitive and chaotic gameplay, these third-person action games are instead very popular in Japan and this would explain why Nintendo wanted to entrust Omega Force and Team Ninja with the development of a spin-off inspired by The Legend of Zelda. It was 2014 when Hyrule Warriors timidly peeked out on the shelves dedicated to Wii U and Nintendo 3DS: many of us frowned, only to change our minds about the quality of a title that was so repetitive, but also damned fun and very rich in content. A few years later, Nintendo tries again the licensed musou experiment with a spin-off of Fire Emblem, the beloved fantasy strategic saga by Intelligent Systems. Are we really faced with the usual musou? Size comparison We immediately want to clarify our position on a rather thorny issue that has followed the development of the game and which has raised a huge fuss in the community of passionate Fire Emblem fans: the roster. The great historical enthusiasts have little digested the choice to focus Fire Emblem Warriors mainly on the latest chapters released for Nintendo 3DS, considered unrepresentative. There are no Roy or Ike in this musou, but above all the protagonists of Fire Emblem Awakening, Fire Emblem Fates and Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia with a small hint of Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Fire Emblem released in 2003 for Game Boy Advance. The playable characters - net of any DLC yet to be defined - are for example Chrom, Lucina, Daraen, Ryoma, Xander, Celica, Lyn, Marth and others for a total of twenty-three. The roster didn't bother us in the slightest, also because the choice of Nintendo, which undoubtedly supervised the project closely, makes perfect sense: it is clear that the big N wanted to push the most recent and popular Fire Emblems that relaunched the brand all over the world when, just a few years ago, it was not even localized for the western market anymore. What annoyed us a bit, if anything, was the fact that some characters are actually ~clones~ of others. Lucina and Chrom, for example, are played in exactly the same way, as are pegasus knights or archers. This tends not to be a huge flaw either, but Hyrule Warriors at launch offered a more diversified roster. Having made this premise, our greatest fear was that the aforementioned heroes dragged along the characterization problems that have plagued the last few Fire Emblems. As bizarre as the plot of Fire Emblem Warriors is, we instead found a more than decent script that convincingly justifies the meeting of all these characters, using the dialogues and cutscenes to characterize them in the best possible way every time they interact. The real protagonists of the story are the princes Rowan and Lianna of Aytolis, a kingdom that suddenly suffers the attack of a horde of monsters. The queen entrusts her children with a magical shield and the two set out to find a way to drive off the invaders, regularly running into the heroes of the other Fire Emblems who come from parallel dimensions that all of a sudden have opened up to that of the two princes. Sometimes our people will have to team up, other times make their way through the bad ones, but in any case they will end up discovering a much more dangerous threat than they believed and which will require everyone's efforts: we will follow their adventures during a story mode that it lasts about fifteen hours and allows you to control up to four characters in increasingly complicated missions in which you will not only have to slice hundreds of enemies, but also rack your brains. The art of war As a counterpoint to the Story we find the Epic mode: it recalls the Adventure section which represented the heart of Hyrule Warriors, enormously prolonging its longevity on Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. In this case, the Japanese developer has made some tweaks to the excellent formula of the past, making it more accessible and interesting especially in the eyes of Fire Emblem fans. Completing story missions, perhaps achieving specific objectives, unlocks in fact of the extra quests in Epic mode that have nothing to do with the story of the princes of Aytolis and which instead follow the most important battles of the Fire Emblems in the game, representing them through the familiar pixelated sprites on squared maps: each enemy corresponds to a mission that can unlock other content, rare materials, special weapons and other collectibles. Epic mode is the true test of Fire Emblem Warriors players: once you have completed all the Story tasks at each difficulty level, it is in Epic mode that you continue to play for dozens of hours, growing the various heroes, unlocking their every ability and ~promoting~ them. In this sense, in fact, the Japanese developer has managed to capture the spirit of the strategic series in an exemplary way, structuring his latest musou in a surprisingly original and layered way. We have said that Omega Force has made various improvements to the tested gameplay of Hyrule Warriors, but the truth is that by doing so, and by implementing a tactical substrate in the classic musou formula, it has clearly raised the quality of its proposal. In this specific case, it was not the weapons triangle of the Intelligent Systems series that surprised us positively: the game emphasizes the importance of facing enemies with the right tools because swords inflict more damage than axes, axes to spears and spears to swords, but in reality it is a power ratio - which also excludes bows and magical tomes, particularly effective against flying and mounted units - easily circumvented with a little skill and an Awakening or final attack fully charged. No, the decisive mechanic in this case consists in the possibility of controlling two units at the same time, exchanging them at will with the simple push of a button. Borrowed from some Fire Emblems of the past, this feature offers considerable advantages both in defense and in attack and an exceptional variety of situations since, in addition to unlocking extremely powerful and spectacular duo attacks, it allows you to weaken enemies by recalling the ally for a rapid attack and to grow the bonds between the various characters, guaranteeing further bonuses that can make the difference in certain battles, especially in Epic mode. The strategy in the musou Just like it happened in Hyrule Warriors - it's easier to mention the spin-off of The Legend of Zelda rather than one of the more recent and semi-unknown Dynasty Warriors - also this time we can call up the map at any time, during a mission, to assign tasks specific to our allies. They usually respect the automatic behavioral parameters that we can also modify, but the greater variety of orders available, combined with a significantly improved artificial intelligence, transform battles into a very successful marriage between the frenetic action of the musou and the micromanagement of a video game real-time strategy. This is especially noticeable in timed missions in which it is necessary to attack a target before it disappears from the map, save a character in difficulty or activate any dragon veins which, by altering the geography of the scenario, open new passages or trap enemies where they they can harm us. The advanced quests offer a considerable variety of situations, although we would have preferred a few more real bosses, as happened in Hyrule Warriors, instead of the repetitive clashes with the same heroes who often end up joining the roster. All the small improvements made to the so-called quality of life still make Fire Emblem Warriors an extremely enjoyable title. Compared to Hyrule Warriors it is much easier to accumulate resources and materials to unlock the skills of the various heroes and manufacture or fuse new weapons, and the missions seemed to us much faster and more dynamic. Technically, Fire Emblem Warriors excels in the rendering of the polygonal models of the various heroes, well-kept and exceptionally well animated. At the same time, it addresses the historical problems of musou which, in a sense, have given the genre a questionable reputation: the enemies are practically all identical, also because the game displays hundreds of them at the same time, much less if played in split -screen together with a friend. In these cases, the developer has preferred to decrease the enemies on the screen so as not to further affect a frame rate that drops dangerously below 30 frames. The multiplayer mode unfortunately has some annoying repercussions also at the level of gameplay since, by decreasing the enemies, it makes it much more difficult to complete some objectives secondari, but it's still a nice option to play in company. If you play alone, however, Fire Emblem Warriors runs at 1080p and 30 frames per second absolutely granite if the Switch is in the Dock, 720p and still 30 frames per second without uncertainties in portable mode. The much talked about Movement Speed option actually reduces the resolution in the Dock to 720p, increasing the frame rate to 60 frames: it is therefore up to the player to choose whether he prefers the fluidity of the fights to the greater cleanliness and definition of the images, but it is certainly a very welcome alternative that we hope to see implemented more often in the future.", "date": "2017-10-18", "grade": "8.0"}
