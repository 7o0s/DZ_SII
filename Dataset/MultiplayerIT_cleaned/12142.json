{"name": "The Sims 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2_a.html", "text": "The Sims can be considered as one of the most striking video game cases of recent years. Developed by Maxis and released on PC a bit on the sly, it immediately conquered players of all ages thanks to the innovative gameplay and the possibility of actually living a second life, albeit marked by numerous limitations of various types. Given the enormous growth of the mobile video game market, the arrival of the series on our terminals was just a matter of time, and in this case we have the opportunity to analyze the characteristics of The Sims 2. The first phase of the game obviously concerns the creation of your own Sim, so we will have to choose the gender, physical appearance, zodiac sign and name of the character. Once this is done, we will find ourselves catapulted into everyday reality inside his apartment, with a ~wish list~ whose items must be completed for new ones to appear. The wishes in question range from the simple ~buy a home improvement~, or ~make a new friend~, to the more complex ~divorce~ if you are already married. The fundamental elements of The Sims 2 are represented by our character's needs, which appear in the form of bars at the bottom of the screen: the need to eat, rest, go to the bathroom, wash, talk and have fun. We'll have to pay attention to these indicators, because when even just one of them goes red, our Sim will refuse to do anything... and if we find ourselves having to go to work, we'll be in serious trouble! To fill the bars of needs, just move the cursor over an object capable of satisfying that need (for example the stove, if you need to eat) and press the FIRE button: at that point the character will go close to the object and will use it in the most appropriate way. In addition to the bars of needs, we will also have to pay attention to the values relating to our skills, which are very important in terms of work. In fact, the Sim we command starts with a profession but can be promoted (and consequently earn more by working less) or find a better job if his physical abilities reach certain values. To improve these skills, we will have to perform a whole series of operations, for example speaking in front of the mirror (improves charisma), being at the stove (improving cooking skills), exercising (improving physical condition) and so on. It will also be important to make as many friendships as possible, and possibly marry a character and then start living together. On a technical level, The Sims 2 on mobile is perhaps a little limited (in practice, you cannot leave the apartment, even if it can be modified in various ways), but the animations and style are those of the original game and therefore they look great even on the smallest screens. The animations are quite numerous but anything but fluid, while the scenarios and background elements are mostly well done. A note of demerit for the sound, composed exclusively of a small number of not very captivating effects. As far as the control system is concerned, everything works wonderfully, with the joystick for moving the cursor, the FIRE button for interacting with objects and people and, lastly, the 0 button for displaying the need bars or the ability.
