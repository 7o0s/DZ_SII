A title that marks the Californian company's debut in the world of first-person action with a team-based shooter that aims for maximum usability without giving up the competitive side. In the face of this departure, the lack of ranked matches at the launch is surprising, but these will soon complete an offer that attracted almost ten million players in the beta. The rest is roughly what we have already seen during the previous tests, starting from the general mechanics to get to the contents, and it is enough to give us a way to reach the long-awaited verdict. Overwatch defies the rigors of competitive shooters by balancing chaos and balance The last mile Talking about Overwatch, you will have understood, is not easy. Aiming for the competitive side, the Blizzard title has slipped into uncomfortable comparisons that have also dragged us into the controversy of arena shooters and skill, the real one. Overwatch has little or nothing to do with this speech and, although a little aim is needed to handle some characters, in the pile of twenty-one currently available there are several others who can count on more generous hitboxes, are incredibly resistant, have that hit automatically or enjoy extremely powerful abilities that are the main reason for the hustle and bustle surrounding the Blizzard title. Hanzo and McCree are among the most criticized, respectively guilty of being able to launch a huge dragon that crosses the whole map and a series of blows that leave no escape by automatically scoring, and with skills of this type on the field it is no wonder that mortality is very high, chaos reigns and frustration is around the corner. But the use of tanks and healers can drastically limit the effectiveness of the most fearsome characters and when things go wrong you get back into the game quickly, with the timer forcing you to wait a few seconds. Furthermore, the ultimates are accompanied by a real announcement and using Symmetra it is possible to place a teleport, destructible by opponents, which allows you to quickly return to the middle of the action. Some of these factors evoke the specter of an easy and confusion-oriented experience but, looking at the whole, the search for an overall balance emerges which also passes through the synergies between the characters and the game modes. In the case of Escort there is a load that heads towards a goal but in doing so it also approaches the spawn of the opponents, making it increasingly difficult to overcome the last mile. This leads to real rushes on the wire, between special abilities downloaded in sequence and fireworks displays that represent the essence of Overwatch, a shooter clearly inspired by Team Fortress 2 but which at the same time is extremely different from the Valve title in variety, rhythm and in combat. However, team play remains fundamental and can change radically depending on which characters make it up. There are those who rely almost exclusively on jammers and there are those who mix them with a core made up of tanks, damage dealers and healers, but there are also those who focus entirely on independent characters, damage and fantasy. As players learn about maps and mechanics, the range of variables will narrow around the most effective synergies, but there will always be ultimates that don't just serve to allow the latest arrival to kill someone. Ultimate skills break defenses, allow you to attack until the last second and are much more effective when used with the brain, thinking about the goal and not the kills. In Overwatch, the total number of kills counts for little, especially since each assist is worth a notch on the rifle and for this reason it is almost impossible to finish a match with a negative balance. On the other hand, it is not difficult to be defeated if you lose sight of the objective whose conquest also requires a good knowledge of the maps. There are some internships, such as Hanamura, which choke, close in the classic funnel which in some shooters turns into an infernal circle dedicated to those who want to accumulate profusion of kills without too much concussion. But in Overwatch there is always a chance to pass. Maps and player abilities are designed to allow an organized team to break through defenses even when two Bastions are garrisoning an objective. The levels are full of holes and escape routes that allow some classes to get around their opponents by messing up the most refined defensive strategies. In this we find the strength of Overwatch which conscapable of slaughtering enemies with one move but is built in such a way that this possibility does not hinder the overall balance. The dirty half dozen The gray areas, mind you, are not lacking between random effects of explosions, special abilities that do not involve turrets, self-guided arrows that kill in one shot, abundant hitboxes and enemies that hit us through the bodies of their companions. In some situations, with six heroes per team overlapping and making a beastly mess, it is almost impossible to understand what is happening and the evident role of randomness in the clashes brings the question of competitiveness back into play. But we have to reiterate once again that in Overwatch we run on the edge of the team and the negative outcome of an action cannot compromise the work of a team capable of exploiting the countless synergies between the characters. Mercy, despite having an offensive power reduced to the minimum terms, can literally stick to whoever is healing and in the captures the support of Lucio, capable of healing and increasing the running speed of his companions, allows a group of Soldier 76 to reach the target in a moment. Winston, on the other hand, wreaks havoc thanks to his gorilla-like bulk and is both a tank and an incredible jammer. To understand Overwatch it is necessary to take these possibilities into account and after a few hours of play with a close-knit team it is clear how everything fits together almost perfectly. Someone dies due to the chaos and someone else is annoyed without being able to react by a guided arrow but at the end of the day the winner is whoever moves better, who organizes himself and whoever pulls out the ultimate at the right time, all without giving up confusion. to fun, to ~tamarri~ characters and to an extreme variety. In all of this, it makes little sense to seek balance in one-on-one clashes. Showing off reflexes like a champion can still give satisfaction but the paper, rock and scissors formula dictates the general balance even if it varies according to the context, preventing planning from prevailing over the player's reactivity. Pharah flutters and unleashes missile showers that are effective against groups of enemies. On the other hand it is extremely vulnerable to the two snipers, Hanzo and Widowmaker, and passing in front of a Bastion it is ground in a millisecond. But it can take advantage of the ~splash damage~ of the missiles to hit its nemeses without exposing itself, which makes it dangerous precisely for the Bastion which in the form of a turret is planted on the ground. The overall balance is incredible with twenty-one characters who are all decidedly differentiated from each other without any of them being clearly useless. A few games slip away between random kills and frustrating defeats but with two balanced teams, reversals in the face and games played on the wire are almost normal. Those looking for pure skill and rambo-style play will probably be disappointed but those willing to accept the compromise proposed by Overwatch could have tons of fun ahead of them from the very first moments of the game. Considering the single character, Overwatch is an easy title to approach. In most cases, all we need to know is limited to a single weapon, a couple of shot types, two or three secondary skills and an ultimate that you load by playing. Getting familiar with the avatar is a matter of moments and after a few minutes it is already possible to launch into feats worthy of a champion. But mastering it in a matched play game is a very different matter. When the opponents know what they are doing, survival comes into play, which passes through the refinement of reflexes, the advance of the ultimates, the mental map of the medikits and a good knowledge of all the skills in play which with twenty-one characters are really many . But once fully understood they also allow us to change characters without fear, helping the team to find that dynamic balance that constantly changes according to the context and the heroes chosen by the opponents. All this falls under the heading of skill, even if in the case of characters like Tracer, fragile but capable of combining slaughterhouses in the right hands, the mastery of the controls has greater weight. In this regard, it must also be said that the reactivity is always high, the console version has been carefully studied for the pad and the netcode has never given us any major problems, not even in the hours of greatest traffic. War colors After years of stylized fantasy Blizzard has finally broadened its horizons without giving up the combination of essential lines and detailed animations. In the case of Overwatch, the latter abound between poses to unlock,reactions to hits taken, reload animations and choreographed ultimates that represent the culmination of the action for each of the twenty-one available characters. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that some animation frames are deformed and it is an intentional choice that allows you to keep an important detail in view or to give a specific effect to the scene. The ~frame by frame~ view highlights marked anomalies in the proportions of the characters but overall the animations are incredibly effective and testify to a meticulous design and construction work to say the least. The cartoon style, it must be said, is nothing revolutionary but also in this case the variety is a distinctive element of a title that between secondary characters and costumes offers us well over a hundred models to play with. Between Venetian masks combined with the punisher and steampunk costumes there is something for all tastes and they are all inspired, even when they slip into the tamarro, as are the maps that stand out for their variety, colors and design. Between vertical sections, self-propelled platforms, quotations in quantity and animated backgrounds, the eyes are lost despite the fact that the polygons do not abound. But palettes, lighting, fluidity and low hardware requirements more than compensate for a compromise that does not deprive us of a lot of details and objects influenced by physics that contribute to an overall rendering that oozes vivacity, joy and pleasantness from every pore. Overwatch is a bubbly, chaotic title full of high-sounding pronouncements and exclamations that pepper every action. We are not faced with what could be defined as dialogues but the quality of the voices is that to which Blizzard has accustomed us and is of the highest level, even in Italian. The music points in the same direction by riding light, lively sonorities in tune with the maps that do not touch the peaks of great music but are undoubtedly effective. In short, the care is evident in every single aspect of the game, including the interface, and seems to fully justify the 39.99 euros requested for the basic version. The maps for now are not a huge amount, a total of twelve, but the hybrid ones are quite complex and the three dedicated to the control mode are divided into nine sub-zones which bring us to a total of 18 areas, all the result of a hard work of balancing due to the large number of characters and abilities. In addition, the price includes Blizzard support which represents a staple of the Californian software house's offer and guarantees dedicated servers, constant balancing work and an influx of additional content that should not be underestimated. And in the case of Overwatch we are sure there is plenty of material for years to come with all the work done for Titan to be exploited. It is no coincidence that the Blizzard title already enjoys a five-star outline which was strongly manifested in the first films and also finds a space in the game thanks to maps full of details, easter eggs, posters and clues of all kinds. To make people understand the level of care, it's enough to say that what happens in the videos dedicated to the characters leaves effective marks in the maps and is an integral part of an imaginary that, starting from the models, obviously gives a nod to cosplay and fan art. In the same area is the huge number of aesthetic elements to unlock which includes legendary drops, coats of arms to paste on the walls, further animations and new phrases for our characters. Crates can also be purchased with real money, and they cost a lot, but that doesn't matter to us since nothing that can be obtained alters the gameplay in any way. Even if customization is a crucial element of the Overwatch universe, as far as side and support are concerned, we are more interested in the presence of the tutorial, the spectator mode that puts us in our team as soon as possible, the possibility of playing in a group against the artificial intelligence, private matches that allow you to organize wars between clans with customized rules and options that include the possibility of deciding specific parameters for each single class.", "date": "2016-05-27", "grade": "9.0"}
