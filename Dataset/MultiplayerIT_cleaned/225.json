In fact, on the occasion of April 1st, SEGA has decided to surprise all fans with a new free game available on Steam at this address: The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog. In its two abundant hours of adventure you can find a bit of everything, including jokes, quotes and even a touch of sentimentality, certainly more than what can be expected from a work born as a joke. But is it worth playing? Find out the answer in our The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog review. Murder on the Mirage Express The first investigation scene of The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog The story revolves around the Mirage Express, a train designed for events and parties. The occasion is Amy Rose's birthday, who has decided - as a true crime podcast enthusiast - to throw a crime party. The guest list is long and includes many well-known faces from the saga such as Tails, Shadow, Knuckles, Vector, Rouge and more. Each of them has received a role to play and, above all, one of them has been designated a murderer: he will have to ~kill~ another guest and, once the ~corpse~ is discovered, the journalist Amy and the investigator Tails will have to find out who it is. the murderer. Sonic is the intended victim and we will have to find out who did it. But who are ~we~? Not a member of the hedgehog gang, but a new character who finds himself on his first day on the Mirage Express with only one job: to make sure everyone is having a good time and doing well. When the train has a sudden acceleration, however, we end up locked together with Tails and Amy in a closet and there we have to solve our first ~case~. The game structure is very simple and will be repeated for each carriage of the train: by clicking on the objects on the screen you will discover a handful of clues and once you have found them all (Tails warns us) the interrogation starts. The character of the moment will have to be convinced through trials to reveal his alibi for the ~death~ of Sonic. The individual sequences are always all very obvious and most of the investigative reasoning will be done by Tails. It will therefore always be obvious which is the right clue to select, but even if you make a mistake there will be no consequences. Once we find the correct one, however, we will have to complete a small platform minigame, which makes this visual novel a real Sonic game. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog platformer minigame This is a very basic minigame in which you have to collect enough rings before completing a course, jumping and moving along the way to avoid spikes and chasms. On average it is very simple, except in the final phase where there is a spike in difficulty, with chaotic sequences and very high requirements for passing. This is practically the only flaw of the game, which absolutely didn't need to become so complex. But just try and try again for a handful of minutes, until you manage to complete the sequence and discover the ending of The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog. Art and mysteries We will have to close the reasoning of Tails in The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog We don't want to give spoilers, considering that in the two hours of gameplay that await you there is little to discover and any anticipation would ruin the plot, but overall we can assure you that it is a pleasant adventure, in which almost every character is exploited properly (let's talk about you, Blaze), with little skits that fit their original characterization adapted to a slightly over the top context. It is also pleasant to see Sonic and his friends from an external point of view, that is from that of a normal person who comments with admiration and sometimes even a little confusion on the way our heroes think and act. Espio plays the poet in The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog Obviously you shouldn't expect an investigative adventure worthy of Agatha Christie, but we mustn't forget that it's always and only a small free game born on April Fool's Day. Also for this reason we are pleasantly surprised by the care taken in the work, especially on a visual level. The beautiful settings are full of details and pleasant to admire, although never particularly large. Furthermore, in this absurd train there are many different carriages, so the variety is also considerable.", "date": "2023-04-19", "grade": "8.0"}
