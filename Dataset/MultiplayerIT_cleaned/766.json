{"name": "Everybody's golf", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everybodys-golf-2.html", "text": "I remember greenways and a little girl's runs. Everybody's golf already from the first screens does not hide the playful vein with which this sport should be taken: big heads in pure anime style, characters running at the speed of light to retrieve the balls, animations that wink at the caricature drawing, balloons and exclamations comic style. As for the technical part, like another game of the genre, everybody's golf revolves entirely around the swing: the famous golf movement that allows the player to hit the ball and throw it as close as possible to the hole; facilitating the approach to this difficult sport, it presents a series of graphic devices that help the player - even a beginner - to extricate himself from the 18 fateful holes. In the main screen from which all the modalities branch out, the first possibility offered is the classic 18-hole tournament: it will be possible to choose between 13 different international courses that can be selected in each different season of the year (obviously the season will influence the physics of the ball) to give complete control to the gamer at the time of choice. Once the destination has been established, it is time to choose the golfer: in the first few games the choice will be quite forced due to the few characters present in the booklet (the total characters, 34, will be unlocked by continuing in the game) and the few usable costumes. Each character differs from the other in a series of parameters such as 'power' 'swing' 'reliability' to give the player a greater possibility of adapting to his style of play. Once the path and character have been established, it's time to take up the bag of clubs and start treading the playing field: the game's graphic interface is simplified and direct, the ground on which the ball is stationed (fairway) will be indicated in the lower part of the screen , bunker or rough) and an energy bar will mark the power with which the ball will be hit. The change of the clubs which can be carried out by pressing the R1 and L1 triggers will allow the player to vary the width of the launch range and a convenient indicator will indicate approximately the arrival point of the established trajectory. In all of this, before launching, it will always be useful to check for the presence of wind (indicated by an easy-to-understand icon at the top right) and the possible presence of detrimental slopes for achieving the launch. The swing modes present in the game are essentially two: a facilitated one represented by a common energy bar where it will be necessary to press only at the end of the stroke to determine the launch power, and a second more complicated one where greater timing will be needed to press in a particular range of time and prevent the ball from being svirgolato or even missed. The moment one passes from the fairway to the green, unfortunately, however, the first problems arise: despite having an absolutely perfect graphic representation as regards the slopes of the green in the putting phase (a series of intermittent dots run along the lines of a grid indicating the covering the terrain) the player will find himself disoriented in the moment of shooting due to the total lack of real points of reference that help him in the most important moment of the track, proceeding by groping until he develops an approximate intuition that allows him to conclude. The tournament mode, in addition to having a long life in the single player, is also the only one that allows multiplayer challenges: it will be possible to compete against up to eight players with a single ps2 or connect to the internet to participate in tournaments of up to 50 players; golf being a fairly static sport lends itself perfectly to online game sessions that allow the presence of several players and the presence of such a well-supported multiplayer is undoubtedly a point in favor of this ps2 version and which makes you regret the lack of this modality in the -practically contemporary- version on PSP. Albatross, eagle, birdie, par, bogey, double bogey, retire. However, the world of Everybody's golf is not limited only to the canonical tournaments, instead it makes its surroundings what distinguishes it from similar publications. A first modality is the one called par3 where the players will be able to compete in a game only for millimeter and precise eyes: the par3 is nothing more than a 9 or 18 hole tournament, all with par on the third shot; to clarify it is necessary to specify that all the holes have - by regulation - a number of strokes which, if equaled, allows you to remain in par (in fact, in parity) with what is the track record. To give a practical example, if a par5 hole is found, in order not to lose points, it will be necessary to complete it in five strokes, in the event that the hole will closea with one shot less, you will score a birdie, two shots less an eagle and three shots less an albatross (it must be said for the avoidance of doubt, that the abatross is practically impossible and many times it is not even included in the games of golf). Similarly, one stroke over par will be called a bogey, two over par will score a double bogey and so on up to the maximum limit for the hole in question. The question of the par3 tournament should now be clearer, it is a series of holes with par for three strokes and which will refine the player's sensitivity towards aspects such as the wind, the use of particular clubs and spin shots. This mode is accompanied by the minigolf section: a goliardic and miniature version of golf, which will put the player in front of 9 holes: the primary purpose of minigolf is to score a series of hole-in-ones, the score of the hole will be relative to the length of the path taken by the ball to end up in the hole, it will therefore be fun to find the most absurd expedients such as slopes, bounces and jumps, to achieve the maximum possible score. Common practice of this type of games to lengthen its longevity is to fill the game with secrets, bonuses and unlockable characters; everybody's golf makes no secret of it and even has a section called 'shop' which will allow the player to spend the points earned on the course by buying characters (even some from famous sony series such as jak, daxter, ratchet,...), clothes, set of clubs, new balls and various game material. The strong ironic vein of the game also overshadows elements such as graphics and sound which are at mediocre levels: the animations and the seasonal rendering of the tracks are very well done, some doubts remain about the backgrounds and the presence of characters on the track ; from the sound point of view everybody's golf does not differ from the productions of this genre, with a series of standard sound effects and a few damned repetitive music. Certainly more complex, certainly more complete, certainly more evolved, certainly less genuine. This is the judgment playing this new chapter of everybody's golf, the series over the years has gradually lost the simplicity, the direct and naive way that the very first chapter had practically proposed almost seven years ago on psx. It undoubtedly remains a product of undoubted value, a game that will fascinate thanks to the infinite longevity given by the online mode. If you are looking for a golf game on ps2 that is fun and perhaps not very busy, then everybody's golf remains your definitive choice: many game modes, many bonuses and a certainly user-friendly setting, make it a counterpart to mario golf on consoles sony. Pros Golf has never been so much fun Long-lived Finally there's also the online mode Cons Poor management of the putting sections Not excellent graphics Quite repetitive sound Since the birth of the first consoles and the first video games, there have always existed two distinct genres that referred to golf: one linked to the great icons of this sport (Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Greg Norman, just to name a few) and another towards a more goliardic and simplistic vision, able to bring even noephytes closer. Everybody's golf is undoubtedly part of the second category described: with captivating and cartoonish graphics it is proposed as a bulwark of Sony Europe on green golf courses; the series, born on playstation, thanks to the contribution of Clap handz is preparing to experience its fifth incarnation, the first online. All that remains is to take up the bag of clubs again, call your trusted caddy and get ready to experience the endless green expanses once again.", "date": "2005-11-09", "grade": null}
