{"name": "Fist of Jesus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/139866-fist-of-jesus-lazzaro-torna-nella-fossa.html", "text": "Humbert 11,1-10 From the page of an apocryphal gospel, unfortunately largely lost, found under the bench of a Madrid pub:1 While Jesus was teaching the crowd and his disciples on the edge of the mountain, an envoy from Mary and Martha arrived from Bethany, who told him of the death of his cousin Lazarus. 2 Jesus then left for the village of his mother and aunt, taking with him the good Judas, still not corrupted by the thirty denarii and social functions. Epic boss fight 3 Arrived on the spot, Jesus found Lazarus wrapped in a shroud, which gave off a not bad smell of rotten fish, surrounded by relatives and friends in tears and by cats in an evident state of overexcitement. 4 Without getting caught up in emotion, Jesus raised his arms and pronounced the fateful words: ~Lazarus, get up and walk.~ 5 Lazarus got up and started walking in general astonishment, then began to devour the crowd, probably annoyed by the general astonishment. 6 At that time, there was no talk of zombie invasion yet, and the Roman army was not equipped with guns to shoot them down by shooting them in the head. 7 Jesus understood that the resurrection was only half successful and, after an initial sense of wear and tear and personal failure, he decided to remedy it, also because he felt responsible for that not very successful miracle. 8 In the meantime Lazarus had gotten to his head and, declaring himself a divinity, went around creating his own army of undead with bites. 9 Armed with loaves and fishes Jesus, after unwillingly involving the brave Judas, the latter unsure of wanting to become the protagonist of a fighting game, embarked on an epic mission to save the world. 10 Zombies Pharisees, Romans and cowboys will have a very short unlife, because they will have to taste the punch of Jesus, as well as his super powers! If you've always wanted a beat 'em up starring Jesus and Judas, read our review Short is beautiful Fist of Jesus is a splatter fighting game born from the YouTube success of the short film of the same name by Adrin Cardona and David Muoz. It goes without saying that it is a light and ironic work, albeit inevitably blasphemous, which combines biblical facts with the inevitable zombie invasion, an event both feared and loved by our age. The protagonists of the adventure are Jesus and Judas who together must stop Lazarus and his plans to conquer the world. When Jesus creates explosions, there is none for anyone. As? Certainly not with parables. The unlikely duo will have to go around beating up zombies of all kinds by cleaning up level after level to accumulate money, with which to buy upgrades related to basic characteristics (health, punches and ranged attacks) and super powers. The two heroes each have three special powers at their disposal, not immediately available (they are unlocked by leveling up), which will take them out of the way of the most desperate situations. Jesus can then multiply loaves and fishes to recover energy or have fresh weapons to use, he can summon the sacred divine fire to generate walls that are impassable or he can create explosions to wipe out entire hordes of enemies. Judas, on the other hand, can launch a Dragon Ball-style energy wave, rain down shooting stars and unleash his inner strength doing more damage than normal and becoming much more resistant to zombie attacks. The dynamic duo The enemies are quite varied and include very normal zombies that advance eager to be punched, Roman zombies equipped with spears or shields, cowboy zombies armed with Molotov cocktails, pistols or shotguns, bigger and harder zombies to kill, considered seeds -boss and capable of throwing destructive punches and so on. A fatality: Jesus uses a fish bone to saw the enemy. There is no shortage of real bosses, usually very difficult to bring down, such as a particularly fat Roman general, a giant octopus that Jesus and Judas will have to face walking on the water and Lazarus himself, a floating mummy armed with his bandages. The latter will have to be tackled on several occasions and will come back stronger and stronger. There are also other surprises that we do not reveal for obvious reasons. The game system is very simple in its essence, however articulated in structure. In part it recalls titles from the mobile world, with progressive difficulty levels to be unlocked by completing the previous ones and a truly immediate control system, with a single button for the attack and others dedicated to the use of special powers and ranged attacks ( fish are thrown, of course). Each level has its own goals: to survive, kill a certain number of mini-bosses, reach a minimum score, and so on. There is no shortage of bonus levels such as tutorial levels or duels, in which you have to beat demo opponentsstraddling themselves faster than them to draw the firearm and shoot. During the adventure there will be different objects to collect, to make life easier. In addition to the aforementioned weapons, ranging from simple swords to crucifixes, via swordfish or zombie limbs to be used as clubs, there are also relics, which, if accumulated, allow you to unlock permanent bonuses. Jesus and Judas also have the ability to perform fatalities, which are activated by stunning enemies and pressing the attack button when a swinging arrow is in the right place. Merry blasphemy It seems quite obvious to us to say that Fist of Jesus lives on its contents. By removing the cheerful blasphemy that characterizes it from the game, we would have a simple fighting game, certainly not evil, but not even exceptional with all its limitations, all too tied to a mobile conception of video games. Fortunately we are among those who consider style a very important part of the gameplay, capable of enormously increasing the appeal of a product and the ability to keep it in the game. The mobile-style map with missions to select. So it is true that in some moments you want to throw the joypad against the screen due to difficulty imbalances, for example when you find yourself surrounded by dozens of enemies without having the possibility of getting out alive; or one is stunned by some not very precise collision, with shots from enemies and protagonists that hit from improbable positions, but these are questions that become secondary if one gets caught up in the drunkenness of quotations, biblical and non, by which the game is characterized and by its underlying senselessness. We also understand that a similar title can trigger revulsion in observant believers, which we obviously advise to stay away from. Technically the game is what appears in the images that you find scattered around the article: 2D graphics drawn in a cartoon style, with a big accent on gore, which however never becomes visually annoying. Let's say that, in general, everything is very colorful and cheerful, perhaps just to tone it down a bit, but that there is nothing that makes you cry out for a miracle, despite the protagonist.", "date": "2014-10-30", "grade": "7.8"}
