{"name": "The Bradwell Conspiracy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-bradwell-conspiracy-la-recensione.html", "text": "It can be said that the genre of narrative adventures has now reached its complete maturity, finding in the various interpretations of the walking simulator some of the maximum possible expressions for this means of communication, but the spaces for experimenting with new solutions in terms of gameplay and story are becoming inevitably getting closer and closer, which is why we place ourselves with the best intentions in front of this review of The Bradwell Conspiracy. Just trying to set the whole communication on an original solution is to be welcomed with open arms, and this game of A Brave Plan (nomen omen) actually tries to do something new in a bold way, both in terms of narrative with the its continuous asymmetrical dialogue, both as regards the gameplay with the gimmick of the gun that materializes the objects, in fact configuring itself as a real puzzle with a narrative structure. The result is a strange mix between the rhythms and the dialogue story of Firewatch and a fairly clear reference to the puzzle mechanisms of Portal, even if in this case we are dealing with puzzles that are much less rigorous from a logical point of view. During a public presentation organized by Bradwell Electronics at the Stonhenge Museum, a mysterious accident disrupts the company's laboratories, which extend deep into the earth just below the ancient British archaeological site. After an emergency evacuation, the only people who seem to be left inside the structure are the protagonist and a girl called Amber, who is however always out of reach and who for most of the game will be a sort of guiding voice and companion constant of our wanderings through the semi-destroyed areas of Bradwell Electronics, while we look for a way to get out of the structure and gradually discover the dark mysteries that wind their way through the laboratories of an unsuspecting company that has always been focused on common well-being and sustainable scientific research, at least as a facade. The main character, who we play with a subjective shot, cannot speak due to the damage to the vocal cords received from smoke inhalation, resulting in the strange asymmetrical communicative relationship with Amber, which in fact characterizes the whole narration of the game: being equipped with a pair of augmented reality glasses capable of taking photos, the protagonist can communicate with the girl sent the photos, which she comments on in the most sensible way possible, possibly providing indications on what to do. This represents a very original element because it allows you to partially guide the narrative by directing the dialogue based on the subjects we frame with the camera, although there are technical limitations to this system: obviously Amber cannot comment coherently on all the photos we send her , so in many cases she will limit herself to giving vague answers or even proving to be nervous, which somewhat breaks the illusion of a realistic conversation, moreover it is often necessary to take very precise shots of sensitive subjects to continue the conversation and unlock the game, which sometimes requires multiple attempts and can create confusion in the player's mind. Puzzle and story In addition to the particular communication system through photos, the other characterizing element of The Bradwell Conspiracy is the tool that after a few minutes of playing we will be entrusted: the most recent and advanced creation of the Bradwell laboratories, the ~materializing gun~ is capable of create objects as needed for the most diverse uses. The company has managed to model a kind of super-efficient 3D printer in the form of a handy gun, which allows you to easily scan objects, keep them in memory and then precisely reconstruct them starting from the mysterious base material. This obviously opens the door to a very particular puzzle mechanic, which requires moving and building various objects to solve puzzles and open up new paths and passages. Generally speaking, these are rather simple environmental puzzles, based on the need to create bridges or footholds or fit objects with others, but in some cases we also see rather complex and intelligent elaborations of the basic concept, even if these they are found above all towards the end of the game and are ultimately few, immersed in a fairly low general level of challenge. There are in fact some logical drawbacks in the puzzle mechanic proposed by The Bradwell Conspiracy: beyond the absence, in most cases, of physical implications in our constructions (perhaps explainable with details such asmaterial used by the gun), we note how the choice of objects to reproduce is strongly influenced by the structure of the puzzles, thus limiting the possible creative choices, as well as bringing out some inconsistencies such as the fact of having to build passages to reach places that would be perfectly accessible, if only there was a jump button in the game. In general, in the face of a very whimsical and stimulating concept, the puzzles remain in most cases rather down to earth and this is a shame. These imaginative elements are well placed in a fundamentally realistic context thanks to the tone adopted by A Brave Plan to stage the game: there is a constant underlying humor that describes the events in an ironic way, thanks to Amber's comments and constant intrusions of the artificial intelligence contained in the AR glasses, which dilutes the atmosphere and outlines a sarcastic vision of scientific research pushed to the extreme, bringing out the most disturbing contours of the conspiracy in a light and intelligent way, but also increasingly clear as the progress of the game. Also in this case the inspiration to Portal is quite evident, but the writing on which The Bradwell Conspiracy is based is really high-profile, especially as regards the quality of the dialogues, and it is probably the real strong point of the whole production (the excellent speech is in English, supported by good subtitles in Italian). The length of the game is short, taking around three hours to complete, but this benefits a notable compactness of the experience, keeping a good pace for the particular narrative mode chosen. On the technical front, the iOS version suffers from too many problems: tested on a sixth generation iPad, the game shows some frame-rate drops but above all a reduction in resolution, compared at least to the PC version, which in some cases makes you confused the outlines of the elements on the screen, also bringing out a very evident aliasing. The touch controls slow down the action a lot, especially as regards the movement of the gaze which remains unresponsive even at maximum sensitivity, a problem partially mitigated by the use of a controller.", "date": "2019-10-22", "grade": "6.7"}
