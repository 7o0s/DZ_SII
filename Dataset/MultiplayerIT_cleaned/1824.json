{"name": "Kingdom Hearts", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kingdom-hearts-5.html", "text": "ThinEven Sora, Kairi and Riku are three children in the purest Square (or Disney if you prefer) tradition, with easily recognizable character traits from the start. Their little dream, divided equally between typically adolescent desires, fears and endearments, is however destined to come to an abrupt end. A violent and anomalous storm caused by mysterious beings in black hits the island where they live, destroying it and assigning Sora to a singular locality, inhabited by unusual but decidedly familiar figures. Predictably, it will be up to our hero, assisted by two inimitable icons like Donald Duck and Goofy, to find his friends and discover the reasons for the sudden disappearance of the island. Trusting naively in such an unoriginal prologue, Disney's contribution to the plot proves to be fundamental, donating its imaginative atmospheres to the service of Square's great directorial expertise. This is how improbable rides in the forest in the company of Tarzan are born, exhilarating Herculesian tournaments where Squall and Cloud participate, unkind visits to Geppetto who ended up inside the whale, surreal excursions inside houses with renewed gravitational laws, just to mention the less bizarre situations. The results are excellent, creating a current and engaging narrative sector. Perhaps the play structure is more predictable, but first things first. Kingdom Hearts consists of several worlds, each of which represents a Disney film, connected to each other by a static map. The goal will be to complete (naturally Sora's presence will make the events a little different) the original story of the cartoon, solving simple puzzles, conversing with shady figures, and above all, exercising the noble art of the keyblade (self-deprecating touch?) , the weapon of our protagonist. Art that will not be difficult for us to assimilate, by virtue of the excellent real-time Battle System prepared by Square, which makes use of the classic lock-on system. A convenient screen menu will also allow us without too many worries to launch the most powerful spells and summons, while the two support characters (whose strategies can be set) will collaborate effectively in mass destruction. The only weak point is represented by the virtual camera, a little slow to follow the exciting clashes. The experience obtained will allow us, in addition to the canonical increase in vital statistics, to learn new skills, magical or physical, the use of which is limited by the number of Ability Points available. The action, to tell the truth a bit repetitive, is enlivened by several sub-games, first of which is a poorly maintained Star Fox-style shooter present between the various levels. Entering the game, the situation will significantly improve, given the presence of a large number of quests, secret bosses, curious and interesting details, some of which are capable of producing the best moments of the game, but the feeling of being inside something schematic and linear is exactly the same that pervades recent Square productions, however certainly not making the product less valid (although it is still a matter of fairly subjective sensations), as evidenced by the longevity, guaranteed by the above and by two levels of difficulty. The last notes concern the version reviewed here, completely localized in a more than fair Italian, but with the usual inaccuracies, and the usual speed reduction caused by the lack of the 50/60 Mhz selector. It must be said that even so the game remains quite fluid. Mill Haven We begin in the usual space dedicated to the technique by stating what is easy to deduce: the latest Squaresoft work can boast the best reproductions of the fascinating Disney universe ever seen in a video game. Luxuriant environments and excellently embellished by colorful textures, manicly animated polygonal models and concretely indistinguishable from their cinematographic counterparts, anything but parsimonious use of masterfully created effects and light sources, allow very little space for any negative criticisms, further expanding the interactive cartoon concept. The characters created from scratch by Nomura are also captivating, with the very sweet Kairi who seems to have come out of Witch, the comic creation of Gnone / Barbucci. Undoubtedly pleasant, just as the soundtrack is certainly evocative, entrusted to the excellent Yoko Shimomura, a name perhaps little known to non-experts, but already author of the unforgettable melodies of titles such as Front Mission, Super Mario Rpg and Legend Of Mana. In this case, in addition to new valid compositions (among which the theme song to Hikaru stands out, especially in the acoustic version), the talented pianist accompanies usagna with valuable passages taken from classic Disney themes. Comment Kingdom Hearts is a pleasant fresco, painted and made with care, finished and embellished with rare mastery. The critic could object that the now elderly artist Square does not carry out the works exalting and suffering as in the past, and that in this specific case it is mainly the sophisticated Disney tempera paints that cover an oil canvas that otherwise would have appeared ~simple~ reproduction of one of the many works already performed by the painter. Recently it seems that another inimitable Japanese teacher has taken an interest in the works of the proud Square, forced against her will to accept the collaboration for anything but philosophical reasons. Sometimes history has shown us how irregular artistic marriages have then become a source of great interest. There is no doubt that the Square-Enix duet is destined to become one of them. Pros - Noteworthy technical realization - Well thought out Battle and Character Evolution System Cons - Imperfect view management - Slightly repetitive - Linear and schematic Amazement, in some cases accompanied by patriotic indignation, had aroused within the gaming community the announcement of a new Square project, this time supported by the classic Disney settings and masks. The exhausting and full of doubts wait continued until the release of the first screens, where we witnessed with horror the presence, together with the usual boy with a more or less absurd scalp, of historical figures of western animation such as The Beast and Peter Pan ! I think you all know how it ended: After the overwhelming success with the public, confirmation also arrived from the critics, whose almost unanimous consent can be found, with due reservations, also in this article concerning the Italian version .", "date": "2003-01-09", "grade": null}
