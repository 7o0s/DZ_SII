It is therefore not surprising that a product like Draw Slasher: Dark Ninja vs Pirate Monkey Zombies brings together a whole series of clichs (let's also insert pirates, go) combining them with two of the most popular features of the moment on the App Store , i.e. a ~survival~ type structure and the ability to ~draw~ your own moves on the touch screen. We know the first one well, so much so that it now characterizes a good number of games and constitutes a basic conceptual choice: better the good old progression between different stages or a single challenge that can last more or less time depending on the player's skill ? Both approaches have their pros and cons, but it is certainly true that creating a title with a single ~survival~ mode greatly limits its thickness, putting it on a par with many ~whistlebreakers~ without art or part. In the case of Draw Slasher, the question is a little more multifaceted: the game itself offers not one but several modes, all characterized by the presence of a single stage and a progressively increasing difficulty. What changes is the way enemies alternate, which can be slow and gradual or fast and chaotic. Apart from the greater or lesser frenzy of the action, the gameplay remains fundamentally identical and is not affected in any way by the presence of larger enemies, also because they behave like their ~standard~ colleagues and share their weaknesses. When there's no more room in hell... The second feature that characterizes Draw Slasher: Dark Ninja vs Pirate Monkey Zombies is the control system, particularly simple and immediate. On the left side of the screen there are two arrows that allow us to move our character to the right or left, but the same result is achieved by simply touching the area we want to move towards. Attacks depend solely on how we draw lines on the touch screen. Do we want our ninja's sword to decapitate a bunch of zombie monkeys? Then it will be enough to draw a line at their shoulders: the character will leap forward and an instant later we will see blood and severed heads fall to the ground. The enemy damage system is simple but effective, therefore it allows us to cut them into pieces as we prefer and returns a visual result of great impact, thanks above all to the original black and white style of the graphics, which admits the only exception of the red blood. The hordes of enemies follow each other more or less quickly, our ninja must destroy them quickly and at the same time try not to suffer any damage. Zombies like to bite, you know, and Draw Slasher's are no exception. The energy bar is restored very slowly and only when the ninja is still, so you have to find the right moment to rest but be careful not to do it in the vicinity of an opponent. ...do monkeys walk on earth? We were talking about black and white graphics. It is certainly another attempt to amaze by Mass Creation, which has done a great job in terms of atmosphere and style. While moving in a single, good quality scenario, Draw Slasher's protagonist and his many enemies appear well drawn and animated, producing spectacular effects when they collide. Chopped zombies ~split~ quite easily, but the result is convincing thanks to the huge amount of blood that flows from each wound. The scrolling of the seabed is always very fluid and is not affected by the number of moving objects on the screen, even when there are many of them. Parallax scrolling also adds a good sense of depth. The action is effectively accompanied by good quality music and effects. Finally, OpenFeint support allows us to compare our results with those of friends, as well as with players from all over the world.
