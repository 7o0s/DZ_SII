A product actually already in a rather advanced state of creation on the occasion of the financing round, which took place between October and November, as evidenced by our test of the game dating back to the month of August. Thanks to Kickstarter, the Guildford-based team was still able to complete the project, raising more than $174,000: almost double the initial request of $100,000. Reason for the good reception given to Strike Suit Zero, the strong influence coming from a good portion of video games dating back to the 90s, part of the well-defined space combat genre of which the various X-Wing, Homeworld and Freespace belonged, not surprisingly cited by the developers as sources of inspiration for their game. Within the team, just to appreciate, the presence of numerous insiders of the aforementioned titles, to whom the guys from Born Ready Games have added the right amount of talent to churn out a product worthy of being compared to its illustrious predecessors, but at the same time able to be appreciated in 2013. Final goal: to revive a genre now almost forgotten by the gaming industry. The universe in 2299 In Strike Suit Zero, the player finds himself part of the forces of the U.N.E. (United Nations of Earth), a coalition of the planet Earth engaged in facing a war that could destroy the world itself. On the other side of the conflict, the union of forces from the space colonies, able to find the ultimate weapon to destroy the Earth, thus preparing to launch the final attack. A plot treated in a deliberately brief way here, but which, while not shining for originality, can be fully enjoyed by drawing liberally from the classics of the sci-fi genre. Through thirteen missions, our virtual alter-ego will have to be able to avert the danger looming over the Earth: the course of events will also be influenced by our actions and by our own performance in battle, on the basis of which alternative endings will come to life. The missions are also made up of secondary objectives, useful for obtaining upgrades for your units, which are divided into four different types. As for the actual game, the wonderful impression is that of actually being in a large-scale battle: in fact, the missions do not take place alone, but rather you often and willingly find yourself acting together with other companions controlled by the CPU. Although the player often ends up deciding the fate of the mission, it's easy to feel like a small part of something much bigger: a prime example is the one in which you find yourself paving the way for your allies equipped with heavy weapons, destroying turrets and other dangerous weapons of enemy ships to give your side an advantage in the next moment of the battle. Fly, oh oh The clashes that the game's artificial intelligence implements between the units belonging to the two factions are fascinating, to the point that sometimes we get distracted by looking at what is happening around us. Staying on the subject of AI we can say (with the benefit of the doubt, since according to the developers this aspect will undergo a further adjustment in the final version) that even without setting the difficulty to maximum, the level of challenge offered by Strike Suit Zero is quite high. with enemies able to make evasive maneuvers at the right moment and likewise latch on to the tail of our ship without mercy, forcing us to run away from their missiles. Before each mission, the player can choose which weapons to mount on his vehicle: there is the category of lighter weapons, such as machine guns and laser cannons, and that linked to heavy weapons, such as rockets of various types. The way in which the various weapons are described is extremely appreciable: not only through text, but also with a short video that really shows them in action. At the center of everything we naturally find the Strike Suit: it is a unit that is acquired in the early stages of the game, capable of transforming itself after having accumulated a certain amount of energy (called Flux) through the destruction of enemies and various wrecks present around the level. Once the Strike Mode is activated, the unit becomes a mecha equipped with a series of special abilities with which to turn the tide in battle, giving the pilot the possibility to automatically engage targets and fire lethal shots froml double cannon supplied: but even in this case extreme attention must be paid, because invulnerability is not contemplated and the radius of the cannon is not that large. At the end of each mission, a possible medal is awarded, together with a score with which to enter the Steam leaderboard, whose features are fully supported; a further incentive to replay the missions is offered by the aforementioned secondary objectives, useful for obtaining upgrades capable of offering an advantageous position in subsequent missions, where the need can certainly be felt. In the blue painted blue If the gameplay does not disappoint, from a technical point of view Strike Suit Zero continues to have its say: each mission takes place on a real ~space painting~ (see the accompanying screenshots to believe), on which the spaceships move fruit of the creation of Junji Okubo, already working on Steel Battalion, Appleseed: Ex Machina and Infinite Space. Wanting to nitpick, we can say that from the point of view of detail the ship models could be better, apart from the Strike Suit which looks good. For the rest, absolutely nothing to complain. Even the sound has excellent references, beyond the complete dubbing in English (as well as the subtitles): in fact, as composer we find Paul Ruskay, already appreciated on the occasion of Homeworld, while the parts of music accompanied by voice have been entrusted to Kokia, a Japanese singer who arrived with a few songs also in the western markets. A game to keep an eye on also in the future, given the already announced support for Oculus Rift when this is put on the market.", "date": "2013-01-23", "grade": "8.0"}
