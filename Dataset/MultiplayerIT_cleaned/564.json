{"name": "Onimusha 3: Demon Siege - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/onimusha-3-demon-siege-recensione.html", "text": "Fitting issues From the release of the PS2 version (of which you can read the review at this address) to the release of the PC version, more than a year has passed. If video games were wine this time would have made Onimusha 3 a cornerstone of the action genre on computers (on PS2 there is a lot of competition on PC there aren't many titles of this genre). Unfortunately, although it can be said without fear of contradiction that it is a good product, it is distinctly felt that the wine is in danger of turning into vinegar. In the first place, the porting was total so total that it can be considered unscrupulous. As often happens in these cases, the developers didn't bother to adapt the game to the different peculiarities of computers compared to consoles. This emerges forcefully whenever reference is made to the control system, given that the various feasible actions are illustrated with the PS2 controller. This implies the need to practice more with the controls, especially if you use the classic mouse and keyboard. In only one case, however, the question of controls becomes frustrating: much later in the game you will have to face a puzzle in which you will have to press keys in a precise order... pity that the usual PS2 joypad will always be displayed on the screen and that, if you keys are mapped very differently from this, it will be difficult to enter the combination shown. The advice is therefore to map the 4 main cross keys following the original scheme, while the ideal would be to have a decent joypad in order to almost completely solve this problem. the porting was total so total that it can be considered unscrupulous Fitting issues Another sector transplanted without thinking too much is the technical one. Not bad for the sound (the music is very beautiful as well as the effects); unfortunately, however, the graphics show rather annoying limits. In the first place the textures: couldn't they have been improved in definition and detail? The washed-out effect is predominant throughout the game as well as a widespread cubedness of the objects scattered around the scenarios (perhaps at Capcom they have never enlarged a bitmap image... who knows). The models of the main characters and enemies are done really well (in some close-ups they border on photorealism), but everything else appears decidedly ~dated~. The graphics that on PS2 can be defined as exceptional, slipped into an average 2005 PC, are at least inadequate (to be good). Much more could have been done without committing too much. What game are we playing? Clarified that it would be the case to take greater care in transporting a title from console to PC (the problems indicated for the Capcom product afflict many other games converted in a hurry), trying at least to properly adjust the control system to adapt it to the coupled mouse + keyboard, we just have to agree on the goodness of this Onimusha 3: Demon Siege which stands at the top of the genre without making too much effort. For those who don't already know it, we're talking about a third-person action adventure with a great emphasis on combat. Driving the two aforementioned characters (with the possibility of driving a third on three occasions) we will have to break the demonic bones of the genma army both in the past and in the future. To unite the two ~eras~ we will take care of another very particular character, a kind of winged fairy, who will jump from one hero to another accompanying both throughout the adventure. However, its role will be very important: it will help in the collection of objects and, depending on the dress worn, it will provide supernatural support by adding very interesting and decisive powers (for example it can be useful to increase experience faster by letting out more spirit orbs from slain enemies); on a couple of occasions he will also act as a courier between the two eras (but it's better not to anticipate the plot too much). The game structure is very linear and includes the typical elements of the genre: many fights with assorted monsters of various kinds seasoned with elaborate and pleasant puzzles, albeit easy to solve. Nothing is missing, compared to the canons of the genre: combos, secrets to discover, two sets of upgradeable weapons (three if we also consider the third usable character), a varied and rather elaborate bestiary, the inevitable bosses and a series of exotic scenarios that they go to exploit the two reference cultures of history. a third-person action-adventure with a strong emphasis on combat What game are we playing? Flying Japanese castles, the possessed Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe stuffed with creaturesand grinning plus many other typical locations, will be the backdrop to our heroic deeds. Onimusha 3 succeeds perfectly in being what it is: a mega-production studied in every detail to capture the player in its shimmering coils Miscellaneous and possible Beyond all feasible considerations, Onimusha 3 succeeds perfectly in being what it is: a megaproduction studied in every detail to capture the player in its shimmering coils. Having abandoned all innovative ambitions, present in the previous episodes, we find ourselves in our hands a light but articulated product that reaches its apex in the scenes set in the world of demons (these are hidden scenes but very easy to reach) where, being able to drop each mask and not having to respond to any logic or coherence, the game shows its purest structure: that of a frenetic fighting game. These are meta-sequences in which the characters can best express their essence without the need to tell anything. Moving on to something else, we just have to mention some other interesting data: to completely finish the adventure it will take about 15 hours even if some more difficult sequences could force you to try again several times, slightly increasing the longevity. Once you finish the game you will unlock various very valuable extras that further increase the time you will keep Onimusha 3 installed on your harddisk. Speaking of playability we are at really high levels with moves that are as simple to make as they are beautiful to look at and with a progressive increase in the challenge that goes perfectly with the enhancement of the characters. Hardware boxes Onimushua 3: Demon Siege did not give any problems on two different PCs: the first a Pentium 4 at 3.4 GHz with 2 GB of Ram and a 256 MB GeForce 7800 graphics card, the second an Athlon 2800 MHz with 1 GB of Ram and a GeForce Fx 5900 XT graphics card. In both cases, despite setting all the details to the maximum, there were no uncertainties in the framerate and no too invasive bugs were found. To make it run decently, however, we recommend at least a 2 GHz processor, 512 MB of Ram and a video card from GeForce 4 (or equivalent) up. Final comment Sin. Onimusha 3 is a beautiful game but, without the amazement for the visual beauty that characterized the PS2 version, the overall result is clearly inferior to its counterpart. For the rest, the gray and light areas that also distinguished it in the previous incarnation remain: a solid narrative for a story of disarming banality; an immediate and refined gameplay but too oriented towards pure action; great attention to the ~scenographies~ which, however, lack imagination and are rather similar to postcards ... A good title, in short, which must certainly be tried by lovers of the genre without a console, but which could have been much better if only it had been cared for a little more. Pros There aren't many titles of this genre on PC Well balanced in its elements Fun from start to finish Cons Trivial and predictable plot The adaptation could have been much better Something is missing from the PS2 version Jean Ren Direct 3D The third chapter of Capcom's Onimusha saga finally arrives on PC, where the good Samanosuke Akechi, protagonist of the first episode, will have to deal with the attempt by the Genma to invade planet Earth in the year 2000. To help him in his endeavor will be Jacques Blanc (played by Jean Reno), a surly modern-day policeman, who finds himself catapulted into Japan in the 1500s where he will have to make his way home, dealing with the same enemies as Samanosuke. In short, a meatloaf in a Japanese-French sauce with some interesting twists and a great many digressions that often lead to the pathetic, sometimes reaching the extreme trashy (how not to mention Jacques who jumps onto a ship, from a pier, with his motorbike mysteriously ending up in the 1500 together with him?). It must be said that, if from the point of view of the fabula we are in bad shape, from that of the narration things improve. Despite inconsistencies and details left to chance, Onimusha 3, despite not having particular twists, is told very well with frequent cutscenes but well balanced with the action, shot discreetly and never too long-winded or redundant.
