We remember very clearly our brutal approach to the demo of Demon's Souls, during the Tokyo Game Show of 2008: suggestive setting and armor, woodiness of the main protagonist, many beatings taken by the opponents, for a dead/time ratio played decidedly against this 'last. It was immediately clear, however, that he had an important and imposing take on the game, which would have paved the way for the following chapters. Hand in hand with success have also come the so-called ~haters~ and the ~i-am-not-impressed~, those who consider the game boring, too hermetic from a narrative point of view and with long-standing and never resolved structural problems. Criticisms that can be shared in part, it would be stupid to deny it, but net of a type of game that inevitably cannot be liked by everyone, the series created by From Software manages to give enormous satisfaction. Three of many, that of overcoming a difficult boss by squeezing your brain and studying the setting or finding an object capable of enhancing your equipment and being able to continue, but also of unlocking an ingenious shortcut that will finally allow you to avoid a particularly difficult section . Fun and light-heartedness are left to other video games and last year Bloodborne also taught that there may still be so much new to show and tell within this genre, while renewing the aesthetic sector. For Dark Souls III it's a completely different matter, however: the risk of causing a sense of dj vu by using recycled material was around the corner, but it is also the closure of a trilogy that sees Miyazaki's return to the helm after the first chapter, in a more mature technological context and with the experience accumulated with the previous souls-like. The final result can be defined as a mix of these elements, but if you have already peeked at the vote at the bottom of this review (as sure as death in the game!), the qualities obviously outweigh the even present defects. Dark Souls III closes the saga created by Hidetaka Miyazaki: here is the review after over 50 hours of play Burning flame The action RPGs created by Hidetaka Miyazaki have always stood out for having a rather cryptic game world and narrative, above all because they are not presented directly to the player, but with references that leave room for interpretations, half-sentences said by secondary characters, small suggestions present in the description of the objects. Together with the need, sometimes, to ingenuity to discover secret passages, optional bosses or particularly useful objects for the continuation of the adventure. Dark Souls III does not escape this paradigm, but also represents the most ~frank~ episode of the series: the main protagonist, risen from the ashes and defined as a ~dormant flame~, must bring the five Lords of the Embers back to their throne by finding them and, if necessary extreme by eliminating them, within different settings, interspersed with as many connecting and other dungeons and manned by always particularly angry enemies and bosses. After a rather simple initial section - for those familiar with the saga - we meet a first enemy very inspired from an aesthetic point of view, Gundyr the Judge, who beyond his skills allows you to refresh your memory on how they ~work~ the bosses in Dark Souls: two configurations, in practice, the second of which activates at about half the energy bar and usually offers a higher level of challenge, with more lethal attacks. Once you have defeated Gundyr, you reach the Altar of Bond, a huge hall that can be considered as the central hub of the game. Inside there are the thrones of the Lords of the Embers, as well as all the secondary characters who meet and ~recruit~ during the adventure. From the Guardian of the Fire, which allows you to spend the souls acquired from killings to enhance the characteristics of your character, to the blacksmith, the seller of objects and the masters of the magic present, those related to pyromancy, miracles and witchcraft. A bit like the Sanctuary of the fire of Dark Souls or the Great Cathedral of Bloodborne, in this case, however, in a practically exclusive way.Each character present, however, follows its own script and reacts on the basis of its own behavior: some will come to help or may become hostile, others ask for scrolls, tomes and further objects to learn more powerful spells or upgrade weapons to a higher level . The Altar of the Bond is therefore the center of operations of Dark Souls III, and from the bonfire present there we leave for the first setting, that of Lothric already seen during the public beta a few weeks ago. At the same time it becomes possible to travel between one bonfire and another without any limitations or inaccessible points as happened for example in Dark Souls, which among other things proposed moving after several hours of play. In short, everything appears a little easier to understand in this third chapter, at least in the basic dynamics, in the progression of the main adventure and in the use and enhancement of weapons and spells. However, this does not mean that the classic canons of the series are upset: the interlude sequences are always few and proposed around the clashes with the bosses, the nuances and details must always be sought proactively by the player; it is also important to read the description of the equipment and try it out, to suit most situations. Just to give an example, a particular boss is practically impossible to kill with all the weapons available; there is one in particular, however, which is found in its vicinity, capable of unleashing an attack with very harmful effects and by reading its description, it is understood that it is linked precisely to the past of the enemy blocking the way. Light and dark Let's take a big step back to character creation: there are ten classes available, each of which guarantees a different initial distribution of the nine available physical parameters, as well as different equipment and initial spells. Nothing prevents you from changing your style and character growth on the run, but the first hours of the game will undoubtedly be marked by the choices made in that first phase. The knight, for example, allows you to immediately obtain a cuirass, a shield and a heavy weapon, in order to take the first steps while suffering little damage at the expense of magic and agility. On the other hand, an assassin will be very skilled, thanks also to his light equipment, in avoiding enemy attacks in a roll and consuming less energy (stamina). A sorcerer will immediately have two spell slots available; the discriminated equalizes all the values and offers, as always, the maximum challenge from the beginning. After playing so many hours, the fears of negative influences from Bloodborne have been swept away, and indeed the experience gained with the exclusive PlayStation 4 has greatly benefited the creation of Dark Souls III. The title of From Software, in fact, offers a much better response to the commands than in the previous chapters, a more immediate and coherent spell summoning time than the rest and a heaviness of the main protagonist linked solely to the type of equipment he uses. The fights are more dynamic and frenetic, it is possible to chain combinations of attacks in a simpler way and everything appears to be linked even more to the player's skills pad (or mouse and keyboard!) in the hand. However, all this does not affect those pillars that have made the fortune of Dark Souls: the impossibility of running with equipment greater than 100%, a less effective roll over 70% of the bearable load, the presence of parry (excuse the English , but they are the technical terms most used by fans of the saga, and we will explain them later), backstep and backstab; not the Bloodborne dodge. First things first: our character can equip a weapon for each hand, usually the offensive ones go to the right, the defensive ones to the left. Let's imagine the classic combination with sword and shield: with RB (Xbox One pad, used in our review) the basic attacks are performed, with RT the powerful ones, which can also be loaded. With LB we have the parry, with LT the sweep with the shield. If you have an adequate one, it is good to learn the ~parry~ technique, i.e. to counter the opponent's attack at the right moment, precisely with the left trigger, in such a way as to be able to inflict a critical blow capable of doing a lot of damage. harm. The shields themselves have various parameters, also linked to the degree of absorption of physical and magical blows, on a percentage basis and net of some that are impossible to counter. Other combinations include for example the double weapon, the use of the bow or thebells, sticks or gloves to evoke the different spells; dulcis in fundo, the two-handed grip, which allows access to the novelty of this third chapter, called the Art of Combat. It activates with LT and is often different depending on the weapon. In the case of the long sword it allows a guard position in order to deliver some critical blows with the right lats, with the ax the attack power is increased, with the scimitar there is a horizontal attack at three hundred and sixty degrees. Both the Art of Combat and spells consume Action Points, connected to a blue bar located under the vitality bar. The latter must be embedded in the available slots, the number of which depends on the parameter called ~Harmonization~. As mentioned, clothing affects the mobility of one's character and equally offers several alternatives, each of which absorbs critical, thrusting or spell-related attacks in a different way; also in this case it is good to choose the configuration based on your fighting style, but also in relation to the opponent you are facing. Therefore, not even this chapter lacks enormous variety in the construction process of the ~build~ that best suits us, for many possible combinations both from an aesthetic and functional point of view. The greater dynamism mentioned above allows you to face multiple enemies at the same time once you have become fully familiar with the control system, also the technique of attracting opponents to face them one at a time can make sense for the toughest ones and with a more lethal range of moves. A further possibility offered by the combat system is represented by the so-called backstab, or by the critical hits that can be inflicted when positioned behind the opponents; also in this case you need to practice a little to avoid the blow (or blows!) received, but its use can be vital on more than one occasion. The multiplayer Since the first Demon's Souls, From Software has implemented an integration of the online into its titles cryptic and at the same time innovative, sneaky and not immediately understandable. In Dark Souls III it is possible to play offline without any connection, of course, but online access allows you to obtain a number of interesting additional features. It starts from some patches of blood that allow you to observe a red hologram of other players in their stages before death: after five chapters we would like this feature to be enhanced by also showing the executioner enemy, to better understand the dynamics of the killing. In addition it is possible to write or read notes written by other players, which can be useful, for example, to anticipate the presence of an ambush or to give an idea of the opponent's weaknesses. There is no shortage of gestural emoticons, which can be accessed using the ~view~ key from a wider customizable rose and with some rather nice goodies. The management of cooperative games and those in PvP is governed by two objects and by the state of the player: the white stone allows you to leave a mark on the ground, which other people can use to summon you in their game to lend a hand; the red eye globe, on the other hand, allows you to invade other people's worlds in order to kill your opponent and gain souls and precious objects. Your character can be in the form of a dormant flame and therefore cannot be invaded nor can you call (unless you have a certain magic...) help, using an object called ~embers~, can restore your state underlined by some visible fiery cracks on the armor; at this point it is in the possibility of summoning and being invaded. There are other small conditions that we leave the player with the pleasure of discovering - the pacts work in a very similar way, with the possibility of being summoned automatically depending on the faction, and with the need to bring certain objects to the pact keepers, in order to to increase their loyalty - while as in Bloodborne From Software it has implemented matchmaking between people from different continents and the possibility of setting a password for online games: if your friends also use it and are in the same area as the player, then in fact it is possible to limit cooperation only to these people, in a rustic and somewhat cumbersome way. Curiosity How many optional areas and bosses are there? Two areas and four bosses in the canonical sense of the term, but in reality there are several small sections that can be skipped (a pity, for the objects present) still arriving at the end of the game. Is it possible to upgrade Estus flasks and bonfires?Yes in the first case, by burning their shards in the Al bonfire", "date": "2016-04-04", "grade": "9.2"}
