A faithful conversion, apparently, which in fact does not care to adapt to the new context and relies a little too much on automatisms to make a gameplay that inevitably loses its edge more streamlined and immediate. in the face of these simplifications. But let's proceed in order, as they say in these cases. History Blade & Soul: Revolution, the main villains of the game. There is an interesting narrative component in Blade & Soul: Revolution, which establishes very specific roles and situations after a short introductory phase. The character that we will be able to create with the editor, and which can belong to four different races with further distinctions of sex and category, for a total of twelve classes, is an apprentice of the Hongmoon School who trains to become a skilled warrior .But at some point, the school is attacked by the army led by the deadly Jinsoyun and her lieutenants, who kill most of the students and teachers, including our old master, in an attempt to recover a magical sword, the Twilight's Edge. Once the blade has been stolen, the enemies leave, but not before having reduced our alter ego to the point of death, who naturally swears revenge once he has recovered. Gameplay Blade & Soul: Revolution adopts a rather crowded and confusing interface. Although the early stages of the campaign appear a bit rushed, they manage to involve us just enough to motivate our progression in the game, made up of more or less equal missions, fights, unlocking new loot and upgrades that at a certain point will allow us finally to face Jinsoyun and his subordinates on equal terms. Unfortunately, the initial impact is not the best: Asian MMORPGs have the bad habit of confusing users with a crowded interface, and Blade & Soul: Revolution is no exception. On PC perhaps it is normal to have to deal with such a quantity of options and information, but for the mobile debut it would have definitely been the case to thin out a bit and make things simpler. Blade & Soul: Revolution includes, among the various options, also a Photo Mode. The lack of attention to the new context is also found in the touch controls, which make use of a fixed, non-repositionable virtual analog stick, which brings to mind productions from a few years ago and makes movements much less precise than they could have been. The biggest problem, however, are the truly excessive automatisms, which provide an excuse to avoid the lengthiness of the many quests and an exploration that is not made that much interesting, quickly leading us to our destination and thus allowing us to limit ourselves to reaping the fruits of the our progression. Blade & Soul: Revolution, our character in the main hub. Fortunately, the combat system is a good reason to take over the reins of the experience, but even here the feeling is that the developers have introduced too many things all at once rather than increasing the complexity gradually. In fact, on the right side of the screen we find numerous buttons for attacks, each equipped with at least one variant to create even very spectacular combos and further icons that are used for dodging. It is a pity that this system, confusing at the beginning but without other endowed with a certain potential, cannot also rely on a good impact yield: the lock on enemies works well and at least simplifies things, but it seems to not hit anything when our character launches his blows. There is a lot of slipperiness and inconsistency, when a few foresight would have been enough to get something decidedly more fun out of this title. Structure and technique The system packaged by the developers is immediately put at the service of a very long but not very varied campaign, to which are added extra modes between dungeons and competitive arenas. The numbers that are missing from Blade & Soul: Revolution are certainly not, which moreover places itself in a fairly honest way in the face of those who do not want to spend money to play: the best loot must be paid for, but you can proceed for free without major problems. of the technical realization there are certainly good intuitions, put in place especially during the cutscenes, but otherwise the game is a bit too difficult to run at maximum settingsand artistically it is rather generic: just look at a few images to understand exactly what type of product it is. We also spread a pitiful veil over the English dubbing, completely decontextualized in its interpretations.", "date": "2021-03-11", "grade": "6.0"}
