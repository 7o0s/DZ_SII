A precise definition that actually includes a multitude of products and which - remaining in the field of video games - concerns any title designed to be exploited in an ideal way by multiple players in the same place. Yet there is one factor, accessibility, which is truly capable of making a difference; to what extent is a product effectively usable to a group of friends perhaps with little or no experience, without creating excessive frustration or disparity? An example above all: Rock Band or Guitar Hero, indicated as perfect party titles, but in reality often complicated to offer to neophytes or beginners. So here it is: if it's accessibility you're looking for, if you simply want to have fun without worries and worries, few other titles will do more for you than Just Dance 3. I don't feel like dancing The most significant novelty of this third release of Ubisoft's dancing series is certainly linked to the multiplatform nature, which therefore abandons the exclusivity of Nintendo Wii to also embrace Xbox 360 + Kinect and (in December) PlayStation 3 + Move. Especially on the Microsoft console, the situation opens up a rather interesting challenge with Dance Central, which arrived almost simultaneously with its second episode; despite sharing the underlying theme, in reality the differences between the two products are more than sensitive and such as to be able to suggest a precise choice to potential buyers. Where Harmonix's offer is more rigorous, structured and decidedly less permissive, Ubisoft's on the contrary appears more festive, rowdy and immediate. In other words: do you really want to learn to dance, or at least try hard? So, Dance Central. On the contrary, if you prefer to move without dignity while having genuine fun, here's Just Dance. Among the advantages of the latter it should also be noted the possibility of playing, even with Kinect, up to 4 at the same time; assuming your living room has the necessary space, that is. Having finished the discussion on the infighting at Microsoft, we can therefore move on to talking about the game itself, even if in reality there is not much to describe especially for those who have already had the opportunity to try the previous editions of the franchise; the news are few and the gist remains largely the same because Just Dance 3, as the title suggests, just invites you to dance. The medium with which it is proposed is that of choreography, obviously personalized for each of the approximately fifty pieces available; on the screen a colored silhouette performs steps that the players must try to reproduce, so as to give life to a final result that is as harmonious as possible. It is obvious that a lot goes between saying and doing, and unless you have a background in the discipline, the results are often more exhilarating than admirable; and it is precisely in this moment that the Ubisoft product is able to give its best, that is when you approach it with a smile on your face and the desire to get involved, make a fool of yourself and have fun. Impossible to get to game over, and even the performance evaluation is rather rose water; elements to consider if you are looking for a challenge factor in the video game that in Just Dance 3 is not perceived, if not marginally. Surely multiplayer is the ideal environment, because losing all respectability with friends makes everything much more beautiful. On a purely content level, the differences between the Xbox 360 and Wii versions are linked solely to the Just Create mode, absent on the Nintendo console, and which in summary allows you to create your own personalized choreographies to then share online. The tracklist is instead identical, and sufficiently varied to be able to meet the tastes of most of the public, obviously limited to the pop / rock / dance genre. The choice to initially block a certain amount of songs and contents, which become available only by collecting points with one's performances, is not entirely convincing; given the nature of the product, it probably would have been better to leave everything immediately accessible. Finally, a note on navigating the menus, much faster, more precise and more effective via Wiimote than Kinect.
