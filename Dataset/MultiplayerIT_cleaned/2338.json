{"name": "Return to Castle Wolfenstein.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/return-to-castle-wolfenstein-3.html", "text": "The road to glory starts here! Before concluding this strange introduction, let's see who created this brand new masterpiece (yes, you won't have to wait for the end of the article to understand how I think...). The software house that has taken on this immense task is Gray Matter Studios, already authors of the famous Kingpin, of a mission pack for Quake2 as well as other minor titles of the Redneck Rampage series. But now it's time to put on your grandfather's uniform (known American soldier... yes, right...) and dive into the middle of the Second World War: Castle Wolfenstein awaits us! The history of man always repeats itself: once upon a time there was power and there was man who craved it... The game opens with a rather atypical introduction film, which shows a hooded man, in a presumably very ancient era, chasing a mysterious dark knight with evident supernatural powers. The story then picks up directly during the world war and introduces us to the exploits of our alter ego, the soldier William 'B.J.' Blazkowicz, who infiltrated Castle Wolfenstein on behalf of the OSA (Office of Secret Actions). The adventure opens when we have to find a way out of the castle, taking advantage of a partisan contact who will provide us with the necessary help, to return to headquarters with the news in our possession. Our escape will take us through a village teeming with Nazis into dusty catacombs and confront us with the chilling truth that, in addition to conventional weapons, they are developing an arsenal of biological weapons and carrying out mysterious experiments in the field of occult. We will discover secret special combat forces, a mysterious SS Paranormal Division but also mutilated corpses transformed into out-of-control war machines, as well as ancient undead warriors and nightmarish creatures waiting to be awakened from their ancient slumber. We will learn that behind all this lies the enigmatic figure of Heinrich Himmler, right arm of the fhurer, involved in the search for the tomb of an ancient ruler and his Dark Knights, and of which we will have to reveal the entire plan. We will visit very different environments, from the ancient stone halls of the castle, to the narrow and suffocating earth tunnels of the catacombs, to then end up in a secret base, hidden in a valley at twilight and continue towards unknown destinations. We will find ancient objects but also experimental weapons, we will meet men and monsters and we will soon discover that the difference between one and the other is more subtle than one might believe. The history of man always repeats itself: once upon a time there was power and there was man who craved it... The mechanics of pain and the instruments of punishment The single player mode finally returns overbearing to its role as prince of the video game! In this renewed incarnation of soldier Blazkowicz, we will return to spending sleepless nights chased by Nazis and monsters, alternating phases of reasoning with moments of acute heart-pounding tension. I must say that the first moments of the game didn't give a very positive impression, since it seemed to me that I was faced with a simple mod for Q3, a very elaborate mod to be honest, but only this and nothing more. The sights, for example, are the same and the only differences were in the graphics and models. Playing a little more, however, there were so many new features to make RtCW a complete game in its own right, and not just a famous mod. The fact of sharing the same engine as Q3 can easily mislead at the beginning, especially the most hardened players, and be a misleading evaluation element. In reality, we are dealing with a real masterpiece, a game, that is, which certainly does not add new features to the genre and does not shine for its originality, but which manages to embody a much higher value of fun than the average. so much so that it can aspire to be the new touchstone for titles to come. One of the first things that catches the eye is the fact that we can interact with the environment, even if in reality it is above all a question of destroying the things we encounter, or of using them for the purposes of our mission. To avoid the player furiously clicking on everything, an icon has been introduced, in the hud, which is activated when we are faced with an object to use (or break). For example, we can collect chairs and shield ourselves with them, or use them to hit opponents or simply put them down to reach an otherwise inaccessible place, such as above a table to relax.add a mezzanine floor. This fact allows us to illustrate another feature of this game and that is the presence of many secret areas full of treasures (just like in its ancient predecessor) that will make statistics at the end of the map. Interesting, as well as very useful, the presence of a summary table that shows us the game statistics and which is activated a little before the end of each level, so as to allow us to go back in search of those damned treasures that have escaped us. Now let's see what are the substantial innovations of RtCW and what make it such an exciting and fun game. The mechanics of pain and the instruments of punishment The guys from Gray Matter Studios have decided to point the needle of a virtual scale halfway between realism and frenetic action, inserting elements that certainly take into account many real factors, but without weighing down the game and still maintaining a basic setting rather action. Among the most important innovations we find the sprint bar, that is (as in Diablo2, for example) we will be able to run faster just by pressing a key, but the longer we hold it down, the more the bar will empty, until, having reached zero, we we will have to stop. Or, when we use the sniper, the hand will not be still and the aim will suffer, especially if we keep the crosshair activated for too long. And again, there are no bonuses or power ups, but health is found in the form of medkits and food and sometimes we will find beers which, mysteriously, will give us a sprint bonus. Also, automatic weapons fire will be inaccurate over long ranges, describing a cone that will make it difficult to hit the target, while some weapons will overheat if used too much. On the other hand, however, it is possible to do things that will make the purists of tactical realism cringe, such as running with the panzerfaust (rocket launcher) or the flamethrower shouldered. What does this mean? Simply that it is an action-setting game that forces the player to think as a soldier and not as a fragger. Now let's add meat to the fire: let's examine the main weapons: KNIFE - we obviously start with the ever-present knife, with which we can open cans and sharpen wooden sticks during breaks. But the knife will be very useful when it comes to taking an enemy from behind, and then here we will pretend to play Commandos and kill him with a single shot! LUGER - the Luger is the pistol supplied to the German troops and is the first weapon that we will find in the game. Noisy and not very powerful, it will mainly serve to defend us in the first moments of escape, at least until we find a silencer ... MP40 - is the machine gun, our most faithful ally during the first part of the game. Noisy, but powerful and mean and with a moderate magazine capacity, it is deadly at short ranges.STEN - it's another machine gun, but this time it has a silencer on the barrel which makes it deadly in infiltration actions. The only drawback, it overheats if used too intensely.MAUSER - the Mauser is a shotgun, but it's not the usual sawed-off shotgun, this is a shotgun capable of hitting at very long distances and will be one of our most inseparable friends, especially when , later in the game, we will get our hands on the telescopic sight and we will transform ourselves into deadly snipers! GRENADE - the typical German hand grenade, the one with the wooden handle and the cylinder head. Once triggered, we will hear the timer warn us of the imminent detonation until we launch it.PANZERFAUST - could the rocket launcher be missing? Of course not and here it is in its world war guise! VENOM GUN - It is the usual chaingun, which shoots at a very high speed and is capable of mowing down swarms of soldiers in a few moments. It's a pity that this too overheats... FLAME THROWER - and here is the big piece of the series, the weapon that will print the most sadistic smile ever seen on our faces (yes, I can say that video games are terrible!): the flamethrower! What more to say? Have fun and remember not to do it at home.TESLA CANNON - As the name itself may suggest, it is an experimental weapon that emits a very powerful electric discharge. Not recommended to be on the other side...And finally, we find the most tacky weapon ever seen in a shooter: the legendary, extremely powerful, CALCIONE! BJ will be able to use his kick to break grates, open doors and even hit enemies. Anyone who remembers Duke Nukem will shed a tear. The mechanics of pain and the instruments of punishment They think, in a world of electronic velvet and binary mountains IncoWe will enter three categories of enemies in RtCW: the Nazis, the Undead and the X-Creatures. The Nazis are organized according to a hierarchy that goes from the simple soldier, armed with machine guns, lugers and hand grenades, up to the Venom Soldiers, armed with the deadly venom gun and flamethrower, passing through officers and special bodies. Among these, the deadly elite guards stand out, in the service of the officer Helga von Bulow, head of the Paranormal Division of the SS. The Elite Guardsmen are an elite body of women trained to fight silently. Armed with Sten, they prove to be infallible killers. The Undead, on the other hand, are what we all know: the corpses of ancient warriors who come back to life to attack anyone who comes near them. Some of them have paranormal powers and special attacks. The only way to really kill them is to tear their bodies apart. Finally, the X-Creatures are the result of crazy Nazi experiments on human beings, exploiting a mixture of occult sciences and experimental technology. Often out of control, monsters and the undead will rush not only against us, but also against the Nazis themselves, creating three-way battles a bit like in Hal Life, between aliens and marines. They think, in a world of electronic velvet and binary mountains What is immediately striking is the artificial intelligence of the enemies which, for once, simulates behaviors that are not only credible, but even such as to put the player in serious difficulty. The soldiers communicate with each other and, if suspicious, assume a wary attitude. They also search around and can retreat if wounded, then return with reinforcements. More than once you will be taken by surprise by the ambush of some retreating soldier, while in some cases we will be able to see ourselves kicking back the grenade just thrown. In short, there is something to keep your eyes open, above all because the fights are never trivial but push the player to think instead of instinctively diving, shooting wildly. Scattered throughout the game, we will find fixed positions, therefore machine guns and turrets, which we can use to make a clean sweep of our attackers, but they will not let themselves be mowed down too easily and instead will seek shelter, if possible, and will even try to take over our position . And what about the undead warriors, who take cover behind their shields to avoid being hit, as they advance towards us? Simply terrifying! Creatures made of darkness and dust, with fiery eyes, who come against us and get back up after being repeatedly hit... Gentlemen, this is a show! They think, in a world of electronic velvet and binary mountains To surround an advanced and credible artificial intelligence, there are a thousand details that cannot escape the attentive eye of the player. Just look at the soldiers on patrol, for example, who emit clouds of frozen breath, or the incredible, very detailed textures, which even allow us to see the ice in the soldiers' hair, under the snow. But if it is possible to enjoy such a show it is also thanks to the graphics engine used, an engine that finally shows all its best capabilities. Naturally, I'm talking about the Quake3: Arena engine, or rather its successor, Team Arena. The amount of polygons present on the maps and in the models is decidedly high, much more than what has been seen so far in other shooters, but the best figure is made by the textures, which border on photorealism, giving us images of strong impact and, I will never get tired of repeat it, a level of detail that is incredible. Added to all this are the splendid animations of the models and even the facial animations synchronized with speech, which manage to reproduce realistic attitudes from all the characters present in the game. Imagine two soldiers on patrol in the cold, chatting amicably, their words congealing into wisps of steam. Now imagine sneaking up and making a noise carelessly, then the soldiers are alarmed and start looking, but you manage to approach one of them silently from behind, you draw your knife and... Here, this is one of many examples of real game action. The maps, then, take full advantage of the available engine and so we will see narrow tunnels, dusty caves, snowy courtyards and wide valleys, all without polygon economy. At this point, being a gamer myself, even before the author of this article, I know well what it means to be faced with a title like this and I imagine the question that many", "date": "2001-12-01", "grade": null}
