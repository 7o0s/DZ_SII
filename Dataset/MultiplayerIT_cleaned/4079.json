It must be said that Fire Emblem has never been a particularly memorable series from this point of view, with some dutiful exceptions; in this sense, it would certainly have been appropriate to follow in the footsteps of the previous Fire Emblem: Three Houses, which with its ferocious developments and multiple branches, had met with the favor of the public and critics. For some reason the Japanese developer has preferred to focus on the gameplay. In our review of Fire Emblem Engage you will find out if and how much this very particular and controversial choice has weighed on our evaluation. Fire Emblem Engage, Alear, and the Marth Emblem in one cinematic And then, somewhere, under that B-series fantasy patina, there is also an interesting story, with some not particularly original but sufficiently unusual gimmicks. We fall into such clichs, between blood ties, amnesia, revelations and millennial Marranos who want to conquer the multiverse here too: the problem is that Fire Emblem Engage tells this story in a clumsy way, with childish dialogues - which the Italian localization desperately seeks to revive - and lazy shots in the scenes that precede and follow the clashes, in which the most important characters discuss or comment on the events. The direction is static, not to say sloppy, and there is an overwhelming detachment between these pedestrian scenes and the splendid computer graphics cinematics, shot much better and decidedly more dynamic, which represent the salient moments of the story and which unfortunately count on fingers of one hand. This does not mean that Fire Emblem Engage is an experience to forget, if only because it relies on a highly respected cast. We repeat, more convinced than before, now that we have completed the game: in this colorful fantasy context, the eccentric style of the illustrator Mika Pikazo works really well and perfectly characterizes the characters who will join Alear's cause or who will oppose him on the battlefield. The different looks express the characters, lineages and cultures to which the many supporting characters that we will recruit in our army belong, since one of the main themes mentioned in the adventure is precisely the importance of putting aside differences and joining forces against an enemy common. Unlike previous Fire Emblems, in which the players' counterparts were silent and without a precise identity, Engage revolves around the figure of Alear, a kind of messiah - male or female, the choice is yours - who awakens after a thousand years to save Elyos from the return of Sombron, the Evil Dragon. Fire Emblem Engage, the computer graphics kinematics are really beautiful Most of the supporting characters have few jokes in the main campaign, entrusted mostly to the representatives of the kingdoms that make up Elyos and who will bind to Alear, but the usual conversations of Support, which are unlocked by making the various units participate in the clashes, help to better understand our knowledge not only of the secondary characters, but also of the Emblems. The latter, who as you probably know are the protagonists of the previous Fire Emblems, have a leading role in the story, but the references to the titles they come from are pure fanservice and will almost certainly escape those who have not experienced those games. a shame that Intelligent Systems has overlooked this aspect of its flagship brand. Our impression, in fact, is not that the Japanese developer tried and failed, but that he really didn't want to commit to the narrative: one gets the feeling that this story exists only and only to justify the gameplay ... that luckily it's bloody exciting. The Fire Emblem Engage combat system Fire Emblem Engage, the variety of maps and situations is extraordinary The return to a leaner and more intuitive combat system should not suggest a bland and anachronistic Fire Emblem, especially when compared to Three Houses with its sophistication, at times even excessive. This time Intelligent Systems has calibrated the learning curve almost to perfection, introducing the player to the many dynamics of the gameplay in a progressive way over the course of the almost thirty chapters that make up the campaign. Initially it may seem that the clashes are imfocused only on the properties of the battlefield and the relationship between weapons - much more important than in the past, due to the Breach, a condition inflicted by favored weapons that prevents the enemy from counterattacking in the next turn - since the first Emblems that unlock they give their owners relatively immediate abilities. As the chapters go by and the other Emblems are found, a plethora of mechanics is revealed, often inspired by the other titles in the series. The most fitting example we can do with the Emblem of Corrin, the protagonist of Fire Emblem Fates, who can use the Dragon Vein to give the boxes on the map positive or negative properties. Fire Emblem Engage, the Byleth Emblem allows you to reactivate up to four units that have already moved It must be said that the variety of objectives, maps and conditions is truly exemplary, and perhaps the widest in the history of the Intelligent Systems series. You also play to find out what else awaits us in the next mission, and if the goal is often rather linear - defeat the bosses or reach the exit - in most cases you have to reach it by roundabout routes: the weather gets in the way unfavorable, such as the fog that obscures the view or the snow that slows down the movements, and obstacles such as the miasma, which protect the enemies and which must be dissipated or circumvented. The entry of reinforcements, who often catch the players from behind, in the middle of the mission, may seem unfair or unfair, but it always keeps you on your toes and in the hands of a valid strategist can represent a source of additional experience points. The reality is that Fire Emblem Engage is a much more challenging title than in the past, and for several reasons. We played it on Hard without permadeath - the timing of a review clashes with a healthy dose of masochism, however stimulating it may be - but the game only allows it to be lowered at a later time. Even so, however, we had to touch the Dragon Chronogem on more than one occasion and sometimes even restarted games. Fire Emblem Engage, the Four Hounds of Sombron will give you a hard time The Dragon Chronogem is an artifact that allows us to rewind time in battle and go back to a turn that perhaps caused the premature death of a unit. On Hard level it can only be used a certain number of times, while on Normal the Chronogem can be used infinitely, and in any case the game does not immediately end when Alear dies: the player can use the Chronogem to go back or restart the game. mission by choosing whether or not to keep the experience points earned, and therefore the progress made despite the Game Over. In any case, at least on Hard, there is never the feeling that the game is unbalanced or that the developer is overwhelming the player with sheer brute force: a wise choice of units, shifts or Emblems usually makes the difference between victory and the defeat. Despite this, even at the Normal level the game is still moderately challenging, with an array of enemies that are much more numerous and stronger than the few units that the player can deploy on the field. For this reason it is essential to calculate the passive skills of the classes and characters, exploiting the synergies to overwhelm the enemies before they overwhelm us: the artificial intelligence is satisfactory and tends to surround the disadvantaged units such as weapons or residual Life Points, often targeting healers and archers, who cannot counterattack at close range. Fire Emblem Engage, Teleragnarok is one of the most devastating spells in the game Fire Emblem Engage has been a rewarding strategy experience at the difficulty levels we've experienced, and we dare not imagine what a delicious torment it can be in Insanity, especially when you consider that the campaign drops gold by the dropper and upgrades the equipment of our army appears very difficult, if not impossible, despite all the features available: it is of little use to have the possibility to immediately buy or upgrade weapons, if there is no money to do so. The game is designed to force us to micro-manage resources , to decide if we want to spend those few golds on the improvement of a weapon - which we can always spin between the different units - or on the Donations board, which virtually multiplies the other resources, such as the ingredients for the canteen or the minerals that are needed to the blacksmith, but he sometimes comes across as a bit too stingy. Some campaign missions reward the player for the achievement achieved with large sums of money, but it is almost apitfall: better to be thrifty and tactical than to fight long skirmishes on the Elyos map for a handful of pennies. Variety of gameplays Fire Emblem Engage, land unit movement is limited in the snow The Somniel is one of the half-successful aspects of Fire Emblem Engage, probably designed to establish continuity with the previous title of the series for Nintendo Switch: the idea of a headquarters that can be explored in the third person is engaging and accentuates the RPG dynamics with the possibility to interact directly with our companions and to undertake various mini-games, from the usual fishing to training, passing through a sort of shooter on the back of a wyvern, but it is clear that the absence of the Persona-style component of Three Houses has influenced the realization of the new hub. In all honesty, we didn't miss that part of the gameplay - in Three Houses it tended to weigh down the experience between missions - but the Somniel, at the same time, suffers from a certain redundancy and many features, such as the Arena or the Hall of Emblems, force the player to a repetitive series of actions interspersed with not exactly very short loads. Fire Emblem Engage, Emblems grant various skills that can be learned later There is therefore a strong discrepancy between this RPG component, which seems forced into the structure of the game, and the raw gameplay on the battlefield. Once you enter the order of ideas, however, the weight of the Somniel is felt much less and the rounds become almost automatic, also because one is too focused on the construction of the characters, which is not limited to the canonical system of classes and promotions, given that in the pile there are also Emblems. Each character can wear each ring, and each ring confers a certain number of skills, which, moreover, double once the Appendices, i.e. the specific side missions, are completed. So we have twelve Emblems, plus extra ones such as the already announced DLCs, and twenty Bond levels for each Emblem, to be multiplied by about thirty characters who can potentially learn every single skill, then it's up to the player to decide which one to equip in the limited individual slots. The synergies, as you can imagine, are innumerable, and the right combination of passives, emblems and minor rings can result in a plethora of different formations. Fire Emblem Engage, Emblem Corrin's Torrential Roar decreases Dodge in a row of tiles The game, however, is smart and doesn't make all the Emblems available to Alear in the first hours of the campaign. The story gives them and takes them away repeatedly, and for this are the minor rings that are extrapolated randomly from the gacha-style Emblems: they make up for the lack of Emblems when you have fewer than the number of units you can deploy in battle. The progression is balanced and for a certain period of time you only have certain Emblems. This change imposes new approaches and a reversal of established habits: we go from breaking through enemies with blows from Marth and Ike, to thinking more tactically with less linear Emblems, such as those of Byleth and Erika. It is a truly ingenious system, which also rewards the rotation of the rings between the characters, so that everyone learns everything for the simple sake of varying strategies. Of course, on Insane difficulty it would probably be suicidal to entrust Ike's ring to a featherweight like the little orderly Clanne, but the combination is possible and who knows if someone doesn't like the image of a brat smashing enemies with a hammer. You may discover a world of possibilities in the Trials Tower, an online mode that allows you to team up with other players in the Relay or challenge their favorite formations in the Other Time Trials, as well as take on single player challenges called Tempest Trials. Fire Emblem Engage, the combinations between characters and Emblems are many This, however, makes us think about the variety of combinations not only in gameplay, but also in aesthetics. Characters can merge for a certain number of turns with the spirits of the Emblems, and in doing so they not only acquire new abilities, but also a new, more ethereal look. While each Emblem has a specific Union costume that doesn't change all that much from character to character, the artists at Intelligent Systems basically drew every possible combination of the 3D models, which is an impressive job in itself. Fire Emblem Engage, graphically, is a real gem and there's not much to add. Not only in the 3D modeling, which is accurate and detailed, but also and above all in the animations, which are fluid", "date": "2023-01-17", "grade": "8.5"}
