{"name": "Il Chaos di Gollop", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/161648-chaos-reborn-il-chaos-di-gollop.html", "text": "Julian Gollop is best remembered as the father of the XCOM series. Not the modern one by Firaxis, which in any case recognized it as the right authorship by dedicating to it one of the infrastructures that can be built on the base (the Gollop Chamber), but the classic one released in the 90s, which received and still receives so much acclaim, and which you would do well to play, even if only for personal culture. However, his career is much longer and more articulated: it begins in the 80s with productions for 8-bit systems (especially for the ZX Spectrum) which show his love for literary genres such as science fiction and fantasy. In fact, the first XCOM was not born from nothing, but from a path that we can start from Nebula (1984), pass through the three Rebelstars (1984, 1986, 1988) and reach the beautiful Laser Squad (1988), before the final goal. In those same years the turn-based strategy series Chaos was born, the first chapter of which dates back to 1985 (Chaos: The Battle of Wizards) and was based on a system of rules designed by Gollop himself in 1982 for a card game. It had a simple but very innovative concept for the times: two to eight wizards had to confront each other with spells in an area destroying each other. The beauty is that at the beginning of each game they didn't know which spells they would get and therefore had to adapt their strategy from time to time to those that chance had chosen for them. The same concept was taken up by the sequel, Lords of Chaos (1990), in which, however, the game system was adapted to a more single-player oriented experience. Since then Gollop has abandoned fantasy and, apart from the experience of the excellent and underrated Magic and Mayhem (1998), a real-time strategy always focused on clashes between wizards, he has dedicated himself to something else. To see him again working on the genre he helped define, turn-based strategy, we had to wait until 2014, when he launched the Chaos Reborn Kickstarter campaign, with which he narrowly exceeded the headline goal set at $180,000 . Luckily Gollop is no newbie and was able to push the development forward. Chaos Reborn finally came out in October 2015, unfortunately missing a large chunk of content, i.e. the entire single player campaign. Don't worry, because it's a story with a happy ending, given that it was added later with a substantial update (numbered 1.3), which among other things finally convinced us to review it. We have reviewed the new turn-based strategy by Julian Gollop, the excellent Chaos Reborn game system The long introduction we made is not just academic, because it describes a good part of what Chaos Reborn is: the very refined third chapter of a series that has firm roots in a great past, the son of a developer who knows the genre like few others . For just over two months, players were able to evaluate it only online, verifying the excellent balance of mechanics that for some might appear brand new, not having recent epigones with which to compare them. Others may even despise them because of the hardships they impose. In fact, Chaos Reborn is also an alien in the world of fantasy turn-based strategy, since it offers a very different approach than the competition. As already mentioned, its formula involves wizards who battle with magic. The spells that are assigned to them at the start of the game in the form of cards are largely random, even if some can be forced by mounting special talismans on the equipment (on the robe or on the stick). Magical effects are of four types, albeit with different variations: summoning creatures of increasing power, direct damage, enhancement of the magician or obstruction. The first and second types are self-explanatory, we will talk about the third in the next paragraph, while the fourth requires some more explanation, because it allows you to place passive defenses on the map, such as, for example, barriers against ranged attacks, they can be used to attack troops that get too close, slime that imprisons enemies, and so on. Each card has a success rate tied to its alignment, which can be chaotic, lawful, or neutral. The more spells of one alignment you cast, the easier it becomes to cast others of the same family, while simultaneously making those of the opposite alignment more difficult to cast. Only neutral spells are unaffected by the flow of battle, always maintaining the same success rate. Fight today There are several variants of the described system. For example when you summon a creature you can choose to castan illusory spell to be sure of making it. The counterpart, however, is the possibility for the opposing mage to destroy it immediately with a counter spell (as a counterweight he has to risk a turn to do so). Or you can simplify the casting of the spell by spending mana, which can be accumulated by capturing springs, burning or failing a spell. Mana also has other uses: allowing the use of some talismans and the casting of more powerful spells related to mage staves. The fights in Chaos Reborn are very different from those of the more recent turn-based strategy games. Meanwhile, there are no energy bars or other escape routes: one shot and you die. Obviously it's not that simple: each unit has attack and defense values that make them more or less difficult to eliminate. For example, a rat will have a low success rate facing a hydra, while a giant will be able to crush anyone with some ease. The variables are also others: movement speed, possibility of attacking from a distance, type of unit and so on. The mage is not too different from the other units, but has more options on his side, such as the possibility of equipping himself differently according to the style of play that one wants to employ (more aggressive, more defensive, more linked to the use of spells) and to cast spells at you to increase your attack, defense, and speed. Single or multi? The system described above creates interesting dynamics, both in single player and in multiplayer. The single player mode includes two options: the dynamic campaign in which you have to advance in various worlds to fight against the wizards led by the CPU, visit places to look for alliances or resources, liberate cities and so on; all following a plot made of intrigue and ancient secrets. It takes about eight to ten hours to complete. To this must be added the time needed to complete the tutorial and its challenges, which are more demanding than one might think. The tutorial is divided into seven chapters that gradually introduce the game mechanics. Each chapter also features two additional challenges that can be tackled after beating the main mission. The advice is not to take it lightly because you die, and often too. Yes, the explanations are given (and they are also clear), but then you have to apply the concepts in real fights, without any discounts. In short, in its own way it is an excellent pastime, different from the tutorials we are used to. Finally there is the more demanding mode, namely the multiplayer one, in which you have to face human players (up to a maximum of four) in clashes that are very similar to real chess games. The asynchronous multiplayer is excellent, which allows you to play deferred with your opponents so that you can carry on the various matches even at different times. While in single player the difficulty is dictated by factors such as the level of the mage and the troops at his disposal, in multiplayer only the skill of the player and that bit of luck necessary to cast the spells counts. Of course, it takes a bit of effort, but the results are not long in coming and you soon find yourself embroiled in this little jewel, which can only make us renew our trust in Gollop, capable after so many years of proposing turn-based strategies original and beautifully made.", "date": "2016-01-08", "grade": "9.0"}
