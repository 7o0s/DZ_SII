Considering that the discipline of the rodeo in our parts is almost unknown, the decision to bring a title like 8 To Glory to the European market, clearly aimed at an overseas audience, certainly raises some doubts. It is no coincidence that the production relies on the official license of the PBR (Professional Bull Rider), the professional league that brings the best talents in the sector to perform in a sort of traveling circus in the four corners of the United States. The official game of the Professional Bull Riders In 8 To Glory you can take on the role of forty bullfighters, mainly of US or Brazilian nationality. The exceptions come from neighboring countries such as Mexico and Canada, or from Australia. A list of perfect strangers, which obviously does not constitute an added value at all in the eyes of the European player who is generally unaware of the matter. The list of competitors is joined by thirty of the deadliest competition bulls currently available in the league, in addition to the presence of the official commentators of the competition. In short, not really stuff to pull your hair out. On the other hand, one of the first problems that catches the eye, approaching 8 To Glory, is the presence of a game structure that is truly reduced to the minimum terms from almost every point of view; so lacking in attractiveness that it seems really uninspiring even for those who really follow and appreciate rodeos. Alongside the individual arcade matches, in which all you have to do is select a bullfighter and an arena in which to take part in the brawl, there are only two alternatives available. By accessing the twenty-fifth PBR Premier Series it is possible to participate in all twenty-seven events available in the seasonal calendar, with the aim of qualifying for the PBR World Finals in Las Vegas. The head-to-head mode, on the other hand, requires one player to take on the role of bullfighter, while the other user will have to control the bull to try and unseat his opponent in the shortest possible time. Zero ideas and laughable gameplay The lack of ideas that afflicts 8 To Glory is aggravated by analyzing the structure of the gameplay, clearly superficial and completely inadequate compared to the standards of the current market. For heaven's sake, perhaps the official license of the PBR will also have served to stimulate the purchase by the American public passionate about the discipline, but we are of the opinion that it would have been decidedly more forward-looking to invest the money on the implementation of some alternative ideas and a little ' more sensible. Just to give a few examples, alongside the league dedicated to rodeos with bulls it would have been a good idea to try to offer other similar disciplines such as ~Bareback Riding~ or ~Saddle Bronc Riding~ with horses. The presence of the so-called ~Rope~ would not have spoiled either, the competition which involves capturing a bull using a lasso. Although it is a sector of little attractiveness in the eyes of the local user, greater freedom of choice would certainly have helped to make the game less boring than it turned out to be during our test. On the contrary, 8 To Glory maintains a one-way approach, making use of an unconvincing game system even for the most diehard fans of the subject. On the other hand, each game is reduced to two simple phases, both characterized by minimal interaction. First it is necessary to improve the bullfighter's grip. To do this, you have to press the same button three times in the correct area of the bar that appears on the screen, receiving a variable rating from Good to Excellent. At this point you really enter the field and you have to try to stay on the saddle of the beast for the eight seconds set by the regulation. Also in this second phase the interaction is really reduced to a flicker, being simply required to move the left stick of the pad to the right or to the left, together with the pressure of a button that allows you to keep your posture, represented by the appropriate bar located in the top of the screen. In the final portion of the sequence, a combination of keys is activated, the speed of which varies in relation to the strength and wickedness of the animal being ridden. Once the test is finished, you receive a score and are placed in the general classification, waiting for the next heat. This simple gameplay will just repeat itself over and over and over again, with no variation on the theme. Logically this lack of content reverberates onlongevity of the game, evidently afflicted by a worrying lack of content. Furthermore, we also found the choice of introducing a series of card packs to be unlocked with the money accumulated during the games questionable: another idea thrown into the pile without any construct, which allows you to activate cosmetic items and rider enhancement cards, but which most probably no one will be encouraged to use because already after the first hour of play the stimuli disappear.", "date": "2018-11-05", "grade": "5.0"}
