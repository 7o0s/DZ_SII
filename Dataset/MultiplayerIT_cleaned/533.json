{"name": "Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midnight-club-3-dub-edition-remix.html", "text": "Gentlemen, start your engines Those who have already tried Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition will be faced with a familiar scenario, as the structure and modes present in the game have not been changed for this Remix. Apart from the added vehicles, in fact, the only novelty consists in the possibility of trying a second career mode within Tokyo alone. For those who are not familiar with the third episode of the Rockstar course series, however, it is better to do a quick overview: after the usual animated introduction, which effectively performs the task of illustrating what are the main themes of this production, DUB Edition Remix lets you choose between a quick arcade challenge, the ~normal~ career mode and the one on the streets of Tokyo. If there is little to talk about in the arcade section, the career aspect is different, the real fulcrum of this production: you start with a ~makeshift~ car and little money, and go around three major cities ( San Diego, Detroit, Atlanta) looking for opponents to challenge. By pressing the Select key it is possible to display a map and possibly set objectives as goals to be achieved, destinations which will then be displayed on the screen even in the distance thanks to colored ~pillars of smoke~ and arrows. Meeting an opponent means challenging him in a variable number of races, with sums of money up for grabs and often the obligation to finish first in order to proceed. The more races you win, the more they appear on the horizon, in the form of free or exclusive trophies (whose participants must necessarily own a certain type of vehicle). Midnight Club 3 will see you drive cars on two and four wheels alike, starting from sedans to get to SUVs. The art of tuning With the money earned on the street (not in the sense of prostitution...) you can go to your trusted workshop to buy a new vehicle, upgrade the one in use and possibly customize it in many ways. Note the use of the term ~vehicle~ instead of ~car~: Midnight Club 3 will see you drive two-wheeled and four-wheeled cars alike, starting with sedans and going all the way up to SUVs. As you progress through the game, you gain access to more cars and bikes, as well as gaining new upgrade levels and new customizations. In this regard, tuning within the Rockstar title plays a truly fundamental role: beyond the various choices that can be made when upgrading (even ~automatic~, if you don't want to act on each part separately), we will have the ability to fit bigger rims and wider wheels, lower the suspension, add spoilers, change the color of the vehicle and add neon or trim, all based on a practically infinite catalog of makes and models. In this sense, exactly as happens in the Gran Turismo series, usually the cars that don't interest us are sold and with the proceeds we upgrade our favorite vehicle. Also mounting a nice pair of hairy dice, in addition to neon lights and a huge spoiler ... Practically Like a good arcade racing game, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix makes use of behavioral models that refer to spectacularity rather than realism: your car will have some difficulty in steering beyond two hundred kilometers per hour, but you will do it even at the cost of make some ~banks~ between guardrails and buildings; just as the frontal impact with a car of the omnipresent traffic (despite the late hour in which the competitions take place ...) will not lead to an end to the race but simply a slowdown. From this point of view, the use of the automatic gearbox as the default option appears more than natural, even if it is possible to customize the controls to your liking. The races are mostly races to checkpoints, where you therefore have to pass certain places to continue, but you are not forced to follow a predetermined route. Visual indications allow us to orient ourselves in the best way, even if it is often necessary to be familiar with the roads in order not to take the wrong route: in that case it becomes very difficult to get back on track. Following your opponents closely will charge the nitro bar, which can then be activated only for a few moments: the resulting boost will help you decisively and above all in the short distance, but you must take into account the area in which you decide to ~launch~. The reproduction of the real streets of San Diego, Detroit, Atlanta and Tokyo looks meticulous and quite detailed, and the game's frame rate is stable. Too bad for the poor definition of the objects and cars, which make the title qualitatively similar to its direct competitors (Need for Speed and Burnout) but completely inadequate in comparisonwith Gran Turismo. Furthermore, the fact of always competing at night has the demerit of making the settings often similar, especially as regards the shades of color used. The sound sector, exactly as one would expect from such a production, boasts a large number of ~underground~ songs that frame the races and which can be selected at will like radio stations. All this is accompanied by a series of effects without infamy and without praise, functional to the needs of the game. Cross-platform The Midnight Club 3 Remix is available for PS2 and Xbox. As often happens, on the Microsoft console the game runs a little better both in terms of the solidity of the graphics engine and the definition of the textures. But the differences end there. Comment If you already own Midnight Club 3, buying the Remix version probably isn't high on your priority list; nor, honestly, should it be. It's a different matter if you like the series but you stopped at the first or second episode: in this case DUB Edition Remix turns out to be a full-bodied, fun and carefree title. Technically it doesn't make a miracle cry and doesn't present any novelty in the panorama of arcade racing games, but it does its job well: to represent a series of night races between traffic, police and buildings in the most spectacular way possible. Pros: Certainly hectic and spectacular. The two Career modes guarantee a certain duration. Numerous vehicles and wide customization possibilities. Cons: Technically not excellent. Very few differences from Midnight Club 3. A fourth episode was expected. There are various ways to do the same thing. You can write a review starting from a synthetic judgment of the game and then slowly describe its characteristics, or you can proceed step by step, starting with an introduction (which sometimes aims to be more than it really is) to get to describing the structurally and technically produced. Various ways to do the same thing, it was said. Commission the creation of a racing game from Polyphony and Rockstar: in the first case, you'll have a rigorous and technically exceptional simulation, in the second case, a spectacular arcade but totally out of touch with reality. It is clear that the video game industry needs both interpretations, and this explains the success of the Midnight Club series (as well as Need for Speed rather than Burnout), now in its third episode and finally this ~Remix~, which adds new vehicles (twenty-four) and a new location: Tokyo.", "date": "2006-04-20", "grade": null}
