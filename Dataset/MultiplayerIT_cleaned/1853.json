{"name": "Toca Race Driver", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/toca-race-driver_a.html", "text": "Genius at play In clear detachment from traditional Racing games, Toca offers us the unusual formula of a story mode in which we find ourselves taking the part of a ~son of art~: Ryan Mc Kane, a young rookie in the world of engines, with the great ambition to make his way despite the heavy legacy left by his famous father, who died on the track. As easily predictable, the road ahead is long and arduous for our Jaques Villneuve in the Gran Turismo version, who even has to face the pitfalls of a pilot brother already established on the circuit. Overcoming the initial skepticism of insiders won't be a difficult task for almost anyone: just pass a rather ridiculous audition to win a contract and enter directly into the main circuit. At this point it's time to manage one's career: from a modest office one views the job offers, which at first will be decidedly undemanding, up to the most renowned competitions, between the Alfa GTV championships and various other single-make complete with beautiful women and champagne. If there is one thing that therefore cannot be objected to Codemasters, in addition to the longevity of the title, definitely on excellent levels as evidenced by the 38 circuits present and the multitude of competitions to be faced in the story mode, flanked by free single and multiplayer modes , it is precisely the effort made to make it different from the ~clones~ stationed on the shelves. The decision to introduce a story mode, which develops through cut scenes created with the game's graphics engine staged before the races, not to mention revolutions, at least rejuvenates a structure that seems to have been planted on the same tracks for far too long. What instead leaves the aficionado dumbfounded is the setting of the gameplay. In fact, by definition Toca was a racing game with obvious simulation ambitions, which translated into a rather high difficulty in controlling the vehicle due to algorithms for managing the physical laws that were decidedly accurate in relation to the capabilities of the now obsolete Psone. This combined with the implementation of damage to the bodywork and mechanical parts and the large number of cars in the race fundamentally distinguished Toca from the arcade-simulation hegemon Gran Turismo. Things in Toca Race Driver have definitely changed. In fact, we have opted for a driving style that we could define as ~arcade-simplistic~, which is not even a distant relative of what many had loved in the Psone episodes. In fact, although the damage to the cars, excellently implemented, has actually remained, there are many question marks that arise in the analysis of the gameplay of the latest Codemasters product. Peculiarities such as a probable sensation of the ~weight~ of the car, or simply something that makes us understand that it is not possible to set the corners to one's liking (ergo: in an ~imaginative~ way) without palpable disadvantages, have been abandoned. So no drifting when you ~detached~ too late, no spinning if you exaggerated with the accelerator when coming out of a bend, no risk of jumping on too high a curb. It is a setting that marries very little with the career mode, which in our opinion would require a driving experience that can at least recall the real one. And instead we find ourselves handling cars that almost seem to wink at the classic driving feeling of two-dimensional games. Without wanting to consider Toca Race Driver a tribute to the legendary Outrun, Chasehq and the like, there are strong perplexities regarding this unfortunate choice, perhaps adopted in the hope of making the title attractive even for a casual and less savvy user group. However, it should be emphasized that the artificial intelligence of the opponents is decidedly well made, so much so that their behavior on the track appears almost plausible. Finally, seeing us in the mirrors, someone will try to block the best line for us. Too bad, however, that the ~ideal trajectories~ in this Toca Race Driver have a decidedly relative meaning... graphics As already mentioned, Codemasters had released many screenshots in the months preceding the launch of Toca Race Driver that hinted at a graphic cleanliness and texture quality never seen on our Ps2. But once the DVD of our limited edition has been inserted into the tray, it is very easy to understand that those shots did not reflect the quality of the final product, but rather that they were most likely artworks that had nothing to do with the Toca Race Driver graphics engine. Do. Without fear of contradiction it can in fact be said to beere faced with one of the worst performances of Playstation2, with all due respect to those who thought they were in the presence of a prodigy. With the exception of the vehicles, which are discreetly modeled, without however reaching the glories already found in Gran Tursimo 3 A-spec and in the related add-ons, the cosmetics of the title oscillates between the obscene and the ridiculous. The polygonal complexity of the scenarios, poor in detail and outline structures such as grandstands, palaces, is significantly below the 128-bit standards; the textures are not very varied, washed out and all in low resolution. By virtue of this, one would at least expect a solid frame rate, and instead, incredulous, we witness tragic collapses in the most crowded phases, which throw the player into a condition of absolute despair. To make everything even worse there is a very annoying bad clipping (for the less experienced: sudden appearance of polygonal structures), which, combined with the slight flickering of the image on the screen, gives us the decisive push to categorize Toca Race Driver as ~horrible visu. The sound sector is on a completely different level, which pays attention to the substance and faithfully reproduces the roar of the engines, which do not make the lack of background music felt. A further shortcoming should be reported: the title, despite being produced and developed in Europe, does not have speech and subtitles translated into Italian. Comment Toca Race Driver is a big disappointment, without a shadow of a doubt. The good ideas concerning the career mode and the satisfying artificial intelligence of the opponents are seriously overshadowed by a simplistic gameplay, which nips them in the bud. It is precisely the setting of the gameplay that is the link that undermines the underlying harmony of the title, and which prevents a direct correspondence with the simulation ambitions demonstrated in the conception of the main game mode. It's a pity, because Toca Race Driver could have been, as in the Psone era, the no. 1 alternative to the classic Gran Turismo. Further disappointing is the technical realization which, with the exception of damage to the cars and sound, is seriously inadequate. Pros +Interesting career mode +Car damage +Refined AI Cons -Simplistic gameplay -Totally underwhelming technically -Uninspiring story mode Second Opinion - Comment by: Massimiliano ~Samp~ Pavan Ok, the game isn't excellent, the physics are very rough, but the new Codemaster title has some merits, artificial intelligence first of all. The driving model is scandalous at times, really too 80s arcade, when going off the track was not a sin. Precisely for this reason, fans of the series will be disappointed, while on the contrary, those looking for immediate racing will be satisfied. Codemaster could have done better calling his latest effort 'Pro Race Driver' (that's the name of the game in the US), doing so would have spared the wrath of his loyalists. The detachment with the previous chapters is really very marked and if the story mode immediately constitutes a basis for this thesis, once on track the fears become certainties. Too bad for the graphic design, from a first generation title. Despite all these negative sides, I do not advise against the purchase of the product: for non-purists, Toca remains an enjoyable, simple and long-lasting experience. For all the others... well, it will be for the next episode... The umpteenth sequel of a noble lineage of the PsOne era arrives on PlayStation 2: it is the turn of Toca, considered by many not too long ago the Anti Gran Turismo par excellence. Appreciated by purists precisely for the simulative vein that distinguished it, it was made to wait spasmodically by virtue of the impressive amount of high-resolution screenshots released by Codemasters, which had caused in most people the well-known pathology of ~drooping jaw in the presence of an amazing image  which with the spread of the internet in homes is becoming more and more a common evil. It doesn't matter if many negative past experiences (read: screens at improbable resolutions don't correspond to the true television ontological) still burn for someone; it doesn't matter if the show of bumpmapping in every corner of the asphalt, which on the Sony machine historically figures among the absent ones, should have at least aroused suspicion; it matters even less if everything was devoid of the slightest lineup: the mass is dreamy and conditioned, and Toca was officially elected the 2nd next-generation graphic prodigy in the field of racing games. And then, accompanied by several kilograms of Hype, here is the title, solemn, capitulates in our Playstation2 European, and it turns out to be a dazzling surprise. In the negative, indeed.", "date": "2002-12-27", "grade": null}
