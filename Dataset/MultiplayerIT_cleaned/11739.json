{"name": "Tony Hawk's: Proving Ground - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-proving-ground-recensione_a.html", "text": "If from this year the world of home consoles has two brands that challenge each other with grind and tailbone shots, the Nintendo Ds 'skate' universe gravitates solely and exclusively around the emperor Tony Hawk. Vicarious Visions, by now the historic developer of the game, has a peculiarity: it manages to amaze the player with bizarre and well-chosen gameplay choices, which often - graphic elements aside - are far better than those of Neversoft (developer of Tony Hawk for living room consoles), and who have the precise task of trying to give a general refresh to a series that between one thing and another is approaching 10 years of life. Tony Hawk's Proving Ground is the title of the new game dedicated to the most famous skater in the world and as the title suggests it is the 'proving ground', the 'testing ground' for this series that seems to have reached a crossroads: decline or evolution. (not) being Tony The first thing that catches your eye starting the game is the change of direction made by the Vicarious in graphic terms: characters and settings are no longer proposed with the abused toon shading, but rather with a decidedly more realistic and close look (put how many quotes you want to the word 'close') to major versions. A lot of time has passed since the last Tony Hawk developed for Ds (Downhill Jam, a sort of racing-style spin-off), time that the developers have spent making several games for Activision on Nintendo Ds (Transformers is probably the most significant), reaching a remarkable level of 3D graphics rendering on the Nintendo laptop. However, the most important element is not represented by the new graphics, but by a complex game structure that leaves the player with total freedom to customize his own experience. By selecting the queen mode of each Tony Hawk, the story, the player creates his own virtual nemesis, initially choosing only gender and complexion, and is catapulted into the skatepark around which a substantial part of the game gravitates. In this place he meets Mr. Hawk who invites him for a short panoramic tour of the area and introduces him to what are two of the most important new features of Proving Groud: the edit mode and the Career/Hardcore dualism. The first of the two elements, the edit mode, actually represents the first level of customization of the game: there are different game sections to modify, you go from the simple purchase of new pieces and sections for the skatepark (editing it at will with new ramps , rails and obstacles so dear to skaters), passing through the total customization of the board and the logo, to the definition of the appearance of one's skater up to the obsessive creation of sound effects to be associated with particular moments of the game. The possibilities offered by the skatepark edit are almost infinite, allowing the player to create a unique work that is completely adapted to his own tastes and ambitions as a skater: are you a rail lover? No problem, just buy sections suitable for grinding and fill the skatepark with them, do you prefer ramps and pipes instead? also in this case no problem, every corner of the skatepark adapts to every need. The aforementioned career/hardcore refers to the second substantial novelty of Tony Hawk Proving Grounds: in fact, during the game you will get to know many skaters who are part of the macro-categories of career skaters (those who live on sponsors' money, who participate at competitions and all that) and hardcore skaters (the ones more open to new moves, decidedly crazier and ready to do anything to pull off the trick they have in mind). Both categories of skaters give the player a series of missions to complete, useful for unlocking new accessories, clothes, boards, skatepark areas and above all tricks. Depending on whether the mission comes from the career or hardcore side, the objectives and goals of passing the test are strongly related to the style of the skater who offers it to the player. This system, combined with a clearly visible bar at the top of the screen, is useful for yet another level of customization of the gaming experience; in fact, what the Vicarious Visions implicitly ask the player is to take sides on one side or the other, to customize their skate style on what you think is the most appropriate side, to get to the end of the game to have understood perfectly every technique and every trick of the chosen side. In addition to the story mode, one of the most successful modes is undoubtedly the one linked to online multiplayer; the Tony Hawk series on Ds -already with the first American Sk8land- had established itself as the first third party game to have its own sonline action, and after the racing experience of Downhill Jam, is presented at its best with challenges for 4 players and the now famous voice chat that uses recorded messages and then replayed online to all game participants. Overlooking small graphic defects and a not very inspired soundtrack, the real flaw of Tony Hawk Proving Grounds is that in fact it remains the classic Tony Hawk game. The same one that has been played for years now, with the same lessons, the same missions and tests repeated endlessly now. And although the inclusion of editable elements brings a breath of fresh air, it is clear how much more is now needed by Falco to return to being the success of the public and critics for which it has been for so many years. Comment The incontrovertible truth is that this Proving Ground was born from the union of the experience of the previous two chapters for DS: Downhill Jam and American Sk8land, taking the frenzy and speed of the first and mixing it with what is the classic game system of Tony Hawk of the second. However, the evaluation of the game is all the result of the complete editability of the gaming experience: skate style, appearance, skatepark, music and sound effects, it is as if Vicarious Visions had decided to give the player the game development kit and let that he found the combination closest to his tastes. However, defects and problems still remain, and - even more serious - are reiterated chapter after chapter. Pros It's Tony Hawk Fully editable Definitely long-lived Cons It's Tony Hawk Graphically not great Some tests are absolutely frustrating and complex", "date": "2007-12-13", "grade": null}
