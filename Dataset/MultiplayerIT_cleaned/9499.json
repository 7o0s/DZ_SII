If we made an ideal call, we would find that the answer would be online shooters with classes along the lines of Team Fortress 2, from which it also heavily copies the graphic style, tower defense, cooperative games like Left4Dead and third-person shooters like Gears of War. Have we forgotten something or someone? Released last summer on consoles, it arrives today in the PC version, to please all lovers of multiplayer orgies. In the near future, football will no longer exist, tennis will be just the memory of some jock lost in an eternal nostalgic sigh, golf will be canceled from the dictionary and American football will be declassified among the activities of boarders, practiced only in the oratories . All sports will be replaced by Monday Night Combat, where two teams of heavily armed soldiers will have to shoot each other with a rich arsenal of weapons, trying to accumulate as much money as possible... literally. Each fight will take place in an arena with the so-called ~Soldisphere~ in the middle, an object to be defended with tooth and nail where the collected cash will be accumulated (basically a piggy bank). Mode The game has two main modes: Blitz, where you will have to defend the sphere from the assaults of continuous waves of enemy robots together with up to four friends; and Crossfire, where two teams will have to try to destroy their opponents' Soldisphere, while committing to defend their own. This is where the diversification of skills comes into play, with the various classes being more or less suited to play particular roles in the economy of each encounter. The player will be able to choose whether to be a stormtrooper, the base class, a tank (practically the bulk of TF2), and then a sniper, a support unit, a gunner or an assassin. Each class, in addition to having three special abilities and a primary and secondary fire, differs in characteristics such as speed, resistance, jump range, jetpack duration, camouflage and so on. Unlike in other games, it is possible to enhance these skills directly during the game, by pressing a button and buying bonuses by spending the accumulated money. The money can also be spent to buy four types of turrets, which in turn can be upgraded twice, to be placed in fixed points on the map, to better defend the Soldisphere from the assaults of enemy robots. Hey, single player is there too! Optionally, there is also a single player mode that requires you to fight waves of robots like in Blitz mode, but completely alone. We report it to you for a matter of mere completeness, but don't count on it too much to value the purchase. It is an addition made just to entice some misanthrope to spend his money on the game, but overall it is superfluous and runs out after a couple of hours. PCs, PCs! Technically the PC version does not differ much from the console version. There are more configuration options and the overall look is cleaner, but essentially we are faced with the exact same job. As you may have already noticed by looking at the images, the character design is identical to that of Team Fortress 2. So identical that anyone who bought the Uber Entertainment game on Steam before the beginning of February received special items for the title from Valve as a gift. Different there is only a sci-fi vein and the developers have seen fit to scatter lap dance girls here and there to sway their butts in favor of the screen. From the point of view of managing online clashes, Monday Night Combat exploits the potential of a PC quite well, inserting all those features that are now considered indispensable in a title designed for online.", "date": "2011-01-31", "grade": "7.5"}
