{"name": "Secret Oops!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/secret-oops-la-recensione.html", "text": "With the review of Secret Oops! let's talk about the new work of MixedBag, an all-Italian team that has already authored titles of the caliber of Forma.8 and Futuridium, making its debut with its own product on Apple Arcade. For this debut, the Italian studio has not skimped on originality, inventing a puzzle game oriented towards local multiplayer that takes advantage of an interesting technology such as augmented reality in a convinced way. So let's find out what it is. Better accompanied than alone Protagonist of Secret Oops! is Charles, a spy who would like to be a new Ethan Hunt but who is actually more akin to Johnny English as he is incompetent and clumsy. Such is the foolishness of our ~hero~ that it is up to the player to do the work for him, paving the way towards the goal of each stage, represented by a briefcase which presumably contains very important secret documents. To do this, it is necessary to deactivate the traps that dot the paths of the various levels before the unfortunate Charles activates them by ending up on them: the bearded secret agent in fact proceeds autonomously with a staid gait, and the user instead of controlling him must keep his finger pressed on the area of the touchscreen corresponding to the contraption that must be turned off (or to the switch that controls it) just enough to let Charles cross it unharmed. If everything seems very simple, it is because in fact Secret Oops! it really is simple, and for a very specific choice: the game is in fact a party game for the whole family, an authentic virtual board game that effectively relies on augmented reality to convey this feeling. Although it is also playable as a traditional mobile game, the MixedBag title absolutely gives its best when used in this way: by selecting the appropriate item from the main menu, the software uses the device's camera to quickly map the surrounding area (it is obviously advisable to have an unobstructed space) and place the playing field on a real surface, allowing the user to physically move around to view the stage from all angles. This is not a mere aesthetic gimmick, given that Secret Oops! it actually plays better in AR and is thus more fun especially in multiplayer: thanks to the excellent work done by MixedBag with this technology, but to be honest also a consequence of the fact that the classic mode of use has a few too many problems. In fact, only two shots can be selected, the first very distant which makes everything really excessively small and the second from above which vice versa is so narrow as to not always allow the player to take the necessary countermeasures in time to keep Charles going; camera management is also cumbersome, entrusted to swipes that rotate the view by 90 on the horizontal axis when perhaps it would have been better to have more direct and immediate control. In short, Secret Oops! it is not the usual game with an augmented reality mode good only as a technological quirk, but a title developed with this aspect in mind and which can only be fully enjoyed in AR, perhaps in the company of three other friends. The local multiplayer component is in fact the flagship of the MixedBag production, with the levels increasing in complexity and the participants who must actively collaborate to be able to reach the finish line, possibly also collecting the bonuses scattered along the way to get the maximum score. While remaining a title characterized by a rather low coefficient of challenge even in this area (forget unnerving Overcooked-style collaborations in short), Secret Oops! it works remarkably well, effectively succeeding in its goal of presenting itself as the modern version of a board game. Of course, compared to the classic board games you have to pay the price of an obviously more limited inclusiveness factor (for multiplayer you still need to have two or more people in the same room with an iOS device and an Apple Arcade subscription), but the MixedBag title makes it clear that with the right ideas, augmented reality has considerable potential also from a gaming point of view.", "date": "2020-02-09", "grade": "8.0"}
