Despite the competition and the decline of the Nintendo portable, Yggdra Union won many admirers, while remaining in the niche of semi-unknown games, just like Riviera. And just like Riviera, also Yggdra Union finally sees the light in the form of a port or remake for PSP: retracted the extreme difficulty, improved the audiovisual sector, added a ton of dialogues in two languages - Japanese and English. Now the most elaborate Atlus strategy game has all it takes to remain etched in the players' memory. We'll never fight alone! ~We'll never fight alone~ is a phrase you'll read so often in Yggdra Union, sometimes redundantly. Yet this slogan is the heart of the game, both from a narrative and a playful point of view. Yggdra Yuril Artwaltz is the princess of the kingdom of Fantasinia, which unfortunately one fine day is invaded by the Empire of Bronqia, commanded by the evil Gulcasa. With her family murdered and the castle under siege, Yggdra manages to escape carrying the sacred sword Grand Centurio with her: the meeting with Melanor, leader of a band of thieves at odds with the Bronqia Empire, will be the beginning of the Yggdra's revenge. In fact, our protagonists will begin a journey in search of allies to face the forces of Gulcasa and regain the throne, but they will soon realize that they are involved in something more than a military conflict between human beings... The plot of Yggdra Union is introduced by a long and spectacular animated sequence and unfolds through about forty missions, introduced and concluded by numerous written and excellently acted dialogues, and manages to always keep the player's attention alive by proposing various and unexpected twists. The characters are extremely characterized and not at all trivial, thanks also to the graphic style adopted: the artworks that portray them are cartoonish in an exquisitely Japanese and graceful, almost childish style, generating a surprising contrast with the mature and dramatic themes of the story. The style of the artwork is also reflected in the sprites that battle each other on the PSP screen in moments of conflict: super-deformed as per the Japanese tradition, but colorful and well-animated, against well-detailed backgrounds. We regret the choice not to dedicate a dedicated sprite to all the main characters, given that the pixels of some opponents and allies are the same as the simplest and most anonymous soldiers who make up Yggdra's army. However, compared to the Game Boy Advance version, giant strides have been made, thanks also to the large PSP screen, and even the visual effects of the ~spells~ have been reworked from scratch, now showing themselves in the form of particularly clean light and polygonal effects and finished. The Union is strength Returning to the concept of not fighting alone, it is important to master it or the missions will prove impossible to finish. The mechanics behind Yggdra Union are easier to play than to explain, but undoubtedly require some practice to master properly. In short, the player selects before a mission the characters he wants to send into battle, each one equipped with an item and a quantity of Morale, which essentially represents their life points. The second selection to make concerns a deck of cards: each card corresponds to a special ability or magic that can be used in combat, an attack value and a precise number of steps that units, in general, can take during the turn where the card is played. But be careful, Yggdra Union is not a card-game at all, and that of cards is a rather atypical choice to characterize the game. Essentially, the player during his turn chooses a card and moves his units on the classic grid map, where enemies are also stationed. By placing one of our characters near an opponent, it is possible to start the battle, but as in any self-respecting strategy there are a multitude of factors that must be taken into account before engaging in battle. Weapons, for starters: swords have an advantage over axes, axes over spears, spears over swords, and in this hierarchy fit together as variants magical staffs, crossbows and scythes. Then, the spell or ability linked to the card we have chosen for the turn can be activated, in most cases, if the attacking unit's weapon matches thatlla depicted on the card. It is in fact possible to attack only once per turn, which is why the Unions come into play, the true heart of Yggdra Union's gameplay. Strategy and Tactics The concept is very simple. By positioning the units around the one that wants to attack in a certain way (the scheme depends on its gender) it is possible to chain the assaults in a certain order: obviously it is a strategy that is also operated by the enemy, therefore it becomes absolutely necessary to exploit the Unions to fight as equals, since a Union can also assault a single unit and bring it to the end of its forces. In fact, every time you lose a fight the Morale of the defeated unit will decrease, with consequent removal of the unit from the mission (or Game Over in case of death of Yggdra or Melanor). A victory over the enemy, on the other hand, will make the survivor gain experience points and attack points for the card that was selected for the turn: in practice, the cards increase in power with the characters. The tactic is therefore very important, especially against the bosses and their load of Morale points: in these cases the player would do better to attack the enemy with a full Union, starting the choreographic sequences in which the sprites fight each other on the left and right of the screen. On the upper part, however, there is a bar that can be filled by holding down the right arrow key (also increasing the power of attacks at the expense of defense) or emptied by holding down the left key (vice versa, increasing defense and decreasing offense ). If the bar is completely filled, and the criteria of the chosen card are met, it is possible to trigger the spell or ability of the card itself: from spectacular spells that burn, damage or freeze the enemy (as well as the aquatic surfaces on the map, making them passable) to tactical debuffs that slow, paralyze, and more. It goes without saying that the opponent can also use his cards: the player will therefore do well to take advantage of this interactivity of the clashes at the right time, exploiting it immediately or waiting for the next turn of any Union. Therefore, unlike very similar games such as Fire Emblem or Advance Wars, Yggdra Union's battles are slightly interactive, as well as being very visually pleasing, and in case you are facing simple and repetitive duels, it is even possible to press the backbone R to speed up the action.", "date": "2008-12-04", "grade": "8.0"}
