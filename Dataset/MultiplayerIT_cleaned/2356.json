{"name": "FIFA 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-2002_a.html", "text": "Venticello widens for Monnezza Let's start playing, pre-set friendly: Juve against Roma. The graphic impact is certainly at a high level, each texture is extremely well defined and full of details. The player skins are really well done: it is possible to see muscles in traction, as well as studs and drawings on the boots, unfortunately there is an ambiguous polygonal realization of the faces. Taken by themselves they are of excellent workmanship, but they do not correspond at all to their real counterparts: to draw Davids it is not enough to apply the dredds on a colored skin. Another example could be the good Tommasi: he looks more like Commissioner Nico Giraldi!! Since the title is famous because it is extremely televised and plausible (apparently), a more accurate modeling would certainly have been more appropriate. The animations of the athletes are very good: very fluid and if there weren't various numbers and indicators on the screen, a layman could mistake the game for a real match. The linesmen wave, the referee runs and is always close to the action, while the polygonal players naturally replicate the exact movements of the real ones: they call the pitches, they touch the sore parts, they limp. A month ago TIF 2002 represented the yardstick, now it is certainly Fifa, even if to be honest we must add that more than footballers, our heroes in canvas long johns seem to have the movements of skaters. One has the feeling of slipping in layman's terms. The surrounding elements are also far above average: the public and the stadiums are finally made as they should: even if made with bitmaps, the people live the match, get up and cheer as never seen before. The sound does its duty very well: the background music of the menus is exactly what one would expect from a fashion title like this, while honor to the credit for what concerns the sound effects: in addition to the chants of the fans, it is possible to hear even the players hoarse in the middle of the field. Do the faults of the fathers fall on the children? Clearly, speaking of Fifa, there must necessarily be something negative. Given the criticisms rained down with the passing of the editions to the programmers, the latter, their goodness, have tried to make changes in the game mechanics, cross and delight of the EA title. The main novelty is the new passing system: finally we have a loading bar, and in addition we are given the possibility to throw the ball in any direction we want. Put like this, it might seem that all Fifa's problems have been solved. Instead, things have gotten worse, as the transition from an arcade system to a more ~simulating~ one only complicates things. In addition to regulating the strength, you also need to be careful when leaving the X when the indicator turns green (the bar is divided into three zones that are not equal in length: white = short throw, green means excellent chances that teammate intercepts it, red is equivalent to throwing in the parking lot of the stadium). The positive fact is that the passes are no longer remote controlled, but due to a very bizarre mechanic, the percentage of incorrect throws is very high. In short, the Fifa series does not accept compromises. Unfortunately, the sore points don't end here: the cross is greatly affected by the new mechanics and even after a lot of training, it will be rare to see good crosses in the middle: most of the time they go looking for a non-existent partner outside the box. Going from good to better, we must also add that the reactivity of the players does not reach the state of the art: it is truly gratifying to work seven shirts to throw the ball between the shirts of the surly opposing defense, to then notice that our punteros they stand still in the middle of the field admiring some beauty in the stands. In short, no advances. Then there are other ~little~ things that I didn't like very much: the kilometric dimensions of the sliding tackles remain unchanged, many times the defenders fall asleep in the area, especially on high balls, and in addition you see goalkeepers making rather unhinged interventions, valid on a theatrical level, but certainly not on a football one. That's all. For heaven's sake, it is possible to perform discrete numbers, feint the shot, double and triple steps, but the feeling is that of never having full control of one's actions. As usual, the physics of the ball remains the most bizarre feature of the entire series: the trajectories taken by the ball sometimes seem to have come out of astronomical geography books, plus shots on goal are either exasperatingly slow, or suddenly accelerate suddenly not missing the playersthey pushed the nitro button! Summing up, it is possible to say that there was an effective change of course in Fifa 2002, but certainly not many benefits that it really brought. The simulation aspect has been implemented in a way that is not very intuitive and difficult to learn as well as a source of little gratification: pushing a key at the exact moment is a valid solution in some sports titles, such as golf, or in rhythm games, but which appears completely out of place in a football title. As we know, football games are divided into two categories, the arcade ones and those more devoted to a more realistic approach. Now the title E.A. he tried to mediate between these two souls, with the only result of displeasing both. Anyone who finds any of the previous versions simple, easy to master, captivating will find a product in their hands that betrays a tradition consolidated over the years, which yields to the flattery of His Majesty the Reality. Those who, on the other hand, usually play more demanding and technical titles, can only find Fifa still too shallow and complete. In the end there is very little to add, the title represents a certain desire to lean towards a more accurate and mature game mechanic, a pity that these good intentions have not been accompanied by a positive practical realization. Such a pity. Pros: Great graphics Great sound Cons: Passing system not at all intuitive Players responsiveness Physics of the ball Bob what do you think? After dear Gozzer's exhaustive comment, I will try to be as concise as possible, limiting myself to exposing only my impressions and comments. I just steal a few lines to repeat that it seemed very strange to me that in the pre-presentation, i.e. when the official brands appear, there are the symbols of all the football leagues and only ours is missing... oh well, it's a venial sin, but honestly I don't I understand why, since all the teams from our league appear in the game! Going back to my feelings, I can start by saying that the first impact wasn't the worst, perhaps because I imagined I was facing yet another remake of the series, without the programmers having actually applied the much-vaunted technical improvements during the development phase . I quite liked the players entering the field, even if it is a bit difficult to recognize them because the models do not correspond to reality as it happens in This Is Football 2002 and in ISS. The commentary is entrusted to Bulgarelli and Caputi and, despite the interventions being quite consistent with the actions and quite varied, one hears in their voice a trifle of flatness and apathy, which on the contrary would have greatly helped in identifying with the title, seen which, at first glance, seems to be watching a real game (consider that my mother, passing by, said to me: what a pain, even today the games ....! ) As regards the purely playful aspect, there are some positives and some negatives. For example, the controls have been improved and, although footballers still tend to skate, it feels more like you've mastered them than in past series. We come to the ambiguous note, that of the passages. The introduction of the power bar is excellent, but it would have been better to introduce it only for shots, since it is really difficult to calibrate passes worthy of the name in speed, moreover, the bar takes too long to load and opponents often manage to take you away the ball without much difficulty. Furthermore, it is often frustrating not being able to get the ball where you want it since everything has to be done to the thousandth of a second. I certainly wasn't asking for remote-controlled passages, but that's too much. There is an option that should compensate for this ~unpredictability~, but honestly, once the aid is enabled, not much has changed. It must also be said that by setting the game speed to very fast and the difficulty to expert it is really difficult to play well. With the use of the right analog stick it is now possible to make very nice 1-2 shots, even if they are often intercepted by opponents. What I still don't understand is the method of using the run; it would be appropriate to abandon the repeated pressing of the button, given that being able to combine this movement with the dosage of the cross or the shot or the pass, as well as the stupendous features that allow the player to trigger his partner towards goal or on the wing thanks to the pressing a key, it's really too much, you have to be a contortionist! I have no doubt that once you have mastered this ~chaos~ of combos, the game is much more rewarding, but I don't think so.he fans of the series wanted this. We have gone from the excessive arcade vein to this perplexing hybrid. Going back to crosses, they are also difficult to make, especially if you are pressed by an opponent. The reverse shots are always the same and the introduction of the loading bar was not enough to make them more varied and realistic. The introduction in the options of the choice of the power of the shots in the match is curious, given that in the end it doesn't change much, however the important thing is that you have taken the right path. However, I did not like the bench management method, since there is no screen that makes it clear in which position a player plays; there is only the list but it is not clear, for example, if Rui Costa plays in the centre, on the wing or in attack, you have to go by trial and error, or rather change places, leave and return until you get what you want. Generally improved the intelligence of defenders who do not create scary holes like in the past. In the end the title is fairly playable and varied but with an atypical trend, neither arcade nor too responsive to reality, so I reiterate the concept that surely fans of the series will remain perplexed and fans of more realistic games will not find what other titles are certainly able to offer. Kudos to EA for being able to turn the tide after all these years of creative dullness. Pros: New control system Graphics Cons: New control system Player skating BOC: FIFA 2002 PsOne Punctual as every year, the Fifa series could not fail to land even on the little one from Sony. The game faithfully reproduces all the options and the various contours present in the PS2 title, so I refer you to the article by the legendary Gozzer for any clarifications. Compared to the aforementioned version, however, it has several differences in gameplay, reflecting a more hasty and less careful programming, capable of taking up all the defects of the series. Strangely the game is quite jerky, failing to maintain a constant frame-rate even if you decide to change the game speed; yes, after all it is faster but not more fluid, indeed one has the impression that the fast forward is held down !! This aspect greatly affects the total playability, making the games very irritating and annoying. This aspect improves if you play with a PS2 and with the improvements that the new machine offers enabled, but honestly I wonder who would play this title with the aforementioned machine having the possibility to play with the ~major~ version. Regarding the controls and the passages, as already mentioned before, the game turns out to be closer to the previous release, but this is not really a big deal because at least it is easier to carry out the passages, in fact the use of the loading bar is more intuitive. However, there is always the great flaw that afflicts all Fifa, from 3DO to today, or the possibility of starting from midfield (if not before) and arriving in front of the poor goalkeeper without him being able to do anything about it. Speaking of shots we are faced with the umpteenth ~trips~ that make shots at the net monotonous, leading, despite the introduction of the power bar, to always shoot hard. Goalkeepers are sometimes shutters but other times they get punched too easily. Ultimately this umpteenth incarnation of the Fifa series is an inexplicable step backwards, especially following the good ~experiment~ carried out with the PS2 version. Recommended only to those who have not lost even a copy of the collection. Pros: Officially licensed Improved passages compared to the PS2 version Cons: Snappy Monotonous Always the same Fifa The time has come. Finally the article that Boc and I have been waiting for since March 2001 has arrived: ladies and gentlemen: Fifa 2002 for Ps2. Finally we will be able to dispel (if the case obviously) decisively and with extreme objectivity all those malicious rumors that stormed our poor post office box last spring. As in my worst nightmares (or dreams) doubt and suspicion were revealed behind menacing nicks: are Gozzer and Boc being paid by Electronic Arts? How dare they say plague and horns (but when ever!) of the venerable Winning Eleven 5? But it's better to start, leaving aside episodes that ultimately have little to do with the games. Turning on the console you are hit by a riot of official logos of the various federations and who knows why the Italian one is missing. After an introduction entrusted to the excellent song 19/2000 by Gorillaz as an accompaniment to an intro partially created with the game engine, we arrive at the main menu of the game.
