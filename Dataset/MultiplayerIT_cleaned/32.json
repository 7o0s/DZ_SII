Nothing to do, in times of a few pixels, with particle photorealism, with the physical complexity of steering on rough terrain or with hypersonic speed: simply, a solid design, a few perfectly exploited controls and a sense of reward for good control conquered with exercise. At its release ExciteBike was a title capable of entering the high-end from a technological point of view, with its overall well-animated aesthetic presentation and its sense of fluidity and speed. What made Nintendo's title a hit in theaters with the Arcade Classics and an evergreen long seller on the NES, however, wasn't about fast-growing graphics, it was about pure enjoyment. ExciteBike was a pleasure to play because the control that gave credit to the player's technique, the horizontal view, the slight isometric depth effect and the sensation of speed made it an exhilarating experience. What is it today Many appreciate the aesthetic minimalism of the eight-bit era classics, which is even celebrated in contemporary aesthetics. On the other hand, there are quite a few who might see ExciteBike as something obsolete from a graphic and technological point of view and therefore not worthy of real interest from a playful point of view. In fact, going back to ExciteBike corresponds to a technological leap of several hardware eras, with an immense gap of realism and complexity between that and modern, realistic productions. But this is certainly not the spirit with which to approach ExciteBike, a game designed to amuse with its simplicity and instigate exercise and, therefore, capable of serving the same purpose today as it did yesterday. One button serves to accelerate, and another provides powerful acceleration but with a side effect: engine overheating. There is a critical threshold, therefore, to be respected with the boost, under penalty of a forced stop. You then have to go from key to key trying to optimize top speed as much as possible, avoiding obstacles such as dunes, ditches and patches of sand that slow down the bike and tackling treacherous jumps. The depth of the control system is revealed precisely in this aspect: the jumps require a good dose of technique to optimize the inclination of the bike according to the speed and the terrain on which you land, taking into account other riders who could come between us and the finish line. Few, precise elements for a challenge against time and enemies that is actually all against yourself on the controller. An advantage that is also a limitation: ExiciteBike is a great classic designed entirely for a single player and with no multiplayer mode, even if its rediscovery includes a nice, at the time futuristic, level editor. Nintendo's ExciteBike, on the Wii Virtual Console catalog at the price of 500 Wii Points (five Euros), is an important milestone in the history of videogame racing on two wheels. It is evident how the genre of racing simulation, car or motorcycle, aquatic or futuristic, has undergone a very long evolution from the videogame beginnings of ExciteBike to today, in the wireless and motion-control generation. And while the race discovers the Wii controller, ExciteBike can be an opportunity for rediscovery and pure fun for all players.", "date": "2007-03-14", "grade": null}
