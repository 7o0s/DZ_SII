But if the statement is very true for the main version, the one developed by the team headed by David Rutter, the same cannot always be said for the whole flood of ~minor~ editions, which among other things this year in more than one case were marked by not very pleasant cases of copy-paste from the previous episode. Yet while there are console versions in a decidedly declining phase at the end of their life cycle, as in the case of Nintendo Wii, on the contrary other platforms are going through a real explosion that has forced Electronic Arts to increase efforts and resources. Leading this group are undoubtedly smartphones and tablets, and FIFA 13 is in fact a rather interesting product. Brothers and sisters! To evaluate a title like FIFA 13 in the mobile version, you must first get rid of the experiences on major consoles, and find the right perspective between costs, capabilities and possibilities offered by a smartphone. No one will ever tell you that tackling a football game with a virtual stick and keys can be compared to a good pad; therefore, going down to inevitable compromises, FIFA 13 should simply be able to offer a credible and fun reduction, capable of condensing the fundamental aspects of the franchise in an accessible guise for a few good games to fill the classic 10 free minutes. But framing the perspective of this FIFA 13 certainly does not mean reducing its qualities, because it is indisputable that the Electronic Arts product has content and production values such as to underline its importance within the plans of the American giant. Certainly it cannot be said that it represents a sensational leap forward compared to last year; from a technical and mechanical point of view, most of the contents are identical, and there are not even particular improvements in artificial intelligence. Obviously it is useless to talk about the Impact Engine or tactical defense, elements that probably would have both reduced compatibility with less powerful terminals and made a deliberately more immediate gameplay all too complex. Where the greatest effort has been made is certainly in the management of the keys; the fact of modifying the function at the same time as the attack or defense phase is certainly not an innovation, but instead the solution chosen for the tricks is quite intriguing. In practice, the appropriate button is used as a sort of analog, requiring it to be pressed and then dragged in different directions corresponding to the different ~numbers~ that can be performed. But probably the most incisive novelty within the FIFA 13 package is therefore the online multiplayer, an even more valuable addition in the context of a sports title. The EA game offers fluctuating performance, but all in all acceptable with a Wi-Fi connection; an indicator signals the quality of the connection with the opponent, selectable between friends or randomly. 3G however is not supported, and it's probably for the best given the dramatic results that could result. Too bad for the lack of attention to one of the elements most dear to users, or the fidelity and visual resemblance to real athletes; from this point of view FIFA 13 leaves something to be desired, with convincing replicas only of the most representative players of the leading teams; for all the others, and therefore for the majority of cases, we are faced with dummies that have very little to do with the references in the flesh, despite the excellent quality of the animations. And the disinterest in an aspect like height, practically completely forgotten, is also strange: seeing Giovinco or Messi who can count the same centimeters as a Pirlo is at first unsettling, and then becomes a reason for reflection on the reasons for such lack of attention to the details ~that matter~. Finally, to close the discussion on the defects, it seems incredible how simply bad the sound sector is; if the commentary only in English recycled from previous years leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it is the quality of the effects that is extraordinarily low, starting with the chants of the fans so repetitive and limited as to be really annoying. Completely muting the audio is therefore not only a suggestion, but almost a necessity. Finally, a note on the size of the application, with almost 1.5 GB to download which swells further once installed; on a device with little storage space it could be a problem.", "date": "2012-10-12", "grade": "9.5"}
