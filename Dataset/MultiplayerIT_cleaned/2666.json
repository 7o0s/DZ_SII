{"name": "DISNEY'S DINOSAUR", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disneys-dinosaur.html", "text": "The game The latest title from the French software house opens with a spectacular introduction that shows us the initial part of the new Disney film ~Dinosaurs~. A flying reptile carries in its beak the egg of a dinosaur of another species, which will soon be born and will be the protagonist of an incredible adventure dedicated to its own salvation and that of all the brontosaurs. Aladar, this is the name of the puppy, will immediately have two adventure companions: Flia (a flying reptile) and Zini (one of the first mammals, very similar to a monkey). These two will follow the little Aladar for almost the entire game, they will see him grow and finally move away together with his fellow brontosaurs. From the very first game sessions, Disney's Dinosaur presents itself as a title that has very little adulthood. Initially you will have to pass a special training that will allow you to master all the commands of the three characters you will use during the game. Everything is extremely simple and intuitive. Maybe even too much. You will have to complete missions with objectives that will almost never be repetitive but rather confusing and unclear. And here the donkey falls: more than once in fact you will find yourself wandering the schemes without knowing what to do and where to go. Which can be very annoying especially to those who want to complete the game without superfluous frustrations, not very suitable for the children to whom this title is addressed. Technical aspects Another thing that brings the latest Disney title closer to children is certainly the technical aspect. Not because the characters are funny or particularly nice but because, in most cases, children don't have great needs in terms of graphics and sound. Often it is enough for them to see colored polygons moving on the screen. Well, for us a little older this is not enough. The graphics of this game are highly below the average of recent PsOne productions: the characters are not very detailed, as are the landscapes and all the surrounding elements (lightning, smoke). As for the sound, there's not much to say here either. The programmers haven't bothered on that front either. The music is catchy at first, then becomes annoying and boring. The sound effects, as well as the voices, are not bad, even if they could be improved. In conclusion Disney's Dinosaur certainly does not pass the exam with flying colors and brings home a slight failure. I say light because it is true that the technical aspects have not been taken care of, but the playability and longevity are quite good, especially for the audience to which the game is addressed. I would therefore recommend this game only and exclusively to children under 10 years of age. If you belong to the over-10s, buy something more adult and technically better. A bit of history 65 million years ago on Earth walked huge animals that dominated the entire continent called Pangea. These colossal reptiles were the Dinosaurs. After many millions of years, Man made his appearance. It has been more than 3 million years since Homo erectus ran after their prey in the African grasslands. And today, finally, after all this time, we have the opportunity to review on our televisions those animals we've heard so much about. Thanks to Ubi Soft, Disney and our trusty PsOne (soon also on PS2) we can dress them up and interact with them.", "date": "2000-12-11", "grade": null}
