{"name": "This is the Police 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/this-is-police-2-recensione.html", "text": "Do you remember Jack Boyd? He was the protagonist of the first This is the Police, the ~noir~ management software of the Belarusian Weappy team. We had tried it exactly two years ago, and our impressions had been positive, albeit with some reservations due to the typical mistakes of the developer's youth. With excellent starting points, the programmers have exhumed the corrupt detective of the first episode to put him on a path of redemption (we would not want to anticipate the conclusion for those who have not yet taken hold of it, but in what follows it is very clear how it ends) . The first impact with This is the Police 2 is quite unsettling, because if on the one hand the ~Office Nineties~ graphics immediately betray the roots of the title, on the other one wonders at what point in the previous one the policemen of the Freeburg in Xcom-style missions. The answer is ~never~ and the fact that the long initial tutorial is dedicated to this new feature could suggest a strategic turn of Weappy's game. Lots of storytelling, little gameplay We are talking about a radical novelty which, however, does not take over the mechanics that we had already appreciated in 2016 and which have subsequently been further refined and adapted to the main objective of the programmers, which is to tell a story. An adult story, with stylistic features reminiscent of the first This is the Police (after all, the protagonist is the same), but which finally finds more breathing space in the new setting of Sharpwood, where our anti-hero has taken refuge. This is the typical continental town in the United States, where the Neckties gang has taken root and is expanding its influence in the drug trade. The first mission features the sheriff and his most trusted men who, following a tip-off, rush into a sawmill where the criminals kill them in an ambush. At that point, the fragile Lilly Reed rises to the head of the department and persuades herself to entrust the direction of operations to Boyd, hiding from her colleagues that she is a dangerous subject wanted by the feds. Day after day (shifts are represented by calendar sheets) new pieces of an intricate story become known in which Jack tries to get closer to his family, hiding from the FBI thanks also to the help of his old mafia friends. The rhythms with which these episodes are staged, in perfect TV series style, may not please everyone, even if they adapt well to the dark-colored atmosphere. During the first hour of the game, for example, you hardly ever play and you spend your time glued to the screen listening to the dialogues between the various protagonists of the story: the graphics are used just to give an idea of the location where the events, but, since there is no type of characterization of the faces, all the weight of the acting rests on the voices of the excellent voice actors that the publisher THQ Nordic has made available to Weappy, among which once again Jon ~Duke Nukem~ St John stands out in as Detective Boyd and Sarah Hamilton (The Longest Journey) as Lilly. The dialogues, another novelty, are entirely subtitled in Italian, which is a nice convenience for not missing even an exchange of jokes. A great novelty and many optimizations The game scheme is exactly the same as This is the Police and basically revolves around the city map in which, from time to time, points of interest are activated: they are the positions of citizens who have called the central to report crimes . Each crime is characterized by a level of severity, so it is not always sufficient to send the first men available to the marked places, but, just as happens in the companion missions of Assassin's Creed, it is necessary that the team's experience touches a minimum level. Once the crime scene has been reached, it is necessary to decide how to proceed: for example, the grandmother who broke the glass of the bank teller, exhausted by the waiting times, can be persuaded to reason and follow the agents, or much more abruptly handcuffed and taken in the central. In this case, however, he could be injured, with the consequent failure of the mission. Each cop has six attributes: speed, stealth, aim, intelligence, negotiation, and strength. In the previous case, therefore, the most suitable one to persuade the old lady could be precisely the one that has the highest negotiation value, while we will certainly rely on a faster element to chase a junkie who has just robbed a girl. Completing missions increases the experience of the agents who become more and more lethal. A little managerialand, a bit strategic It would all be too simple if we didn't have to deal with the very scarce human material available, both quantitatively and qualitatively. On the shoulders of the department gravitate some real parasites who show up for work once a week, others who get tired after half a day spent on paperwork and are no longer performing, still others who always have excuses ready to avoid carrying out their duty, like agent Mustard who doesn't want women in his team having already endured a couple at home, or the beautiful Spurlunk who doesn't agree to go out on a mission alone. The difficulty is therefore to navigate among the thousand unforeseen events that daily undermine the number of men present for the work shift and the paturnies of the employees that make even the rescue of the cat a real mission impossible. At the end of the working day there is a debriefing in which Boyd's work is judged on the basis of the number of beer can tabs in a glass: each completed mission earns them, the failed ones decrease them. With the points available, you can hire new agents or restore stocks of equipment; you must then choose who to call on duty the next day, bearing in mind that even the agents get tired and deconcentration could lead to road accidents or the failure of missions. It soon becomes clear that the important thing is not to process all the reports from citizens (practically impossible), but to carefully select the potentially more dangerous ones, which can, for example, lead to the death of people (and therefore to extremely negative scores), sipping the limited number of men available. In addition to emergencies, there are two other types of missions: investigations and field action. The first, which we had already known in the previous episode, are reports from citizens in which two or more possible culprits are brought to Boyd's attention. On the basis of the clues initially available, it is first necessary to direct the attention of the agents (who therefore cannot be available in the area while they are at work) on whoever considers himself guilty and, once in possession of all the elements, to reconstruct the happened and bring the offender to justice. We mentioned the last type in the initial lines: these are missions in which the agents are directly controlled from an isometric view. Before going into action you have to choose which bonuses to equip the policemen with (possibility to shoot multiple times in the same turn, wider range of vision, etc.) and then lead them to the completion of the objective (neutralization of enemies, deactivation of a bomb, etc.) within a certain number of turns. These are tasks much easier said than done: the artificial intelligence is not superfine but is well compensated for by the imbalance in the number of forces in the field. Balance and graphics To complicate the matter even more are Boyd's debts to organized crime that keeps the FBI away from him: every week he has to pay his tormentors $ 20,000, and this money certainly cannot come through the daily routine. So here are the ~borderline~ quests that can also be refused, however not knowing the outcome that certain actions could have in the continuation of the title and often forcing the player to repeat even several rounds before being able to make the ~correct~ choice. However, we note that several imperfections of the first episode have been corrected, making the player's activity a little less bizarre, although there are even more variables at stake. In particular, the management of the police command is much more streamlined and rapid and even the rescues themselves are more ~rational~ than the previous ones. From a graphic point of view we are faced with a refinement of the work that we had already appreciated a couple of years ago: some animations and some more details that enrich a very particular and refined graphic style. We have already talked about the excellent dubbing, and we can say that the soundtrack is also absolutely up to the work of the Minsk programmers.", "date": "2018-07-30", "grade": "8.0"}
