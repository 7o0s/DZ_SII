{"name": "Viva Piata: Guai in Paradiso - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viva-pinata-guai-in-paradiso-recensione.html", "text": "Return to the island The gameplay, in essence, is the same as in the first episode: the aim of the game is to take care of a garden and populate it with as many species of piata as possible, while tackling management problems of various types. To enrich the background a little, to tell the truth just mentioned in the first chapter, a minimum of history has also been included which introduces the player's action. Prof. Pester, with the help of his shady henchmen, has in fact penetrated the central computer of Piata Island, completely resetting the precious archive of Piata Central, containing all the data on the various species of piatas and on the assignments of these in the various parties around the world. At this point we enter the scene, urgently recalled to the exotic island to take the situation back in hand. The departure is substantially identical to the original and with spade in hand, we find ourselves having to start a new career as a ~gardener~. The interface is borrowed from the typical management-strategic one and, despite the adaptation made to better fit the Xbox 360 controller, it still invokes the use of the mouse as an elective control system. With the analog we find ourselves moving the ~pointer~, which from time to time takes on different characteristics depending on the instrument chosen: the spade, for example, is the initial object, with which we can dig holes to plant vegetables, shape the configuration of the land to create pools of water or knock down elements of the scenery and also ~beat~ the bitter piatas, which periodically come to disturb the peace of the garden (in case you choose the hard line and don't want to try to induce them to ~ good~, according to the typical dichotomy of the whole game). the result is a rather complex management of the garden-ecosystem, with slightly improved dynamics compared to the first version Return to the island The spade is only one of the tools available, all the rest of the possibilities can be recalled through the main menu, with which you can access the various options and take care of different aspects of the garden and the piatas: buy and distribute new types of land on the surface, make build homes for the various species of piatas, take care of the vegetation, closely connected to the habitat needs of the little animals. The aim is to create an environment that satisfies the physiological requirements of the various species, in order to attract them around the garden, make them become sedentary and possibly make them proliferate through mating (feasible through simple mini-games). Also keep an eye on the ~caramel~ level of the piata, which is also an indication of the good health of the animals and consequently of our good work. The result is a rather complex management of the garden ecosystem, with improved dynamics compared to the first version and enriched by new options. The news The brief animated introduction could suggest new narrative elements inserted into the fabric of the game, but it is a mere pretext to introduce the second chapter, and the story is soon lost among the thousand commitments of the garden. The novelties must be sought among the gameplay gears, since as already mentioned this new episode represents more a general filing and revision of the first, than a real expansion of the concept. The most obvious addition is that of the two new territories to explore, the desert and the arctic, which obviously involve new specific piatas for both habitats: these are not game areas where you can expand your garden, however, but places separate to visit exclusively to catch new pinatas and bring them to our territory (which introduces the new practice of setting traps with baits and trying to attract the creatures). As regards the new species, there are about 30 that add to the already large original repertoire, with further variations. The novelty that integrates better and actually evolves the game mechanics is that of the missions: the good Langston (one of the bizarre individuals who populate Piata Island) will continuously commission us shipments of piatas for parties around the world. This introduction has a beneficial effect on the pace of the game, as it provides what was fundamentally missing from the original chapter: objectives. this new episode represents more a filing and general review of the first, than a real expansion of the concept The news Having to gradually satisfy new requests, we are stimulated to move forward, focusing on new piatas and trying to get them to reach maximum carameliness and then send them to their destination (they come back after a short time, of coursent). In this way, that sense of disorientation that could strike the average player who could not enter the simply collecting perspective of the first Viva Piata is mitigated. Each satisfied request also contributes to increasing our level of experience, leading us to obtain upgrades for objects and indispensable extensions of the garden. Having said that, however, one should not think of an upheaval of the structure: the game is still largely based on the collecting spirit and on the affection that Rare's little creatures can inspire in users. If we get caught up in this mechanic, it becomes an irresistible title, otherwise the lack of stimuli given by a progression comparable only to the expansion of the garden and the increase in the species of piatas can be tiring in the long run. Another addition, less evident at first glance, concerns a greater attention and assimilation of the flora in the ecosystem of the piatas, also with the typical good/evil ratio with intermediate gradients (some seeds can be both baleful plagues and delicious food, for example ) which covers a bit the whole world of Piata Island. Finally, new faces and various helpers have been added to spice up the gaming experience, without representing substantial additions to the general structure. Technicolor terrarium The appearance of Viva Piata: Trouble in Paradise does not differ much from that of the first chapter, which was already at excellent levels. On the other hand, the very particular characterization requires a certain fidelity to the line, and the new additions are in fact perfectly inserted in the general climate established by Rare for the first incarnation (in papier-mch?) of Piata Island. However, everything appears slightly cleaner and more fluid; when a new creature appears for the first time, the presentation video is triggered, and it is a real pleasure to see the piatas magically color themselves once they become part of the garden. From an aesthetic point of view, as well as from the sound, Rare have done an impeccable job. Some adjustments to the control system make the action even more dynamic: using the back buttons it is possible to comfortably scroll through all the little animals in the garden, and the presence of seed bags directly in the main menu represents a convenient shortcut that avoids the usual loop for shops. Speaking of the latter, there is a general speeding up in the loading of the various locations in which to shop, but the fact of having to wait a few seconds every time we need to contact the various shopkeepers is always rather annoying. To vary the action a bit, a cooperative online multiplayer mode was introduced, where you could invite friends (up to a total of 4 players) to your garden or visit someone else's, and that was one of the things you he missed it in the first chapter, given that growing a garden with so much affection makes little sense if you can't then share it with friends. Comment Viva Piata, like many other strategic-management games, relies mainly on contemplative pleasure, in observing the micro-cosm created and cared for with much love by the player for the small creatures of Rare, despite the fact that there are many things to do. In essence, it has remained the same game as two years ago, but it is much easier now to get into the heart of the action thanks to the learning curve excellently mitigated by the new introductions of this chapter, in addition to the usual captivating aesthetic derived from the first. In order to get to the bottom, however, as in the original, it is necessary to be in line with what Piata Island requires of the players: the ideal user is the one who manages to get caught up in the protectionist spirit towards small creatures, and at the same time falls within in the figure of the model collector, who takes pleasure in abundance and discovery, since essentially the progression in the game is determined only by the increase of the population in the garden. On the other hand, it must be said that with Trouble in Paradise it is also easy to end up identifying with this prototype player. Pros Excellent and characteristic technical realization Pace improved by the new missions Structure always solid and well built Cons Few additions compared to the original, two years later Persevering isn't for everyone Interface that still isn't very intuitive Xbox 360 goals Trouble in Heaven is particularly challenging from an objective point of view. Not having a classic scan in levels, achievements are achieved only through the achievement of particular results, often quite challenging. In total, the objectives are 50 for a total of 1000 points, and to be collected rethey ask for a certain consistency of play. Pinata cards In an alternative marketing access, Rare has decided to include particular trading cards in the Viva Piata universe. In the style of Pokmon, each card corresponds to a new creature, and just show them to the Live Vision Camera for this piata to come to life within the game. The system is based on reading a particular graphic pattern on the edges of the card, like a new ~Barcode Battler~. And new ones can be created by uploading the photographs taken in-game from your own garden or that of friends to the official website, so that you can exchange them at will.", "date": "2008-09-19", "grade": null}
