At the rate at which the gaming industry is evolving, a title takes very little to become ~old-fashioned~ and it is increasingly difficult to impress modern players with the old glories. However, even in an era that has accustomed us to very high quality titles, often developed with cachets that would make a Hollywood producer pale, there are some timeless masterpieces that everyone should have the pleasure of experiencing. A company that can boast of having created or published some of these pillars of gaming is undoubtedly Interplay. In case it was not known to you, know that it is to this company that we owe the birth of Earthworm Jim, Descent and Fallout. Not a small pedigree, completed by one of the most loved action games of the last twenty years: MDK. The company has had some dark moments in the past, but has recovered by selling the Fallout brand to Bethesda (a transaction that has also caused countless legal squabbles that we won't talk about here). Now that it is economically stable again, it has cleverly decided to leverage the brands that made it famous, and one of the first moves in this direction was the release of a remastered version of MDK. strangely, however, the choice did not fall on the first stratospheric chapter (who knows, maybe they want to keep it safe for possible dark times) but on MDK 2. A less astronomical work but made by Bioware and in any case of superb quality. The project was entrusted to Overhaul Games, a subdivision of Beamdog. If we consider that the aforementioned software house is made up of former members of the Canadian giant, some of whom were involved in the creation of the original, there could be no better choice. Just one small problem... MDK 2 is eleven years old. After all this time, will it still be worth saving the world as the most dangerous janitor in the universe and his wacky cronies? Jailbird was the Goulash MDKs are not only unique in their remarkable quality. Among the strong points of the series there are also the dementia and the crazy characters. At the heart of it all is Dr. Fluke Hawkins, a brilliant mad scientist who exiled himself from planet earth in order to make some extraordinary discovery. The mustachioed scholar, after having built the Jim Dandy space station and having convinced his attendant Kurt Hectic to follow him into space by bribing him with Hungarian Goulash, had found himself dealing with an alien invasion. Kurt himself had thought of saving the world, with the help of the doctor's trusty robotic dog named Max and armed with a highly advanced combat suit. The second chapter begins immediately after the conclusion of the first, with our heroes discovering one last alien base in Canada and preparing to end it. But something goes wrong, and Kurt is captured by a huge alien named Shwang Shwing. It's up to Max and the doctor to save him and defeat the invaders yet again. As can be guessed from the plot, in MDK2 HD you will not only control the old protagonist in his shiny spandex suit, but also his two friends. The beauty is that the change of character involves a total transformation of the gameplay. Indeed, this sequel manages to be more varied than its predecessor, introducing styles of play that are as diverse as they are brilliant. Kurt has the same control scheme as always: he can deploy his jib parachute to glide slowly and glide through the air, take out enemies with an arm-mounted machine gun, or finish them off from range with the scope of his extra-long ~sniper helmet~. Max has a less tactical approach to battle and limits himself to puncturing everything that comes in front of him using four weapons at the same time (he still has four arms). The big dog can also use a rechargeable jetpack to reach elevated areas. Fluke Hawkins instead uses the MacGyver-fu, and can combine the objects scattered around the Jim Dandy in the most disparate ways. Want an example? An atomic toaster can turn a baguette into a homing missile. We have said everything. MDKs, Multimedia Development Kits? Bioware knew how to do it even 11 years ago, that's all. MDK 2 still has great playability today, it's fast-paced and fun. In particular, the structure of the levels should be praised, full of simple but well-structured puzzles that do not break the action. Even the professor's levels, clearly full of puzzles, manage to be a nice diversion from the shootings of his two adventure companions. Certain factors actually show the age of the game, mainly some less sophisticated maps. In any case, these are trifles, and they are not minenano a title that undoubtedly deserves to be played by the new generations. Overhaul games has decided not to change the gameplay that much (even if the difficulty is that of the wiiware version, more accessible than the original), but has opted for some graphic tweaks. The HD version of the game features brand new three-dimensional models. Kurt, Max, the Doctor and some bosses have been completely remodeled, and their ~bubbleness~ is gone. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the less important settings or enemies, which have remained essentially unchanged even if in high definition. The final effect clashes a bit, especially in the animated scenes, where it can happen to see very detailed models flanked by aliens made up of a dozen polygons. Also strange is that the mouths of the characters move in the portraits of the dialogue boxes, but not on the actual models. At least everything moves very smoothly, and we experienced no crashes or bugs of any kind during our run. A separate problem is represented by the Beamdog client whose download is necessary to start the game. This is not a particularly invasive virtual platform, but it created some problems for us in the first few days, with a couple of updates that made the game practically impossible to start. The problem was resolved very quickly with a new patch, but this increasingly widespread desire to imitate Steam annoys a bit, especially when the alternative platform has neither the options related to social networks, nor the reliability and offline mode of the very famous Valve counterpart.", "date": "2011-10-31", "grade": "8.2"}
