All this popularity, also and above all linked to the theme of zombies, has led the franchise to invade the world of video games on many occasions, in particular with the adventure developed by Telltale Games in 2012. Now the brand returns to mobile, and does so with a rather awaited strategic: here is the review of The Walking Dead: Survivors. Structure The Walking Dead: Survivors, a detail of the management phase. The first minutes of The Walking Dead: Survivors give the idea of a production that immediately plays all its cards in an attempt to positively affect users, with high-impact sequences and lots of animations, only to then fall back on a structure that we have seen many times on iOS and Android devices, that of casual management  la Farmville. zombies after they have overcome the outer barriers of the settlement that forms the backdrop for the entire campaign, using the energy that gradually recharges to launch other survivors into action or use special weapons such as oil and explosives. The Walking Dead: Survivors, a look at the settlement. In reality, however, these phases represent a secondary portion of the experience, accessible from the main menu in the form of missions which, however, are very limited in terms of development and progression, so much so that you repeat the same formula again and again until you run into obstacles of a freemium setting that after a few hours clearly aims to monetize with microtransactions. After a couple of hours in which you proceed very quickly, quickly unlocking new characters and proceeding in the chapters of the campaign based on the traditional list of achievements, you therefore find yourself having to wait several minutes for the completion of a building or its upgrade , fundamental elements to be able to build something else or to make our troops more effective in the automatic clashes that take place outside the walls. Gameplay The Walking Dead: Survivors, a detail of the tower defense-style strategic phases. In short, The Walking Dead: Survivors only pretends to be a real strategic one, instead offering us for the most part a management gameplay that has already been widely seen and inflated, moreover without any innovations that can somehow refresh the formula. We move from one collection of resources to another, from one construction site to another, from one training to another, trying to grow the settlement. We've already seen everything, we said. The only difference compared to other similar productions lies in the fact of being able to have a greater number of units dedicated to construction or collection, in practice all the survivors unlocked up to that moment, instead of a single poor man who immediately forces us to endure long waits or spend hard currency to speed up the work. Technical realization Also in terms of technical realization, the experience of The Walking Dead: Survivors turns out to be a bit of a ~hit and run~, which puts its best things into play in the very first sequences only to then return to the comfort zone of a three-way isometric view quarters and get by. There's literally more care and effort in the opening minutes of the campaign than in the hours after, which is a shame. While perfectly competent within the genre, with a fairly clear and well-organized interface (albeit limited to one visual in portrait style, only sensible on smartphones), as well as an effective visual representation of the settlement and the walkers, the title produced by Elex does not stand out in any way.", "date": "2021-04-15", "grade": "6.8"}
