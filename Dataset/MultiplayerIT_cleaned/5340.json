For hours, in truth, we could also discuss the decline of SNK, its swan song and its transformation into SNK-Playmore, which was followed by an unexpected rebirth with the recent chapters of the series. However, the rebirth did not take place on an economic level, since The King of Fighters XIII's enormous technical barriers and its atrocious netcode prevented it from becoming a commercial success (within a genre where it is already not easy to sell a large number of copies). For this reason, after abandoning the Playmore brand and promising a recovery of its great history, SNK has chosen to revolutionize the brand by following the same path as the last Street Fighters: a main chapter of the saga with three-dimensional graphics and 2D battles. Too bad the house doesn't have great polygon artists among its ranks at the moment and that the reveal was greeted with some skepticism even by fans after the first trailers. So today we are here to tell you if the king of fighting games has remained large enough to allow us to pass over graphics adequate to the last generation, and if his latest chapter hides enough surprises to be able to break even the hearts of newbies. The King of Fighters is back - can it still compete against the stiff competition? Champion with sideburns The King of Fighters XIV seems to want to be the symbolic game of the new direction taken by the Japanese development house, a return to the origins in every element, starting from the story mode. Unlike what has been done by the competition, in fact, this title does not offer a complex storyline with several chapters, but a typical arcade mode with an initial choice of three fighters, interspersed with videos and closed by a couple of boss battles. Only the final scenes (drawn, as in the old chapters) and some cutscenes change according to the chosen team, but the underlying plot remains broadly the same. And it is a basic plot that of the latest The King of Fighters, built around the bombastic millionaire Antonov, who decides to buy the rights to the most famous fighting tournament in the world and to transform it once again into a spectacular show. Except that together with the television rights comes the usual evil entity eager to destroy the planet, with which the fighters will have to deal with during the final. For the rest, it's really all here: a light story that doesn't take itself very seriously, up to the inevitable ~SNK-like~ boss with unjustifiable moves (even if on Normal difficulty we are faced with a monstrosity much easier to deal with than people like Goenitz, Rugal and Igniz, so rest assured if you remember these names with dread). A solution undoubtedly in line with the previous chapters, but far from the well-finished modalities seen in the NetherRealm titles, or from the complex background of the Arc System fighting games. Not that it isn't enjoyable enough to be played a handful of times, mind you, yet more could certainly have been done. Also because the rest of the modes know already seen, between survival and tests divided by character. In short, from a content point of view, this The King of Fighters does not make you cry out for a miracle, and it is a champion only when you look at its impressive roster of about fifty fighters. Fists for a few The fortune of the title, predictably, lies in the finesse of its mechanics. The series has always been at the top of the genre, but in recent years it had reached peaks of rare technicality, capable of making it the fixed choice of many veterans. However, this is not a philosophy capable of expanding the catchment area to date, so the developers have chosen to partially modify the game's combat system, while maintaining the very high technical level necessary to fully master it. Let's explain ourselves better: the complexity of The King of Fighters is undeniable, and it becomes evident when one considers that there are already four jump approach options alone (jump, super jump, medium jump and normal jump); to these leaps are added dodges, counter-dodges, blows that cause wall rebounds and an enormous number of applications of the available moves. Not enough there is also a MAX mode, which allows you to use enhanced moves for some time and specific systems tied to the various characters, all in the midst of hits that require near-perfect timing to be linked in a complex way. And at this point you will rightly ask yourselves: ~but how can all this mess be thought for a neophyte?~ Well, in verity is not, and the only truly beginner-proof gimmick inserted by SNK are automatic combos that close with a super if you crush the light punch in bursts (not recommended at high levels, since the damage done is less compared to normal combos). Yet the normal melds have simplified, to the point where many of the basic melds are easier for the average player to execute. The bar has therefore lowered slightly compared to The King of Fighters XIII, although the title remains designed for experienced players and longtime enthusiasts. Dicta as directly as possible: if you are looking for a first fighting game capable of gently introducing you to the genre, this is not the game for you, but neither is it the brutal tour de force seen in the past. Playstation 4 trophies The King of Fighters XIV has 48 trophies, of which two are gold and ten are silver. In general, almost all of them will take a long time, especially the silver trophy that requires you to complete the story mode with all teams, or the one that will force you to play party versus a hundred times. The two golds are particularly challenging, requiring ten consecutive wins and 100 wins in online ranked matches. Among the arduous silvers, however, we underline the one that requires the completion of 100 tests, given the difficulty of executing some combos. Inscrutable polygons From a technical point of view, however, there is very little to say. Indeed, one word actually comes quite automatically: ~why?~ It is seriously difficult to understand why SNK has decided to convert to the cult of three dimensions, especially when the sprites of the previous chapter were of very high quality; yet it was done and the result is... disappointing. The King of Fighters XIV is not a nice game to look at: the polygonal models are sloppy, the animations rather woody, the particle effects mediocre, the supers not very spectacular and the backgrounds are the only thing to save (although they are far from a any jaw drop). A fine work would certainly have taken more time and perhaps keeping the graphics 2D would have made it impossible to quickly insert many new fighters, but watching the game in action still causes a lot of regrets for the old style. However, the experts will care little about the technical sector, they will be more concerned about the netcode, the black beast of the XIII that had to be tamed here at all costs. Here, in truth we were not able to perform in-depth tests before the release, but we managed to bring a few games home and, by informing ourselves a little in the company of other European and overseas players with a review copy, we should be able to confirm a clearly stable greater than online matches. It is not the case to expect miracles - the matches against overseas players are still half a disaster and some moments of heavy lag can happen - but the improvement has been there and lovers of network fights will be able to enjoy the good lobby and match system ranked offered by the game, complete with challenges between single fighters and parties to complement the inevitable three-on-three matches.", "date": "2016-08-22", "grade": "7.8"}
