{"name": "The Forest Quartet", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-forest-quartet-recensione.html", "text": "The gaming world has repeatedly faced complex and painful topics: the death of a loved one and the trauma of being uprooted from one's family context are at the center of titles such as Gris, What Remains of Edith Finch, the recent How To Say Goodbye , and many more. Even the small Danish team Mads & Friends wanted to have their say on the theme of mourning, telling the story of The Forest Quartet, a band that is facing the disappearance of singer and saxophonist Nina. Nina's voice runs throughout The Forest Quartet as a red thread that holds both the gameplay mechanics and the reflections of his three fellow musicians who remained alive. Crossing the forest that gave the band its name, Nina's spirit - led by the player - will have to help friends to move forward and mourn: the puzzles are aimed precisely at ~freeing~ the minds of the three from fears and pain, within a tripartite structure that explores different ways of coping with the death of a loved one. However, given that the protagonist is the soul of the deceased Nina, one wonders what agency Mads & Friends gives to the living in dealing with a traumatic event. We discuss this in our review of The Forest Quartet. From Denmark with (a lot) love The forest of The Forest Quartet is a place to get lost and find yourself The Forest Quartet is a project first and foremost rooted in the family background of developer Mads Vadsholt, responsible for game design, audio and graphics. The Vadsholt family has a strong musical traction: the jazz soundtrack is in fact composed by dad Kaspar (who also recorded the double bass parts together with other musicians of the Danish Radio Big Band of Copenhagen), while the protagonist of the adventure, Nina, it has the voice of Mads' sister of the same name. It can be said that The Forest Quartet is a journey aimed at reconstructing jazz understood as panache, joie de vivre, ability to improvise in the face of life's difficulties. The band that gives the title to the Mads & Friends game is faced with a situation potentially capable of breaking its jazz: Nina's death is an event that could destroy the group forever, fragmenting it and making it impossible to continue on its path . Luckily Nina's ghost doesn't give up, and after re-emerging from the grave he dedicates himself to a loving job of reconnecting and enlightening the hearts and minds of his surviving colleagues (and friends). Each member of The Forest Quartet has their own way of coping with grief. The adventure is divided into three acts, each dedicated to one of the remaining band members. A mysterious mushroom has taken possession of the portion of the forest that symbolizes the pianist's mind, transforming the nature from which Kirk drew inspiration into a dark and rotting place; JB's house, on the other hand, is besieged by creatures of darkness who do not give peace to his mind tormented by memories of Nina; drummer Sebastian's tumultuous and impetuous heart is symbolized by a volcanic and burning landscape, and his personal forest risks being reduced to ashes by the anger with which he has received the news of his friend's death. It's up to Nina to bring back the light in the dark forest of her three friends, a place once full of beauty, but now besieged by the cumbersome presence of mourning. The survivors remain in the background, protagonists only on paper of their personal drama, while it's up to the deceased to restore order - like a loving mother - in the minds and hearts of her companions. So much so that the message given by The Forest Quartet seems to conflict with the laborious confrontation with oneself and one's own pain necessary to overcome a traumatic event: here Nina takes care of it, the one and only protagonist of the adventure, female deus ex machina who, even when dead, she perpetuates the role of care and mentor that her companions recognized her in life. Just a little light Many of The Forest Quartet's puzzles are based on light. Nina's specter has a particular power: it can bring light wherever it goes. All it takes is a snap of a finger to light up the street lamps scattered throughout the forest, while the machines capable of illuminating the minds of his friends can be activated by finding their components and putting them in the right place. Many interactions center around the power of Nina's voice, which made her a brilliant and respected musician in her lifetime. As for the puzzles, nothing is too complicated: The Forest Quartet is a very linear and not at all complex adventure, also suitable for the little ones and can be completed in about an hour and a half. In terms of setting, it is a pity to see how the navigationaction is not always immediate: at times it is not clear which abysses of the forest can be overcome in flight and which cannot, and some limitations seem to have been placed in an artificial way, forcing us to complete puzzles to cross spaces which, in other situations, are navigable without no obstacle. The puzzle solving and the exploration of the forest - brilliantly rendered with sober colors and strong contrasts, with an art direction that explicitly looks to Kentucky Route Zero - are accompanied by the voices of the band members, with clips of past interviews that they open a window into the lives of the musicians and the internal dynamics of the quartet. We would have liked to hear more, because these are often exciting and particularly well-chosen passages within the playful context, capable of creating a link between life, death and jazz, the main themes of The Forest Quartet. The sound design is very accurate, which retains its strength and expresses itself with small musical flashes up to the very successful final jazz explosion.", "date": "2022-12-08", "grade": "7.0"}
