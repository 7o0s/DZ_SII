{"name": "Super Mario Advance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-mario-advance.html", "text": "Super Mario Bros. 2 To begin with, Super Mario Bros. 2 is a rather atypical work in the panorama of events featuring the Italian plumber; this is because initially the title did not describe the exploits of Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Peach, but was adapted in its transposition from the Japanese to the American market, obtaining incredible success. I say this because we are not dealing with the orthodox gameplay that made Mario famous: it will always be necessary to jump between the various platforms and on the heads of enemies, but it will also be necessary to extract vegetables from the ground, go through parallel worlds, play the slot machine and other news. The starting point for the plot is offered by a coup carried out by Wart in the realm of dreams; the terrible figure wants to conquer the dream territory to then move on to reality. Obviously our intrepid plumber can't afford to have nightmares, so he sets off to the rescue with his lovable friends. Here's another innovation: you can decide which character to face each stage with, your choice is bound to Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Peach (who for once shouldn't be saved...); each has its own characteristics, which are distributed between the abilities of speed and strength jump (plus Peach can hover in the air for a second and a half). The adventure unfolds in 7 worlds for a total of 20 stages. The game is beautiful, colorful and captivating, it is also finally possible to face a Mario adventure in 2D that is different from the others. The controls are truly classic: with A you jump, with B you increase the speed or extract objects from the ground, with the PAD you move and with the LEFT button (left back) you scroll vertically. Precisely on vertical scrolling it is necessary to make some clarifications: the programmers have decided not to make it fluid, when the screen changes the game freezes, the image moves up or down, depending on whether you are going up or down, then resumes; this expedient (long-standing and now in disuse) allows you to direct your fall or your rise as it shows you the whole screen first. A function has been implemented directly from Mario64: by crouching on the ground it is possible to perform a super jump. What most fascinates me (or perhaps scares ...), is the great variety of hidden objects, red coins, secret passages, Warp points that you will encounter during the game: you will have to decide when to stop me because experience will allow you to make great virtuosity, reaching previously inaccessible places, understanding what is hidden behind a screen, and so on. In the study of the levels, the Nintendo titles prove to be abysmally superior to the competition, making 20 stages appear as an unlimited territory. Many passages will be difficult, but the captivating graphics and the sweetness of the characters and atmospheres will always encourage you to continue, without letting frustration take over. To enter the game mechanics it will take a few games, then it will be like passing into a small magical world with its rules, its protagonists and a vast and cute ~bestiary~. At the end of each way you will find one of Wart's bad allies who will try to stop you, but fear not, because it is possible to save the progress obtained in the adventure at any time. The sound aspect is valid: the music is beautiful, the sound effects always appropriate and a large amount of verses, voices and digitized phrases characterize the title superbly. The technical realization is the classic one from Nintendo: flawless; the game is always fluid, there are no flickers (except those intended), I have not encountered any bugs or glitches, it is clear that the game has been tested properly. All positives then? Probably someone will denounce a sort of repetitiveness of the settings; but it didn't bother me even after many (and I mean many) hours of play. I'm sure that in a year the Game Boy Advance will show us many other marvels, especially with titles specifically designed for the machine. Mario Bros. Classic Now let's move on to the progenitor of the family, which is not a scrolling platformer, but a title that is divided into a single screen. Your task will be to eliminate all the monsters that descend from above, hitting the platforms on which they walk with their heads and then kicking them off the screen (you will thus obtain precious coins). Needless to say the game is wonderful in its simplicity even after all these years. Hours upon hours of gameplay trying to improve your high scores are guaranteed. Obviously in the long run it can be repetitive, but it represents what perhaps the vet is and wasUsta Italian definition of video game: harp. Multiplayer After much writing we have finally arrived at interpersonal relationships. This title offers you two games that you can share with other acquaintances: Mario Bros. Battle (if you only have one cartridge) and Mario Bros Classic (if you have one cartridge for each connected Game Boy Advance). Both can be played up to four. Mario Bros Classic is like what you find in single-player, but now you will need to cooperate to finish the levels. In Mario Bros. Battle you will have to challenge each other, you will also find a wonderful garbage can in which to lock up your opponent (I used the singular because the garbage can only appears if you play in two). For both games the dynamics are like those I described for the single-player Mario Bros Classic: you have to turn the animals upside down and throw them off the screen taking the coins that this action entails; the big difference consists in the sums of impropriety that you can do against your opponents, i.e. inflict shoving, shrinking, stealing the fruit of their work and so on. Incredibly Bowser will also appear. Remember to make the connections right, and that the player who has the small plug attached to his Game Boy Advance is Player1. A must buy? Is Super Mario Advance a must buy? At the moment yes. You understood that the review leaked a certain enthusiasm. Looking at the list of products now available for the Game Boy Advance, Super Mario Bros. 2 is one of the best, which must also be owned for multiplayer modes; these are simple, maybe even obvious but fun (and that's what counts). Pros Cartridge saves are possible Technically flawless Nintendo has allowed us to replay a classic that was in danger of being forgotten (when is a collection of other titles coming soon?) Cons It's not a new product... It doesn't take advantage of the Game Boy's potential Advance We leave Mario is the most loved symbol of the Nintendo flagship: each new appearance of his defines new standards in terms of quality, versatility and innovation in its category. However, this cartridge has some surprises in store for us... In fact, we won't find a new episode of the saga inside, but two re-proposed and adapted classics: Super Mario Bros. 2 and the first Mario Bros. (in the Classic and Battle versions). Don't twist your mouth: I understand that everything can take the form of a sinister commercial operation that has allowed Nintendo to package a title by recycling dated products, but I invite you to approach the game without these preconceptions, because you will have some nice surprises. 6", "date": "2001-07-06", "grade": null}
