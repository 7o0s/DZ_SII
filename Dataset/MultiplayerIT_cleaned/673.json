The differences between the first and second chapter are really many. The first and most evident is the change of perspective: from shots in third person to fixed screens (like Alone in the Dark, so to speak) we have switched to a third person from the shoulders of the protagonist (like Tomb Raider, in short) making us lose to the title one of its main features (and most discussed as well as worse made) and making it decidedly more dynamic both in the action and in the fights. The new perspective (due to commercial choices or to the change of developer? Who can tell) renders really well, above all thanks to a well-made graphics engine that allows an excellent rendering of details and the creation of a convincing dark/medieval atmosphere , made up of cities destroyed by an incurable disease, islands of death that look just like islands of death (they are all the same in any game, you would spot them among a thousand other islands), rotting marshes full of thirsty leeches, look what of your blood; in short, the places of the fantasy imaginary have all been visited to a certain extent by adding some element out of context (like a level that seems to have come out of Alien), but never risking venturing down paths not traveled elsewhere. Even the enemies are the same as usual - ghouls, corrupted priests, angry Saracens, demons and many other beasts of a rather conventional nature - but they are particularly well done with smooth animation and a decent amount of detail. Paul, could you take off your armor before you go to bed? The control system of Knights of the Temple II is pretty standard: four buttons (or the left analog stick, in the case of the console versions) for movement, the mouse (or the right analog stick) to orientate the camera and to attack (with the left button you carry out a normal attack while with the right a more powerful attack in the console versions you will have to use two buttons), one button to parry, another to change weapons (you can fight hand-to-hand or opt for the 'use of a comfortable and powerful crossbow), yet another to jump and a couple to bring up the interfaces of special skills (there are magic skills and combat skills) plus others who will perform various tasks (opening inventory, consulting the map and other). We haven't eaten heavy food that we see everything green... only these swamps are full of poisonous junk! The game structure is very different from that of the previous chapter: there you had to face a series of levels in a linear sequence, here you can choose your destination among the known places and you will have to go back several times to visit the same places to succeed to complete all quests. Already; this KOTT II has a much more open structure than its predecessor, with various GDR veins. We will therefore have to talk to the characters who populate the various locations to obtain jobs to be carried out or information that will help us advance our difficult mission. By solving quests and killing enemies, you get experience points that can be used to improve your characteristics or various skills. Some quests can be tackled differently so as to determine the alignment of the protagonist (the classic good/evil dichotomy). Basically we will have many more things to do and objects to find than in the first chapter. KOTT II has a much more open structure than its predecessor Cross-platform The different versions of the game (PS2, Xbox and PC) are identical to each other except for the less refined graphics of the PS2 version (worse textures and some small framerate drops). Otherwise there are no differences to report. Instead, the fact that the game is completely localized in Italian (both text and speech) should be mentioned. The overall quality of the adaptation is really very good and does not regret the English voice actors. Damn bugs I can't slice them with my sword! Unfortunately Paul's armor overhaul didn't take out all the dents. This fine allegory serves to introduce the fact that there are flaws in the game and they are also very annoying. First, go to the hardware box to read about a bug that forced me to try the game on a different computer (obviously the problem didn't concern the console versions, which started without problems). It will be up to poor Paul; imitate Sam Fisher too! Speaking of gameplay problems, how can we fail to mention the artificial intelligence which, at times, touches the Lecciso level (a new standard of infinity)? It's not nice to see enemies running into a wall, in the direcopposite ion to the one we are in, trying to come upon us (it seems strange but it is so); just as it is not pleasant to walk a few steps from them, with a lighted torch in hand, and see them motionless unaware of our existence. In some cases we border on the ridiculous with enemies lurking in the shadows to ambush us who make us pass as if nothing had happened by taking our blows without saying a word (overexposure from a reality show?). Obviously we don't pretend that all videogame enemies are comparable in intelligence to those of F.E.A.R., but it would be nice to see monsters a little more reactive instead of these scarecrows who often don't seem to know what to do (we attack him or get slaughtered in cheerfulness?). it would be nice to see a little more reactive monsters instead of these scarecrows who often don't seem to know what to do Damn bugs I can't slice them with my sword! Another problem, not of secondary importance, derives from the bad balance of the combat system. Basically, tactics with fast but not very powerful weapons do not pay off and it is better to rely on big broadswords like Paul who, with a couple of well-aimed blows, can destroy enemies. Even making combos is of little use since attacking with your head down allows you to get out of most situations unscathed. Don't misunderstand, however, since the combat in KOTT II is a lot of fun provided you don't want to be too refined. Lastly, a few too many bugs should be reported, one of which was rather annoying which prevented me from continuing in the game forcing me to reload a rather old save (a couple of hours of game lost... in a nutshell). Box Hardware (PC version) The minimum requirements to play the game speak of a Pentium IV (or equivalent) at 1.5 GHz, 256 MB of RAM and a GeForce 3 or Ati Radeon 8500 graphics card with 64 MB (GeForce 4MX are not supported). The recommended requirements are, of course, higher: a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 (or equivalent), 512 MB RAM and a graphics card of the generation of GeForce FX 5900 and ATI Radon 9800 with 128 MB. The game was tested on a 3.4 GHz Pentium 4 with 2 GB RAM and a GeForce 7800 GT graphics card, resulting in a Blue Screen of Critical OS Error (system was recently reformatted, it's well optimized and normally does not cause any problems with games). It was then tested on a 2.8 GHz Athlon with 1 GB of RAM and a 128 MB GeForce FX 5900 XT card without giving any errors and was fluid in almost all occasions, even with the details set to the maximum allowed. Final comment Knights of the Temple II is a good action game with a few flaws too many. A few more weeks of development wouldn't have hurt him, since most of the problems encountered seem to be solvable with a few tweaks (especially the various bugs). Having said that, we can only recommend it to all those who love this type of setting and are looking for a light and well-made game that also has a good longevity. Pros Very well-kept atmosphere Improved significantly compared to the first chapter Good character growth system Cons Many bugs Artificial intelligence of enemies at an all-time low Combat system unbalanced Heroes you become! At the end of the first Knights of the Temple, Paul de Raque, grand master of the Templars, had obtained the remarkable result of defeating the evil that threatened the world... unfortunately the woman he loved (a certain Adele) had ended up in the arms of the devil with the 'obvious result of finding her in front of her, twenty years later (in Knights of the Temple II, in fact), in the guise of a kind of evil deity dressed in red like Santa Claus and celebrated in all the corrupted temples of the planet. What to do if you don't care about enjoying your retirement years and spending the money accumulated with years of militancy in the knights of the temple, buying yourself the latest model of two-handed sword, complete with a slot for memory cards so you can record the best blows brought to the head of some villain? Unfortunately Paul de Raque doesn't think so and, still strong and vigorous, decides to go in search of three artifacts of unspeakable power that will serve him to erase evil from the planet and, above all, to obtain a better sponsor for the next equestrian tournament of the templars. Leaving his castle on foot, he walks, fully harnessed, towards the first artifact until, having arrived in front of the vast sea... he goes back and asks Francesco de Lama (known cheater in online games), to accompany him with his ship, so you don't rust your armor swimming for miles.
