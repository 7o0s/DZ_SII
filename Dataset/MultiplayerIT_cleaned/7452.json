Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae is an exception, even more so when you look at the typically Japanese style that permeates the entire production. We're talking about a low-budget indie title, a game entirely based on combat that doesn't care to offer much more than hundreds of enemies to eliminate with swords. Curious? Better curb your enthusiasm... Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae is an independent action that comes directly from Japan! High Speed Katana Action Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae was developed by a small Japanese team called Zenith Blue and after the accolades obtained at Comiket 84, managed to get an English-language publication on Playism and climb the Steam Greenlight charts. The game, available only in digital format, is proposed as an action entirely based on the fights between the protagonist and the waves of enemies she has to face, as well as some bosses. We are talking about an essential and raw product, whose appeal is totally to be found in the battle system. The player controls Misa in conflict with Suzuka, another student. Both are in possession of a weapon with particular powers and we will have to face dozens of enemies by evolving our skills until we reach the archenemy and defeat her definitively. Despite some short cutscenes, the game is completely action-based that takes place in circular arenas. These are very similar to each other and do not offer any particular ideas. The only element that must interest us is represented by the waves of enemies, who occupy the space around us in large numbers, trying to surround us and eliminate us one group after another until leaving room for the clash with the boss on duty. Miniskirts vs giant robots Once the first game has started, we are welcomed by a graceful damsel with long black hair, in schoolgirl clothes, a miniskirt and knee-high socks. The look exudes ~Japaneseness~ from every pore, as well as the rest of the title after all. Being this a semi-amateur product we didn't expect much but some elements made us think again. If you have peeked at the vote at the bottom of the page you will have already guessed how the title has many limitations, but the heart of the game, or the battle system, works very well, keeping the entire playful experience standing on your shoulders. At first glance, the system appears essential, based on attacks with bare hands, which fill an energy bar, and others carried out using the katana, which instead consume the same indicator. A wise strategy mixes the two types of shots and results in combos of 50, 100 and more hits. And then there are the super moves, such as the definitive elimination of previously weakened enemies, which, once the blade is sheathed, explode by spraying digital blood. What has been described roughly summarizes the offer of the game, enriched by the possibility of acquiring experience points, distributed for each particularly well-chosen kill or attack, to be spent in the appropriate menu. Here we discover new skills to learn, so as to refine the techniques available. There aren't many, but the good calibration and flexibility of the battle system keep the fights fresh. Pad in hand, then, the game offers great satisfaction once you have learned the most advanced techniques, thanks to very rapid combos and pyrotechnic and very fast evolutions of the protagonist. Dodge and parry are two additional elements that enrich the possible tactics. They particularly help during boss fights, which are really challenging at times, though not always for the best of reasons. In fact, the design of the game does not appear to have been taken care of with particular attention, causing peaks of frustration alternating with all too simple phases. That's all? Trying Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae we went through three different phases. Initially the title seemed approximate, simplistic and uninteresting. Having started to become familiar with the combat system and having unlocked some skills, we have partly forgotten about the flat technical sector and the repetitiveness of the enemies, a bit few and the victim of indiscriminate cloning. Once you have passed some levels, however, the game shows all its limits, also caused by the means available to Zenith Blue. The arenas are all similar to each other, circular and devoid of any variant that is not aesthetic. The enemies, as mentioned, are too equal to each other, not only in the graphic rendering but also in the style of attack, a more serious factor because it flattens a gameplay that is already poor in ideas. The absence of a plot and any type of variant to the fights infiers further. The result is a product that feels more like a demonstration of the high quality of the battle system and animations of the protagonist than a real game. The technical sector does not help, acceptable and even pleasant in the polygonal models, with the two damsels rendered in an appreciable way, instead bad when you cast an eye on the seabed, which seem to come not from the last generation but from the era of the first Playstation. It's a real shame we didn't try harder, also because the animations are accurate, fluid and fast, appropriate to the very fast pace of the action. The problems are not only aesthetic, but can partially affect the gameplay. In particular, the camera manages to get stuck behind the most imposing enemies, completely blocking the view and making it impossible to get a clear idea of what is happening on the screen.", "date": "2013-11-26", "grade": "6.0"}
