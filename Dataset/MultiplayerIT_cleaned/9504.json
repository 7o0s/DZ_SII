Those over thirty may not pose the problem, but the little and evil Stewie Griffin does, and how. Did his visceral hatred for his mother and plans to conquer the world eventually cause resentment in the family? Well, it's a drawback that can be fixed: just dust off the old time machine and travel backwards to eliminate the cause of everything. But things don't go the right way, and so Stewie finds himself projected with Brian in different eras, and must do everything in his power to go back. Will he succeed? Family Guy: Time Warped is just the latest tie-in dedicated to ~Griffin~, the cartoon created by Seth McFarlane which has been delighting us for nine seasons now with its irreverent and politically incorrect humor. It is a platformer with a rather simple structure, which sees us explore fifteen stages in search of uranium bars (which constitute the character's vital energy, like in Sonic) and numerous other objects, all while gangs of henchmen or the fearsome Police of the Time try to put a spoke in the works. Each level can be replayed to attempt 100% completion and upload your results via Game Center, but above all to enjoy the entertaining animated sequences from the series, reproduced here in the original language (Time Warped is all in English, in fact). Time paradoxes The control system adopted by GLU sees two arrows on the left side of the touch screen that are used to move left or right, while on the other side appear two or three icons for actions, depending on the character. In addition to jumping and hitting with a baseball bat, Stewie can in fact perform a powerful uppercut, which however, given the slowness, is only useful when an opponent is stunned. Both he and Brian can pick up power-ups along the way that give him permanent extra abilities (Stewie can double jump, Brian can glide from great heights) or special equipment such as sawed-off shotguns, laser guns or even bottles of ipecac syrup: the latter causes enemies to vomit, turning them into living stepping stones to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. At the end of each ~day~ of the adventure there is a not very demanding boss fight, and after all the entire production is more like a nice tribute to Griffin fans, a title that offers decent entertainment for 79 cents and is capable of snatching much more than a smile. The bulk of the appeal of Family Guy: Time Warped is due to the technical realization, which tries to resume the particular style of the animated series and succeeds perfectly with regard to the characters, moreover equipped with a good number of animations. The scenarios, on the other hand, move between ups and downs: despite the good variety of locations, some are really repetitive in the background elements (see the far west) and the ideas in terms of level design appear few. The sound is very nice, with some sampled voices as well as with the entire opening theme (always in English) reproduced on the startup screen.
