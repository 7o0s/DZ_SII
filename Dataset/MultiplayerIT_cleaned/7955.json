After the good eFootball PES 2020, the Japanese developer has decided to take a sabbatical year to have the time necessary to transfer the game to the Unreal Engine and transform it from its foundations. The promise was that of a constantly changing game, able to combine the ability of the oriental studio in synthesizing the dynamics of the playing field with the latest market trends, which see free-to-play and live services as the dominant economic models , above all because they are extremely profitable. A few days after the release of FIFA 22, the stroke of genius: to publish a still incomplete version of the new eFootball on the market in order to try to steal some loyalists of the EA series thanks to this new business model. Too bad for two things: the first is that eFootball was broken not ~only~ in the game modes, but above all in the gameplay and in the stability of the graphics engine. The second is that the PES Team has once again demonstrated that they have biblical reaction times and it took us months to adjust the shot. The result is that many contracts with the most important partners are about to expire, that several pro players have found themselves forced to switch to the competition and that many players have moved away from the series, also because of the glorious PES there was nothing left, not even the title. However, on April 14, 2022, Konami finally released version 1.0.0 of eFootball 2022. It is, according to the developers, the game they wanted to create from the beginning, a product of sufficient quality to rival the history of the Pro Evolution Soccer/Winning Eleven series. It will be enough? Or is it too late? Find out in the eFootball 2022 version 1.0.0 review. What changes? After all these months it is important to underline what changes between the 0.9 and 1.0.0 versions of eFootball. As it is possible to understand from the size of the update, it changes a lot, if not everything. On the playing field, all the code has been revised both to eliminate the many glitches and bugs present in the past, and to make the actual game more enjoyable. In terms of modes, the Dream Team mode was introduced, i.e. eFootball's response to the success, especially economic, of FIFA Ultimate Team. So all right? Not really, because at the same time those few things that version 0.9 of the game had disappeared. Where are the online friendlies? Konami's decision-making processes are inscrutable. Dream Team and? An eFootball Dream Team The arrival of Dream Team should make all potential eFootball fans happy. It is, in fact, a mode that is finally more structured than the friendlies of version 0.9, designed to try to do what FUT does, but with a slightly different attitude. In other words, the fulcrum is always to build the dream team by drawing from the many champions in the game database. As always, it will be possible to decide the form to use or affect the tactics and attitude on the pitch of the players, so as to adapt the eleven to your needs. Unlike FUT, however, each card will not immediately express its potential. Once you have purchased a Pogba, for example, you will then have to spend experience points to train and improve him in the most useful way for the team's needs. Do you want him as an attacking midfielder? Better train dribbling and passing. Will you place him in front of the defense? Better to strengthen the physique and the ability to steal the balls. The new versions of each card will be able to count on particular strokes and abilities, in order to make them different from those already published, not only in terms of statistics, but also in terms of functionality on the field. This should prevent the ~arms race~ typical of EA which every year looks for an ever more imaginative way to offer ever stronger versions of the cards already published. eFootball 2022 The other difference is that, for the moment, there are no packs to buy, but the accumulated experience points are spent both to buy new champions and to upgrade them. Also in this case a move that has always been thought to avoid any possible connection with gambling. Experience points that can probably be purchased to speed up the team's growth, waving spectra from a pay-to-win model. The real inexplicable choice is to publish a complete version of the game after months of waiting... which is not complete! Starting with the Dream Team mode, everything is extremely limited, with several elements still blacked out and others that it is not known if they will ever arrive. For example, at launch you can only do afriendships between the Dream Teams. Friendlies, of course, that no longer give EXP to grow your team. Then, inexplicably, online friendlies using licensed teams disappeared. You will only be able to use the usual handful of teams in offline friendlies. Where are Argentina and Portugal, which are the national teams that can be used in the tutorial? Where is Serie B, the exclusive eFootball league? Where are the Seasons or online friendlies, the backbone of any self-respecting game? Where are the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that sounded? Maybe we're getting carried away. Gameplay Is eFootball 2022 kicking off? Even in terms of gameplay, Konami's work is polarizing. There is no denying the effort of the Japanese developer to fix his game both in terms of technology and in terms of gameplay. eFootball 2022 is undoubtedly a good soccer game; but with equal certainty we can say that it is far from being a perfect game and from being able to fully express its potential. Some things are commendable, such as the attempt to create a game based more on building in midfield than on running, having differentiated the types of shots available, creating a risk/reward mechanic for those made with the always pressed run, and trying to introduce inertia, to make the players' movements less neurasthenic. Observing the game, you no longer notice the bugs and imperfections that had become instant memes on the internet, such as CR7 in convulsions after a goal. Even the reading of the bodies is more precise, with more realistic and better calculated clashes in the game, something that is reflected in the refereeing, more punctual than in the past. But the impression is that the hands have gone back two years. In fact, let's review many of the limitations that existed in PES 2019, with very slow gameplay, in which it is impossible to shoot in range, with various forcings mainly linked to the lack of more punctual animations capable of covering a greater number of cases on a playground. In other words, the clashes are almost all the same and both the light and the heavy ones see the two protagonists fly several meters forward. Similarly, changes of direction take too much time mainly because the game has to close an animation before starting the next one and you can see that some types of shots are missing, especially those on the fly or before. In general, the feeling is that the game does not always respond in a timely manner to the commands given. Even more disarming are some artificial intelligence blunders. The low shot is very slow and it often happens that, before it reaches the recipient, the opponents have already repositioned themselves. Even worse, when this is intended for a distant teammate, even if the others could intervene, they don't, letting themselves be anticipated by the opponents, unable to intervene dynamically to what happens on the pitch. They all seem a little slow and taking a moment too long to react no matter what. eFootball 2022 Therefore, it is not eFootball 2022 that adapts to you, but you will have to adapt to the game. When you are able to always play with the players' bodies facing the ball, cleanly and without forcing, eFootball 2022 is able to offer good football, entertain and excite. If you go off these tracks, however, the game struggles even more than it should, more than we would have liked it to do so many months after the disastrous launch of September 30, 2021. A good leap forward The cover image of the eFootball 1.0.0 update From a technical point of view Konami has made a good leap forward. Corrected the macroscopic errors of version 0.9 and cleaned up the code from bugs and imperfections, a pleasant game emerges, with good polygonal modeling and some valuable animations. The stadiums and sound effects are also noteworthy, except for the walk animations and the commentary, which is very monotonous. The real weak point, as mentioned, is the variety of animations: if Konami will be able to enrich the movement baggage of the players during construction we will soon be able to have a good football game. Physics-wise, the ball moves well when it's off the pitch, but there's still too much friction when it's on the ground, making bass licks too cumbersome. The clashes between the players are good, even if the variation of animations is also low in this case, making physical contacts still too approximate and random. Online matchmaking seemed valid to us. It's not particularly fast, but once you find your opponent it allows you to have fairly stable gamesthe.", "date": "2022-04-15", "grade": "6.0"}
