{"name": "Battle Princess Madelyn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battle-princess-madelyn-recensione.html", "text": "The genesis of Battle Princess Madelyn is one of those able to collect thousands of views on social networks. Christopher Obritsch, semi-amateur programmer and obvious retro-gaming enthusiast, was playing Ghouls 'n Ghosts on the TV at home when his daughter Madelyn was enchanted by the first monster, the infamous Statue of Terror, so much so that she asked her father to repeat the level times. Amazed by so much involvement, Chris decided to create a game that traced the same mechanics of the Capcom platform and that featured his beloved eldest daughter. He didn't lack experience, in fact his curriculum includes, in 2014, the little-known Insanity's Blade, another retro platformer; it was finances that gasped. To carry out his idea, he set up a Kickstarter campaign that went very well and reached, in fact, about four times the 60,000 Canadian dollars requested. The Battle Princess Madelyn project after taking off is now ready, in all its glorious low definition for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Switch (while the versions for Vita and Wii U should arrive in 2019). Platformer in 240p Before starting the review it is necessary to take a step back, in particular in 1985 when Ghosts 'n Goblins was released for cabinets, a platformer produced by Capcom which was subsequently converted for a multitude of platforms including ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Atari ST. The sequel, the aforementioned Ghouls 'n Ghosts (1988), enjoyed considerable commercial success so as to give life to a spin-off for Game Boy (Gargoyle's Quest, 1990) and a highly appreciated Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts for Super Nintendo in 1991. In this saga the player takes control of the knight Arthur and must move through levels populated by skeletons, zombies and numerous other types of monsters, to save the princess Prin Prin and her kingdom from the paws of the evil Lucifer. The series continues between ups and downs until about ten years ago, when two episodes of Gold Knights for iOS were released, but by now the world had evolved and the appeal of two-dimensional titles had completely diminished. Battle Princess Madelyn starts from a slightly different point of view (after all, the protagonist, despite little Maddy's perplexities, is a girl), but in the end the task is the same: to defeat a wicked evil wizard who has kidnapped the family of the princess and killed her dog Fritz, who had thrown himself in defense of his masters. If you are close to forty the game mechanics should not surprise you at all and indeed, you will seem to have reinserted the cartridge into the SNES. Madelyn starts protected by a simple dressing gown and with the only possibility of making small jumps; she is armed with a spear barely capable of taking out any carnivorous plant or skeleton and is accompanied by her bodyguard. After a quarter of an hour spent jumping and ~blasting~ (you forgot it, tell the truth) enemies, you enter the room of the first boss, a pretty easy skeleton after all. All this happens by selecting the story mode: it is probably the most interesting one because it is enriched with secondary quests given by non-player characters whose completion is rewarded with gadgets; there is also a blacksmith who can upgrade Maddy's weapons. In this variant there are influences from metroidvania: some areas are not initially accessible, but only after obtaining special skills or keys. In addition, the difficulty is lower than the arcade version which has more ~compressed~ levels to be completed simply by continuing from the left to the right of the screen. Here the princess immediately leaves without limitations and meets more numerous and difficult enemies. Coordination and exploration are the two keys to understanding any self-respecting platformer, and Battle Princess Madelyn is no exception. The princess can only be ~touched~ once by the monsters, in which case she is rejected and remains invulnerable for a few moments; a further contact, however, makes her lose one of the four lives with which the game begins. Once the counter has been reset, it starts again from the last checkpoint, having however preserved any objects that have been collected previously (in story mode). The level of challenge is high due to a continuous respawn of enemies and jumps to be performed to the millimeter in order to successfully reach the adjacent platform. The movements are made even more complicated by the presence of traps and pitfalls that require excellent reflexes and a remarkable mastery of one's reactions. Furthermore, more often than not, you die just to try to discover the structure of the level, where of course pas aboundsecret essays and areas that can be reached with the strict practice of trial and error. There is a good variety of monsters, each with its own behavior and health level: some attack from below, others from higher positions, still others appear from behind the player. The apex is reached in the clash with the final bosses who, as in the best tradition, can only be defeated by knowing their weak point. To take them out Madelyn can rely on increasingly powerful weapons and armor that is embellished in the continuation of the story, as well as of course the dog Fritzy, which can be unleashed as if it were a special move. In story mode you can choose which offensive tools to use, also changing them during combat, while in arcade mode you can only hold one weapon at a time. Retro style If the Casual Bit Games title had been released in '92 it would have been a killer application for 16-bit consoles, but even today it manages to make a dirty impression. Of course, you have to come to terms with a pixel art that is bloody especially on 2K and UHD monitors (in these cases we recommend playing it in a window, perhaps at 1280x720), but which is embellished with a series of effects that at the time would have been difficult to implementable, such as the reflections on the water, the trees that move, the rain that rages. The backgrounds have been created with great attention to detail and the enemies are also well characterized. The audio system is of excellent workmanship: the soundtrack deserves a mention in particular, which can be activated both in orchestral and midi style. Longevity is valid: the story mode will keep you busy for at least ten hours, but be prepared for moments of frustration linked above all to the control system and an unusual level of difficulty by current standards. We used the Xbox 360 joypad for Windows, but the ideal would be to have the Super Nintendo or Mega Drive one.", "date": "2018-12-06", "grade": "6.5"}
