{"name": "Richard Burns Rally", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/richard-burns-rally-2.html", "text": "Never give up Being able to describe the game mechanics adopted in Richard Burns Rally represents a more difficult intention than one might think, simply for one reason: the SCi production touches completely unknown peaks of realism in the genre of rally games on consoles, so much so that able to displace even the most ardent lover of the discipline: WRC and the aforementioned Colin Mc Rae are, in comparison, games for young ladies. From the outset, the intent of the Warthog team is clear: to offer the most faithful rally experience to reality ever created. Precisely for this reason, an entire section called ~rally school~ was created, made up of about 20 tests intended to instill in the player the rudiments of the trade but, above all, to present the driving model and the control system in the most progressive way possible. adopted game. Skipping this exercise to immediately jump on the track is probably the most wrong thing you can do: quite simply, you would end up throwing the pad on the ground and the DVD out the window after no more than 2 minutes, guaranteed. The cars available, initially only three but destined to reach ten once the rest are unlocked, are all official with faithful replica liveries of those used in competitions. The customization phase is overwhelming, especially bearing in mind the scarce handful of settings present in most titles of the genre, such as WRC. We are talking about the possibility of touching practically every variable on which it is possible to intervene, with real and tangible repercussions on the behavior of the car. But it is once he takes the wheel in hand that Richard Burns Rally reveals his nature in the best way (or worst depending on your point of view). We sincerely doubt that anyone, during the first game sessions, will be able to conclude even one stage with good results and the car still intact; yes, Warthog Fatigue really is THAT hard. Playing Richard Burns Rally means being willing to face an uncompromising title, which does not forgive the slightest mistake and which requires the player a dedication, attention and patience that, we are sure, only a few will be willing to grant him. The physics of the cars is excellent, and their behavior responds at all times in exactly the way it would respond in reality: taking a curve with just a few kmh too much means a nice off-piste in the best of cases, just as exaggerating with the brake cannot nothing but lead to loss of control with all that goes with it. The damages deserve a separate discussion, real protagonists within the racing economy and perfectly capable of putting an end to their high-ranking ambitions at any time; hitting a tree or a low wall or a boulder simply means the race is over. But in the same way the glass can break, the bodywork be dented, the suspension damaged, the wheels leave their seat and so on, all perfectly in relation to the entity and the area of impact. Drive carefully Alongside the hyper-realistic management of the car's physics and damage, Richard Burns Rally also features an excellent level of interaction with the settings: for example, hitting a fence does not cause the car to stop unbearably, as in most of titles of the kind, but on the contrary produces the collapse of the fence itself in the area where the car impacted. The behavior of the spectators is also interesting, to whom you can ask for help in the event of rollovers or in general finding yourself unable to get back on track: in fact, for the price of a few seconds, a group of robust enthusiasts will get the car back on track. But that's not all: passing in the middle of the vegetation, the possibility of colliding with animals or birds must also be taken into account. In all, 36 tracks are available, set in the locations visited by the world championship, with stages of variable length but on average around 4-5 minutes. In the same way, the implementation of variable weather conditions is very interesting: before starting a stage, in fact, you will be informed of the state of the weather with forecasts on its evolution expressed as a percentage. In other words: starting off on dry tires and finding yourself halfway under a downpour is certainly not ideal for aspiring to the top rankings Also from a graphic point of view, Richard Burns Rally is a product that is difficult to evaluate: the desire to creating settings as close to reality as possible has undoubtedly been successful. The use of colors, the modeling and more generally the ~feeling~ of theslopes is extremely believable, as are the effects related to the raising of dust or splashes of water. But at the same time the overall cleanliness is certainly not impeccable as is the frame rate, especially when using the external view - however not recommended given the realistic nature of the product -. On the other hand, the bad-clipping phenomena are extremely limited and never annoying, with a drawing distance that is certainly very valid. The sound is excellent, especially as regards the different engine noises, which vary according to the gear engaged but also to any damage to the same. Comment Richard Burns Rally is, by far, the most elite of rally games. This statement could be enough to describe Warthog's effort, based on a realistic game model to the point of being able to be faced and digested only by a very small circle of discipline lovers. The line between fun, satisfaction and frustration is in fact all too sensitive, and the risk of collapsing miserably in the latter is extremely tangible for anyone who does not want to spend whole hours just learning how to set the curves. But what remains for the brave willing to make such sacrifices is a certainly unique title, which sets new standards in the field of rally simulations and which proves to be a well-finished product of excellent value in practically every aspect. A game to love madly or to hate blindly, with no in-between. Pros: Driving model with absolute realism One of a kind, and really cared for from every point of view Satisfying like few others Cons: Unapproachable for many Valid graphics but not free from defects Very long uploads Despite the interest practically confined to European soil alone, the vein of rally games has continued to churn out titles with good regularity since the days of Sega Rally and the first Colin Mc Rae, real starting points and sources of inspiration. Over the years, the genre in question has always markedly offered titles based on two extremely different approaches, i.e. focusing more on the realistic and simulative aspect or, on the contrary, putting these characteristics into the background by preferring extremely immediate arcade mechanics. A few weeks after the release of Rallisport Challenge 2, the last cornerstone of the more ~jaunty~ approach, this Richard Burns Rally appears without too much fanfare, openly at the opposite extreme to the Digital Illusions title. A joy for hard-core rally drivers?", "date": "2004-07-16", "grade": null}
