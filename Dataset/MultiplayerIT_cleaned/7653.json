You don't even need to think about it: the VS, or Vital Suit, if you prefer. We are talking about mechs that are not huge in terms of size but endowed with incredible capabilities, from the reactors that allow them to jump and shoot to an arsenal of unprecedented power, modular, which alternates miniguns and missile launchers to be unloaded on the fearsome Akrid or on other robots, those possibly controlled by soldiers belonging to opposing factions to ours. The gameplay of the first and second episodes from this point of view were very similar, with a fast pace, frantic stages and incredible boss fights. Of course, the differences were instead clearly visible in the structure, with Lost Planet 2 which in fact renounced a precise narrative direction in favor of an experimental approach which, however, was not appreciated by the fans, deprived of a real protagonist after becoming attached to Wayne. We don't know what Capcom thought when it decided to produce Lost Planet 3 and to entrust its development to the western Spark Unlimited team, not even so renowned (they are the authors of the mediocre Legendary, so to speak). Surely there was the desire to change the cards on the table, and not a little. So new talents at work, new ideas, a new engine (no longer the MT Framework 2.0, replaced by the Unreal Engine 3) and a new beginning for the series also on the narrative front, with a prequel set thirty years before the events of the original Lost Planet, therefore on the planet EDN III still completely covered by ice, never so inhospitable. Lost Planet 3 has nothing to do with Lost Planet, but it's still a captivating shooter The cardboard suitcase Jim Peyton, the protagonist of Lost Planet 3, is a skilled Rig pilot who decides to work for NEVEC on EDN III in order to ensure a future for his wife and son, who remained on Earth. The story actually takes place in flashbacks, and right from the start you realize that the developers have really invested a lot in this aspect of the production, which boasts a cinematic level script, with an excellent characterization of the characters (from Peyton himself, who exchanges video messages with his lonely wife, to his caffeine-addicted ~trusted mechanic~, from the researcher who asks him to collect samples to the doctor who seems mad from spending too much time alone in the frozen lands), elements which is not easy to find in a video game. The enjoyment of the plot is further enhanced by one of the best dubbing in Italian we have ever heard in a game, also of cinematic level, with a cast of extraordinary quality, led by Alessio Cigliano (the voice of Shane Vendrell in ~The Shield~ among others). Many pieces of the Lost Planet puzzle find a place in the dialogues, for example the fact that the Rigs cannot mount weapons due to a ~contractual issue~ with NEVEC and must therefore defend themselves from the Akrid attack with drills and hooks. But exactly, what are Rigs? These are ten meters high work robots, therefore definitely bigger than the VS we were used to. We could consider them precursors, the point is that their introduction implies a substantial change in the nature of the experience, which abandons the frenzy and the spectacular we mentioned at the beginning - the fundamental traits of Lost Planet - in favor of an approach in which the robot is not the protagonist of the action but a mere tool, fascinating for its size and its brute strength (even more so after a certain Pacific Rim has been released in cinemas), but it is not the war machine armed to the teeth that fans of the series have come to expect. And therefore, Lost Planet 3 is no longer Lost Planet. Take a moment to digest this concept. Xbox 360 goals The fifty objectives included in Lost Planet 3 alternate basic actions (the first modification of the weapon, the first log collected, the first online match won) to more complex ones, which clearly give a greater amount of gamerpoints. We therefore range from completing the game to winning a certain number of multiplayer games, from eliminating a certain amount of Akrid to achieving specific objectives according to the plot. Dead space Was it really a change of this magnitude that Capcom wanted? Whatever the answer to this question, the reality is quite clear: those who expected a proper sequel from Lost Planet 3 (ok, despite being a prequel) will be disappointed. There are no VS, there are no sensational fights based on missiles, grenades and bursts of machine guns, there are not even characters who manage to jump from a roeach other thanks to a particularly efficient grappling hook (which is also present here, but in a less ~extreme~ version). In addition, the fights aboard the impressive Rig (whose control implies the obligatory passage to the first person view) are a disappointment, as they are based in most cases on timing and ~quick time events~ rather than on the ability to unleash powerful metal cartons or use the huge drill mounted in the right arm of the robot. As we said, in the game our giant friend is just a tool, given that in reality the gameplay revolves around Jim and the ~third person shooter~ sequences that see him as the protagonist, in a mix of moments that closely resemble Dead Space 3 (audiologs are there too!) and Gears of War: Judgment, the latter for the ambush system and weapon management in relation to controls. At first, the solutions adopted by the developers leave us a bit dumbfounded, but the aforementioned quality of the plot, screenplay and dubbing give us a substantial piece, ferrying us towards a central part in which new characters and twists begin to emerge, along with more challenging shooter sections, also thanks to the simultaneous improvement of the arsenal at our disposal and the assimilation of a mission system inspired by sandboxes to offer us main and secondary quests, to be tackled in the order we prefer to increase credits and therefore buy more weapons, upgrades and so on. The playful system is supported by well-made graphics, albeit with some less brilliant aspects: first of all, the design of Jim himself, probably the least inspired character among all those present in the cast, with a drinker's face which would have benefited a few wrinkles for a minimum of charisma (fortunately Cigliano is there to give it a bit of character); secondly the presence of drops in the frame rate rather evident in the most agitated situations. We liked the musical accompaniment, with the nice expedient of the songs that the wife of the protagonist sends to her husband and which cheer up the missions aboard the Rig (the effect of the stereo that continues to play when we get off the robot is also nice). but also and above all with original themes that underline the intensity of certain moments.", "date": "2013-08-28", "grade": "7.0"}
