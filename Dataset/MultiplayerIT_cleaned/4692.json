It is worth clarifying immediately, for those who feel a little confused, that Monster Hunter Stories is a spin-off of the famous Capcom franchise: the last chapter to be released in chronological order on the Nintendo portable console - and later on Switch - it is Monster Hunter XX, however, and that is the sequel to Monster Hunter Generations that will probably never see the light in the West. Monster Hunter Stories is in fact something completely different, but the developer Marvelous (the same as Senran Kagura, to be clear) has succeeded in the very difficult task of transforming a series that has always been difficult to associate with a specific genre into an RPG for all ages without falling into the easiest trap of all: those who expected a kind of Pokmon with monsters were only partially right, because Monster Hunter Stories is much more than just a clone. The Knights of the Monsters If you have read our previous tried or even just played the demo, at this point you will know that the plot in Monster Hunter Stories plays a very important role: after all it is a real JRPG, but sincerely we feared that, after the introduction in which our friend Cheval loses his mother in a tragic accident, the focus would have shifted to finding new monsters - indeed, monstie! - to tame and ride, in pure Pokmon style. In reality, the story flows quite smoothly and unpredictably. After becoming a real Rider, our alter ego embarks on a journey to discover the world, in the hope of also finding a remedy for the Black Scourge that is corrupting the monsters, ruining the idyllic relationship they have always had with the villagers of Hakum. The adventure reserves many surprises, also because at a certain point it takes a really interesting turn and focuses on the various supporting characters, starting with the bizarre Nabirou. Naturally, it is a story designed above all for a young audience who, however, a bit like Pokmon or Yo-kai Watch, are able to convey important messages about the meaning of life and respect for nature. The contradiction lies in the fact that the Riders prefer to tame the monsters and ride them instead of killing them, yet we will make a real massacre during the thirty hours it takes to complete the main missions. The side missions, completely optional, practically double the duration of the game and fit well into the overall structure. The request board is a mandatory stop every time you return to the city, but often it will be the various inhabitants who show off a nice exclamation mark above their heads, rewarding us with money, consumable items, recipes or new skills to use in combat. Unfortunately, the distribution of secondary missions is not exactly organic and it soon becomes necessary to revisit the population centers each time the story progresses to find out if in the meantime we have unlocked new missions without knowing it. The Gattovana system, however, comes to our aid allowing us to move easily to any part of the world, as long as we have first visited it by unlocking the relative kiosk. In this sense, Monster Hunter Stories is a JRPG designed in an intelligent way: it offers a classic structure that we have seen and over-seen, but it does so with some simple tricks that rejuvenate it without distorting it. Scissors, paper and Rathalos Monster Hunter Stories' turn-based combat system is all based on a kind of Chinese morra but, for better or for worse, it offers much more than it might seem in the first minutes of the game. Our Rider takes the field together with the ~monstie~ (a play on words between ~monster~ and ~beasts~, i.e. best friend) that we have selected as the main one in our team made up of up to five monsters. During our turn, therefore, we directly control our alter ego, choosing whether to change monstie, use a consumable item, take advantage of some special ability or attack by choosing between three types of shots: speed, power and technique. Fast attacks beat powerful ones, powerful attacks technical ones and technical ones beat fast ones: this means that if we attack each other with the target, whoever wins in the Chinese pen attacks first and prevents the other from scoring a hit. Our monstie thinks a little differently, though. We can order him to use a specific skill, consuming the Bond points charged during the fight, but it is the intellectartificial intelligence to decide how to attack. It is very important to decide who to cure and when with herbs or potions, for example, and in the advanced stages of the game all those objects that could never be missing in a hunter's bag in real Monster Hunters become very useful: smoke bombs, paralysis bombs, antidotes, mixtures and so on. The Rider can equip a suit (made up of a single piece, fortunately) and a weapon, purchasing them and subsequently upgrading them with the materials collected by defeating enemies or exploring the various areas. However, there are only four weapons (sword and shield, broadsword, hammer and hunting horn) and despite the plethora of skills that distinguish them, the focus soon shifts almost entirely from the Rider to the monstie: our role at a certain point becomes above all support and it is our monstrous friends who really fight the enemies. From this point of view, Monster Hunter Stories is a game that misleads. At first it seems easy, intuitive. There is not even the Game Over: once the three hearts of the Rider are exhausted, it simply starts again from the last checkpoint which, usually, is just before the fight with a boss. Despite this, we are talking about Monster Hunter and, in this sense, Marvelous has really worked a magic. Facing a boss soon becomes an exercise preceded by a preparation phase reminiscent of real Monster Hunters: we need to understand what we are dealing with, perhaps by studying its data in the Monstropedia, and decide not only which weapons to equip based on skills we will need, but also what to put in the bag since we have a limited number of spaces. Furthermore, the choice of monsters to fight with is absolutely fundamental because each monster is more or less weak or resistant to certain elements. So far everything is quite logical, but it is when the management of eggs and genes takes over that Monster Hunter Stories demonstrates its true depth. You can't make an omelette... Each monster that we can ride during our wanderings has different environmental skills. Some simply show us enemies or resources on the map, others can jump or climb, still others break through walls or move underground. The discovery of new monsters unlocks passages or areas in which they could not enter previously, inviting us to revisit some areas that seemed to have nothing more to say but which perhaps hide secrets such as the hundred poogies to find. Another reason for wandering around several times, however, lies in the dens. These caves appear at random points on the map and connect us to small dungeons that are very similar to each other where monsters lay their eggs. Collected an egg, just take a few steps to get out and run to the stable, where we can hatch it. Monster Hunter Stories has a hundred monsters that we can ride and each of them is born of a certain rarity, which affects its statistics and its effectiveness in combat. The search for the rare lairs and the best eggs, while completely optional, is one of the funnest parts of the game, also because the Shamanic Ritual that is unlocked a few hours after starting the adventure further layers the experience. Each monster, in fact, is born with a random grid of passive abilities or bonuses and the Shamanic Ritual allows us to combine the genes of two monsters by sacrificing the second: its grid overlaps that of the first, increasing or replacing its abilities, and if we manage to line up genes of the same color in the resulting grid, then the monster's capabilities will further increase. Considering that it is also possible to use various objects to micromanage genes, it is easy to understand that Monster Hunter Stories is a game particularly suitable for lovers of customization, those who will be able to squeeze every tiny mechanic to overcome the most difficult challenges before and after completing the history. Behind its delightful cartoon style, the Marvelous and Capcom title therefore hides an unthinkable depth. We spent hours looking for the best eggs, combining genes and monsters, visiting and revisiting each area, and it must be admitted that the randomness that affects the appearance of the dens, and the eggs hidden inside them, can sometimes be a little frustrating. Fortunately, it is not necessary to delve into this aspect of the game obsessively, but some bosses can be really tough, especially when the difficulty rises a hair more abruptly in the middle of the game, and the best solution is to prepare better, not to charge headlong. In this sense, the Japanese developer has been able to perfectly capture the spirit of the mother series not only in the minutiae del gameplay, but also using music, sound effects and animations that continually recall it. Yes, Monster Hunter Stories is a very different game, to look at, but also one of the best we've seen running on Nintendo 3DS: the cel shading is absolutely spectacular, net of an aliasing that dirty the image a little especially if you activate the excellent three-dimensional effect and some small drop in frame rate in the most elaborate areas such as the Strada in Fiore on the Vette della Primavera, a grove where the wind lifts the cherry petals all around us, overlooking the lake above which the huge city of Gildegarn. In these complex and spectacular scenarios it can happen that the game stumbles, but it rarely happens and it doesn't bother anyone. During the fights, however, we have not encountered any problems even when our heroes are unleashed in pyrotechnic special combined attacks, not to mention that it is possible to accelerate up to three times the speed of the clashes.", "date": "2017-09-07", "grade": "9.0"}
