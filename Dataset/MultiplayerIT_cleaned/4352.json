The historic producer Toshihiro Nagoshi had in fact revealed that the sixth chapter would have been the final one for the Kazuma Kiryu saga, and that just to honor such an important appointment, the development team had seen fit to design the game specifically for PlayStation 4, avoiding the limitations of a cross-gen design that even with Yakuza 0 had worked flawlessly, giving us a technical sector characterized by an extraordinary care and quality of the assets, also thanks to a frame rate firmly anchored to sixty frames per second. We were talking about expectations: after the structural richness of Yakuza 5, which literally squeezed the capabilities of PlayStation 3 by putting five different protagonists on the table, as many scenarios and unpublished situations, it was reasonable to expect that the debut episode on the current Sony flagship console pushed the franchise even further. Well, let's try to clarify a fundamental point right away: Yakuza 6: The Song of Life is truly an excellent title and will undoubtedly win the favor of fans, but it is not the extraordinary synthesis we expected. Wanting to hazard a musical comparison (after all, the subtitle of the game allows it), SEGA's latest effort is like a catchy, radio song, but which does not go beyond the traditional verse and chorus sequence, renouncing variations on the theme and even to the ~special~. Stories of fathers and sons Obviously we do not intend to reveal too much about the plot of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, so we will limit ourselves to talking about the already known aspects of Kazuma Kiryu's new adventure, which takes place about three years after the events of the fifth chapter. Initially busy managing the Okinawa orphanage, young Haruka decides to leave when she realizes that her past as an idol could jeopardize the future of her friends, all while Kazuma is in prison, determined to clear his name once and for all. all from ties to the Japanese underworld. The girl reappears in Kamurocho, but in an unexpected way: she is hit by a car whose driver doesn't stop to help, sacrificing herself to protect her son, little Haruto. When Kazuma gets out of prison, this is the scenario he's faced with: the shattered dream of a happy life with his little friends, the urgency to return to the Tokyo district that was the backdrop for the most complicated phases of his existence , sweet Haruka ended up in a coma from which she may not wake up, a little baby to take care of and a search for the culprits that will lead him to Onomichi, Hiroshima prefecture. There are many questions that the protagonist of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life will have to try to answer. Who is Haruto's father? What was Haruka doing in Kamurocho? Was it really an accident that saw her involved? How has the city he knew so well up until a few years ago changed, and how far has the conflict between the Chinese, Korean and Japanese mafia gone? Elements that intertwine in a broad and multifaceted plot, characterized as usual by an impeccable direction, an intense acting (in the now traditional mix of dialogues in Japanese and subtitles unfortunately only in English) and twists almost never called. which often and willingly revolve around the difficult relationship between fathers and sons, but which in their entirety we found less inspired and convincing than what we recently saw in the prequel, Yakuza 0. Of course, in that case there was the fascinating setting of end of the 80s to somewhat emphasize all aspects of the experience, but also from this point of view the speech made at the beginning is valid: considering the conclusive nature of The Song of Life, we would have expected a more coherent narrative structure in some breakers. The usual Yakuza? In many respects Yakuza 6: The Song of Life represents a return to the origins for the series, an episode heralding simplifications that aim above all at the return of the single playable character, Kazuma Kiryu, and at the introduction of a new map, that of Onomichi, which for many reasons cannot boast the attraction of the now well-known fictitious district of Kamurocho. In fact, we are talking about a provincial reality, in which there is a complete lack of convenience stores as well as any type of collateral activity other than small shops and restaurants, and which is not surprising even in terms of extension, presenting invisible walls.ili a little too early in the exploratory stage. There are very characteristic alleys, an equally typical shopping gallery and the area of the temples, which with its stairways takes us up to a hill from where it is possible to admire the coast; but, as mentioned, there are no functional aspects to enrich the structure other than the clan minigame. The latter is introduced quite quickly during the campaign and allows you to engage in strategic battles against JUSTIS, a group nominally born to counter petty crime but which in turn has transformed into a huge gang of thugs and corrupt men. Progressively unlocking new units, sometimes defeating them in normal street fights, our task in the minigame is to place new soldiers on the ground based on the available energy and watch them face the enemy troops semi-automatically, with only the possibility of activating special abilities that our captains are equipped with. Side activities in Kamurocho and Onomichi One of the hallmarks of the Yakuza series lies in the minigames and side activities available within the scenarios, and this new chapter is no exception. In addition to the traditional arcade classics (in this case OutRun, Super Hang-On, Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone), in the Kamurocho SEGA Clubs you can also try your hand at the full version of Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown and Puyo Puyo, both playable in local multiplayer and accessible from the main menu. As for other pastimes, mahjong, darts, battling center and karaoke are back, while two of the ~spiciest~ activities stand out: the first is the Hostess Club, a variant of the minigame seen in the aforementioned Yakuza 0 , but in which we will have to chat in first person with a girl, selecting from a set of cards the topic that we consider most effective to conquer her; the second is the live chat, with a nice mini-game made up of key sequences, to hit so that our charming interlocutor begins to undress: if we are good, we will be able to see her in a string bikini. And what about Onomichi? We will be able to play baseball games, try our hand at underwater fishing or carry Haruto around and try to interpret his expressions to rock and caress him when he starts crying. A well known song On the gameplay front, Yakuza 6: The Song of Life does not renew the classic formula of the series, which unfortunately is starting to feel the weight of the years. In fact, the rich sandbox of the game does nothing but show us where to go from time to time (with a single exception at the end, when we will be asked to solve a puzzle), inserting any collateral situations in these routes from point A to point B, first of all the now famous side quests. Some are linked to the previous episodes and will certainly bring a smile to longtime fans, others are completely new but move in a well-defined groove, without trying to shuffle the cards: dialogues are completed, answers are answered correctly (or even no, it doesn't seem to change much) a few questions and you end up fighting with the bad guys on duty. Added to this are the missions of the fictitious social media Troublr, created to report any problems of public order that we can offer to solve, in this case rescuing couples attacked by criminals, chasing thieves and pickpockets, and so on. The interesting thing about this ordinary administration lies in the attempt to enhance everything that is outlined, tying any action to the progression of the character: the matches in the SEGA Clubs, the sorties in the restaurants and, in practice, everything we do will increase the score of some categories from which to draw for the general enhancement of Kazuma, for the unlocking of new skills and moves, including the specials that take advantage of the scenario or weapons (that of the knife is very painful: the protagonist sticks it in the abdomen of the enemy and then throws a knee that pushes the blade even further) or the skills related to movement (primarily the duration of the stroke) and secondary activities. Pieces of a puzzle that seems to connect precisely with the challenge level of the campaign, avoiding turning us into unstoppable warriors until towards the end of the story, when that degree of skill will actually be necessary to get the better of the last, mangy opponents. Bring it on! Speaking of duels and skills, how does Yakuza 6: The Song of Life's combat system look like? The system is solid as always and manages to emphasize the impacts very well, a fundamental element because the clashes are reducedltino entertaining and do not get bored, not even at the hundredth chance meeting with a band of reckless. The layout is the one that fans of the series know well, with the Square for light blows, the Triangle for heavy ones and the specials, X to dodge or interact, Circle to grab and give life to different maneuvers (punches or throws, basically ). The left back button allows you to parry, the right one to activate the lock-on on a single opponent, while the left trigger centers the view and the right one activates, where available, the ~fury mode~. In this state, Kazuma automatically grabs the objects he finds within range to use them as weapons, but above all he can perform a devastating flurry of blows capable of inflicting huge damage even to the toughest enemies. Unfortunately, even on the combat system front, however, there is a conservative, almost defeatist attitude: after having successfully introduced the fighting styles with Yakuza 0, the developers have chosen this time not to follow up on that experiment and to remain anchored to a solution unified, effective but in some ways inadequate for certain situations. There is an abundance of resources to draw on to get the better of your opponents, it is true, but these mechanics often turn out to be too slow to really make a difference, forcing us in case of trouble to fall back on strategies such as ~ hit and run~ (running and flying kick, in practice), less spectacular but safer when there are so many enemies and it becomes impossible to get out of the brawl without suffering damage. Sure, the new physics system returns more realistic reactions as regards impacts and you will happen to fight even in the middle of commercial activities, but in the end it is about details that you will not always be able to appreciate. Playstation 4 trophies There are fifty-nine Trophies unlockable in Yakuza 6: The Song of Life. Given the nature of the game, as it was reasonable to expect, many achievements are linked to subquests and side activities, rewarding the desire to explore the scenario and take advantage of the many possibilities it offers, but there is no shortage of Trophies obtainable through simple progression within of the countryside. One last trip to Japan While on the one hand Onomichi's new setting is beautiful but not particularly significant, on the other Yakuza 6: The Song of Life offers a definitive vision, in terms of care and detail, of the fictitious district of Kamurocho. Those who have played the previous episodes will now know the streets of the area by heart, but they certainly will never have seen them so rich, lively and evocative; especially during the night, when the many luminous signs make up a show capable of triggering mixed feelings. The new version of the Dragon Engine manages this amount of data in a very convincing way, anchored at thirty frames per second on PlayStation 4 Pro, with few uncertainties and, above all, assets of indisputable quality: the jaggies and less brilliant elements can be counted on the fingers of one hand, giving us a visual sector of absolute excellence for the rest. And what about the cutscenes? Some are textbook combat cinema, intense and masterfully directed, with perfect timing and framing. The sound is no different, but there are practically certainties: the cast of Japanese voice actors of Yakuza has always proved their skill, and even this time there are no out of tune notes, the level remains high from the beginning to the end of the campaign , assisted by almost always excellent music, capable of underlining every type of situation in the best way, from the most lively to the most touching sequences.", "date": "2018-03-15", "grade": "8.4"}
