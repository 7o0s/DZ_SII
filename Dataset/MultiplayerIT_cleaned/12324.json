{"name": "Jetpac Refuelled - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jetpac-refuelled-recensione.html", "text": "Solid roots The substance of Jetpac, even in this new version, has remained almost unchanged. The 100 plus stages are divided into series of four, which start with a scheme in which you have to put the 3 pieces that make up the rocket back together and then fill up to take off. Every 4 levels, in fact, you change the spaceship model and you have to reassemble it before proceeding to collect the fuel that rains from the sky. The novelty of this re-edition, in addition to the already mentioned 2D graphics, but completely in high definition, is the introduction of two new gameplay elements, namely the bombs and the boosters for the astronaut's shot. With the first of these, the laser beam doubles and in addition to fire horizontally, it becomes possible to eliminate the enemies who attack us from above in a perfect vertical line. With the second, however, the radius is tripled, allowing us to clean even the lower floors more easily, with respect to the axis on which we are moving. The learning curve is rather soft and, with a minimum of effort, it is possible to reach more than half of the available diagrams (with two images and a theme to download as a surprise for the most tenacious ed), until things get done really complex with hundreds of sprites on screen, and with a thread of frustration that inevitably surfaces. Helping the player is the fact that it is possible to start playing from the last assembly level reached, without the obligation to start all over again every time. The fact remains that, from the sixtieth level onwards, things get really difficult and that only the most tenacious will still find the desire to continue, while the others will in all probability abandon after having unlocked most of the objectives. Multi Jetpacs A fun multiplayer mode has also been included in Refueled, even online. Basically, after deciding the time available to the two players, a fight ensues between the two to see who will be the first to rebuild the rocket and fill up to take off. Obviously, the fuel packets will be contested with bombs, which serve to make the opponent lose possession of the gasoline just enough to be able to steal it and bring it to his rocket. There is not much else and, although it is an innovation as fun as it is welcome, it is inevitable that its charm will fade after a few games on Xbox Live. The real challenge, therefore, remains linked to the single player, which is really very long in this edition, and to the old version of Jetpac with its 16 levels to be overcome without credits and with only three lives available. Truly an arduous undertaking! Goals 360 The 200 points of Jetpac Refueled are definitely within everyone's reach, especially if you are satisfied with taking a hundred, or those guaranteed by the achievement of a million points, or a certain number of levels or upgrades. The points for completing Refueled or the old Jetpac, on the other hand, will be the preserve of a few players, no doubt. Comment Jetpac, for the many proud owners of the Zx Spectrum, more than a real milestone, is the memory of the beginning of the life of a software house which, in those years, churned out one masterpiece after another. The charm of Refueled is reinvigorated by the good additions made, by the multiplayer and by the price of only 500 Microsoft Points, especially in relation to the general quality of the package. He will not have eternal life, given the repetitiveness of the action over the long term, but for this amount much more serious sins can be committed than the purchase of this very welcome return, above all in the hope that the other big names will also arrive. Pros: Attractive graphics Fair multiplayer Great price Cons: A bit repetitive In the long run frustrating In 1983, an English company called Ultimate Play The Game made its debut on the 16K Zx Spectrum. The debut game had the name of Jetpac and was essentially a clone of Defender which featured an astronaut as the protagonist, all intent on rebuilding his rocket with which to take off from the surface of an alien planet, once full of petrol. All this, of course, while dozens of aliens of the most improbable shapes tried to kill him, often succeeding without too many problems. It was a real success and it was only the first, among those that marked the history of that software house, which then called itself Rare and which has come down to the present day under the protective wing of Microsoft. Jetpac has returned to visit us from the Live Arcade stage, with a version called Refueled, in full high resolution!", "date": "2007-04-30", "grade": null}
