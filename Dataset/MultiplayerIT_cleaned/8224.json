Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask was actually one of the Nintendo 3DS launch titles in Japan over a year and a half ago, but the third act of the second trilogy is still in development so for once, don't we have to look with envy at fellow players from the Rising Sun. What fans of the series have been holding in their hands for a few days is on the one hand the umpteenth iteration of a granite formula in its consolidated manufacturing quality, on the other an episode that inevitably had to be squeezed out a little more to make changes that would justify the change of platform. In reality, as we will see shortly, it is more of a revised cosmetics and some cheeky ideas towards the finale, but given that Level-5 and Nintendo have no intention of going too far off the beaten path, there are still some value adjustments. Layton porn Old friends, in the case of Hershel Layton, mainly serve to get himself into trouble: when the sharp professor decides to open the letter sent to him by Angela Ledore, he certainly cannot imagine setting in motion the events that will lead him to the faithful Luke and Emmy in the middle of the desert, in the streets of wonderful Montedore. In eighteen years, the opulent urban center has evolved at a blazing speed, passing from a simple oasis to an elegant and lively city. Unfortunately the peace was shaken by the arrival of the mysterious Masked Gentleman and with him by disturbing events. The story fits into the canons of the series, mixing a light atmosphere and characters with high tension moments, once again resulting in an exciting one without having to resort to too strong tones. Therefore suitable for a very large user. Among other things, the narrative travels on two separate tracks with the first, in the contemporary world, immediately attributable to the Mask of Chaos while the second, a step back in time to Layton's youth, will have less predictable implications. Precisely this secondary block will be a real joy for the most ardent fans, as it allows us to delve into aspects of the life and personality of the professor so far kept hidden. To see who writes the events told in Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracles are not among those best orchestrated ever in the course of the series, but the familiarity that is established with the characters at least partially compensates for the shortcomings and a departure with the handbrake on. The habit of relying on entirely two-dimensional graphics has instead been upset so as to mix 2D, used above all for the cut scenes, and 3D, necessary to enable the stereoscopic effect. The result, with the exception of some non-tragic defects, is valid and does not make us regret what we have seen in the previous chapters. Among other things, since it is easier to produce animated scenes in three dimensions, several dialogues have been guaranteed greater dynamism and the exploration of the environments, which now takes place on the upper screen while directing the cursor with the nib pointed at the lower one, is enriched with some camera movement. They are all small adjustments, because in the end the experience does not change one iota: 150 puzzles accompany the analysis of the seabed, offering a challenge that is not too demanding but varied and pleasant. Coins to collect and Picarati points to accumulate are simple systems that return with their own load of familiarity and a decent sense of progression. There are the three unlockable mini-games along the way - rabbits to follow in their career as performers, shops to run, and robots to lead through increasingly complex paths - but they didn't hook us like they used to. Rather Nintendo has promised 365 extra puzzles, one a day for next year, so as soon as the initiative kicks off you'll likely want to turn on the console from time to time to see what the house has to offer. Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracles doesn't do very many experiments but, apart from a variant on horseback where you can control him while avoiding obstacles, which is not at all exciting, you come to an interesting section where Layton moves in real time from above, abandoning the semi-static screens in favor of an exploratory approach that would be worth exploring further in the future. If for the music we feel like making the usual note, that is, that they are beautiful but monotonous, it must be said that Nintendo has done another excellent job of localization despite often playing with words and the many characters encountered show different regilanguage and personalities.", "date": "2012-10-29", "grade": "8.5"}
