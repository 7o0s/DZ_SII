Already in our test, carried out a few months ago, we told you how the style of the Spiders title, published by Focus Entertainment, was really able to strike and involve from the first moment; today, in our review of Greedfall, we confirm that initial impression and tell you how difficult it is on PC and console to colonize an island that hides more than just a mystery. The narrative The background of Spiders was not the most reassuring, the previous works were all united by excellent ideas which, when tested, were lacking in terms of personality and bite. Greedfall certainly starts from some common problems with the past, such as the size of the team, which has remained unchanged, and the budget that financed it, certainly not triple A. Yet the title seems to be the result of the team's assimilation of mistakes of development, limited only by exogenous problems of a different nature. The first really big doubt that gripped us before the review lay in the solidity and caliber of the game's narrative. The mix between eighteenth century and fantasy was certainly fascinating, but how much and how this union could be created on granite foundations was yet to be discovered. Well, on balance Greedfall offers a solid narrative that branches out with a well-structured plot between main and secondary missions. The strength of the title is in the choice to opt for secondary missions that are not a mere filler, but which expand the background of the protagonists and which push the player to discover more about the characters and events. Despite everything, there are two well-marked narrative arcs leading the way: finding the cure for Malicore, a disease that infests Europe and especially Serne, your nation of origin, and managing the colonization of the island of Teer Frade between bloody civil wars and meticulous diplomatic actions. As you can guess, therefore, the narrative stratification is well structured with your base of operations, the city of New Serne, as the fulcrum from which everything branches off. Factions, conspiracies, deceptions, mythology, ancient gods and history will accompany the protagonist and his cousin Constantin on a journey to discover the unknown and themselves. Even on a stylistic level, Greedfall tries to propose a ~silent narrative~ that is consistent with what is proposed by the active plot: names and clothes, for example, fully draw from the classic conception of the colonial eighteenth with armor that recalls the Spanish and Portuguese Conquistadores, with some hats that draw inspiration from the British navy and capes that make one think of the French Musketeers. In Teer Frade instead, the native populations aesthetically different from any type of Indios, propose a social similarity with the native American populations: in fact they are proposed as subjugated by the desire for Western domination, usurped of the dominion of an island belonging to them ~by strangers with guns~. The combat system with tactical pause From a narrative point of view, therefore, Greedfall is solid, interesting, well structured and with several important themes addressed with the right mix between historical truthfulness and fiction. However, the nature of the Spiders title is not that of a graphic adventure, but of a western-style action RPG which must therefore possess an extremely solid combat and character growth system. Greedfall, we tell you right away, is not without its problems, but at the same time it offers solutions against these shortcomings as if, in a conscious way, those weaknesses were a ~small price to pay~. The basis of the combat system is simple: two melee and one ranged weapons, the ability to cast spells, one simple and one powerful strike, dodging, parrying and a ~fury~ strike as a bonus. The mechanisms are extremely classic and tested: you hit and dodge, while learning the enemy's attack pattern to make the most of their blind spots. The problems arise in the realization of all this: the woodiness of the characters is in fact very accentuated and often in combination with a not always excellent conformation of the battlefield you end up incurring some unexpected and not exactly wanted death. As we told you, however, Spiders offers a solution to all this by inserting the tactical pause. Being able to plan moves, issue orders in a thoughtful and reasoned manner and perform actions without pressing the keys on the pad allow the player to avoidsolve the above-mentioned problems by eliminating all the ~reflections~ which are then subject to the major influences of woodiness. Technical level and roster system As for the growth of the character and everything that surrounds the combat system, Greedfall offers several excellent ideas and some that can be reviewed. Your alter ego, created at the beginning of the game using a decent creation editor, will be fully customizable not only in terms of equipment but also in terms of skills and peculiarities. The initial choice on which attributes and talents to prefer will not be binding and you can therefore change your growth in progress. Basically this will be divided into skills, attributes and talents. The former will influence your way of playing, with bonuses and skills related to weapons and armor, while the attributes will affect your statistics such as strength, charisma, agility, altering which equipment and actions you can use and perform in the game. Finally, the talents will touch on some aspects such as the crafting of weapons or consumables or will act on magic. The role-playing aspect is a preponderant element in Greedfall: in fact, often using brute force will not be the wisest choice, while intimidating, bribing, persuading or threatening may be alternative solutions capable of offering you better and different results. All this will depend on your customization and therefore also the replayability benefits from these solutions, with entire quests that will be modified by your actions. Even the party of allies that you can bring with you will be aesthetically customizable, but the most important choice will concern your relationships with them. Talking to them, discovering their past and helping them when they ask will lead you where Greedfall wants, that is, in the great stratification of side missions that serve to expand the depth of the title. On the sidelines of the main actions remain all those RPG elements such as loot and crafting. Each weapon or armor found in the loot or bought from merchants will have different power and rarity; on these attributes, however, you can go and act through craftsmanship, or the possibility not only of creating but of modifying the equipment in question. Changing the hilt of swords or the pommel, modifying the material of the butt of arquebuses or flambergas, but also inserting armor parts or changing the material of a dress will affect your stats, but also the aesthetics of your character. An interesting combination, which expands the possibilities and the stratification of a game that focuses heavily on the role-playing side. Unfortunately, among the various notes to report there is also the technical level of the game. It's not an extremely visually lacking game, but the modest nature of the budget is noticeable in many cases, with textures that are not always in high quality and some polygonal models of secondary characters that are not well cared for. On the other hand, the quality of the inhabited centers and of the island of Teer Frade is superb, which really show a strong personality. Even the monsters you're going to face, especially on the island, will be very characteristic with the bosses at the top of the list for design and quality of workmanship. Margin note for ambient music and sounds, truly inspired and able to press the player at key moments.
