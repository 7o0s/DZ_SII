{"name": "Persona 5 Royal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/persona-5-royal-recensione.html", "text": "Before this review of Persona 5 Royal, the recurring question from readers was one and only: ~what the hell is Persona 5 Royal?~. For this reason, we believe it is right to start from the long-awaited answer. Persona 5 Royal is the definitive version of Persona 5, with new characters and confidants, story and gameplay refinements, a script that continues for a long third semester not included in the original game, and introducing new combat mechanics and a myriad of changes that (re)touch every single aspect of the already extraordinary Atlus adventure. There is also a second question that often comes up when discussing Persona 5 Royal, and it is equally interesting: ~couldn't they have made a DLC directly, instead of creating a new game sold at full price?~. The answer in this case is more complex: yes, distributing this version of the game through a DLC would have been technically possible, just as it would have been possible to offer a cheaper digital version dedicated to those who have already purchased a copy of the original game digitally . It is Atlus that has chosen not to do so, using the same strategy put into practice with the FES and Golden versions, conceptually similar to this Royal, for the third and fourth chapters of Persona. But this is not just a mere commercial choice. For Atlus, the care put into the development of all these improved versions is such that they deserve a market launch worthy of a totally new game, and in some ways we can't blame them... Gameplay and differences with Persona 5: Back to school After finishing Persona 5 in 2017, we didn't think that going back to the Shijin Academy benches again could be so fun and addictive, almost like it was the first time. The replayability of Persona is naturally part of its gameplay, which allows for totally different choices from those made in the first instance, but it is not only this that has given us the strength to retrace the game once again with the same original resourcefulness. The biggest differences between Persona 5 and this new Royal version can be read on any wiki, they are all on display among lists and planks drawn up over time by enthusiasts, but somehow they are all additions that one expects in a relaunch like this ; it is therefore no coincidence that for us who have already completed the adventure at the time of its original release, at the end of the great upheavals the many, many small improvements implemented practically everywhere proved to be more precious, and which made what was different which in the end is not different. For example, the beginning of the game in Persona 5 Royal is very similar to that of the original, but the myriad of microscopic devices make the experience much friendlier than in the past, which is especially useful for newbies, as well as much better paced. Persona 5 Royal flows much better from a narrative point of view but not only, given that even the dungeons can now count on some new gameplay superstructures that help make exploration, and related fights, more varied and fun than ever. For example, new shadows make their appearance which, if hit in the right way, can cause an explosion that will involve all the monsters present in combat, and new secret objects to locate and collect. Soon, the grappling hook will also be introduced, a new tool that will immediately prove to be very useful, both for exploring the different dungeons and for taking the most difficult opponents by surprise. Changes that also involve some of the bosses, which now include new moves to dodge and new weaknesses to track down, for a much more tactical gaming experience than previously. Characters and Pastimes: True True Ending Essential in making the game even more structured and full-bodied are the unpublished extras and the three new characters added: Kasumi Yoshizawa, Takuto Maruki and Jose. Kasumi is a very pretty girl who will join the Phantom Thieves as an active member, so also in battle; Takuto, on the other hand, is a psychologist who will arrive at Shinji Academy to help students after some traumatic events, and will prove to be a rather important confidant to hang out with in his spare time; the last character of a certain weight to debut in Persona 5 Royal is Jose, a very particular child from the world of shadows, and to whom we will be able to sell some special objects to receive equally important ones. Royal also introduces new locations to attend alone or with friends, while others already present have undergone changes in order to host new events. With Royal also come other pastimes, such as darts and billiards: the former allowsone to increase the effectiveness of a new choral move of the group, while the second to raise the possibility of inflicting critical attacks on enemies. Even at this juncture, there is no need to reveal all the new features, partly because we are sure that veterans of the game will prefer to discover them on their own, and secondly because the list would be completely useless to those who have never tried the original version , and for this reason they could not make comparisons. We want to spend a few words on the third new school semester, even if only to warn you that it will be necessary to bring a confidant to the maximum to be able to unlock it; if this does not happen, the game will end exactly where it ends in the classic Persona 5, and you will not be able to face the new dungeon included in Royal, nor learn all the backgroud on the genesis of Joker, the fighting version of our character who remains in the base game actually mostly in the shade. By tackling the third semester, it will also be possible to unlock two new endings: one negative and one positive, the latter a real ~true ending~. A new headquarters In Persona 5, the Phantom Thieves could gather to talk about their future plans in different locations, such as the school rooftop or the attic of the LeBlanc cafeteria; in Persona 5 Royal they will soon also be provided with a place in the world of shadows, or metaverse, to customize with paintings, music and statues related to our adventures, all to be unlocked through a new currency linked to collectibles to be found in dungeons, and to be delivered to Jose. This currency can also be used to play with the other Phantom Thieves in a fun card game that has all the qualities to charge another abundant dozen hours on an already very long game. Among many innovations, a subtle but substantial graphic upgrade could not be missing. Persona 5 was born as a cross-generational game, while Royal takes full advantage of the power of PlayStation 4 through a generous texture upgrade. On PS4 Pro it is possible to raise the resolution up to 4K (30fps...) and the difference will immediately appear clear, overwhelming, thanks to a truly impressive image sharpness and which, combined with new animations and other small but effective tricks , make this Persona 5 Royal truly a marvel, much more than it already was originally. It seems more and more to be in front of an interactive anime, at least until an anime really becomes one: the Atlus series very often makes use of cut-scenes of extraordinary quality and Persona 5 makes no difference, Persona 5 Royal also adds more new. In Italian, finally From now on, it is very probable that the classic version of Persona 5 will be easily found at bargain prices, turning into a point of reference for all those who, curious but never completely convinced, have never had the courage to invest their money in it. money needed to take it home at or near full price. It fits, it's a smart choice, but if you love the genre, and there are many chances that Persona 5 with its peculiar social mechanics is the perfect game for you, well don't be afraid to aim for the best of the best: you don't deserve nothing less than this gargantuan Royal edition. For all those who don't know English, the choice is even easier since Persona 5 Royal is the first Persona in the history of the series to boast texts completely translated into Italian (instead, you can choose between voices in English or Japanese). The localization is also done extremely well, except in a couple of situations (these at least those encountered in our game) and in the inexplicable desire to also translate the name of the Phantom Thieves which for obvious reasons could easily remain in English. A very important translation that of Persona 5, the lack of which at the time of the original release had even prompted me to make sacrosanct complaints to publishers and developers, something never done before and for a reason that is easily explained: Persona 5 touches on very important issues, but the narrative canvas that glues the different branches of its rich plot all converge on the incommunicability between young people and adults. You can't talk about generational barriers when your lack of translation is about to create another one; this problem has finally been solved and with the Royale edition, Persona 5 can finally gather all the heads suitable for its message in Italy too. Thanks to all those who made it possible because even though only the text has been translated, it's still a huge job, and on a genre that certainly doesn't guarantee easy sales. Role play What remains to be saidis all that was already written in the review of the original Persona 5. We are talking about a game that is already beautiful, the refinement of a formula born with Persona 3 and which in this fifth game reaches absolute qualitative peaks. There are those who will continue to prefer Persona 3, or Persona 4, but preferences are also dictated (above all?) by the attachment that everyone will build towards the different casts. Analyzing the last three games in depth (the first two Personas are more canonical JRPGs), there can be no doubts: Persona 5 is the one designed and built best, a gap that widens further with the Royale edition. One of Atlus's winning moves has been to take advantage of public advice to add rather than replace, so as not to create any kind of discontent. A perfect example of this philosophy can be found in the dungeons, which were previously only procedural and consequently sinned in characterization, but which are now divided into Castles and Mementos: Castles are built around the main enemies and have a structure designed to the millimeter , while the Memento has a procedural structure, and is used to level up at will and to ~steal~ the heart of secondary enemies. But Persona isn't just fighting: its great strength is made up of social links and the different activities that our character can carry out every day to improve his empathetic characteristics: it is necessary to study but it is an activity that leads to double the results when it is raining, it is essential to go out with friends but it is much better to do it also thinking about the feedback that a character will be able to give in battle, you can spend the evening watching TV series rented in a shop in Shibuya and you can organize Sunday outings with a group of friends tighter. Each action has repercussions on the growth and the different specializations to which our alter-ego can aim, and which can also be distorted and detached from the winning mathematics of a FAQ to bend to our natural affinities, so as to hang out only with those we like, so we can do whatever we feel like doing. There is this old diatribe, between fans of western and oriental role-playing games, about how correct it is to categorize the latter as role-playing games, because actually ~role-playing~ very little is played. Here, Persona 5 is one of the few JRPGs in which role-playing is not only possible, but it is also an essential element in the development of the character and the strategies he can adopt in battle. In this game, enjoy the rain sliding on the windows, sip the best coffee we've been able to make, visit seasonal fairs with friends, choose which film to go to the cinema or spend the evening in a completely different way , they are never trivial choices; as indeed it is not choosing in real life who to hang out with, or how to spend one's free time, a pity that we almost always realize it too late...", "date": "2020-03-17", "grade": "9.6"}
