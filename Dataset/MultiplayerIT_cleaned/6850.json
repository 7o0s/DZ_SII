We are not only talking about the ~three stories~ of the campaign, namely Nightmare in North Point, the Zodiac Tournament Pack and the Year of the Snake, but also all those packs that have enriched the ambitious United Front Games title with a series of new ~ outfit~, of cars, but also of moves, weapons, skills and various buffs. In short, a really full-bodied package, at the not exactly popular price (but not even at full price, to be honest) of  54.90. We don't want to get involved in the usual hackneyed question of the meaning of these operations, but we will try to understand whether playing or replaying Sleeping Dogs today is worth it, being well aware of its offer, its strengths and weaknesses. Lots of content for the Definitive Edition of Sleeping Dogs. Is it worth it? And the PC? If on consoles the price of Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is high, but commensurate with the amount of DLCs and the transition from the old to the new generation, we cannot say the same about the PC version, which is also sold at a lower price (29.99 ) compared to the full price of the original 2012 release, but undoubtedly much higher than what we would have paid if we had taken advantage of last spring's sale, i.e. 3.99, for the ~smooth~ version of the game. Obviously, to equalize the offer, we would have had to include all the DLCs by paying them individually or with a convenient 15 upgrade package which also includes the free (yesterday as today) Texture Pack HD for a definitive, um, visual experience. Consequently how much did you pay Sleeping dogs the first time? Full price or balance. If on balance, what balance? A nice swirl of prices that certainly mortifies the value of the offer of this Definitive Edition on PC. Important ambitions For those who have only connected now, Sleeping Dogs is a free roaming of the GTA, just to attach a label to it, set in a lively and credible Hong Kong, in which we take on the role of Wei Shen, an undercover cop, with the difficult task of dismantle the Triads. The work of United Front Games owes its debt to the many films set in the sordid world of the Chinese mafia, but obviously the direct reference is Infernal Affair, which perhaps most know through the American remake by Scorsese The Departed. An undercover cop is perfect for this genre of games since his double life, explored quite well with a mature and adult narrative that deeply dissects Wei Shen's ~split personality~, leads us to carry out cop missions and as a henchman, perfectly grafted into the full-bodied and functional growth path of the protagonist. This is therefore one of the strengths of the game that allowed us to develop our (anti) hero as we want. In fact, every action we take, every mission we complete, whether good or bad, increases our potential: by acting as a guardian of the law we become wizards in stealing cars, we disarm our adversaries smoothly, or we can access bullet time during gunfights, not to mention less recoil or more damage during car chases. On the contrary, as a mafioso, the skills to be unlocked are all focused on the combat system, such as more damage with or without white weapons or various resistances. The acquisition of new combos is done through the performance of missions given by the martial arts master that go through the recovery of different jade statues. We can undoubtedly define the combat as a nice plus of Sleeping Dogs, but at the same time a critical issue that cannot be overlooked. There are many moves, tailored to the various types of enemies, but often confusing in the execution methods with too similar combos. Pad in hand, the clashes are well choreographed, owing to those of Batman with the automatic counter-move, but in the long run, as Wei Shen's skills grow, they become all too easy and not very technical, also because there is the possibility of exploiting the environment for instant ~kill~, without forgetting that every car can generously provide us with a jack, with which we can easily thin out the opposing ranks. A real shame because looking at it ~from the outside~ the combat system could easily be mistaken for thisello of a finished fighting game, full of attacks and moves (to corroborate this hypothesis there is the DLC dedicated to the Zodiac Tournament), but even without having accumulated an exaggerated number of hours of play the clashes become decidedly mechanical, easy and not too much exciting. Without forgetting that the better you fight the more your opponents will be afraid of you, ~refraining from fighting~. Unfortunately, even the armed phases are decidedly forgettable: you shoot only when the mission requires it, the opponents' artificial intelligence does not sparkle, while the bullet time is an extra we didn't feel the need for. To close the range of ~customization~ of the protagonist there is also the fame, which increases above all by dedicating ourselves to the dozens of secondary missions, which pass from the classic assignments of escort and delivery to love stories, from the systematic destruction of drug dealing squares to karaoke, street racing and so on. The ~rewards~ are varied, from having a car always ready to increased statistics. Above all, the possibility of improving the effectiveness of the actual status upgrades with bonuses to damage and health stands out, which are obtained by gulping down green tea or fearsome street food, greatly facilitating survival around Hong Kong. Playstation 4 trophies Sleeping Dogs rewards the player with sixty trophies. They all relate to the various types of action that can be performed in the game, but also and above all to the level acquired and the number of Triad and Police missions carried out. There are also trophies related to the unlocks of the ~social~ part. Obviously the most coveted trophies are obtained by gradually completing all the missions, favors, races, extra jobs and investigations of the game. Nine are the trophies that are obtained with the DLC of the campaign, none particularly complicated, linked to the degree of completion of the ~mini~ stories Revised and corrected? Sleeping Dogs is rich in content, between main and secondary missions there is really a lot to play, all passing indiscriminately between a man of the Law and a man of the Triad. In this sense it would have been interesting if United Front Games had inserted a crossroads path, in which certain dramatic choices had precluded the carrying out of some missions, thus reaching different endings, but since the game requires us to do ~everything more ~ to grow Wei Shen is an understandable choice, even if a little forced on a narrative level. Speaking instead of the ~new~ contents, or the three DLCs, we would have liked to describe them as full-bodied but, alas, they can all be finished in less than two hours each and in the end they are frankly forgettable. However, United Front Games must be acknowledged for having proposed extra stories with an interesting starting point. In Nightmare in North Point there is the classic zombie/vampire apocalypse, declined however with reference to local folklore, therefore different from Walkind Dead and associates, immersing Hong Kong in a perennial bluish light. Chases and lots of fisticuffs with lots of portals to close, that's the nightmare at North Point. In Zodiac Tournament Pack we are instead from the parts of The 3 of Operation Dragon, the legendary film with the never too late Bruce Lee. Here the developers try the Tarantino-esque nostalgia operation complete with a ruined film effect to make the homage to the 1973 film even more obvious, but beyond a series of chases and encounters there is little to do, despite new clothes and new moves . Year of the Snake shares only the length with the other two stories, but takes us back to the streets dealing with a terrorist group and fortunately gave us the idea of being more varied and less focused on combat than the Nightmare and the Zodiac. But technically how are we? The switch to 1080p and a general optimization of the engine has made Hong Kong much more pleasant to look at, with an obviously greater detail (especially for the foreground elements) which fixes the problems a bit, but not entirely. poor detail and blur that plagued previous console versions. Today as yesterday, however, what is most striking about Sleeping Dogs is the representation of the city, very large, alive and vibrant, well built and not at all bare both in terms of traffic and pedestrians, and in terms of urban furniture, to the advantage of the credibility of staging a miniature Hong Kong really similar to the real one. It goes without saying that the old-gen cut is visible, but never too penalizing anyway. Ultimately, even if net of a higher resolution, more ~special effects~, and a physics now applied to more objects (at the price, however, of a frame rate that is not exactly granite) we cannot say that we findarch in the face of a bad game, but an ~old~ game polished for the new consoles. Obviously the leap with the old-gen versions is particularly appreciable, but compared to more recent titles that have enjoyed a definitive version, this is the one that (obviously) comes out with the most broken bones and that most shows its origins in the previous generation .", "date": "2014-10-10", "grade": "7.5"}
