The game is actually a sort of action-adventure, a little adventure and a lot of action. Your adventure begins at the Baggins house and you will be confronted by Gandalf the rest of the story you should know. In this first part you will be able to enjoy a splendid reconstruction of Hobbiton since you will be able to explore it far and wide to complete some small sub-quests (the only ones in the game) for the locals: you will thus be able to visit places only described in the book and not touched by the film such as the Sackville-Baggins house or the inn. Unfortunately this game is not a CRPG and therefore you will have to limit yourself to viewing the exterior, not being able to enter the various homes as you please. The rest of the game faithfully follows the progression of events that will take you to the banks of the river Anduin and to the end of the first book. In various junctures of the game you will be able to control other characters in addition to Frodo such as Aragorn and Gandalf. However, the game will still try to make you stay alone very often or at most in the company of another character. Which is a bit strange given that in the first book the company is always (or almost) complete, while in the game you will only see it reappear in the animated interludes. To the bridge! The three characters that you will have at your disposal have obviously different characteristics, Frodo for example, in addition to striking with his sword, will be able to throw stones (skill used in some situations, for example to distract some enemies, such as the black knights) and of course wear the ring. The ~unique~ was represented by a bar, called ~purity~ which depletes as you use the ring, to recharge later, and represents the influence that the ring has on you. You will not become ~evil~ but if the bar runs out, you will die. Frodo is also the only character capable of jumping. Aragorn, on the other hand, is the only one who can use the bow and is equipped with some special moves with his sword. Gandalf, of course, will be able to cast various spells, each of which is worth a certain number of ~spirit~ points. Don't worry, food and potions are quite common. However, if there is one thing very similar to the film and the possibility of inflicting the coup de grace on enemies when one of them is on the ground, not yet dead: your character will approach and kill him, impaling him with his hobbit stick or with his sword! However, some shortcomings in the game interface make themselves felt, such as the absence of a compass or a map, which will make you lose orientation many times and above all the absence of a reference to the energy left in the various enemies, a characteristic appreciated in this genre of games. And everyone will love me desperately! The game as a whole will have you trying to bring the ring to Mordor (incredible!), and once you leave Hobbiton the game will turn into a sort of 3D beat'em-up that will see you dealing with the various enemies that populate the middle ground: spiders, bows, goblins, orcs, trolls, to occasionally get to the classic ~boss~ (obviously a Nazgul, the Balrog, depending on the situation), all interspersed with the occasional activation of buttons and levers. Fortunately, to break the routine there will be countless animated interludes to better describe the development of the plot. Although the dialogues should faithfully follow those of the book (at least that's what I was told, for the original version), in the Italian version the dialogues seem much ~poorer~, not to mention the absolute lack of any attempt to give a minimum of intonation for various speeches. None of the voice actors (all of obvious cartoonish origins) recite with pathos, indeed it seems that they are all really reading. Such a pity. It's mine! It came to me! In conclusion, the Fellowship of the Ring is a fun game after all, with really nice graphics (the music is of excellent workmanship, but the absence of Howard Shore's soundtrack makes itself felt). Too bad for the shortcomings noted previously and for a not exactly high longevity (three afternoons were enough to finish it), which could make one reflect on its purchase. Pros Top notch graphics Based on the book Cons Not officially licensed for the movie Poor longevity Not terribly innovative One ring to rule them all.... Finally arrives on the PC, the first in a long line of games dedicated to the Lord of the Rings. This one in particular isn't the official Tie-Incial of the film, but enjoys a different license, and is in fact inspired by the books and represents a more or less timid attempt to take advantage of the notoriety that surrounds everything related to Middle-earth: Tolkien will probably be turning over in his grave. Clearly in this game the protagonists will not respect the likenesses of the actors for obvious rights reasons: a bit of a disappointment given that in the collective imagination for many years to come (until it will come to mind in a few decades to make a remake of the trilogy) thinking of Frodo and Aragorn will undeniably bring to mind the faces of Elijah Wood and Viggo Mortensen. Ironically the likenesses of the characters bear some resemblance to the likenesses of the characters in Ralph Bakshi's failed cartoonish version of the trilogy. Furthermore, there will be some differences with the film in the same points in which it deviates from the book: in the game you will find the presence of Tom Bombadil and Baccador, on the occasion of the rescue of Frodo Glorfindel will arrive instead of Arwen... Furthermore, there will be more parts such as that of Sinuouswillow and the Barrow Wights (the tombs where Frodo obtains the sword of the west) and less like that concerning the fight between Gandalf and Saruman. Whether that is good or bad is up to you to decide.", "date": "2003-01-30", "grade": null}
