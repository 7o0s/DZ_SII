After all, it is a consolidated equation since the very first editions for Game Boy, when after a while Pokmon Yellow joined Red and Blue, the beginning of a tradition for which the double identity of each new episode is not what a deception, given that sooner or later a third one comes out as well as a bit of a remake and a bit of an upgrade. We saw it with Pokmon Crystal and Pokmon Emerald, and here we are again talking about the third complementary Pokmon to the Pearl & Diamond duo that sold out worldwide two years ago. What's cooking again? In fact, there would be no reason for a Pokmon Diamond or Pearl owner to buy this Platinum edition of the same game as well, unless they are a truly die-hard fan of the series. The structural differences with the original pair of games are absolutely minimal, and the gameplay has not been tweaked one millimeter. It works damn well, be careful: Pokmon Platinum is still an RPG apparently for teenagers, actually really deep and tactical. For those who don't know what we're talking about, let's just say that even in this episode the player has to capture extravagant little creatures to fight others in turn-based battles in which the natural element of the two challengers plays a fundamental role: in a sort of Chinese morra , each element has advantages and disadvantages over the others, and it's up to the player to assemble a team that allows him to approach each battle in the appropriate way. Everything is enhanced by a myriad of more or less side dish options, which would be truly impossible to list entirely. What differentiates Platino from the two previous episodes, however, is a slight narrative variation for which a new area opens up to be explored after approximately twenty hours of play: this area has been created completely in 3D and offers rather original puzzles that precede the usual Pokmon battle. Other than that, there's little else to the single player experience, apart from obviously the usual variations on the presence of the little creatures, which will have to be traded with the owners of the other cartridges in order to really get them all, and a series of unpublished fights that will give a hard time even to the most experienced Pokmon trainer. However, a substantial improvement has benefited the online mode, now full of new options such as a sort of exclusive lobby where you can meet other players and share funny mini-games and the possibility of resuming your battles and sharing them with other users. Nothing revolutionary, but a welcome extra for those who already own the previous editions and want to buy this one too or for those who simply try Pokmon for the first time. For all those who have decided to venture into the Sinnoh region and feel a little lost, Multiplayer.it Edizioni offers a mammoth 600-page guide that includes tricks, tips, detailed strategies and an exhaustive list of all 492 Pokmon and their moves. A real Pokmon Platinum Bible, for only 19.99. Same beach, same salt It's always a party when a title belonging to the mother series of Pokmon peeps out on the shelves, but objectively this Platinum version does not differ practically at all, on the technical side, from the Diamond and Pearl editions. And the latter were already a bit obsolete two years ago. The Nintendo DS has shown that it can handle much more complex 3D engines and although the Platinum graphics are absolutely functional to the gameplay, the unedited area created for this version stumbles over its own intention of flexing its muscles and astounding the player, resulting clumsy and rude. For the rest, Platino is a feast of colored sprites that are fairly animated both on the field and in battle, where in reality the special effects relating to attacks and characteristic moves of the Pokmon are the masters, almost static sprites although very colorful and, as always, extremely varied and imaginative. The sound sector is the one we are now used to: jingles and carefree tunes, sometimes repetitive, and the unbearable squeaks of the little creatures, very different from the funny vocalizations of the animated series.", "date": "2009-06-10", "grade": "8.5"}
