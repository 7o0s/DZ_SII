{"name": "Stalingrad", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stalingrad.html", "text": "hold on tight because if you really wanted to test yourself as a strategist, DTF Games will give you the opportunity that history has denied you And the Volga turned red You will understand that we are talking about realism here and therefore some films worthy of the Istituto Luce could not be missing in the opening, which will accompany us during the game to step on the pedal of realism, which Stalingrad has as its main objective. Beyond the soundtrack made up of slightly dated heavy-metal flavored rides, and in my opinion a bit out of tune with the accompanying visual context, the mission briefings do not spare themselves in detailed descriptions of the scenario in which you are about to enter , although the menu screens are too rigorously austere. If they made it... As soon as you set foot on the battlefield, you can't help but notice the immediate parallelism with Blitzkrieg, from which Stalingrad borrows the game engine and consequently also many of the mechanics associated with it. The bearing element of this title is the verisimilitude of the situations, for which all the means of transport and artillery pieces used at the time have been reproduced, with a craving for statistics almost too much to be really actively taken into consideration during the game. Attention to historical realism strongly influences the strategic attitude that Stalingrad requires, as we cannot rely on supplies or troops other than those present at the time in the various clashes. Just the context limited to a single episode gives us a very marked tactical coherence. This means that every single piece of artillery or any means that passed on those fields at the time was miniaturized and reproduced within the game. From the opening campaign to the leadership of the Nazis, up to the Soviet counter-offensive, the strategic factor is preponderant above any other aspect. The considerations to which we are required to comply are purely ballistic: range of the weapons, penetrability factor of the bullets, armor levels for the crawlers distributed for each component of the vehicle and available resources. Each movement must be performed considering the different practicability of the terrains and the speed of the vehicles, exploiting gorges and avoiding being exposed to enemy fire in an open field: a cannon shot is enough to tear apart an entire unit of infantry. This means that every single piece of artillery or any means that passed on those fields at the time has been miniaturized and reproduced within the game If they made it... Even if the fleet of vehicles and the mania for numerical comparisons can exalt for their meticulousness, we must not forget that this translates into a very slow and measured approach, which requires considerable concentration. If you are not a true enthusiast, you risk finding yourself groping along the scenario, suffering devastating defeats due to a cursed mortar that you don't even know where it is; any urban or rural settlement can turn into hell with a few wrong moves and the planning necessary to manage shooters, towed vehicles and the endless series of tracked vehicles can easily make the casual strategic player impatient. Unfortunately, on the one hand, the enemy is cunning and difficult to evade, while on the other, the management of movements sometimes tends to become too cumbersome, especially in narrow and overcrowded spaces, a problem that also affected the discreet Blitzkrieg. A vintage graphics engine Perhaps in order not to lose the halo of historicity, even the graphics engine borrowed from Blitzkrieg is part of the long tradition of the isometric view with a fixed camera, in spite of the three-dimensionality, which would have greatly benefited the management of the troops. Even the animations do not recover from what is certainly not a performance-heavy game. As detailed as the scenarios are and the vehicles shine for the finely retouched polygons with modeling love, the ~diorama~ effect is felt a little too much. By this I mean that everything looks like a static model, which lacks that throb of the scenario necessary for one to feel the bloodiness of the clashes, however stylized in their inevitable reduction to scale. In particular, the infantry units look like small figurines glued into the plastic and the effect is more symbolic than functional. In any case, the scenario has been chiseled with fine craftsmanship and if on the one hand it ~breathes~ little, on the other it is splendid in its static nature, especially as regards the buildings. It almost seems like a rule: as the simulation increases, the graphic impact decreasesor. Yet there would be nothing more enjoyable than a lively game environment to accompany the strategic tension. Then I insist once again on the metallic-flavoured soundtrack, which should trigger spurts of adrenaline while on the contrary having a vague effect of estrangement. Comment Stalingrad is to be welcomed, because it consolidates the ranks of a genre that suffers a little from the lack of spectacularity offered when compared with first-person shooters, which manage to squeeze the machines to their limit. This does not mean that a satisfying challenge cannot be found even in such reflective games, such as this strategic one, so complex and faithful to its historical inspiration as to be almost elitist. Therein lies its strength but also its limitation. On the one hand, true enthusiasts will love the fine strategic component and the amount of means and data associated with them, for all players looking for easy entertainment it could be at least hateful. This goes beyond any graphic consideration which ultimately, although not very popular in its tradition, has little effect on the heart of Stalingrad. However, we must not be frightened and if you want to take a first step in the strategic genre there are splendid products such as Rome: Total War, accessible to all types of users. But if you want a hard time, don't miss this profitable opportunity. Pros: Realistic and detailed A real challenge for real strategists Fascinating historical fresco Cons: Requires a lot of patience and passion Technically we have not progressed Old graphics engine And the Volga turned red As I write these lines, the men dressed in black are climbing the stairs to pick me up, since I have spread the news online that in reality wars have not been fought to finance the war industry, but that of the market (video) playful; already the highest ranks of the Reich were actually planning the Atari in complete secrecy. I would have preferred to pass away writing about the long-awaited Full-Life, but publishing doesn't always follow the logic of the heart. So here I am on Stalingrad, yet another RTS that will see you engaged in one of the most lucrative conflicts in history. If you still see the monitor clouded by the many medals of honor, hold on because if you wanted to seriously test yourself as a strategist, DTF Games will give you the opportunity that history has denied you (and perhaps it didn't go so badly). As the name suggests, the conflict ignites in the old Stalingrad, theater of war of a romantic and heroic resistance of the Red Army (summer 1942 - February 1943). Naturally, the first hand belongs to the ~bad guys~, the infamous Wehrmacht soldiers, while it will then be the turn of the Red Army which will have to bottle up and break up the advance of General von Paulus. A large conflict distributed over thirty-six missions to which are added seven ~hidden~ clashes, which will enrich your knowledge about some interesting backgrounds.", "date": "2005-03-15", "grade": null}
