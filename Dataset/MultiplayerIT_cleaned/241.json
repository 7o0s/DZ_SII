Since we have been talking about it, the mysterious continent has been making the fortune of writers, authors of television formats and of course many more or less brilliant programmers. If the oldest among us can let themselves be carried away by nostalgia for the past, when Lucas Arts published Indiana Jones and the fate of Atlantis, everyone is still granted the opportunity to savor the adventurous search for the myth thanks to the new The Secrets of Atlantis, which falls in all respects into the category of point-and-click adventures, which you can only love or hate. You will remember a Nobilis cruise for a lifetime Although the plot, at least in its incipit, may seem obvious, you will soon have the opportunity to change your mind and for this reason the Nobilis title immediately earns a few more points over the competition. Seeing Howard Brooks, the undisputed protagonist, with a crumpled cowboy hat and the cloying outfit of an Indiana Jones clone, we immediately thought of a fanatic of relics or grave desecration, while on the contrary he presents himself as an engineer, moreover never been so far from wanting to hear about vanished cities, guns or cursed temples. Unfortunately for him, the developers had other plans in mind and after a mysterious attack on board the airship he was on, he will be involved by a billionaire named Foster in the search for the longed-for sunken city. Apparently a race against time, because even his aggressors are interested in the much fabled technologies with which to control Italian televisions ... er, the nations of the whole world. I say, do you find Atlantis and can you still be so narrow-minded that you want to ~rule the world~? It looks like a screenplay for a blockbuster set in the 1930s and in fact this is precisely the temporal location of The Secrets of Atlantis but as we said before, an intriguing and brilliant narrative in its joking with the stereotypes of the genre kicks off from rather obvious premises. Action! From the moment you get to know Mr. Foster you will have to travel a lot, with inconveniences comparable only to the trips of the editors of Multiplayer.it to California, but enjoying exotic settings for us such as China, Mesopotamia and India. It must be said that a long section inside the Empire State Building was included with a certain originality, among other things in the era during which New York experienced its moment of greatest splendor and popularity. Unfortunately, even if on the one hand the reconstruction of the environments is refined, both in terms of lights and colors, the lack of a real three-dimensional engine pays a price for simplicity: with the mouse you will be able to observe the world around you at three hundred and sixty degrees in first person, but moving from one location to another is instantaneous and requires pressing the mouse on the active areas of the screen dedicated to movements. To put it simply, you will not be able to walk or explore any game area on the move, so that you will be forced to click from one room to another to visit a floor of the Empire State Building, with decidedly modest results in terms of play. The interface is invisible and is limited to an inventory with unlimited capacity, from which you can collect or combine different objects, while interaction with the play area is achieved by identifying the objects or characters with which to interact with the pointer . Hence the name of point-and-click adventures, joy for fans and frustration for all detractors. as for puzzles The Secrets of Atlantis is above the average of the adventures Action! Naturally every hero has his beauty and his secondary figures, starting from the elusive Kate Sullivan, a femme fatale in clothing but not without character and thickness, up to Nathaniel Blackwood, an enigmatic character animated by ambiguous motivations. We therefore have a cast (of which we have clearly mentioned only a few relevant figures) and we have a stage, we just have to start filming. It was no coincidence that a cinematographic language was chosen, as The Secrets of Atlantis really looks like a genre film, but with a very engaging rhythm and crescendo. It will be precisely your total extraneousness to the facts and the consequent fall into a network that thickens with each journey, made up of half-truths, revelations and secrets, which will complicate the general picture by drawing you deeper and deeper into a spiral vortex (but look) , which will culminate with the Mystery, the one with a capital ~m~. There are not only narrative secrets, but also many small pemany to discover during the exploration, even if the almost naive simplicity of the interface could make you think of an easy path to follow. In reality there are no aids of any kind and after the first two settings you will discover that in terms of puzzles, present in very high quantities, The Secrets of Atlantis is above the average of adventures: these are often original and tantalizing puzzles, always logical but in some very demanding cases, to the point that the occasional player or one not accustomed to the adventure genre could seriously get bogged down, which has hardly happened for years now in many games. From a personal point of view I don't find it a limit at all, also because you won't find yourself having to put a handle in a monkey's ear, and with reasoning there will be no insurmountable enigma, but the less patient are warned. Action! Unfortunately, problems often arise from modest means that somewhat affect the overall performance: as we said, it is not possible to freely travel through the game environments and even the characters are often awkward in the animations and alienating in the physiognomies. Sometimes one gets the impression of watching an old TV show in which at any moment the bartender takes off his mask and reveals himself as the alien parasite he is, halfway between Visitors and Zack Mac Cracken. Since we are dealing with an adventure with a cinematic cut, we expected something more than a few pre-rendered sequences or small videos that illustrate the results of an action undertaken, a clear attempt (albeit appreciable), to get the best out of the few funds available disposition. Simplicity is basically the biggest limitation of the Nobilis title: on the one hand, it lightens the management of the commands, but on the other, the absence of some alternative features in the gameplay ends up restricting the potential audience only to followers of the genre, seriously risking bore other players, however perceptible efforts are made to keep the player glued to the keyboard. The dialogues, however discreet, unfortunately suffer from a problem that has been weighing on most of the adventures for a long time and which concerns their total lack of incisiveness on the plot. There are no right or wrong answers, as you can well imagine, so that every conversation ends up being a way of obtaining mere information, without that pleasant tension of having to study the words in front of our interlocutor. However, there is an X factor that we would like to reward, and we dedicate the next section to this. the puzzles are often original and tantalizing, always logical but in some cases very challenging 8 per thousand in Nobilis And so you want to find out what inheritances will unfold in front of you thanks to the pieces of an ancient medallion. You have the actors, the locations and some (modest) special effects. However, it is the screenplay, the style in the choice of details that elevates to elegance what otherwise would swim in the crowded sea of mediocrity. In this The Secrets of Atlantis shows the passion of the people who made it: there are vintage quotations, carefully chosen paintings and a dose of irony that plays with the conventional models of the characters without being either coarse or obvious. Of course, don't expect an intellectual work, it is perhaps not even the right medium for this kind of experience, but it winks at the mature player and reflects the desire to create a modest but not tacky work, which suffers from lack of technology employed, however suggesting that if there had been more funds they would have been invested with love. An excellent incentive for a sequel, since The Secrets of Atlantis is only the latest in a long series, could just be to buy the game, totally localized in Italian, although without the class of a cinematographic dubbing. However, let's consider it as a final confirmation of the good will with which this title reaches the shelves: devoid of innovative mechanics and simple in intentions, it is nevertheless enjoyable and a harbinger of sleepless nights for at least a few dozen hours. Conclusions The Secrets of Atlantis is certainly not revolutionary and rests on very simple foundations, as well as the whole technical system, which will save your processor a lot of effort. Nonetheless, in its immediacy it manages to intrigue and involve, playing on genre clichs without taking itself too seriously, but at the same time setting up an intriguing scenario and a well-paced story. There are puzzles to solve at every corner, some of which are quite challenging, suitable for awakening the mental torpor that is generated with so many titles on the market. Unfortunately as far as the fewelements present have been developed with commitment and are accompanied by an Italian localization, it still remains a flat game in gameplay, suitable for those who love adventures or players looking for a diversion waiting for profitable months for the PC market. Let's hope it's a good start for a juicier sequel. Pros Classic themes shot with irony Lots of consciously studied puzzles Well-characterized settings Cons Very old game mechanics Technically questionable character realization Point and click. Nothing else. You will remember a Nobilis cruise for a lifetime Man cannot do without mysteries, because in some way they answer the anguished question that has tormented him since he has been traveling around the Earth: are we the result of a bizarre case in the nebula of probabilities or is our life the the result of a plan that we would define as rational? If you have subscribed to Multiplayer.it to get this kind of answers you just have to contact Customer Service to forward the complaints of the case, but if you want to know what the hell all this has to do with the game published by Nobilis you are in the place Right.", "date": "2006-12-01", "grade": null}
