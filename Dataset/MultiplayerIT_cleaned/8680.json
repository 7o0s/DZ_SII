In recent years, the attention of insiders (and others) has returned to catalyze titles from small software houses, but which have had the merit of making people talk about them well beyond the visual merits: let's talk about Dear Esther for example , To The Moon, UnEpic which, although belonging to very different strands, are all characterized by an excellent quality of entertainment. Among these, the first work of the Croatian company 2x2 Games, published by the venerable Matrix Games, on whose development the chief programmer Tomislav Uzelac and his three collaborators worked for almost five years, rightfully enters. All to the front Set in the Second World War, and more precisely in the Eastern European theater, Unity Of Command presents itself as a classic turn-based strategy along the lines of Panzer General or Steel Panthers: the units are distributed on a hexagonal grid and the player's aim is to conquer the objectives indicated to him at the beginning of the game in the shortest time and with the least expenditure of men. Said like this, it would seem all too simple, and in fact immediacy is the strong point of the 2x2 Games game, thanks to a technical realization that is as delightful as it is functional. In fact, the few minutes necessary to complete the first scenario are enough to understand the dynamics of a title that can be controlled with only the left mouse button. Despite the setting and the vastness of the maneuvers that followed one another in the context of Operation Barbarossa, from which the inspiration of Unity Of Command springs, the battles take place on maps that are often displayed in a single screen, giving thus to the player the unitary vision of the forces in the field. The graphic style, strictly in two dimensions, is adorable in its cleanliness and in the choice of color palette, so much so that it recalls vintage postage stamps; the interface, while minimalistic, provides all the necessary information without unnecessary frills. The aspects relating to economic resources have been eliminated in toto, therefore the game focuses completely on the tactical management of the troops which can be summarily divided into infantry, cavalry and tanks; in principle, the Wehrmacht is more powerful but less numerous, the exact opposite of the Red Army. The strategic keystone that makes Unity Of Command tremendously tactical is the front line. At the beginning of the game, the armies are already arranged and ready to be moved: each has a certain amount of movement points (which can be modified by geographical and atmospheric factors) and attack, variable based on the experience and updates to which units have been subjected. The two units are located in the territory of competence (typically the right side of the screen for the Soviet forces) and it is essential that all units remain within it: if the enemy were able to ~cut~ the front, he would isolate the troops which in a couple of turns would be penalized both with the reduction of movements and with the impossibility of carrying out attacks (as supplies would be missing). This concept is perfectly counterbalanced by the brevity of the games that must be completed on average in about ten rounds: it will therefore be necessary to calibrate every single move both to prevent the army from being decapitated as it advances towards the objectives, and, conversely, to bring the attack before the turns are up. The result is a gameplay that overseas colleagues would define as addictive and which turns out to be perfect for frenetic games in small spare moments, considering that normally it won't take more than half an hour to complete them. The game also offers archaic support for multiplayer, which relies on direct IP connections or the Crammondian hot seat mode, but the real highlight is represented by the two campaigns (one German, the other Russian), which can corner even the most shrewd strategists. It is essentially a plot that links the individual scenarios (however playable individually) and which in practice keeps in memory the results with which the missions have been completed: that is, it will not be possible to face certain maps if victories have been obtained in the previous ones with low scores. The task is made difficult by'incredible artificial intelligence developed by programmers: the opponent controlled by the CPU seems to know the player's moves in advance and always manages to respond accordingly, almost never resorting to direct attack but using the soft underbelly of the army to cut him off from supplies . After being amazed, in the first few bars, by the computer's ability, we will have to rack our brains to try to get the better of it: each game is a story in its own right and there are no predetermined tactics to guarantee victory. The fact that there is a single level of difficulty could discourage less savvy users, who are obviously not the recipients of Unity Of Command which, despite its accessibility, requires a good deal of experience in order to be mastered properly. However, it is worth waiting a few days (on the official forum Uzelac confirmed that it is working on it) to be able to try a demonstration version which, in addition to dispelling any reasonable doubts about the goodness of the product, can definitely make you fall in love with this little gem.", "date": "2012-03-14", "grade": "8.0"}
