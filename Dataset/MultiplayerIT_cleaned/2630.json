You will play two Dalmatian puppies, Oddball and Domino (brother and sister) who set off on a long and difficult adventure along the roads of England, in order to free their parents and friends kidnapped by the evil Cruella Demon and her henchmen. Many of you will wonder why this hatred towards dogs, which are considered by all man's best friend, while for Cruella they are the source of her economic misfortunes. She had opened a toy chain in England, which, unfortunately, turned out to be a huge flop. From that day on, the idea grew in his mind that kids spent their money on spoiling their puppies, instead of buying his high-tech toys. And so the hunt for the Dalmatian begins, and the destinies of the breed will be in your hands. The adventure begins... After a long film in FMV (full motion video), our two heroes are finally ready to embark on their adventure. The aim of the game is to free six puppies for each stage, breaking the narrow cages in which they are imprisoned (similar concept to that of the Spyro series, in which you have to free the frozen dragons). Unfortunately, the path of our Dalmatians (at any moment of the game, by entering the options, you can choose who to command) will be hindered by some toy-enemies who can be defeated either by barking (square button) or by charging at them (triangle button). The 16 levels that make up the game are extremely varied and well made, ranging from bucolic settings to the streets of London, from gloomy mines to carnival atmospheres. The graphics are in 3D and the characters are rendered with a good number of textures, but the game has flashy pop-up and bad clipping effects (you will see objects suddenly appearing and questionable polygonal collisions). The music is in keeping with the cartoonish style of the game and helps immerse yourself in the relaxing atmosphere of the adventure. Appreciable is the inclusion of a series of mini games, two of which can be selected from the start, while the other four can be unlocked during the adventure. You can challenge the CPU or your friends on mini golf courses, dance courses, race tracks and more. Surely this mode makes the game longer lasting, which, if placed in expert hands, proves to be particularly linear and can be finished in the space of a day. But obviously the programmers have created this title for the use and consumption of a medium-low target. The end We are faced with a good conversion, which manages to revive the cinematic sensations with the addition of interactivity, typical of the CD format. Furthermore, the complete localization of the title also makes it accessible to a very young audience, given that both the menus and the dialogues are in our beloved language. Despite some small flaws, I advise parents to buy this game for their children, to the delight of young and old. pros: excellent film conversion simple and immediate cons: excessively easy small graphic imperfections Cinema, what a passion! In recent years, the union between the film and videogame industries has gradually strengthened. It often happens to see films that are transposed into video games, or the opposite, even if usually the results are not always the happiest, and the risk of a flop is always lurking. Fortunately, there are certain certainties in life: Christmas always falls on December 25, the sun rises every morning and Disney films always set box office records. The cartoon 102 Dalmatians: Puppies ti the Rescue does not escape this law, which thanks to the collaboration between Disney Interactive and Core Design finds new life on the PsOne screens.", "date": "2001-02-20", "grade": null}
