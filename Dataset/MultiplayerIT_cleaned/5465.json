At least for those accustomed to a somewhat traditional vision of videogames, having to deal with a game that practically plays itself out is disorienting at first, and you need a rather open approach to new perspectives to overcome the first impression and capture its essence. Because in fact there is a substance behind the apparent madness of a game that plays itself, and the fact of appreciating it can be even more shocking for the aforementioned traditionalist gamer. Also from this point of view, mobile-derived games truly offer new perspectives and food for thought for those who are used to seeing this market according to somewhat too schematic rules and this Nonstop Knight is paradigmatic in this sense. Just to make people understand the dynamics, the game is a sort of Diablo-style hack and slash action RPG, in which, however, the protagonist moves inside the dungeons and fights completely autonomously, leaving the player with a support and management role of resources. Put like this, the description seems to portray a crippled game, lacking its main component, i.e. interaction, but there is a need to look at things from another point of view: the focal points of Nonstop Knight lie in the growth of the character, in the wild grinding that itself becomes gameplay and leads us to consider the semi-automated combat system practically secondary and even more the moving and exploration of the scenarios, however obviously simplified. It is obviously a lighter type of game than that of a standard Diablo, with which this title shares only something of the form, but hides a mechanic that really manages to capture the interest and create addiction. Nonstop Knight: the hard life of a knight's assistant shows the background of the action RPG Without posing While our immaculate and fearless knight roams the dungeons (actually all quite the same) and engages in battles continuously, all the management of his evolution is delegated to the player. Without the action ever stopping, therefore, we find ourselves activating the protagonist's special abilities, choosing them appropriately based on the moment and calculating the necessary cooldown period, and managing the growth of statistics. The money earned in the clashes can be immediately invested in increasing the efficiency of weapons and armor, with the possibility of changing equipment on the fly when new items are acquired and thus noting the increase in the protagonist's statistics in real time, including attack and defense, to which is added the increase in special skills that comes with the transition to the next experience levels. Once you've taken down a certain number of opponents you move on to a later dungeon or boss fight, which intersperses the action frequently and allows you to earn massive amounts of loot in one fell swoop. The fights in this case are obviously more demanding and it becomes necessary to be well prepared to face them, which pushes further on the grinding front, a practically fundamental element of the whole game. A particular mechanic in the growth of the character also requires you to return to the starting level from time to time: the Ascent of the knight essentially allows you to keep the level of experience intact but at the same time start over from the beginning by sacrificing all the equipment and the money collected to obtain special coins in exchange that can be used to apply substantial and constant increases to the protagonist's statistics. In essence, the progression is the game itself here, in a kind of extreme schematization of the action RPG mechanics. The problem is that the evolution is perhaps even too fast and calibrated to offer a real sense of challenge. Nonstop Knight offers an extremely smooth approach curve, which on the one hand avoids forcing players to resort to microtransactions but on the other hand begins to offer a sense of challenge when they are probably already saturated with the gaming experience.", "date": "2016-06-08", "grade": "7.2"}
