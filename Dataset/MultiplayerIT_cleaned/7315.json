Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. That of the ~princess in danger~, as you well know, is a rather recurring theme in video games, even in the mobile sector. But what happens when the hero of the moment chosen to save her is not a knight without blemishes nor a gruff with a tender heart, but a small flame? We'll find out by playing Pyro Jump, the new action puzzle developed by Pinpin Team for iOS and Android devices. It is a title with a very simple approach, whose control system is in fact based on a single input: you have to touch the screen, with greater or lesser intensity, for our character to take a leap and pass from a ~wheel~ to another, from one platform to another, within increasingly complex levels, divided into four worlds (to unlock those after the first, however, you have to pay 2.69 euros), each characterized by a different theme. Considering that the capabilities of the flame do not change, it is precisely the scenarios that introduce an important element of variation in the gameplay, while leaving a basic principle intact: to successfully complete a stage in Pyro Jump you need to be very precise and reactive. Collecting all the stars, in the traditional points system that evaluates our performance at the end of each session, in fact translates into the unlocking of some bonus levels. Pyro Jump is an immediate and fun action puzzle, in which, however, you have to be very precise and reactive The flame of passion The offer of the Pinpin Team title is fairly substantial, with seventy missions that will keep you busy for at least a couple of hours. The experience is clearly marked by ~trial & error~, in the sense that there are no checkpoints but rather relatively short stages, which you have to start over with every game over. In fact, it takes very little to ~die~: a badly calculated jump, not made at the precise moment in which we are asked to do so, and our character can fall into the void, then going back up nicely like a little angel. It is precisely this excessive emphasis on precision that represents the greatest limitation of the game, which can become frustrating at certain times, also because it does not provide alternative ways of dealing with situations. In short, the point is to memorize the connotation of the levels and behave accordingly, making some attempts until the objective is reached. Fortunately, the harshness of the commitment is tempered by a very pleasant glance, given that the technical sector of Pyro Jump can count on comic and intriguing graphics, characterized by splendid chromatic choices and a cartoon style, in which the elements active and the characters are represented as paper puppets, clearly very sensitive to fire. Also nice is the sound, which with its jingles well interprets the fairy-tale and basically cheerful character of this production, which we certainly recommend you try.", "date": "2014-02-15", "grade": "7.5"}
