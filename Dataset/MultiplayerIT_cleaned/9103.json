The house has managed to achieve notable successes and to carry out numerous projects, thanks to the excellent value for money of its adventures and the use of some historical brands never forgotten by those who grew up with Sierra and Lucasarts. However, with the very recent Back to the Future series, the developers have begun to show a sort of ~riddler's block~, clearly perceptible in the lack of panache and variety of the last few chapters. The quicksand of repetitiveness risked becoming excessively deep, but Telltale did not sink without a fight, and in this period of crisis it has decided to use its latest ace up its sleeve. Actually, it's a rather dirty ace, shredded, and with a photo of a little naked woman in the background, but still full of potential. Let's talk about Hector: Badge of Carnage, one of the most offensive and entertaining sagas ever, born from the minds of the guys from Straandloper, a small animation studio based in Northern Ireland. We reviewed the first adventure of the grumpy detective some time ago. We liked it, but it wasn't without its flaws. Now the brand has passed into the hands of the American software house, and the second episode, Senseless Acts of Justice, is finally available on Steam. If you are worried about a possible change of route due to the handover, you have nothing to fear. Straandloper is still firmly in the reins of development and the nastiness of the game hasn't diminished at all. Today we will try to understand if the quality of Hector's adventures has also remained constant, or if the rude detective has in turn set off on a path of no return. I coulda guessed that Senseless Acts of Justice puts us back in Hector's shoes, exactly at the moment we left him at the end of the first adventure. Our plump friend had managed to enter the room of the sniper who had kept the police department in check for days, but instead of the criminal he had found a deadly surprise. Your first task will therefore be to save the life of the protagonist. Easier said than done, as the detective's karma is pitch black, allowing him to survive critical situations only to get him into even more apocalyptic messes. In fact, think that to get out of trouble this time ours will not be able to act alone, but will have to rely on his colleague Lambert: a man whose intelligence perfectly reflects the efficiency of the Clappers Wreake police forces ... as absolutely non-existent . The ability to switch characters is an interesting mechanic, which has given the programmers the opportunity to introduce some basic but well-structured puzzles. However, you will not be able to take advantage of Lambert's help throughout the game, but only in the initial phase. After that, the slender policeman with the IQ of a pine wood bench will only serve you to activate the very complete system of aids and suggestions. Not that there was really a need: the puzzles of Hector - Episode 2 are not particularly difficult. In any case, it is impossible not to praise the imagination of the developers in conceiving them. Few in the world are able to create puzzles that can be solved using obese prostitutes, drugged meatloaf and beef blood. No news regarding the interface. The mechanics are the most classic in the genre, an inventory to collect and combine objects, and the mouse to interact with the environment. The main innovation lies in the introduction of some colleagues, with whom it is necessary to communicate multiple times to advance in the adventure. More precisely, a coroner named Gloria and an arrogant hacker known as Solid Bass. Ballbags! After Telltale entered the field in the development of the Hector trilogy, it was reasonable to expect some improvements from a technical point of view in Senseless Acts of Justice. The first episode is still a title born for the iPad, and created by only two people. There have been improvements, but they are only marginal. In general, there is greater care in the designs of the settings, and slightly more fluid animations. In short, the graphics are not surprising. The verve of the characters and the absurdity of certain locations fortunately make up for the technical shortcomings. In an adventure, after all, looks take a back seat to charisma. The real strong point of the Straandloper and Telltale series is to be found in the dialogues. The zany and outspoken humor of the game is hilarious, and once again the craziness of the situations they find themselves in Hector and company does not disappoint in the slightest. Only one problem, which unfortunately returns from the predecessor heavy as a boulder: the dialogues are not localized, and the characters often use an English that is not easy to understand (slang, shortened words, idioms). If your English is below grade level, you're unlikely to enjoy the jokes. Such a pity. The other main flaw of the title, the price, has been partially curbed by Telltale. The entire trilogy can now be purchased for around 20 euros. Not much (even less if you consider that Steam is a platform full of discounts), and certainly a step forward compared to the first chapter. Longevity, on the other hand, remained scarce and, even if Hector's stories are slightly longer in chapter two, they will hardly keep you busy for more than 3 hours.", "date": "2011-09-08", "grade": "7.3"}
