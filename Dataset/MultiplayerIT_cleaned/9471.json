Some leave a limb, others their humanity. The protagonist of Brutal Fantasy: The Orcs of Undermountain on the battlefield even loses his soul, devoured by a dark entity that pushes him to fight, fight, fight relentlessly and without mercy, trying to satisfy a thirst for revenge that never seems to subside. The battle is fought in the mountains, and the enemies are no longer men: orcs, undead and even wizards capable of vanishing and casting evil spells move among the corpses. A simple sword will not be enough to eliminate them, to guide the blade will have to be an unstoppable spirit, who can also count on the support of the dark arts. Through a series of different locations, our warrior will therefore find himself facing increasingly numerous and determined hordes of enemies, annihilating them with his weapons until nothing remains but silence. As mentioned at the beginning, the game offers the classic dynamics of scrolling fighting games, however enclosing them in a survival-type structure. However, we must not confuse Brutal Fantasy with any ~thought-chiller~ in which the game goes on until you die: the scenario is basically static, the opponents alternate rapidly and there are rather agitated phases, but there is a term for each stage and at that point it is possible to dedicate oneself to the enhancement of the character, spending the money collected on the battlefield to buy new and more powerful weapons. Survival race The effectiveness of each sword depends on ~role~ factors such as strength, speed and dexterity, so depending on the case the same blow can inflict superficial damage or critical damage. As the stages are passed, identified in the plot as days (there are twenty in all), we see new types of enemies appear, equipped with different attack and defense capabilities compared to their predecessors. Luckily we can count on an excellent control system, based on a virtual d-pad and three buttons: one for attacking with a sword, one for parrying with a shield and one for using magic. The latter depends on a bar that fills up as we eliminate our opponents, and can vary according to the case: at the beginning only a sort of ~fireball~ is available, later on a healing spell is acquired, and etc. The basic combo is obtained by repeatedly pressing the attack button, while by acting twice on the d-pad and pressing the attack button it is possible to perform a powerful charge capable of routing even entire groups of orcs. It is a pity that such a precise control system has not been exploited to insert a greater number of moves: the presence of few attacks and the almost total uselessness of the parry mean that the action soon becomes repetitive, mixing the cards on the table only when the difficulty becomes much higher. This is certainly an intrinsic defect in the scrolling fighting game genre, but we reiterate that a greater variety would certainly have helped the enjoyment of the experience, and we hope that in a future update the developers will be able to insert new moves. If the precision and reliability of the controls are undoubtedly one of the strengths of Brutal Fantasy: The Orcs of Undermountain, the technical sector is no less and in particular we must applaud the graphics: original, in some ways ~ dirty~ but with an undeniable charm, was specially created by the J.
