{"name": "Amnesia Rebirth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/amnesia-rebirth-recensione.html", "text": "The Amnesia Rebirth review tells of a new chapter in the discourse that began with Penumbra, expanded with Amnesia: The Dark Descent and tried to unhinge with Soma. Frictional Games didn't limit itself to creating a horror game, but wanted to refine its theory of videogame tension, however trying to make it almost vanish within the narrative. In Amnesia Rebirth everything is a story and every game mechanic flows gracefully within it, without ever trying to prevail. On paper we are talking about a first-person psychological horror, a very abused denomination and adopted by any pseudo-author who tries to transform his adolescent itches into a video game, but in practice it is something different, broader. Don't misunderstand: psychology is there and horror too, but they are declined towards a broader vision and are never the ultimate goal of the experience, except in a broad sense. History The protagonist of the game is Tasi Trianon, a French scholar with a passion for drawing and archeology with a traumatic past. She is married to Salim, a researcher like her. At the beginning of the adventure we see them sitting side by side on a plane that is taking them to Algeria. They have to reach an archaeological site of which we are told almost nothing. Unfortunately, things get complicated right away: the plane crashes due to an engine failure and Tasi finds herself alone in the wreckage of the aircraft. Where have all the others gone? Why didn't Salim wait for her either? Leaving the plane, she discovers she is in the middle of the desert. Having examined the objects in the surrounding area, including some documents that give her some vague information on what is happening, Tasi decides to go in search of the group. Being in the sun is dangerous because it's really hot, so you have to run from one shaded area to another until you reach a cave, where the woman finds the remains of the camp of the survivors of the plane crash. In this first phase the game already dictates part of its themes, its rhythms and its rules: we learn how to relate to the surrounding world, in particular that each interactive object can be dragged or held according to its weight and dimensions; we also discover that Tasi is subject to what we can define as real panic attacks, which strike her when she is frightened or uncomfortable (for example when she spends too much time in complete darkness) causing her terrible visions (the nature of which we will discover in the second half of the game). We also discover an essential object: matches, which we need to light ourselves (for a few moments), as well as to light the candles, lamps and torches scattered around the maps. Later we will also acquire an oil lantern, but at least for the first section you have to make do and prepare to run in case you are left without sources of light. This is where Frictional starts building its tension machine. From reading the documents found in the caves we learn of the presence of a creature that lives in the maze of tunnels from which they are formed and attacks anyone who dares to venture into its territory... right where we need to go. We also understand that Tasi is deeply upset, either for obvious reasons, or for something that will manifest itself over time. She is not a superhero and there is no lack of an opportunity to express her anxiety, which slowly becomes that of the player himself. In short, you find yourself crawling in the dark afraid of who knows what, running at breakneck speed in search of a source of light when the tension is on the verge of exploding Tasi. But the monster is in the caves, running is dangerous... gameplay Also in the caves we discover that Tasi has a strange device, which incredibly resembles a compass, with which he can open portals to another dimension. We don't know why she has it and she herself doesn't understand what is happening. Of course, we will find out everything later, but in the meantime we are forced to cross large portions of a dark and mysterious world, where the remains of a civilization apparently capable of erecting exceptional monuments stand out, destroyed by no one knows who. To all these elements, another one is immediately added which concerns the inner world of Tasi. Something happened to her and this something seems to be the pivot around which the whole story revolves. There is actually much more, as we will discover in the final part of the adventure. Without giving advances of any kind, even if it is inevitable to mention the story to talk about a game like Amnesia Rebirth, in which the same is doubly linked to the gameplay, we can say that there is so much to discover. The very structure of the game is designed to push towards the search for indexesbile truth that underlies our actions, dosing purely narrative phases with other more properly horror ones. For example, the long section that takes place inside a ruined fort is particularly terrifying, as is the descent into a large shaft carved into the rock. However, the beauty of Frictional Games' work should not be found in the jumps on the chair or in the stealth system, the latter quite in line with that of the studio's previous games, apart from the addition of the possibility of lying down on the ground so as to hide better to the pursuers (when possible), but in the way everything was perfectly dosed scene by scene, almost as if to make the game mechanics disappear in the flow. Something similar had also been tried with Soma, but there the different scenes were more detached from each other, while here there is an enormous continuity so much that you don't perceive big gaps and you never know what can happen. Although not an open world, Amnesia Rebirth seems to make us play in a single environment, in which all the various places coexist harmoniously, although they are often in contrast with each other and although there are actually well-recognizable sections. Here and there are also puzzles to solve, such as rebuilding an elevator hoist or reactivating strange alien machinery. Usually we have to explore dark and scary areas to look for the objects we need. Also in this case there is nothing for its own sake or added just to lengthen the broth. Everything has a narrative progression and serves to tell us something, but also to increase tension, often beyond the guard level (a couple of times we even turned off the game to catch our breath, even though we weren't sure if we had stalkers on our heels) . The game mechanics are so intertwined with the story, that some are even impossible to name, because they can't be explained except by revealing large chunks of the plot. Graphics Graphically / stylistically, Amnesia Rebirth is the classic Frictional Games game. Technically there is nothing to cry out for a miracle, despite the presence of some very beautiful landscapes. That said, there are some highly visionary moments, which unfortunately we can't talk about specifically unless we give you huge previews (it's kind of the leit motif of the entire review), and some areas have been designed with great architectural taste and scenographic, such as for example a cave full of Roman remains or the already mentioned fortress that we see for the first time from below, going up along a rock ridge overlooking the desert. The pencil drawings made by Tasi are also very beautiful, some relating to his past and viewable in the loading screens or in some particular sequences, others present in his diary in an obscured form, which become clear as his memories are unlocked. To all this must be added the splendid soundtrack, perfect in its ability to act as a driving force for tension and to create strong moments of anguish, underlining the emotional states of the woman. In short, on the one hand it could be said that technically Amnesia Rebirth limits itself to working, on the other hand that it also has a recognizable and coherent style, an original imagery and unexpected details, at least for those who know how to grasp them.", "date": "2020-10-19", "grade": "9.0"}
