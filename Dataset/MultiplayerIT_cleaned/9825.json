In Japan, where the title has already been available for a few months, the latest chapter of the series that originated way back in 2002 with the first episode on PlayStation 2 has so far found great success with the public, carving out an important space for itself in the hearts of fans . To the point that some of them have gone so far as to define it as the best title of the saga. But is it really so? Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep takes place ten years before Sora's adventures, in a world where peace and harmony are still monitored and guaranteed by the Masters. It is in this context that the events of three young students of Maestro Eraqus take place, namely the serious Terra, the fast and cheerful Ventus and the protective Aqua, the protagonists of the game who will be involved in a serious crisis that will affect the their entire universe and dealing with the disappearance of Xehanort and the threat of new enemies: the Unversed. Each of the three boys has his own situation to tell, a portion of the story that must be experienced by the gamer by interpreting each of them in turn, in order to have a complete picture of the facts through the perspective of the young people, up to the secret ending to unlock which will clarify every aspect of the story completely. Old and new While leaving the users free choice, Tetsuya Nomura, the famous game director and character designer of Square Enix, went so far as to suggest starting the game first with Terra, continuing with Ventus and finishing with Aqua, in order to better understand the implications of the plot. But let's now analyze the aspects related to the gameplay. The gameplay of Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep maintains the traditional structure of the franchise which involves the exploration of various locations ranging from Cinderella's dream castle to Peter Pan's Neverland or Princess Aurora's Enchanted Domain, just to name a few, with a certain freedom of movement, the fight against the enemies that populate them, generally with the help of famous characters such as Goofy and Donald Duck, and the completion of some secondary missions. Each scenario includes hidden treasures, fun mini-games, maps and tough final boss fights. But it reviews the control system of the characters in battle and their evolution. In this way the gameplay while maintaining strong reminiscences of Kingdom Hearts II appears more dynamic and faster in the combat phases. Thanks to a more immediate command deck to manage, in fact, it is possible to compose the series of techniques or actions of your hero in advance and then quickly select them in battle. Simply scroll them with the pad in the pop-up menu on the left of the screen and press the Triangle button to execute them. In addition to allowing greater speed of execution, as mentioned, this method guarantees more expert users to customize the gameplay and fighting style of the character used, making it unique. Each action or technique has a recharge time that varies according to its depth and power, as well as certain parameters related to the character. Furthermore, they can be freely modified and combined to obtain new ones, and again through the use of specific crystal objects, support skills can be added to the set of commands created. Focus attacks During the clashes, the success of the blows that the user will be able to inflict on the enemies will lead to the progressive filling of a special bar which, once full, will allow the action commands present in the control menu to undergo a sort of level-up with new options of combat. Continuing to attack the aforementioned bar will start to fill up again until it reaches a second maximum level which this time will allow you to deliver finishing blows very similar to the Limit Breaks of the Final Fantasy series instead of the usual combos. These absolutely personal techniques for each character can in turn evolve once certain conditions are met. Another tasty novelty of Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep is a new system relating to attacks and spells (which by the way now do not require MP), to be performed using the back buttons L and R when the appropriate Focus bar located below that of the HP is full: once the above function is activated, a viewfinder appears that the player must try to place on as many enemies as possible in order to ~hook~ them. Once everything is completed, when the word End appears on the video, the dancing can begin. PressRepeatedly pressing the key indicated for the specific action you have chosen to use within a time limit executes the attack. Imagine for example what Terra can do using a meteor shower to destroy every enemy shape on the screen (in this case by repeatedly pressing the circle button) or Ventus with his techniques. Experience isn't everything The issue related to the Dimensional Union has also been revised, i.e. the system that allows the hero on duty to summon one of the previously encountered Disney characters into battle: this recall operation is now performed without the need to stop the fight or write on the screen , practically in real time, so to speak. Once the appropriate blue bar has been filled by collecting the spheres of the same color that fall from hit enemies, Terra, Aqua and Ventus can receive the support of the various Mickeys and associates who provide them with new cover commands and finishing moves. The latter can be enhanced by earning specific symbols related to each character. However, don't be frightened by all these bars to load or commands on the screen: the controls are easier and more immediate than it might seem at first glance and as always practice is the best way to master them. For the rest, as mentioned at the beginning of the previous paragraph, the character growth system is also a mix between tradition and novelty. Experience is gained by eliminating enemies and as usual, when a certain necessary score is reached, the level of the hero on duty is increased. However, what is different from the usual is the possibility of leveling the individual movements of each character and the related skills making them unique. The evolution of the characters' abilities, as well as the weapons they equip, is also associated with a system that vaguely recalls that of the licenses of Final Fantasy XII and the game of the goose. On a command panel that reflects from time to time one of the worlds of the game just explored, the player can move his pawn represented by the character used for the adventure based on the score obtained by rolling a dice, challenging two opposing characters. Like a board game The aim of the game is to complete a certain path by passing colored checkpoints and occupying some white boxes, making them in turn the color corresponding to the one that represents your hero. In this way they can then be used later to extort points from other competitors when they happen upon them (as in Monopoly). Furthermore, on his way the user will also encounter particular boxes that have specific effects on the commands and skills of his alter ego, improving those possessed or giving new and rare ones. Completing level thirty of the game also unlocks a special mission useful for completing the series of events related to the Ultima Weapons. To further liven up the session there are some squares where you can exploit the relative powers. An example: Ventus can call Sparky from Lilo & Stitch and use him to steal Points from opponents. At the end of the path you will get all the rewards, new skills and upgrades you have conquered. This particular play in the game can also be used in the multiplayer session of Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep. In fact, it is part of the four multiplayer modes available in the product which provides for the presence of up to a maximum of six human players (depending on the session played) in the same game via an ad hoc Wireless connection in versus or cooperative mode, or in other mini games from the world of Disney Town. In addition to entertaining users with friends, the multiplayer of this production serves a thousand other things: for example, to collect medals to exchange in the Moogle shop with rare items such as spells, equipment, synthesis materials and commands. Oscar technical sector As for the technical realization, this Square Enix title leaves you positively amazed. Looking at the game, it's almost hard to believe from a visual point of view that this is a production for a portable console. The graphics of Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep, in fact, for level of detail and beauty has nothing to envy of the previous productions for PlayStation 2. The polygonal models of the various characters are treated in detail and well reproduced, the textures that cover them are well defined, the scenarios in general appear refined and can count on an excellent choice of color palettes. In all this good things we see only occasionally some slight loss of polygons, but nothingrelevant given that they are sporadic situations. The sound component of the product is no less. Everything is clean, clear, defined, from the characters' steps to their voices, with an English dubbing entrusted to world-famous actors such as Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from Star Wars), Leonard Nimoy (Spock from Star Trek), James Woods and the ~usual~ Christopher Lee (Ansem the Wise) moving on to effects in combat up to those of spells. Several films were then revised for this western edition of the product and not only in terms of shots but also in terms of direction to simplify the understanding of the story, usable without problems for anyone thanks to the subtitles in Italian, good albeit with some translations in our opinion not optimal for the names of some techniques. Not forgetting the soundtrack: the music bluntly is simply superb. Most of the songs are unpublished, with the exception of the opening theme similar to that of the first Kingdom Hearts and those present in a couple of worlds that by heart seem recycled from the previous chapters of the series. However, all of them lend the right atmosphere to each scenario in which they accompany the action of the users.", "date": "2010-09-07", "grade": "9.0"}
