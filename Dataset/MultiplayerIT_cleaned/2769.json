The last decade has seen an explosion and a total transformation of the mobile panorama, has seen trends and fashions pass, genres establish themselves and decline within a few months, but strangely Fruit Ninja has always remained outside of all this, remaining stuck in its first chapter, updating itself with integrations and special events but without wanting to reinvent itself to go back to competing in a fundamentally different environment. We must think that the Halfbrick title arrived in 2010: at that time Candy Crush Saga did not yet exist, FarmVille was doing great and the first mobile phenomena emerged on the small (by today's standards) screen of the newborn iPhone 4, among which a place of honor was immediately conquered by Fruit Ninja, in those first gameplay experiments focused on the most basic uses of the touch screen. Considering where we have arrived, with the most advanced gaming experiences such as those also present on Apple Arcade, it is understandable that the series has not found many outlets but for this reason this new chapter is particularly intriguing. What new ingenious ideas will have been developed to relaunch an archaic formula like that of the original? What daring mixtures of elements and gameplay hybrids will they have come up with in Halfbrick? Well... in fact, none, to be honest. Fruit Ninja 2, in full action, looks exactly like the original from ten years ago, with the need to cut the fruit on the fly by rubbing your finger on the touch screen like obsessed, now as then without taking too long to aim or go for the subtle, to be honest. The work done by Halfbrick on this sequel is more about a marginal enrichment of the gaming experience, expanding the various modes, improving graphics and technical elements and adding something more between swords and special abilities, but leaving the core of the original gameplay essentially intact. Which on the one hand guarantees the safety of a functioning and well-established game mechanic but on the other hand, obviously, eliminates any factor of originality and surprise. Fruit cutters The great success of the first Fruit Ninja also derived from the ability to build the gameplay entirely around the user interface: in a period in which mobile video games were still immature, often trying to transfer console experiences to a portable context and colliding, in the meantime, with the huge rock of the control system, Halfbrick together with a few others managed to establish itself by putting the difficult touch screen at the center of the experience and building the game around it. The success was overwhelming, also because the intuitiveness of the controls added the possibility of playing quick games with sessions on the fly, adapting perfectly to what would become the standard use of many video games in mobile format. Fruit Ninja 2 arrives in an era of maturity of the medium even on these devices, yet it demonstrates how its basic mechanics are always fresh and appreciable, thanks also to the particular formula derived from the lively setting and the graphic style adopted. In fact, there is something extremely satisfying about cutting various types of juicy fruit on the fly and seeing them pop or divide perfectly according to our cut and all this has remained the same ten years later, aside from some marginal graphic enrichment . Where, on the other hand, the developers have worked the most is in the game modes and in the side elements that enrich the situations and types of challenge in which to take part: presenting itself as free-to-play, Fruit Ninja 2 offers the player a series of different options to take part in and a form of personal progression that gives a more complete meaning to the action, providing objectives to be achieved and rewards to be obtained. The different styles of play create a functional variety to always keep the interest high, allowing you to experiment with numerous variations on the main theme that manage to remove a monotony that would otherwise be physiological in such a simple game mechanic. We are therefore faced with different ways to follow: timed challenges in which we have to cut as many fruits as possible while being careful to dodge bombs and obstacles, real mini-games always based on cutting fruit but built in such a way as to provide always different challenges, classic mode in which we have to cut all the fruits but staying atttry not to hit the wrong targets and many other variations that are unlocked progressively by advancing through the experience levels. There is also a multiplayer mode whose dynamics are not always completely understandable but which also increases the sense of challenge and the idea of advancing in the game by becoming stronger and more skilled. This whole progression system fits perfectly into the free-to-play mechanism with micro-transactions, moreover: the fact of constantly setting objectives to pursue, the possibility of customizing the protagonist in terms of appearance, sword and skills are all elements that easily become monetizable. To underline this there is also the presence of real season passes that can unlock much higher bonuses if you purchase the additional packages, just as happens in many current multiplayer titles. Gems and currencies can be won by playing, but there is no doubt that progression without spending real money requires a lot of time and dedication compared to the micro-transactions route, which however is not imposed as semi-mandatory, if anything.", "date": "2020-11-25", "grade": "7.8"}
