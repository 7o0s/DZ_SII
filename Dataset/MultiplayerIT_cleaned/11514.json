Once the game was launched, the choice of having to immediately install a patch to add the online part and new features seemed very questionable to us (we don't know if it was dictated by technical problems or not). After this process it is finally possible to access the game, and immediately notice the interface, which if in a so-called ~common~ title assumes a mere functional role, in Gran Turismo 5 Prologue it is treated in detail, with a dashboard topped off with weather information, a calendar with upcoming (even real) scheduled events and the currently selected car against a suggestive background, such as that of Kyoto. Many little goodies dear to Yamauchi and which may have delayed the release of the game for a few weeks, but knowing the character they can largely fit. Fortunately, the same care has also been placed in the creation of the manual inside the game, truly exhaustive in every aspect and which certainly deserves a reading as in few other cases. The part purely at the service of the gameplay is divided into two large sections represented by the offline mode and the online one, which we are going to analyze in order. Abandoned the much hated (at least by this writer) driving license system, the game offers a small initial budget (in credits), which allows you to buy your own car among the medium/low range ones of the various manufacturers present. The list of cars, slightly higher than the Japanese counterpart (which in any case has been updated accordingly) stands at around seventy units, which also include versions of the cars in racing mode and the presence of the Ferrari brand, an absolute novelty for the series . In this sense, we confirm the 2007 version of the Ferrari F1, which can be purchased for the modifable sum of two million credits, which translates into dozens and dozens (and dozens...) of hours of play. The races available start from mono-brand competitions available directly inside the particular manufacturer's shop, to continue in the so-called main one, called event and divided into three categories, each made up of about ten races. We obviously start from the lowest one, in races divided by traction, power, type of machines admitted but also special ones like the one in which you have to overcome all the other fifteen opponents in one lap. Ready to go! The maximum number of participants has in fact been brought to 16 players, while the tracks available are six plus their ~mirror~ variants and see the introduction, compared to the Japanese version, of the one called ~High Speed Ring~, which, as presage the name is equipped with long straights and curves to be tackled almost flat out, except for one. In addition to the Eiger Nordwand, seen in GT HD, the well-known Suzuka, Fuji Speedway and the Daytona oval, special mention should be made of the London track, decidedly impressive from a technical point of view and made up of numerous bends and changes of direction , a feast for the eyes and for the pad. By completing all three categories of races (just get the bronze medal in each) you access the advanced tuning mode of the machine parameters, which we will discuss in a special paragraph. A final addition is represented by the split-screen mode (obviously horizontal) for two players, which turns out to be a good way to challenge a friend but which is not integrated into any particular competition. Finally Online The first point of contact with the online part of the game, if we exclude the Dashboard which downloads information when the console is connected to the Internet, is represented by the news channel and above all by GT TV, a sort of virtual theater from which it will be possible to download episodes automotive themed and other video content about the game. To date it is only possible to download the introductory video, but we hope that soon this channel, which is very interesting on paper, will be adequately fleshed out. By selecting the Arcade item, you access the time trials, which are enriched by the online ranking system, divided by car, track and manufacturer, a good incentive to use this mode several times, act on the various parameters and try to file up to the last tenth of a second the time in the track. It is also possible to download replays of the top ten finishers, in order to study their trajectory and see what type of configuration they used. We have finally reached the real online mode, available through the appropriate item in the menu. Polyphony has chosen to create specific events each equipped with particular prerequisites also connected to the offline mode, a sort of continuation in which, however, the advsaris are made up of people instead of the computer, again up to a maximum of 16 players. Competing online also allows you to receive credits based on the type of placement, and thus replenish your wallet to proceed with the purchase of new cars. As a network technology, the Japanese developer has opted for a dual system, which provides for a host player if he has a good connection, or a so-called ~mesh~ type network, in which all the players are connected to each other. During our tests we obtained generally good lag results, with some shots of the opposing cars in races with 16 players or in fairly crowded periods of the day, but in general our online experience can be defined as positive. Driving Technique and Model If there is one aspect in which Polyphony has never failed, it is certainly the technical one, and also in GT 5 Prologue the results, especially as regards cars, are extraordinary. It is impressive to flank an opposing one and feel that sense of fullness and definition which in fact sanctions the construction of the machines as close to the definition of photorealism today, also thanks to the effects of light and the skilful use of colours. The realization of the circuits alternates peaks of excellence, such as some passages in London, with much more normal glimpses, such as those of the Eiger Nordwand, but in general it is above average, especially as regards the lighting system (the blind exit is beautiful after the High Speed Ring tunnel). As per tradition, the frame rate is set to sixty frames per second, ideal for a car simulation, even if on several occasions and in conjunction with a large number of cars on the screen, the graphics engine bends to slowdowns, which fortunately remain well limited to these situations. The work done with regard to the sound sector is equally valid, where the programmers have been very good in diversifying the various roars of the engines and making them as close as possible to the real ones. But how do you drive this Prologue? First of all, it is possible to immediately change the type of gearbox, the wheels and the assisted controls such as braking, traction and stability, the real difference, however, is the selection of the driving model, chosen between standard and professional. In the first case, the sensations received are more or less the same as in the fourth chapter, with little possibility of spinning or being penalized for driving dirty. The situation changes quite a lot in the case of professional driving, where all the bumps in the track, the displacement of the aerodynamic load, the type of traction of the car and the changes in direction are more perceptible, all factors aimed at increasing realism and making the driving model in step with the times, which still does not come close, even by choice, to sacred monsters of the simulation genre such as GTR for example. It goes without saying that to fully enjoy it you need to use one of the many steering wheel models supported by the game, which once mastered really allow you to influence the times traveled on the track and rival those who hold the track records. Driving Technique and Model Also because, once the three categories of the event mode have been successfully completed, it is possible to access the rapid tuning of your car, modifying values such as aerodynamic weight, braking power, compression ratios, camber and more, with the possibility also of assign up to three quick settings to the steering wheel or pad, to change the configuration while racing and then exploit them based on the type of curve or straight ahead to be tackled. Therefore, if the driving model seemed satisfactory to us, we still have some reservations regarding artificial intelligence. The cars certainly appear more combative than in the past, and it is not uncommon to see one going off the trajectory or going off the track for a long time, however situations still arise in which the usual ~trains~ occur and overtaking in series when approaching a bend by braking to the limit and risking a little. Comment Let's get straight to the point, GT 5 Prologue is currently the maximum technical expression in terms of car games, it offers an adequate driving system (very much with a nice accompanying steering wheel) and is starting to show good potential both in terms of settings and online mode. However, we would have expected a slightly lower price, especially as regards the download version, and perhaps a section dedicated to the mechanical tuning of the machines, which is missing. However if the Prologue represents a light appetizer of what ved we'll be in the fifth chapter proper, we can't do anything but rub our hands and gloat at the idea of being able to use all the settings that the game offers on many more cars and tracks, together with a more consolidated online mode (in fact, there are no rooms and voice chat, not a small flaw); meanwhile all those who can't do without the series and in general a good grand touring driving simulator, which is completely absent especially on PlayStation 3, should absolutely keep an eye on it. Pros Extraordinary creation of the cars Good driving system Finally online Cons Few tracks and cars Some slowdowns Price a bit high", "date": "2008-04-02", "grade": null}
