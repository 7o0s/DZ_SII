Leaving biased is always a mistake, but after the last three or four games of the series, between numbered chapters and spin-offs like Judgment, it was really difficult not to fall into the trap, underestimate the work by pointing it out as another Gears, a series that made plenty of time. But with Gears 5, The Coalition has done an impeccable job, applying some innovations to the classic formula which, although they have made some players turn up their noses, have allowed the series to look far beyond its claustrophobic dogmas. They talk, you shoot! Now that the game has been enhanced thanks to Xbox Series X and the new Xbox Series S architecture, it's time to go back to talking about what is undoubtedly one of the most badass action games - sorry for the term but we don't believe there is one a more suitable one - of recent years. We could start by talking about the plot, but in all honesty if you are interested in the Gears 5 script it is because you are passionate about it, and if you are passionate about it you will most likely have already played it on Xbox One or on PC, where it has been available for about a year . However, this is a review that wants to focus on the fluidity of the Microsoft offer, capable of making this game, but not only it, a title designed to survive and thrive in the ongoing generational change, a situation that usually requires new products from every point of view. view to be fully appreciated by the user. Gears 5 on Xbox Series X, the platform where we tried it and completed it again and with enormous pleasure, will in fact be a full-fledged next-gen game for many, able to amaze through new graphic settings and a response to commands that perhaps it has no equal in the field of modern shooters. A leap that brings all the graphic features that made it a good sight on PC to consoles, to which are added further improvements on which the developers have worked to make the debut on the new Microsoft gaming machines a real event. Calibrated adrenaline Don't worry, you who don't know the characters and situations: even if you haven't played their predecessors (which you can still do with your new Xbox thanks to the ecosystem's full backwards compatibility) it only takes a few seconds to understand everything you need to do drag from the action. The bad guys are the locusts, they come out of the ground, and the good guys are the COG, an elite body that fights them with devastating weapons but that the people, exhausted by the war, now see as a handful of fascists capable of doing more trouble than solutions. Gears 5 does nothing but carry on this war scenario, while trying to bring out the simple psyche of its rich cast in the best possible way. Don't expect anything profound, although many steps forward have been made since the first game: Gears remains and will always remain the game with chainsaw rifles, where you cut enemies in two and enjoy the rich dose of adrenaline introduced through the pad into our nervous system. This last feature, a little too watered down in the last few episodes but which returns to levels of excellence in Gears 5, is here proposed alternating with more contemplative phases, where the calm of exploration will be an appetizer to the hell of combat. If, on the other hand, you always keep the volume at maximum, at a certain point the user may no longer perceive the effect, getting used to the very high octane experience and thus making it partially ineffective. With Gears 5, The Coalition has learned to better balance the playlist of emotions, resulting in a game that is much more impactful than one would expect. Perfect aim Already in its original version, Gears 5 has perfected every key aspect of the series: the cover system, the mobility of the characters, the feeling of the weapons which are now many more than before. If in the first games you ended up inevitably attached to walls and low walls, trying to survive between bullets and explosions, now similar situations are always the result of a player's error, and not from the immature emptiness of the control system. Gears 5 from this point of view is a perfect Gears, but it is precisely in the controls that this new version for Xbox Series X takes a further leap forward. When we tried the game on the new Microsoft console for the first time we had mistakenly attributed the precision in the commands, especially in aiming, to the new pad and its still excellent analog sticks, later discovering that this precision was the result of a latency between the immiWhen pressing a command and its on-screen response reduced by 36% in story mode, and by 57% in multiplayer. This change translates into an extraordinary feel, which is hard to go back and which we sincerely hope becomes a standard in all games in which you aim and shoot, including the upcoming Halo Infinite. We have never witnessed such precision with a pad in hand, we are really one step away from the unrivaled mouse thanks also to an acceleration calibrated to the millimeter. Unreal Engine latest model Graphically, Gears 5 on Xbox Series X is very, very similar to its PC counterpart played at maximum detail. Here too we have a splendid dynamic 4K that seems native and a 60fps that doesn't blink, although in some details and in some reflections, this new version shows what further months of perfecting the engine can do. We don't know if this feature, together with the more vivid reflections, the unchallenged video cleanliness, the more precise shadows, the lighting that makes extensive use of the latest Unreal Engine features, will also arrive through a patch on Windows platforms, but at the moment it is just that and without a doubt the best Gears 5 of the lot. Status that also gains by virtue of the 120fps, at least for those who can afford them, and with which it is possible to make the multiplayer travel for a competitive experience of exceptional quality.", "date": "2020-11-05", "grade": "9.2"}
