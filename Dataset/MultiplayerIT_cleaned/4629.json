The mix between a game system extremely similar to Dark Souls in its foundations (but which then detaches itself from it by creating an action that is even more brutal at times), with the scenario of feudal Japan and its folklore, has been able to enrapture the players from all over the world, becoming one of the most popular titles on the market. With just days to go before the PlayStation 4 exclusive expires and the full edition arrives on PC, let's take stock of the latest downloadable content and what NiOh stands for as a whole. It's all over? The narrative arc of The End of the Massacre takes place a few months after Honor Contemptuous and does nothing but put old frictions back on their feet, inserting here and there references to that Maria who has definitively become the fulcrum of events. Forget the possibility of seeing all the various branches of the story closed and, for those who expected a conclusion to the events of the beautiful Hispanic, there will be bitter tears to cry. Difficult choice to ponder and even more to digest: we will find Maria again as the probable focal point of the obvious sequel to the Team Ninja title, but the player will not feel betrayed and abandoned for this reason. As we have become accustomed to since the release of NiOh, it is not the narrative that dictates the rhythms and qualities of a game that makes its true essence of brutal and satisfying gameplay. The three main missions, whose recommended level is 217 (we tackled them with about fifty levels less and we can assure you that the difference is substantial) take place in well-designed environments that bring together everything good seen in the progression of Team Ninja's work. If the news around Onore Sprezzante were focused on expanding the maps and making them even more articulated from a level design point of view, The End of the Massacre refines this technique, giving us some of the best glimpses both from an aesthetic and functional point of view . What benefits most are the boss fights (still half a dozen) that are finally managed expertly. So forget very small arenas dedicated to gigantic demons: in fact, there will be huge creatures, among the biggest in the title, but all the clashes will reach peaks of spectacularity and fun that bare the growth of the team, culminating in a final battle that is as beautiful as it is surprising . We're not going to spoil the surprise, but know that we'd pay to see your expression when you realize ~who~ you're dealing with. All this makes us understand, if there was still a need, the amount of work that the team has generated in these 8 months since its release. We are not talking about content cut from an already mammoth work in itself, but a trio of DLCs that creates a real expansion capable of rivaling most of the large productions of recent years. Playstation 4 trophies Also this time the thirteen trophies (all bronze) present will confront you with the need to carry out the missions and complete specific challenges. Of course, there is also the trophy dedicated to reaching the twentieth floor of the Abyss, which will require a lot of dedication. Killing time Leaving aside the forgettable pun in the title of the paragraph, what really impresses with this DLC is Team Ninja's willingness to give away dozens and dozens of hours to all those who can no longer do without NiOh. In fact, we talked about the main contents of this package (to which, to be honest, a handful of new Yokai, weapons and armor should be added, albeit no new classes specifically). However, going to sift through the actual news, you will notice a further new difficulty that adds even more spice to replayability and a totally new mode. The Abyss, this is the name of your worst nightmare, lives up to its epithet by throwing you into the fray in a series of encounters of increasing difficulty, which will lead you to choose your moves carefully. Each floor that you will face will in fact be divided between the possibility of facing a series of hordes of demons, useful to simplify your life with the boss on duty (but at the same time able to reduce your resources anyway) or immediately the bad guy: if you are you to emerge victorious, you will be free to leave and bring to the surface the amrita obtained and the weapons found. Added to this is a totally new mechanic that has to do with the contamination of weapons and the possibility of making them even stronger and more peculiar, but provided you completethe floor of the Abyss, under penalty of losing what you have invested in terms of raw material. On the contrary, if you feel brave enough to try, you will be able to go even deeper and collide with enemies that are more and more challenging every time, with the risk of staying dry and saying goodbye to all your loot. We are certainly not talking about an absolute novelty of the kind, far from it, but it is still an interesting addition, capable of giving further hours of blows on the teeth (especially yours). To close the package we think about a technical aspect that has remained substantially unchanged, albeit with greater cleaning and better use of particles and some atmospheric agents.", "date": "2017-10-06", "grade": "8.5"}
