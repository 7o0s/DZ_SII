The very latest edition of Electronic Arts continues the path prompted by FIFA 08 and tends to polish various aspects aimed at increasing realism, and which find the maximum interpretation in multiplayer and the real strength of this edition in the stores . The extreme defender Kak and Chiellini welcome the player on the initial screen while the trademark of the series that appears as soon as the title is launched is the game arena that precedes the menu and which further expands the possibility of training directly at the start. In fact, by pressing the select key, you access a superimposed screen thanks to which you can select the scheme to try, beat penalties and so on, and where there is also the possibility of impersonating the goalkeeper, one of the most visible innovations of FIFA 11. The main menu has been redesigned and does its honest job even if it doesn't shine for usability; as always, the news compared to the previous chapters are highlighted by a special writing next to each of them and a sort of blackboard on which various statistics relating to the player are also always visible on the right. Like PES 2011, we weren't able to try out the whole part dedicated to online - which we'll leave to a later special - and also in this case we can limit ourselves purely to the description, where among the various head-to-head, enhanced club mode and matches between virtual players also stands out that 11 against 11, the first time ever thanks to the ability to control the goalkeeper. Obviously we immediately dived into impersonating a new Buffon rather than Casillas (in this case for his better half): the view is the classic one from behind (but it is possible to change it), with the right analog it is possible to dive in the desired direction , with the circle you enter a slide for a catch or on the opponent's feet while with the rest of the buttons you can call the ball or the various patterns including offside. Finally, with a special menu it is possible to choose whether to display the trajectory of the ball with a red line and the position to keep on the pitch, a possibility that should not be underestimated because the impact with this mode requires a little training to avoid conceding a goal at each opponents shot. The result is, if we want, engaging in terms of identification and satisfying after having averted a danger, but even if with the select key it is possible to move the camera over the action and use the keys to encourage or advise the players, in this configuration they are even more accentuated the downtime when the game develops in midfield or in attack, which mitigates the fun a bit. Footballers you become Going back to the options part, the first thing that caught our eye was the replay room. As always it is possible to save them and share them online and then review them later, the nice thing is that at the end of each game played there is an item in the summary menu called ~highlights~ with the list of the ten most important that can be displayed individually and in the same way saved to be hosted in the aforementioned room, the only limitation is in the maximum number, rather low, of those that can be saved. Another interesting item is the one reserved for personalized music and chants: in fact, it is possible to upload your own tracks (from the dashboard) for all the teams and as regards entering the field, the victory or defeat of the team, a specific competition or the chants general; really very tempting for fanatics of customization. The editor linked to teams and stadiums has remained rather unchanged with basic changes to names and little else, the players' one instead does not allow you to edit the name, surname and features of real players - probably due to the FIFA license - while is definitely complete and deep for those created from scratch, the famous virtual footballer who can be used in different game modes. In FIFA 11 the old ~Be a Pro~ and managerial management have been merged all together in the career, which this year allows it to be tackled in three differentconfigurations: player, coach and player coach, which represents the synthesis of the first two. In the latter case and after having created our virtual footballer with all the trappings of the case, we were greeted by an interface that provides various well-known options such as squad management, transfers with various filters for searching for players and the news section. The part dedicated to the transfer market seemed to us a little more realistic in the transactions managed by the CPU, although overall the managerial part is too simplified to be able to even minimally compete with that present in the dedicated titles. The same section used for relations with management is reduced to an endless sequence of email communications that are soon ignored because they add little or nothing in the identification phase. In any case, when you access the calendar with all the friendlies and official matches, there is a welcome possibility in addition to simulating the match, or taking part in it as a professional player or in command of the whole team. In the first case the player created according to the dynamics already seen in the previous chapters is used, in the second there will still be the presence of one's own virtual footballer and the aim will always be the same, that is to bring him to improve his characteristics and in general to successes with your club. The interesting thing is that while the improvement of the performance of the real players is delegated to the classic training screen seen previously, that of the virtual footballer is linked solely to the ability with the pad in hand, continuing what was done with the previous chapters: in any mode you are in fact, including the arena, every action from simple to more complex ones allows you to unlock challenges, which are highlighted in the upper right corner of the screen as trophies; for example, 3 consecutive short passes scored increase the score relating to the passing ability of one's own virtual footballer by one unit. To keep track of everything, there is a special diary-shaped menu that illustrates the available challenges (and there are so many) as well as the conditions for overcoming them, a very interesting way to continue playing but also to learn and experiment with all the gameplay variants that FIFA 11 has to offer. More real than real Beyond this excellent progression, the unintuitive menus and above all the game modes represent a bit the weak part of the Electronic Arts production, as they know what they have already seen and do not offer great incentives to be addressed. Where in fact World Cup was a significant step forward in this sense thanks to the menus, the direction, the atmosphere of the match and the official license of the competition complete with logos and more, FIFA 11 accuses a bit of the lack of these components and competitions that reflect the real ones, as well as greater attention to what happens in the stands, in the direction of the salient moments and in general everything that establishes the atmosphere and identification around a football match. Also because the number of licenses for teams and players is truly impressive, there is also Serie B and the introduction of the Russian Premier League which are added to a database capable of satisfying all the tastes of football fans. The only discordant note and on a par with PES is represented by Palermo, which does not have an official shirt and logo, while even in our review version all the transfers from the summer transfer market are already present. Among the many stadiums, referees and even boots there are high-sounding names that define the novelties of the gameplay: Personality+, Pro Passing, Fight for Possession and so on exemplify novelties and changes related to the simulation of the game, we will leave them to marketing and instead we will worry to explain what has changed compared to the past. In fact, once you take the field, the feeling with the players is immediately familiar and the continuum with the previous chapters is perfect; control is now total and the response to the commands convincing, with the right playing times, good spacing on the field and in general the possibility of replicating a remarkable variety of realistic manoeuvres, thanks also to the new animations that accompany the movements of the protagonists in field. In this regard, the similarity of the players with their real counterparts has undergone an improvement especially for the more famous ones: finally there is a diversification of the movements between these and the others, with less flattening than in the past. In reality we are not yet fully satisfied because it is enough to observe good but less famous players to accuse the same shortcomings as always and aa still unconvincing posture, although the situation is clearly better than in the past. The physics of the ball appears ~heavier~ and more coherent in the reactions to shots and passes and is especially noticeable in crosses which have a greater variety, such as those aimed towards the goal which are perfect for spearing the goalkeeper with his head and cheering in the face of the opponent. The trajectory of lobs has been made even more ~dirty~ and therefore it becomes more difficult to perform in easy goals in front of the goalkeeper or even from the edge of the area. Even the physical contact between the players is finally more perceptible and differentiated especially when they are pressed from behind, where, also on the basis of their physical size, they are able to defend themselves with their arms or with their whole body, with some goodies such as protecting the outgoing goalkeeper . The FIFA series is then on the shields when it comes to manual controls and the 2011 edition is no exception. In the options menu, in fact, Electronic Arts has made the management of passes, crosses and shots even more detailed and customizable, a real godsend for those looking for extreme realism and want to have total control of their players. Only the analog trigger, which changes the stroke based on the amount of pressure on the right trigger, does not work properly because to perform 360-degree dribbles you still have to avoid pressing it, making this progression useless. Playstation 3 trophies FIFA 11 offers 42 Trophies, of which 4 are gold and 7 are silver. The bronze ones are linked to various actions that must be done in the match, such as favoring a playmaker goal rather than scoring after a tight cross in the box. Others are obtained with your own virtual footballer, participating in the various competitions also present as a goalkeeper rather than becoming a legend in career mode. There are several trophies associated with the online part of the game, the classic ones are obtained after a certain number of games while the more difficult ones provide for a large number of consecutive victories against other human opponents. Like watching TV The icing on the cake is the hand ball, which together with the rest allows the game to have a simply unattainable variety of actions, together with a realism enriched by many goodies such as the progressive fatigue system, which indeed seems to be more sketchy than anything else in this edition. We also have small improvements as regards the defensive lines of the opposing team, less aggressive and more wait-and-see, and for the goalkeepers, who only sporadically suffer from amnesia in some shots rather than superman skills in others. The pace of the game is what we liked the least perhaps in its default configuration, too frenetic for a simulation that tends so much towards realism, fortunately it is possible to lower the speed and resolve the perplexity just expressed. Dulcis in fundo the technical sector, which as the rest of the review suggests sees as always excellent and perfectly linked animations, with the addition of increasingly defined field textures and perfect fluidity. The physical representation of the players and faces has been improved, as already mentioned above in the article, but it is still visibly behind the competition, this is especially noticeable in medium and low level players, but also in some more famous ones such as those at the level of a Cavani or Rossi, which are a far cry from their real life counterparts. The match commentary is as always entrusted to the Caressa / Bergomi duo and does its honest job: it has improved technically in the transitions between one comment and another even if the anecdotes about teams or fields still seem too ~detached~ from the rest.", "date": "2010-09-28", "grade": "9.3"}
