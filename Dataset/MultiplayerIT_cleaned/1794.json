{"name": "K - Hawk: Survival Instinct", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/k-hawk-survival-instinct.html", "text": "The gameplay The game begins by directly catapulting our heroine (incredibly saved, no one knows how) Kate Hawk onto the beaches of the island, with a voice of the ~command~ who will tell us what to do: Coleridge with his ~Suspension of Disbelief~, he will be turning over in his grave. Our task will be to get to this phantom colonel and at the same time cause as much damage as possible to the island. At our disposal we will have a tool that will allow us to go unnoticed very easily and that is a sort of Radar that will show the ~Line of Sight~ of the various enemies, that is their field of vision, typically represented by a sort of cone. Within this area you will be detected, unless you are hidden by a wall, or some natural obstacle. If you are identified, the enemies will try to kill you and warn their companions: once discovered, the senses of the enemy guards will also be more ~acute~ and therefore more attentive to their surroundings (and you can notice it from the enlarged field of vision). You will also have to be careful to avoid making too much noise so as not to attract the attention of enemies, while in more advanced missions you will also have to deal with the classic cameras. In case you are discovered, you can use the weapons that you will have at your disposal, if things really go wrong; strangely the game starts without any weapons available, not even with a weapon that allows you to stun enemies, a classic element in this genre of games. Not without flaws... The game takes place in environments ranging from open space, with large valleys and many natural hiding places to indoor environments. K Hawk, is not an excessively difficult title, indeed it is all too easy to go unnoticed by slalom at full speed between the visual fields of the guards, raising a great noise and breaking dozens of twigs (as per clich), yet the enemies do not seem realize it. At times, however, it can also become excessively frustrating, given that for example the damage model is not perfectly calibrated (guards need more and more shots to be killed, sniper rifles do not do their job, etc.), or for some apparently dead-end situations if not with the use of force, a symptom of not perfectly accurate play testing. The AI is therefore one of the weaknesses of the game, and it is something that matters a lot in this genre of games, the other is that of the immersion factor: for PC the masterpieces of this genre are undoubtedly the games of the Thief series , and even Deus Ex, and feeling involved is something that certainly helps in the overall appreciation of the game. In K-Hawk, in my opinion, one has the feeling of participating in a story that is a bit far-fetched, whose atmosphere is certainly not helped by the graphics, of a level a little too inferior to today's productions. In conclusion... Ultimately, K Hawk is not necessarily a bad title: there aren't such big and heavy flaws (except perhaps the AI) that affect everything, its main fault is perhaps that of failing to involve the player, given that you don't is sufficiently motivated to continue in the game. So if you are looking for a good stealth game, remember that Splinter Cell will arrive shortly, and that in the future Metal Gear Solid 2 itself will land on these shores. K Hawk therefore, is perhaps a title that could have been successful in the market a few years ago, but by now the genre has evolved considerably. Pros For some it could be a diversion Fluid even on systems that are not the latest fashion Cons Underdeveloped Artificial Intelligence Graphics quite sparse Not very innovative K Hawk K Hawk, produced by Similis and distributed by JoWood, fits into the genre of Metal Gear Solid-style stealth games. The story sees such Kate Hawk, a SEAL, helicopter pilot, bring one of his companions into the skies of an unspecified island to allow him to complete his mission and that is to kill an anonymous colonel. Unfortunately, something goes wrong and the island's SAM defenses shoot down the helicopter... and the last thing we see is the helicopter crashing into the island's waters.", "date": "2003-01-22", "grade": null}
