Although tennis is a sport that has been in an irreversible crisis for some years in our country, there is no doubt that the Sega Hitmaker game has achieved great success in the arcades scattered across our peninsula. His strong points have always been the remarkable visual realism of the images on the screen and a gameplay that is as simple and immediate as it is deep and realistic in the execution of the shots. The same qualities are immediately traceable in this conversion of Virtua Tennis 2 which remains identical, or nearly so, to the Dreamcast counterpart. In fact, we find the same game modes (world tour, tournament, exhibition), the same options and the same, winning, game system. There are still 16 athletes (8 men and 8 women), chosen from among the more or less well-known champions of the ATP and WTA professional circuits. The only addition is represented by the certainly not phenomenal Japanese tennis player Ai Sugiyama who replaces Helena Dokic for licensing reasons. For the rest, we find the two terrible Williams sisters, the Kafelnikov bomber, Patrick Rafter, one of the last representatives of the serve & volley style of play, and other colleagues, probably less known to the general public, but nonetheless equipped with a good technical background. Arcade or Simulation? For those who have not had the opportunity to try the game on Dreamcast, I am going to present the main features. Virtua Tennis 2 was born as an arcade tennis game and, although its appearance is the most realistic one can admire in a sports simulation, the arcade soul is immediately grasped as soon as you pick up the PS2 controller. All shots, and they are undoubtedly many, can be performed using only two buttons, one for topspin and one for backspin, plus the inevitable button for lob. Pressing the analog buttons involves executing a different shot each time which will be more or less effective depending on the different pressure level of the analog buttons and the position of the body with respect to the ball. The development of the rallies is, in most cases, very frenetic and spectacular, and it is not uncommon to see long and exhausting dribbles from the baseline conclude with a lightning forehand (or backhand) on the counterattack or with a rapid descent to the net, winning the point with a masterful volley or with a smash worthy of the bionic man. As for the game modes, the inevitable World Tour stands out, which allows us to create a player (or female) from scratch, to shape his body and face to our liking, to dress him according to the dictates of the latest sports fashion and finally to train him until he reaches an acceptable level of play. Training, and therefore the consequent technical progress, takes place gradually by participating in a series of mini-games ranging from knocking down pins placed in the opposite half of the tennis court to hitting targets of all kinds from different positions each time. Once we have refined our shots and strengthened our physical skills, we will be able to decide to take part in tournaments on the international circuit, to climb to the top of the rankings and world championships, and finally to qualify for the most prestigious competitions, the classic grand slam tests which here take on a different denomination. The tournament mode, on the other hand, represents the definitive solution for those who do not have the patience necessary to complete a long career and allows you to take part in one of the available tournaments of your choice. Finally, the unmissable exhibition mode which gives us the keys to the wildest fun that can be found in such a game. I'm obviously referring to the multiplayer mode which can accommodate up to 4 human players willing to beat each other up both in very tight single matches and in exciting doubles sessions. You can give more.... From a technical point of view, little or nothing has changed compared to the original. We could have expected some aesthetic improvements due to the greater power available to the PS2 but instead we have to settle for a simple port that has preserved the initial appearance while having to give something up to the Dreamcast version in terms of texture and image cleaning. The result is still pleasant and still valid despite the fact that the latest generation consoles have shown that they can do much more. However, VT2 boasts the best animations in the sector, relying on the phenomenal motion capture that has seen the shots of the 16 champions present in the game perfectly reconstructed. As far as it goesrda the sound, everything remained unchanged. So expect the usual engaging music and sound effects, perhaps a little fake, but still effective. Finally, the presence of the 50/60Hz selection screen should be noted which, at least in this case, does justice to the mistreated European consumers. Game, Set, Match Virtua Tennis 2! Virtua Tennis 2 is once again THE ultimate tennis game. Although radical changes are still to be expected, it is currently impossible to find a better electronic representation of the splendid racket sport. It is almost superfluous that I suggest the purchase to all fans of the genre, to those looking for a multiplayer title with infinite longevity and to anyone else who wants to approach a discipline that in Italy, never as at this moment, needs new adepts. I'll wait for you on the playgrounds, virtual and not! Pros: Almost perfect conversion Playability to the stars Simple, immediate, irresistible! Animations always great Cons: Nothing new Games last at most one set Graphics a bit dated The expected conversion Virtua Tennis 2, THE tennis game, finally makes its debut on PlayStation 2 in the conversion of the acclaimed simulation that landed some time ago on that masterpiece churning machine called the Dreamcast. A few years have now passed since the arrival of the first chapter in the arcade, but Virtua Tennis has succeeded in the difficult task of setting a game standard that is still unrivaled, despite the countless attempts at imitation and the technological advances made by the consoles on the market. Virtua Tennis 2 (better known as Tennis 2k2 in America) has repeated the success of its predecessor and, after having delighted the few, intimate Dreamcast users, it finally seems ready to present itself to a slice of the public of considerably greater proportions, to those 40 million video game enthusiasts who have purchased the PlayStation 2 to date.", "date": "2003-01-07", "grade": null}
