Even way back in E3 of 2016 we had the opportunity for the first time to see in action what was originally a ~simple~ mini-game of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. At the time, CD Projekt's goal was to distribute a competitive, multiplayer and free to play card game on the market, which however also offered valid entertainment for lovers of narrative and single player experiences. In fact, the original project envisaged real single-player campaigns to be purchased separately and which served at the same time as a very long tutorial on the mechanics of Gwent, and as a palliative for lovers of Geralt and associates waiting for a fourth chapter of The Witcher or of a spin-off that we will probably see only after the release of Cyberpunk 2077. However, something must have jammed during the processing and after a handful of graphic restylings, some substantial changes to the game mechanics and a beta session that lasted a year and a half, the initial idea was literally broken into two parts. On the one hand there is Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, the original multiplayer game that has finally reached a definitive and stable version, and on the other we have this Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, a single player experience set in the world of The Witcher that it bases all its gameplay on the mechanics of the card game, however, alongside a long story narrated like a visual novel. But is Geralt there or isn't he? Avoiding any risk of spoilers like the plague, we will limit ourselves to saying that Thronebreaker is set a few years before the events narrated in The Witcher trilogy. The character at our command is Meve, the beautiful queen of Rivia and Lyvia who will find herself involved in ruthless court games and terrifying conspiracies while her kingdom is set on fire by the second war with Nilfgaard. At a narrative level we can consider the title divided into five different acts, each based on a distinct setting in order to justify the meeting with the different races that populate the universe of The Witcher and above all to motivate the great variety of cards that we will find to use and deal with. All for a longevity that has left us absolutely surprised: we doubt that you will be able to complete the story in less than 18-20 hours; the writer has employed about 24 trying to collect every collectible scattered on the maps. We can hear the question echoing in your heads: what game is this Thronebreaker actually? Consider it a title with two very distinct souls. On the one hand we have the Gwent matches which we will return to later and on the other we have the ~exploratory~ part where the plot points, the dialogues and we prepare to face the clashes take place. In this phase we will be able to move Meve within a map with an isometric view from above, like a sort of Diablo but with a style that recalls numerous JRPGs: the colors are vivid and the look is almost cartoonish, with the characters outlined by very marked strokes, on the border of cel shading. During this game component we will have to wander around the environment in search of resources that we will need to upgrade our camp and therefore to create new cards for our deck, but we will also be able to collect some well-hidden collectibles (which are then used to unlock decorations and other cards to use in multiplayer Gwent) and above all we will find ourselves interacting with the other characters and assisting the continuation of the plot. Meve, during her long journey of war, escape, rebirth and revenge, will be accompanied by numerous characters, many of whom are quite well known in The Witcher book universe, and she will find herself interacting with many subjects. In these phases, the game view will change showing us the dialogues with a style that is very reminiscent of the visual novels with the partially animated figures on the screen that limit themselves to changing poses and expressions according to the chatter. There are also several phases narrated like a book and, while lacking in all cases a real multiple choice dialogue system, the player will be left with the possibility of deepening some exchanges and above all we will find ourselves very often having to make complex, and sometimes even violent and unpleasant decisions, in the classic style of the series. The consequences of these actions will be visible graphically since the game world will change in some details depending on what we do, and there may also be consequences on the cards that we will be able to use or that will become part of our deck. TOSome may even choose to leave us because of an unpopular choice. The mechanics of Gwent Also on this front Thronebreaker can be conceptually divided into several distinct parts. In fact, when the game places us in front of the need to face an opponent, be it human, dwarf, beast, elf or monster, Gwent comes into operation with three variations on the theme. On the one hand there are in fact the classic clashes - best of three rounds and without any kind of modification to the deck that we have painstakingly built - which unfortunately are also those present in smaller numbers. In most cases, in fact, we will find ourselves facing card game matches with special rules that substantially alter or modify our deck and with only one round available. There is also no shortage of puzzle-fights where only certain cards will be granted to us and we will have to solve the battle by studying the precise order in which to use them. The result is that we soon realize that the deck construction phase, despite the number of cards available to the player being quite substantial (while remaining very far from the size of a Hearthstone or a The Elder Scrolls Legends), is quite superfluous. Spending hours studying the best combinations or determining the number of cards or carefully analyzing the special abilities is of little use, given that the style of the clashes almost always favors direct attacks or in any case cards that can do damage, invalidating the which is the basic mechanic that distinguishes Gwent from all other card games: disorienting the opponent to force him to consume all his cards. However, we must, at the same time, praise the work done by CD Projekt as regards the variety of opponents. Although you find yourself facing dozens of matches (probably hundreds) during the game, the enemies have always different decks and there are also very original clashes thanks to some excellent design ideas used to differentiate the battles. Precisely speaking of the deck construction phase, Thronebreaker presents a sort of management component concerning the camp that we can ~summon~ at any time during exploration. Here we will be able to spend the three resources collected around the maps (wood, gold and recruits) to build and then upgrade some buildings that allow us both to unlock and improve some cards, and to access some bonuses and battle skills. The actual cards can then be created by spending the same three resources up to a maximum of five of each type. There is no mechanic to ~disassemble~ the possessed ones in order to recover the reagents: in fact, in Thronebreaker the cards are not ~unwrapped~ but simply earned by continuing in the campaign or created starting from those unlocked in the camp. What is Gwent The game rules of Gwent are quite simple. The match is based on the best of three rounds. Each player starts with ten cards in his hand and will be able to draw new ones only at the beginning of the following turn (three cards) or if some special ability of his cards allows him to do so. In each round it is possible to put a single card of your choice on the ground by placing it on one of the two bands that make up your half of the play area (three in competitive Gwent) and which represent the area of the melee fight, or the ranged one (or the one reserved for siege weapons). Cards can be special abilities or creatures, the latter with a specific strength value. The winner of the round is decided by the sum of the strength of all the creatures put on the field when both players choose to pass their turn without taking any action. Gwent is a very tactical game where the player must learn to read the opponent's moves and possibly bluff by choosing whether it is better to put down yet another creature to try to overcome the challenger's value or whether to keep the best cards for the next round . The artistic component It's difficult to talk about a technical aspect for a title like Thronebreakers as it is a card game. However, there is the exploratory component that deserves a few words to be described and judged. As we have already mentioned above, in this phase the game shows a look with bright and bright colors that could apparently clash with the typical darkness of the world of The Witcher. In reality, this cartoon-like artistic aspect almost highlights the more dramatic and violent aspects of the game, creating a sort of dissonance that increases the sense of unpleasantnessfor the most immoral and negative actions that we will find ourselves carrying out even when we choose to act on the basis of the lesser evil. Furthermore, all the special effects concerning the flames, the particles and also the use of lighting highlight the great technical competence of CD Projekt which is not resized in the slightest despite this obviously being a less showy project from a graphic point of view. Let's spend further notes of merit primarily on the design of the cards and the game table which move away with great vigor from what we saw in Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. The quality of the illustrations is excellent even when we are faced with the animated ones and what happens in the game is always well highlighted by the effects on the screen without these ever being distracting or overwhelming. The dubbing in Italian is also excellent and, more generally, the sound throughout: the voices used all seemed perfectly in the part and help to deal with a title that by its very nature requires the player to spend a good part of the time listening (and reading ) what happens to the protagonists of the events.", "date": "2018-10-18", "grade": "8.0"}
