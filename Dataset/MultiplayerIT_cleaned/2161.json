{"name": "F1 2002 Pal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-2002-pal.html", "text": "TWO OPTIONS... Having made the necessary premises, I will proceed to analyze the title in question. The presentation is short but suggestive, after a few seconds of loading the main menu appears. We can choose between: Quick Race, 1 Player, Multiplayer, Options and Credits (thanks). If we choose a fast race, we will be able to tackle the following circuits for 4 laps: Silverstone, Hockenheim and Monza. The other tracks will become available as soon as the points necessary to open them are reached. For example, to compete in Monte Carlo we will need 100 points. To earn points we will necessarily have to place ourselves among the top 6 in a race. In the fast race we have traction and assisted braking, an indestructible single-seater and the absence of rules; the number of laps is fixed at 4 and we will start from the last position on the grid. No doubt this mode is ideal for familiarizing yourself with the control system. The 1 player mode is the most 'full-bodied', after having selected it we can choose between: challenge mode, grand prize and examine player (statistics). The challenge section is a series of time trials (similar to the driving license section found in the Gran Turismo series for Playstation) to be overcome to unlock the grand prix mode, which was initially unavailable. There are 20 tests to overcome ranging from braking at the right time to respecting the flags displayed by the marshals on the track. In addition to these challenges, there are also 'on the track' tests in which we will complete a lap of the track and we will have to stay under a time limit for each of the 17 tracks. Once this obstacle has been overcome, we will unlock the Domination mode (in this section of the game we will be called upon to face an entire F1 season with the obligation to win all the races: a titanic undertaking to say the least). Interesting is the fact that, for each of the 37 tests overall, we can choose between: normal control or simulation. If we opt for the normal control we will have aids such as TCS and ABS as well as a very gradual steering response. If we face the test in simulation mode we have more time available to complete it but controlling the vehicle will be much more difficult; in this last case, the steering response is very fast, perhaps too fast, probably designed for the use of a steering wheel. Still in simulation mode, we can choose whether or not to activate TCS and ABS. It goes without saying that to enjoy a realistic experience you need to turn off the aids. THE CONTROL SYSTEM Let's skip the menus for now and talk about the visuals and the control system. There are four views available, two internal (from the camera car above the driver's head and from the driver's seat) and two external (close behind the single-seater and low front, GT style with rear mirror up in the centre). Undoubtedly the most playable view turned out to be the one from the camera car (complete with mirrors) even if the fastest is the GT-style one but with the latter you don't have the size of the single-seater on the screen which is essential for setting trajectories precise. The controls of the F1 cannot be customized and there are only 2 types of configuration for the controller which are: type 'A' and type 'B'. With type 'A' we can: accelerate by pressing the right trigger or moving the right stick up, brake by pressing the left trigger or moving the right stick down, steer (in an analogical way) to the right and left by moving the left stick or steer (digitally) by pressing the directional cross, up a gear with the green button, down a gear with the red button, take a look behind us with the yellow button, engage reverse with the blue button (only in normal), scroll through the views with the white button, see the replay of the last 30 seconds with the black button, pause with the start button. With type 'B' we will instead have: gear on the triggers, accelerator on the green button, brake on the blue button, reverse on the red button (only for automatic gearbox). The other commands are the same as for type 'A'. The pad performs its function well if we choose the 'normal' mode; the latter is 'arcade' as we have traction control (TCS) and assisted braking (ABS) as well as a simplified physical model. If instead we opt for the simulation mode, well the gameplay changes, for the worse though. It is practically impossible (if not after innumerable attempts) to tackle a fast curve in a precise manner; it is not possible to set a 'smooth' trajectory due to the excessive sensitivity given to the analog stick (in practice there is no dead zone and the response is not linear). Thus, we will find ourselves continually correcting the trajectoryia zig-zagging along the entire width of the track, constantly risking going off-piste (in the challenge mode it means having to retry the test). The story changes for the slow corners or chicanes as, on these occasions, you turn completely without having to dose the steering. From the above it can be seen that the use of a steering wheel with pedals is a must if you want to obtain a rewarding driving experience in 'simulation' mode. GAME MODE Let's go back to the game modes. After analyzing the challenge mode let's deal with the Grand Prix mode, the heart of the game; in fact, from this menu we can choose between: Single Grand Prix, Custom Championship, Full Championship, Companion Challenge and Domination. If we choose single Grand Prix we must, after having selected one of the 22 available drivers, set the options of the event which are: Opponent level (easy, normal or difficult), Duration of the race (4 laps, 8 laps, 16 laps, half or full), Interactive stops (enabled or disabled), Weather (variable, dry or wet), Damage (enabled or disabled), Gearbox (automatic or semi-automatic/manual), Tire wear (enabled or disabled) , Petrol consumption (enabled or disabled), FIA rules (enabled or disabled), Faults (enabled or disabled). Once this is done we can choose a track among the 17 of the world championship. After a short loading (at the end of which we will be able to see a demonstration lap of the track) we have to select the control mode between normal and simulation; once this last choice has been made, 4 options are available: Free Practice, Qualifying, Warm-up and Race. If we have chosen the simulation mode, in the pits we have the possibility to modify the following parts of the car: tires (compound and pressure), aerodynamics (front and rear with values ranging from 1 to 20), suspensions (front and rear which offer ride height, suspension travel, spring rate and anti-roll bar adjustments), brakes (balance and brake force), gear ratios (short, medium, long or custom) or revert to default (default) . If we had chosen the normal mode in the pits, we will only be able to select the type of tires to be fitted. The same goes for the personalized championship and the complete championship, with the only difference being that in the first we will be able to choose between a minimum of 2 events up to a maximum of 17, while in the second we will face the entire championship. In Buddy Challenge mode, the goal is to reach the finish line before your stablemate by competing on all tracks. Once this is done we will be 'promoted' to a more important team. To complete this challenge we will have to be faster than all 11 teammates we will face, within the 17 races of the world championship. I've already talked about the Domination mode. SOME MULTIPLAYER For the Multiplayer section we can choose between: Time Trial, Team Race, Advantage and Elimination Race. In these modes you can challenge up to 4 players simultaneously in split-screen (split screen) and up to a maximum of 22 overall. Let's go straight to the last menu, the options one. Here we can change the audio/video settings (volume adjustment, video format, on-screen indicators,...), the language, the type of control (A or B) and finally we can choose whether or not to automatically save our progress . STOPS IN THE PITCHES Brief parenthesis on pit stops. We can choose between: interactive stops or automatic stops. We can define the interactive stops as semi-automatic as we will have to carry out: 2 braking operations (one for entering the pit lane bearing in mind the speed limit and one for approaching the actual pit), one steering (to the right, immediately after the last braking), engaging first gear (with the green button) and finally restarting (attention, it is necessary to wait for the signal from the computer). During the stops it is possible to 'admire' the mechanics, all made completely in 3D (obviously, as in reality, each team has a different suit) and very well animated. GRAPHICALLY SPEAKING Ok no more menus, I've bored you enough, let's now move on to the graphic aspect of F1 2002. At first sight the game makes a very good impression. The single-seaters, apart from the absence of tobacco sponsors, are treated in detail, even the pilots' helmets appear identical to their real counterparts. The circuits are all beautifully made, the number of polygons that characterize them is very high; you will happen to get distracted at the sight ofFerrari flags, present in large quantities, on the grandstands. The public is also large, both in the grandstands and on the lawns surrounding the circuits. After a careful analysis, however, I noticed that, at close range, the textures lose quality. Those used to make grass and sand appear too simple and flat, the ones chosen for asphalt are better. But let's forget the bump mapping we admired with Halo, the EA title doesn't use it. Sin. Fortunately we console ourselves with the reflections on the bodies: remarkable. The whole track is mapped in real time on the latter. The same goes for the shadows: based on the position of the sun, the single-seater will project its shadow on the track. Praise deserves the implementation of the rain effect, truly amazing. The track will gradually get wet until real pools of water form; in the latter the sky will then be reflected, creating an effect of great impact. Furthermore, every game view, including replays, will actually be 'hit' by numerous drops of water: these will create an ultra-realistic effect of distortion and blurring of the image, just like in reality! SOME PROBLEMS... The visible distance is around 700-1000m depending on the circuit; this depth of view is more than sufficient to prepare yourself to face the curves correctly. The sensation of speed is excellent, very realistic; the fluidity or rather the frame-rate is, however, rather low (let's say far from the level reached by Rallisport) regardless of the complexity of the scenes displayed. This phenomenon is seen almost exclusively at high speeds, roughly from 200 km/h upwards; on these occasions it seems that you do not exceed 20fps. I must also say that very often, when tackling a slow curve, there are phenomena of slow or incorrect video updating, one has the sensation that the image moves in an unrelated manner (for example, first the upper part is updated and after a few moments bottom), especially when making 180 degree turns. The latter phenomenon is however negligible as it does not affect the playability of the title. However, F1 2002 is a very enjoyable game from a graphic point of view, the fact is that from the Xbox hardware it is legitimate if not right to expect more in this respect. DRIVING MODEL Let us now focus on the driving model offered by the game. As already widely anticipated, we actually have two models available: normal and simulation. The 'normal' type is suitable for the so-called 'casual gamers', i.e. those who don't want to bother with settings and are keen on immediacy. The 'simulation' type is recommended for realism 'maniacs' who will spend hours and hours refining their driving style. From the point of view of gameplay, I have already stated my opinion when I explained the control system. From a technical point of view, the simulation mode is very accurate, it will be enough to accelerate a little in advance, e.g. in a slow corner, that the F1 will spin. The possibility of controlled drifting and the 'recovery' of the car with prompt counter-steering are excellent. Positive is the fact that all the changes made (in the pits) to the single-seater will influence its behavior on the track. There are many adjustments available, only missing: convergence and camber. An important lack in my opinion, however, is the telemetry. We don't have the possibility to analyze in detail the information that allows a more accurate adaptation of the single-seater to the circuit to be tackled. As difficult as it is rewarding is the 'simulation' experience without the aids. The only drawback is the sensation that acceleration from a standstill is assisted, in fact it is not possible to carry out a 'classic' 360 degrees starting from a standstill with the wheels turned. In my opinion, however, to take full advantage of the valid driving model offered by F1 2002 it is necessary to have a steering wheel with pedals. If we use the pad to play, we will need hours and hours of 'training', above all, to master the steering (in simulation mode). CRASH TESTING AND AI A few words regarding the damage that the cars may suffer; if we decide to activate them we must be very careful not to 'touch'. Even if the cars are more resistant to shocks than in reality, they are damaged progressively (the damage adds up). Suppose you damage the right front suspension, for example after a violent accident", "date": "2002-04-20", "grade": null}
