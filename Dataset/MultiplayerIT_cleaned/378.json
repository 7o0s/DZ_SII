{"name": "Tomb Raider: Legend", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-legend_c.html", "text": "It is probably useless to dwell on the plot of Lara's new adventure, given that it is now well known. Rather let's focus on the playability and technical transposition on PsP. Tomb Raider: Legend appeared immediately as an almost new title. Even without making excessive innovations or distorting the ~concept~ at the base of the series, in fact, the types of CD have managed to give a different imprint to the Eidos title, transforming it. Especially in terms of gameplay. The control of the main character is finally excellent, very intuitive and manageable, and recalls what we had enjoyed in the Kain saga. This has a positive ~repercussions~ on gameplay which, while maintaining the classic ~puzzle-resolution, action-jump~ format, takes advantage of these modifications especially in the exploratory and combat phases, enhancing them. A concrete example of what has just been said can be found can rediscover in one of those moments that have always characterized the saga: the leap towards a handhold.If in the past, making a leap towards a rock outcrop was often problematic and you had to put yourself in absurd positions to find the ~right point~ to stand out the flight, sometimes even with the heels fixed on the edge of a chasm and the soles of the feet suspended overhanging, now everything is handled differently and is disarmingly simple, as is the possibility of launching from lianas or rocks in non-standard directions that take full advantage of the game's 3D engine, without forgetting some additional elements such as the Real Time Events, strongly inspired by Shenmu, designed to vary the phases of the adventure. Once again the fights will be a complementary element of the adventure. Also in this case the immediacy of the controls and the immediate execution of the commands by Lara means that the spectacular element of the firefights is emphasized. Although a greater and more complete interaction with the environment has been implemented than in the past, however, an aspect that gives Lara the possibility of throwing objects at enemies or aiming explosives previously placed in the vicinity of an area, for example, these turn out to be globally undemanding. To confirm this, just think that the various Med-packs of the situation are always at hand and that the ammunition of the basic weapon is infinite. For her missions Lara will be able to count on a respectable paraphernalia, such as to make even Ethan Hunt of MI pale. In addition to the canonical double pistols, in fact, our heroine will have at her disposal weapons such as rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, and useful trinkets for every situation, such as personal light, a computerized viewer and a PDA to control the objectives, etc. However, the paperback edition of TR:L is not without its flaws. First of all, from the gameplay point of view, there is a lack of a second analog stick in the PsP, an element that in the home version on other platforms allowed the user to easily manage the shots (partially obviating those that are not exactly very happy by default - Ed) , which has forced the programmers to make do by attributing this function to the L and Square keys, which respectively cover the functions of automatic centralization (single pressure) and manual management of the framing (continuous pressure), which, understandably, in its execution difficulty tends to break up the action at times, particularly near the most dangerous areas. Technically this conversion suffers from the same problem as the other versions, namely a not exactly constant frame-rate, especially in the more aesthetically complex areas, while on the graphic level, if on the one hand there is a positive highlight, the character design of Lara Croft , much more intriguing than usual and successful, on the other hand, there is a texture sector that is not up to par. In this PsP version a new mode is available for two players in Wi-Fi (a simple timed race), which, combined with the mega-mansion of the Croft family to explore, full of puzzles to solve, almost a game within a game, raise a little the longevity of the title compared to the home versions. Conclusions Even with several situations recycled from other titles of the genre and not, and with some inevitable flaws, TR: L proves to be one of the best titles in the series. Fun, playable, globally satisfying, the Eidos title is positively ~affected~ by the work done by the CD team. If we exclude the problems inherent in the management of the shots, all in all we are faced with a globally well-converted game. Pros: Immediate control system. Fun to play. Good variety of situations. Cons: Unstable frame rate. Texture not althe height of the potential of the PsP in some environments. Let's face it: how many of you still hoped, after the disappointments suffered in recent years, to review, at least one last time, an adventure of the splendid Lara Croft up to the excellent second chapter of Tomb Raider? Few, for sure. Maybe nobody. Yet things don't always go as expected, for better or for worse. Fortunately, we add in this case. In the global videogame panorama there are still software houses that manage to learn from their mistakes, even if sometimes late, and to change, to put a stop to their past to avoid fossilizing themselves on outdated and at times monotonous game styles and concepts, at least in the light of the ~most advanced~ similar products in circulation. This is the case of Eidos, which, aware of the fact that its Tomb Raider series really needed a good ~freshening~, had the brilliant idea of entrusting the task of renewing everything to one of the best English teams around, the ~fathers~ of the Legacy of Kain series, Crystal Dynamics (Studio Crystal D), joined for the occasion by the creator of Lara, Toby Gard, as a consultant. This unusual pairing has thus given birth to this Tomb Raider: Legend that we are going to analyze thoroughly, whose good success found in its previous releases on Xbox, Playstation 2, PC and Xbox 360 has pushed the producers to release it on PsP.", "date": "2006-09-06", "grade": null}
