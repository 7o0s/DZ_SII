{"name": "Cooking Mama 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cooking-mama-2-recensione.html", "text": "Cooking Mama is one of the most commercially successful examples of the new Touch! Generations by Nintendo (although it is not a first party title, however). A cooking simulator, that is a simple but innovative idea, enhanced by the possibility of exploiting the tactile controls of Nintendo DS, in order to create an interaction system that otherwise would probably have been anything but fun. Like other titles of the new generation of games dedicated to ~casual~ or simply non-gamers (regulars), the result is difficult to include within the typical dynamics that, for a gamer, identify their favorite hobby. Nonetheless, the success was enormous, precisely due to the opening implemented by Cooking Mama towards a vast audience that was able to interpret and appreciate the Majesco title (505 Games, here) precisely for its immediate essence, as a filler for a few minutes to be taken in small doses. In addition to this, there was the possibility of really learning some recipes, within the vast repertoire of dishes to be made in the game, ranging from Japanese to more traditional Western cuisine, and the advertising campaign seemed to focus on this in a particular way . In short, success has probably come to a greater extent than what the publisher himself would have expected, helping to consolidate this new videogame wave dedicated to casual and less demanding games: with these prerogatives, the sequel was an obligatory choice for 505 Games, which in fact promptly produced, after the first episode dedicated to Nintendo DS and Wii, this Cooking Mama 2 which continues in the line defined by the original predecessor. Invitation to dinner with delight The expression ~more of the same~ may seem overused in recent years, but it is a fact that the market approach that focuses on serialization leads to a flattening of the contents for the numerous sequels that appear on the market. Cooking Mama 2 is a classic example of this type of sequel: its entire structure derives from the first episode, even a good part of the action is exactly the same as the original, simply adding some side dishes and new recipes to complete . On the other hand, the game dynamics offered very few alternatives, but for its part, the development team really did everything not to take advantage of the possibilities to modify its structure. In essence, it is about preparing a large amount of dishes from various international cuisines, using the Nintendo DS stylus in various ways, through various stages: from preparing the ingredients, to mixing them, up to cooking. Within all this, there are the mini-games that make up the system on which the gameplay is based: slicing, dicing, kneading, mixing, etc. they are part of the various actions that we will have to simulate on the console's touch screen with short and quick stylus movements. The correctness of the movements and the right timing will decide the success of the single operation, on which the final result depends (and therefore the goodness of the cooked dish). There really isn't much to say about the gameplay: Cooking Mama 2 is the son of that line of games that base all their appeal on the discovery of the Nintendo DS tactile interface. In summary, the whole game is reduced to a simple movement of the stylus on the screen, even in a rather guided manner, and divided into very short sessions. The general characterization manages to amalgamate these small fragments of the game by creating a unitary structure, from which it is however difficult to expect a certain depth, which to tell the truth is not sought by Cooking Mama's ideal audience, nor by the developers. The news The subtitle of this second chapter, ~At the stove with friends~, presents the situation chosen as a background to the game, and could erroneously suggest a new propensity for multiplayer, which instead, although present, is not able to satisfy more than that, as we shall see. There are essentially two game modes: the first is the classic one, which allows us, under the careful guidance of Mama, to learn a large number of recipes by performing what is told to us step by step. The second mode, the one that we can define as ~history~, instead leaves the helm entirely to the player, who will have to complete the recipes without Mama's support: however the phases unfold, the preparation goes on, but by accumulating errors obviously the final result will be insufficient, or ~inedible~ in the worst cases. In this section the ~friends~ of the title come into play, who are then the subjects to whom the delicacies (or presumed tali) on which we commit. It is clear how difficult it is to expect from Cooking Mama 2 a real progression between levels, or a certain variety of situations: in fact, the variation is linked to the large amount of recipes available, while the objectives consist of the score ( to which various medals are associated), from unlocking new recipes and from obtaining various objects and prizes that can be used to change the kitchen or the very appearance of the characters. There is a new multiplayer mode, which however appears rather limited: instead of offering a serious ~versus~ or ~co-operative~, the multiplayer game simply allows you to run the short single minigames, extrapolated from the preparation of the various recipes, in a contest of speed and precision. It all stops there, without offering a satisfying challenge with a minimum of thickness or a valid alternative to normal game action. Liveliness and colors The design of the game is perfectly in line with its predecessor: a cartoon look of Japanese origin, all tending towards stylization, simple lines and bright colors. The effect is pleasant and tending towards that ~cuteness~ (in Japan they would say kawai!) which is characteristic of genres intended for a casual audience, or openly dedicated to female users (even particularly young ones), remaining anchored to old preconceptions. In any case, it is an excellent interpretation of the culinary world for a video game, certainly very apt, albeit with an obvious, little use of the graphic possibilities of Nintendo DS. Few animations but a large number of well-designed dishes and different ingredients create the right graphic balance in a game that definitely does not need to push on the technical sector, but which could run the risk of falling into the squalid, and instead is captivating and cheerful thanks to its particular character. It is definitely a Japanese game, from all points of view, and the trait adopted to represent characters and dishes fits perfectly into the stylistic features of the casual genre from an oriental point of view. The musical accompaniment is part of the general festive atmosphere, and supports the fast and fragmented action with lively and catchy, although not exactly memorable, melodies. Some sampled phrases have been added to the repertoire of the first chapter, with Mama now able to say, with a strange accent mixed between Japanese and English, the result of our performances in the kitchen. Comment It's never easy to judge a game like this. From the point of view of the average and passionate gamer, it is often difficult to grasp the qualitative depth of a game aimed at that new segment of the public called ~casual~, for which there is a tendency to leverage elements other than those that traditionally constitute a nice video game. So here we are having to analyze Cooking Mama 2: the title in question is basically a collection, not too assorted, of mini-games based on the touch screen, as we have seen several on Nintendo DS, with extremely limited depth. More than the others, it has a good characterization and the fundamental fact of being based on the cuisine, which makes it original and attractive to a vast audience. To the detriment there is the scarcity of additions and innovations compared to the original, and a multiplayer mode that is absolutely devoid of depth. Those who didn't appreciate the first (and among these we imagine a large part of traditional gamers), will not find reason to be interested in this second, but those who have stripped the original will be able to immediately immerse themselves in this extension of the same game structure, which brings behind defects and merits of the first chapter without however being able to still count on the ~absolute novelty~ factor.
