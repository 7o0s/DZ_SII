{"name": "Chili Con Carnage - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chili-con-carnage-recensione.html", "text": "Massacre with irony These are nothing more than super moves capable of exterminating many opponents in a few seconds in the most devastating and crazy way possible, perhaps with a barrage of tornado-style bullets. By eliminating enemies, you can acquire various bonuses and extra skills, very useful for advancing in the game. One of these bonuses even allows you to go back in time by a few seconds, thus restarting the action from the point where it was at that precise moment. By obtaining certain scores or finding certain rare objects, it is finally possible to unlock new scenarios for the alternative modes ~Style~ and ~Survival~, or the ~El Macho Mode~. Too bad that in the face of so much material the adventure goes on with a certain linearity in the missions and that the control of the Pg and the cameras are not always perfect. Chili Con Carnage also offers an interesting multiplayer section, even a double mode, ~Donkey~ and ~Fiesta~, which involve either the game in pairs with a friend with a single console (challenges in turns), or the ~traditional~ in Wi -Fi for up to 4 participants (one for each console and with a separate copy of the game). That CCC is a totally crazy game can already be understood by seeing the first scenes of the game. Colorful graphics, absurd even if not very detailed settings, characters based on the stereotypes of certain criminals from Central America in comics, that is megalomaniacal, moustached, rough, but also clumsy and funny. Like the genetically modified super-momas who raise bomb chickens. These are made with not many polygons, but nevertheless appear equally well characterized and can boast of very respectable animations. On the other hand, the special effects such as explosions, lights, distortions and Matrix-like ~slow-motion~ effects are splendid, even if all this is paid for in the most ~extreme~ cases with a scrolling that is not always fluid. But it is the sound that takes the lion's share in Chili Con Carnage: dubbing entirely in Italian, with absolutely crazy and funny dialogues, Hip Hop music but with a strong Mexican ~tinge~ created, among others, by Control Machete and the Delinquents habit. Comment Chili Con Carnage is one of those third-person shooters without many pretensions, other than to give yourself a few hours of absolute fun without excessive difficulty. Which in some ways, given the ~function~ of such titles, is not bad. Seasoned with a deliberately ironic, unrealistic and therefore amusing violence in its fiction, the title Eidos seems to mimic certain films by Tarantino, for better or for worse. Recommended for those looking for a game that can offer them a level of challenge that is not high but at the same time complete. Pros: Very fun. Text/audio localization in Italian. Huge variety of weapons and things to do. Cons: Despite everything, not very long-lived. Some imperfections in the management of cameras. Take an old Amiga title, the splendid Chaos Engine by Bitmap Bros, add a pinch of violence, a dash of madness and a story that gives a nod to Quentin Tarantino's films and you'll have an explosive cocktail ready on the PSP. Chili Con Carnage is Eidos' latest work for the Sony portable console, a sort of ~sequel-parallel~ (the plot is conceptually almost a sort of ~what would have happened if...~) of the discreet Total Overdose, released a couple of years back on PS2, Xbox and PC. Developed by the Deadline team, the game is a third-person ~action-arcade~ with a strong humorous and violent impact at the same time. The story behind the title is as deliberately trashy as possible: in an alternative, fictional Mexico, the semi-deranged young Ramiro Cruz declares his very personal war against the local underworld boss, a certain Cesar Morales, guilty of having commissioned the murder of the boy's father on his birthday (by means of a threshing machine...). A ~conflict~ with no holds barred that will put the imaginary town of Los Toros on fire. The game modes are different even if the single one is the beating heart of CCC. The main adventure consists of around 19 missions set in 7 locations, ranging from chaotic Mexican cities to intricate local jungles. The gameplay is obviously focused on frenetic shootings and the use of weapons (many) and more or less conventional means to carry out the carnage of the case (you can use, among others, tractors, machines, forklifts, poultry shears, etc). Like a new Max Payne, our Ramiro can perform many moves and actions (even running up walls like Prince of Persia or jumping in slow motion performing authentic stunts in the air) to eliminate the cunning enemies present in the various areas,above all he must shoot in bursts to be able to load the appropriate combo bar to the maximum and then make everything flow into the delirious ~Loco Move~.", "date": "2007-05-07", "grade": null}
