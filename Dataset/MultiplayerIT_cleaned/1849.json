But the strong point, however engaging the story or various missions may be, is finally the inclusion of support for XboxLive; you will say: ~And what do we do with it since in the meantime it can't be used yet?~ Well a more than legitimate question, but in the meantime we can start enjoying the 20 missions for the single game and train and become ever better and more lethal for when we will meet mechs no longer guided by too preordained AI but by real human players like us who are playing from who knows where! Hand in hand, you will also have to develop the intelligence of how to use our big robot, and discover that shooting at mechs is not always the best solution to come out on top: imagine 5-6 mechs against you alone, but at the same time they are placed on top of a bridge (and note that you have a chance to destroy any object) what are you shooting at? The choice is yours, it seems rather obvious to me anyway it was to give you a simple example. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Mech Assault Mechs and their arsenals In MechAssault you will have at your disposal 18 mechs plus 2 hidden ones to unlock; they are (excluding the 2 to be unlocked so as not to spoil the surprise): Mad Cat, Timber, Wolf, Atlas, Prometheus, Owens, Hackman, Cougar, Puma, Uziel, Belial, Vulture, Mad Dog, Catapult, Bowman, Thor, Summoner , Uller, Kit Fox and Elemental. It goes without saying that each one has completely different characteristics from its ~comrades~: for example, the heavier mechs will certainly have more disruptive firepower, but at the same time they will also inevitably be slower and more awkward in moving than the lighter and at the same time quick. The only negative aspect of the game is related precisely to the mechs: in fact, in practically every robot game you will have the possibility to customize your beloved to your liking, customize it with stickers, modifications to lighten it, etc. etc. ; none of this unfortunately in MechAssault, however you will have a fair amount of weapons that will help you in your businesses. The weapons that your mech will be able to carry are essentially of 3 types: missiles, ballistic weapons and energy weapons. Through the triumph in the various missions it should be noted that you will have the possibility to optimize your armaments: in fact each of these categories can be upgraded for another 3 levels in addition to the starting base one; all obviously to obtain better performance: faster and more firepower. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Mech Assault Technical aspect From the so-called ~technical~ side we have to analyze, albeit briefly, the usual 3 aspects: controls, graphics and sound. You may wonder how complex it can ever be to control a gigantic robot: nothing more wrong; the programmers have managed to assign perhaps the simplest controls ever seen on Xbox and you will notice it by playing with it, when even the most complex moves will come by themselves and you will forget the complex (or at least questionable) controls in the GunValkyrie style. The graphics, on the other hand, are nothing short of exceptional: excellent textures, bump mapping, a good number of polygons on the screen (especially in single player) and almost non-existent slowdowns, accompanied by a good visual depth. But the strong point of the title is certainly another: the really possibility of destroying everything: whether it's a building, a bridge, other objects, trees and so on... As for the sound side, it seems to me that there is no need to add other than the fact that the game is fully compatible with DolbyDigital 5.1. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Mech Assault Concluding The time has come to sum up also with regard to this game: it will surely be a must for all fans of the genre, but thanks to its variety of gameplay and simplicity in the controls, it will surely win the sympathy of non-fans as well. Longevity, if that's your thing, is practically infinite because after having ultiAfter the 20 singleplayer missions you will finally be ready to jump into the fight on XboxLive. And as for the rest what to say: well, it is enough for you to know, as I have already said, that EVERYTHING can be destroyed and therefore means total freedom in one's choices of action. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Mech Assault The Mech game that will revolutionize the old conceptions of single-player video games is finally here. No longer just battles with an AI that seems limited after a while, but now (or at least since XboxLive will be available) we really have the possibility to face human opponents with human intelligence (or at least hopefully). It's almost Christmas, when I start my Xbox with its MechAssault DVD inside and for a few hours I'll be aware that good intentions will go away: it's time to blow up some mechs! Yes, you got it right: MechAssault, the game that will probably redefine the concept of multiplayer gaming on consoles is right here in front of me (indeed, inside my Xbox).", "date": "2002-12-28", "grade": null}
