{"name": "Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-angel-of-darkness-2.html", "text": "Who starts well... The game welcomes us with a sort of tutorial that shows us the ~bouquet~ of commands to use to make our Lara move. The dramas begin immediately as making our character move will prove to be one of the most difficult points of the whole game... The puzzles don't scare us and the lead will keep the opponents at bay that the plot will put in front of us... but tell me who's going to save us from making Lara Croft move? Right from the simplest movements, the protagonist points out the total absence of grace, even the response to our commands will be a feat because Lara, perhaps hard of hearing or perhaps due to the onset of a good arthritis, it takes some time to execute the command we have chosen, in short, even Lara Croft gets old and dull. Getting adequate answers from our character will be a real challenge and the main cause of our deaths within the game especially in the initial stages, in which we will have to escape from the Parisian authorities. Lara doesn't seem to worry about this in fact, despite the game, with short animated scenes, immerses us in a pressing atmosphere of hasty escapes to avoid capture and consequently the GameOver, the protagonist will be there, very woody in her movements and with her racing mode which instead seems like a slow muscle awakening. It is noteworthy (negative), the new feature of our noble archaeologist, which makes this chapter of the saga look like a real RPG. The novelty consists in accumulating experience as soon as Miss Croft performs certain actions. It won't seem real to you but you will get used to seeing the archaeologist break down a door or move wardrobes, and hear her recite the phrase ~I feel stronger~ accompanied by the appearance of an arrow-shaped symbol in memory of the event ~Level Up~ . It is true that from this chapter of Tomb Raider a product was expected that would bring a breath of fresh air to this now stalled saga but I don't find the new entries brought about by Eidos brilliant and effective at all. Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness is an inexhaustible source of surprises: the more we play it the more we will realize that this title is definitely not the product that aficionados of the saga expected. Lots of bugs Now let's talk about the graphic part of the game. The latter has been taken and fed to the bugs that will infest the game from the very last levels. The shadow system inserted in the game is not convincing or effective. Another evil that afflicts the graphic part of the game are the bad textures and models of the characters. Even if the settings of the graphics settings menu seem ~winning~, we will find it very difficult to believe our eyes. Do not forget also the background that should remind the city of Paris, you will notice it in the initial levels when you are on any roof of a building, an intricate image which reminds nothing but moldy wallpaper. The textures are completely out of place, for example the wooden planks are supposed to show off the characteristic grain of woody texture, but the planks in Angel Of Darkness only seem to have the right texture for a road made of gravel. This is just one of many examples I could give you but the observant player will see myriads of these imperfections over the course of the game. The 3D models of the characters and objects present in the levels, as I mentioned earlier, required all the effort of my eyeballs to be viewed and reviewed. Notice in the level ~The roofs of the industrial area~ when you have to cross the two buildings attached to the cable connecting them, you will notice the French police helicopter approaching and pointing its spotlights at you. Try to make out the features of the helicopter and you will feel a cold and narrow shiver run down your spine. Could I maybe spare the graphics quality of the cutscenes? Certainly not. And if you stuff all this with subtitles that are sometimes incorrect and certainly not faithful to the spoken word, and by the fact that Lara's voice continues to echo, but her mouth doesn't move; then your hopes of recovering your spirits, enjoying the cutscenes made in the way, will soon be dashed. The news hurts me I know Another novelty wanted by Eidos Interactive to bring ~good mood~ among users is the introduction of a new player character. I'm talking about Kurtis Trent, this emblematic boy who will accompany us in the adventure for some levels. We will notice the appearance of Kurtis on the streets of Paris where, intent on escaping, monterhe rides his two-wheeler and disappears through the alleys of the French capital. The introduction of a new player character within this new episode of the saga perhaps represented the spearhead of the title for Casa Eidos but in doing so it only gave even more negative nuances to this action game. Our Tomb Raider will make us remember, and the owners of the Sony platform know it well, Capcom's man-eating zombie saga, Resident Evil. It is true that taking ideas from the past, updating them and stuffing them with noteworthy innovations is a well-known process in the videogame panorama, but Eidos with its latest release has made a collage, with basic ideas that are probably winning if developed in a different way from the created , but apparently the art of collage is not the strong point of Lara's parent company which this time, let's face it, screwed up. All these things together strongly penalize the logevity of the game. After a few hours, the user will no longer bear Miss Croft's slowness and the constant bugs that make her appear merged with the walls of the buildings, this is just a small example of the ~wonders~ that await you in this title . After some time, the game also destroys the gaming enthusiasm of the most daring and gives the coup de grace with one of the slowest game times in the history of action games. I would also like to add, even if we enter into the personal tastes of the undersigned who must be recognized as having a very high rate of fussiness in his blood, that I hate the game start icon that the installation will place on the desktop. I can't ignore the fact that such a majestic game (in the name I mean) is on my screen under the guise of an abbreviation, TRAOD, which in my opinion is definitely not very effective from an aesthetic point of view and neither encourages nor entices players to try their hand at this video game. Salvation on the horizon Finally a highlight of TRAOD : The soundtrack. Engaging and crafted with supreme craftsmanship by the London Symphony Orchestra and its conductor David Snell. The music will never be monotonous and with the installation of EAX Unified technology we will always have excellent results. All the music within the game is very enticing and blends perfectly with the various situations that the game throws at us. With soft and sweet music we will completely immerse ourselves in the alleys of Paris and in situations of escape we will have the pleasure of listening to the virtuosity of the strings of the London orchestra. Another positive feature of the game is the possibility of completely installing this chapter of the series on our Hardisk, skipping the tedious steps of opening the package and inserting the game into our CD-Rom. By doing so we will save 5% of stress at the start which will lighten the impact of our senses with the features of the title in question. The system for customizing the game settings is not lacking in praise, in which we will have fun looking for the settings suitable for our system and our graphics card. In addition to the resolution setting, we will also find that of textures and reflection and refraction effects. The settings panel will let us notice the extreme versatility of TRAOD in terms of settings but don't delude yourself it can't work miracles. We will also have the possibility to adjust the volume of the soundtrack, effects and the audio quality of the same in the way that best suits us. Reflections In short, games of the Action genre have always worked and it was Eidos who had to write manuals on this, given the invention of the archaeologist who has been leaping on our screens for 7 years, what are you up to this time? Instead of doing a massive ~brainstorming~ on how to bring fresh air to the series, and remove the curse that surrounds the titles with so many sequels (a flattening of the plot and a poor contribution of novelty in the field of gameplay), home Eidos has clearly decided to churn out this product for us that will remain in the annals only for the points against it... Eidos should wake up and understand that by now Croft's sweaty shorts and fearsome cleavage can't hold up an entire ActionGame by themselves. A question I ask myself (and I think I'm not the only one) after watching this title at the end of summer: With what criteria and with what canons did Eidos look its latest creation in the ~face~ and say: ~This episode of Is Tomb Raider a valid title that will excite gamers?~ We may never get an answer on that. Pros:Engaging and well-crafted music Complete installation Advanced menus for customizing audio and graphics Cons: Too many bugs Slow and not very exciting Repetitive The sky shows no sign of wanting to stop dropping rain and darkness, while lightning, cutting through the air, illuminates the roofs of Paris. Paris...Paris in turmoil because of a madman, called ~the Monstrum~, a killer who roams horribly mutilating the bodies of his victims and leaving strange glyphs throughout the crime scene, code symbols of an arcane ceremony of which we still know nothing. We only know one thing. The seventeenth victim is our mentor, Prof. Werner Von Croy. We are furious at Werner's treatment of us, he abandoned us in the pyramid of Anubis in which we were imprisoned for a long time, losing hope of living and returning to our old job, the job that gives meaning to our whole life; our life which is now marked by the death of our guide, killed before our eyes. On top of that, the French police think of us as responsible for all this bloodshed. Our only foothold lies in the words of the now deceased old Werner: Obscura Painting. We will be hunted down the boulevards and ghettos of Paris, there will be twists and turns and whoever wants to put a spanner in our wheels... but after all, danger is our daily bread. Thus begins the last episode of the long and noble series of the heroine of the Eidos house: Lara Croft.", "date": "2003-08-18", "grade": null}
