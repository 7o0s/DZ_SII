In fact, the French company, while certainly not a master of originality, has taken on a leading role in the ultra-mobile market, a sector certainly less rich in certainties and totally virgin until very recently. As a pioneer, the company had to partly reinvent those same games that clearly ~inspired~ them, adapting and optimizing them to the new standards associated with full touch interfaces. The result was certainly fluctuating in terms of quality but there was no lack of valid titles, among which it is possible to include the Gangstar series. The last episode, Gangstar Rio: City of Saints, moves the action to the moral capital of Brazil (the political one is Brasilia in fact), between beaches, sun, beautiful women and fearsome gang wars. Very clearly taken from Grand Theft Auto, Gangster Rio: City of Saints is therefore a very classic free roaming, set in a heavily modified Rio de Janeiro. Blessed no longer by the imposing Christ the Redeemer located atop Mount Corcovado but by a decidedly less sacred statue of a mammoth ~setter~, the city of the most spectacular carnival in the world gives way here to its most dangerous part, to that undergrowth made of violence, trigger-happy, sex, profanity and all those things that so attract the generalist press when it comes to talking about videogames as ~absolute evil~. Carioca revenge Beyond the freedom of action which, as we will see, certainly does not leave a wide range of choices to the player, the main story has as its protagonist a ferocious killer and right-hand man of the boss Andreas who, after years of loyalty, has now decided to hang up his weapons and retire to private life. The coveted last assignment, however, despite a certain reticence of his girlfriend, proves fatal: in an explosive attack the surly girl loses her life and the former minion himself, who escaped by a miracle, is forced to undergo major plastic surgery which it actually turns him into another man. Thirsty for revenge and eager to become powerful and respectable again, Angel (this is the new name assumed after the operation) thus prepares to face the dangers of the Rio streets. With the city in the hands of the Assassinos and Discipulos gangs, in the grip of corrupt policemen and politicians, Angel will therefore be forced to resume criminal activity to find clues about the real perpetrators of the attack. Alongside this main mission, however, there will be many other parallel activities to be carried out to maintain the right network of contacts, accumulate money but above all grow in level and respectability. One of the novelties introduced in this episode by Gameloft is in fact the possibility of increasing the level of experience, spending the points obtained after each promotion to increase Angel's skills according to the parameters of strength, drive, aim and health. Pad (virtual) in hand, the impact with Gangstar Rio: City of Saints is certainly positive, especially for the numerous fans of the genre: in fact, the missions, short as they are, must be on a device devoted to mobility but at the same time varied and numerous (60 between main and secondary), represent a synthesis of all the traditional samples. There will therefore be shootings, chases, escort services, executions, ~special~ transports, thefts on commission as well as the traditional clandestine races. Each mission can be started in a standard way, that is by driving to the starting point or, for ultra-fast games, simply activating them from the pause menu: a truly intelligent choice, which helps a lot even in the event of unexpected failures. The simple and totally customizable control system allows you to suffer less than usual camera and movement problems typical of titles played on touch screens; obviously not everything is perfect but, compared to the competition, the situation has clearly improved. Particular attention also deserves the driving options for all available means, from cars to motorcycles via helicopters and planes, which can be piloted both with a system of analog levers and with accelerometers, in an immediate and fun way. However, what makes the game across the Alps far from any GTA of recent years is the almost total absence of action outside the main or secondary missions. In fact, between a shootout and a chase, fans of Rockstar titles know very well by now that it is possible to have fun simply by roaming freely through the streets of San Andreas, Vice City orLiberty City, sure to find a way to pass the time anyway; unleashing panic or engaging in various recreational activities with friends are now fully consolidated options. Strolling around Rio, on the other hand, there is little or nothing to do: a few bonuses left here and there, some buildings that can be explored for no clear reason, the possibility of repairing cars or changing clothes and, of course, the always well-stocked weapons and accessories. It is clear that, despite the pompous premises of Gameloft, the majesty of a GTA was certainly not claimed here, however from this point of view more could be done, also considering the absence of any online mode. The thorny issue concerning the technical aspect remains to be addressed, again full of ups and downs. If on the one hand there is in fact a good general impact, especially with the play of light outdoors (the effects of sunrise and sunset are very beautiful), the same thing cannot be said for closed environments and night-time parties. The models of the main characters are excellently made, especially the faces, while the supporting characters are made up of often repeated figures. The physics of the vehicles is certainly acceptable and driving is fun (the damages are present even if not always consistent with the collisions) but the steering angle is really very small; the character's jump and run animations are instead woody, a detail that clashes with its more than good polygonal realization. Despite the power of the latest Apple devices, there are frequent building pop-up problems; cars and passers-by, on the other hand, appear along the way gradually, starting from simple transparent sketches up to becoming ~real~ people and vehicles in polygons and textures. Finally, we point out the (not very welcome) possibility of cheating through microtransactions, which allow you to buy both extra game money and the option to suddenly increase the level of experience.
