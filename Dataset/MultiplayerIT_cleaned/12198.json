Produced by Ubisoft and out for all gaming systems, TMNT should resume the plot of the new animated film and boast the same settings. Not yet having the opportunity to know the story of the film, we cannot say whether or not the situations we will experience in the game are identical to those we will see in the cinema. In any case, TMNT adopts a very particular narrative style, which sees the ninja turtles remember together more or less recently experienced adventures: a comic book appears on the screen whose pages we flip through quickly and project us directly into the action. The stages can have a single protagonist or see the four Turtles act in collaboration, but there will always and only be one character on the screen, which we can eventually exchange with another by pressing a button. The game mechanics are simple, in practice each level offers a certain amount of platform action, interspersed with combat sessions which, in the end, lead to a boss fight. Deep TMNT offers only one game mode, and as previously mentioned we will have only one character to control, without any multiplayer nor with the other turtles controlled by the computer. Each level must be traversed in its entirety; and we are talking about really huge locations, which however we can only interpret in the way wanted by the developers of the Canadian division of Ubisoft. In fact, the view is blocked and we will have to do exactly what the game asks us, using a control system related to the screen which on more than one occasion has been conspicuously ~corrected~ to remedy any errors due to a sudden change of shot. perhaps while we find ourselves crossing a small bridge that overlooks an abyss. After the first stages, we will also have the opportunity to access combined moves between the ninja turtles, which will allow us to make longer jumps and which will also prove useful in fights. Fights that see us basically using only one attack, a rather effective combo but very limited in variety. It is accompanied by a kick that does not do much damage but which knocks the opponents to the ground and gives us the opportunity to ~catch our breath~, given that the clashes always take place in serious numerical inferiority and the only way we will have to defend ourselves is a sort of evasive movement, which makes us move the character rapidly from one part of the screen to another. In reality we will have the opportunity to use it very rarely, since the enemies usually limit themselves to taking our shots without almost reacting, apart from the boss. Technical realization Sound is rarely the strong point of a game, but that is the case with TMNT. Unfortunately we are not dealing with an audio section without defects, but it still boasts a certain number of advantages: the Italian dubbing is of an excellent level and the music is really well done. The sound effects, sadly, don't hold a candle to it. As far as graphics are concerned, we are on good levels but there are some problems that undermine playability, and they concern precisely the ~rigid~ setting of the game and its visuals: in some cases it is difficult to see what is there after a few meter, and maybe you end up falling. Indeed, in one case it happens to fall when you can see the road very well only a few meters below ... On the other hand, the characters are quite well done despite denoting a general lack of inspiration as regards the enemies and the settings. Huge, as already mentioned, but which end up looking a bit too much alike. The graphics engine moves everything without too many problems, even if who knows what levels of fluidity are never reached, indeed it remains far from 30 fps. Comment TMNT aims to relaunch the famous ninja turtles, also in terms of video games. Unfortunately, however, intentions and deeds did not completely go hand in hand. First of all, thinking of a Turtles game without multiplayer is already a courageous choice, and if this choice is not supported by valid gameplay, you only end up having the usual insipid tie-in and only recommended for fans of the series. The fact that TMNT is obviously designed for a young audience does not justify its repetitiveness, the mediocrity of the AI and the absolute lack of interactivity with the locations. We await the next tie-in of the ninja turtles, maybe it will be the right time ... Pros: Excellent dubbing in Italian Very beautiful music Graphically discreet Cons: Repetitive Gameplay very limited Visual problems TMNT is available for PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox 360 and Wii. The tested version is the one for PlayStation 2. In the last two years we have witnessedto a grand return of all the icons of the late 80s and early 90s. This is the case of the Transformers, back in the form of comics and protagonists of video games (see the Melbourne House masterpiece, precisely entitled Transformers), or of the Masters of the Universe (new cartoons and new toys). The Turtles could not miss the appeal, who enjoyed a new animated series some time ago and who are preparing for a return to cinemas thanks to a feature film in computer graphics. And here's the tie-in.", "date": "2007-06-14", "grade": null}
