We are referring above all to the release of The Stick of Truth, an Obsidian Entertainment role-playing game dedicated to the most irreverent animated series on television, but not only. The title released several months ago has now been properly metabolized, for lovers of Cartman and company there is now another appointment: it is South Park Pinball, the name given by Zen Studios to the new paid content for Pinball FX2, a pinball game now very launched also thanks to some exceptional licenses. So let's go back to talking about this title, which we remember is available for free for download in its basic version, which can be accompanied by other content such as The Walking Dead Pinball, dedicated instead to the Telltale Games videogame series and released a few weeks ago. Having done the necessary preamble to remember who and what, at this point we just have to find out what the developers have reserved for us within what are two tables this time, entirely dedicated to the world of South Park. Batdad, Mr. Hankey and even ManBearPig - they're all in the new South Park Pinball for Pinball FX2! Two for the price of (almost) two If in the case of The Walking Dead the single update was sold at the price of 2.99 euros, with South Park the guys from Zen Studios have decided to double the offer, offering a double content to download at the total price of 4.99 EUR. The first table, the one we could define as ~main~, is entitled ~Super Sweet Pinball~ and includes the presence of most of the characters known during the television series: in addition to the ever-present Kenny, Kyle, Cartman and Stan, we find all a series of names that South Park lovers will be able to recognize without difficulty. The entire pinball machine is, moreover, a real gem for those who fall into the category just mentioned, given that during the game it is impossible not to notice references of all kinds to new and (above all) old episodes, integrated within the table through some mechanics specially linked to characters such as Batdad, Mr. Hankey and ManBearPig, to be unlocked together with the various components that the pinball machine makes available to us. In this regard, the mini-guide inserted by the developers within the same table can be useful, thanks to which you can learn the various strategies to be adopted to be successful, while earning a greater number of points. Moving on, the second pinball machine is instead dedicated to the character who is the great absentee of the first: it is in fact entirely dedicated to Butters, within which we can immerse ourselves in the world of the blond-haired boy. Also in this case, we find many moments taken from the numerous episodes of South Park now in circulation, reworked to give life to the pinball machine: thus the alter ego Professor Chaos is back, engaged in a minigame, accompanied by missions such as the one in which the device to predict the future must be recovered, for which Butters dresses up as a young girl in a memorable episode. Laughter for everyone From a graphic point of view, both tables have a style that naturally closely resembles that of the South Park drawings, making its protagonists the main elements: in addition to the likeness of Cartman and friends, the player can also enjoy the original voices of the voice actors of the English-language version of the cartoon, taken from the episodes to which the two pinball machines pay their respects. In terms of difficulty, ~Super Sweet Pinball~ and ~Butters' Very Own~ seemed average to us: the loss of a ball does not happen for reasons of bad design, but only in case of a mistake or after the 'inevitable unfortunate bounce. Both pinball machines have also been promoted in terms of variety: in the first there is naturally more meat in the fire, given the presence of multiple characters and the reproduction of epic moments such as the ~visit~ of the aliens to Cartman, but also the Butters defends himself quite well. After all, if that were not the case, we imagine that the developers would hardly have dedicated an entire pinball machine to a single character. In conclusion, we can say that South Park Pinball is an unmissable appointment for all those who love this series and pinball machines. After all, the references to the various gags from the episodes are only a side element for a gaming experience that remains strongly connected to that offered by the other tables published by Zen Studios, which has now become a synonym of quality. Precisely for this reason, even those who are not familiar with South Park will be able to appreciate these new pinball machines, toohe if in this case the 5 euros to spend could need a moment of extra consideration: the tables available in Pinball FX2, after all, are now many.", "date": "2014-10-22", "grade": null}
