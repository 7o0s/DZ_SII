{"name": "Pascal's Wager", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pascals-wager-recensione.html", "text": "Grappling with Pascal's Wager's review was nothing short of enlightening. The title developed by the Chinese team Tipsworks, which had made so much talk after the publication of the debut trailer on the occasion of E3 2019, is in fact a true soulslike for iOS and Android devices. Mind you: we are not talking about a action RPG adapted to the mobile context, such as the excellent Animus - Stand Alone released in 2017, with small levels and an essential side dish, but a product that structurally would not disfigure on PC and consoles, and which does not compromise if not as regards the management of the difficulty, effectively calmed for the use of touch commands although the game supports Bluetooth controllers perfectly. Does this detail make Pascal's Wager's campaign easy? Absolutely no. Using the physical controls, obviously the best option in terms of precision and reactivity of the inputs, you will be able to face the opponents with greater awareness of your abilities and the repertoire of moves available, but in any case you will have to deal with enemies able to inflict massive damage, as well as scary and powerful bosses, who will often and willingly push you to resort to the grinding expedient. The level design, which is also distinctly soulslike, will support you in this age-old practice thanks to the inevitable ~watertight compartments~ of the map , which gradually opens its doors creating rapid passages towards one area or another, and which through the use of the altars allows you to recover energy, pay the accumulated money in order to obtain upgrades, create objects and obviously rest, thus restoring the health of the characters but at the same time accepting that all hostile creatures already eliminated come back to life. Setting Before going into the details of the gameplay of Pascal's Wager, it is definitely worth spending something on the setting of the game, which is closer to the sick one of Soul Sacrifice than to the From Software series. In fact, we find ourselves in a kingdom cursed by an eternal night and a permanent haze, illuminated only by the light of a globe that is located on the head of a dead Colossus. The image itself is disturbing and contributes to creating a very peculiar atmosphere, in combination with some artistic choices made by the authors regarding the playable characters and what revolves around them. There are a total of four warriors at our disposal, with the possibility of selecting two to alternate in each mission, by simply pressing a button or upon the death of one of them. Personages The protagonist of Pascal's Wager is Terrence, a knight who has been banished from the Church for transgressing its rules, engaged in the search for his lost wife, Teresa, but also in discovering the truth around the curse that surrounds the Colossus. He wields two swords: one allows him to quickly enter the enemy's guard, the other to sink powerful blows to kill him. Then there is Viola, a guide apparently still under the orders of the Cult, who decides to accompany Terrence on his journey. knows why. Surrounded by an aura of mystery, the silver-haired woman holds a rifle equipped with a bayonet with which she can target infernal creatures in various ways and hit them even from a short distance, without however the ability to parry their attacks but only to dodge them. Norwood is also a knight, but with a truly disturbing appearance: his face is covered by a golden mask and he lacks his left arm, which does not prevent him from dispensing death by unleashing his armored fist and brandishing a heavy grave of iron tied to a chain, an object that he also uses as a shield during the parry and that can be spun when the relative indicator is full. Finally there is Benita, an inquisitor with an even more disturbing design than Norwood: we are talking about a blind fighter , dressed in a red and blue tunic to which a sort of halo is connected which holds bags of blood and liquid. The woman, determined to drive away the evil that afflicts the kingdom, fights holding a monstrance whose end extends thanks to a cable, becoming a sort of elaborate whip. Gameplay As mentioned at the beginning, Pascal's Wager does not pose the problem of the platform on which it runs, trying to capture the key elements of the soulslike genre to offer users solid, mature and convincing gameplay from almost all points of view. The characters are naturally equipped with a stamina indicator that limits their moves and even the use of blocking and lateral dashing, requiring great attention in managing movements duringthe clashes also due to the effectiveness of enemy attacks. We will be able to defend ourselves using light and heavy attacks, increasingly devastating combinations that can be unlocked over time and finishers that become accessible when certain opponents find themselves in difficulty, for example the bosses . The latter interpret the general artistic direction very well, showing themselves as creepy creatures, able to literally make us stagger with their mere presence. In fact, an unprecedented element is present in experience, that of sanity. If we fail to control the relative indicator using the traditional flasks, letting it fall below the guard level, we will be catapulted into a sort of nightmare and our opponent will become stronger, as in a sort of second form, enriching his repertoire with the addition of devastating maneuvers.Memorizing the patterns is therefore also in this title a fundamental element for survival: you need to understand when to sink the blows and when to withdraw, carefully monitoring the enemy's movements to avoid suffering damage. This is true for all the creatures in the game and for all the chapters of a campaign that can offer a considerable duration for a mobile game, ranging from fifteen to twenty hours depending on the case. Technical realization If it is true that in terms of difficulty Pascal's Wager fails to be truly ruthless due to the touch controls, which are necessarily ~protected~, despite presenting a considerable degree of challenge, there is another aspect of the production Tipsworks that is not fully convincing and it is the technical realization. Here too we try to understand each other: aiming for console-quality graphics in the mobile sector is not easy, but there are some useful expedients to somehow ~hide~ the limits of the hardware. Well, the developers weren't always smart enough to resort to it and this, combined with the project's grand ambitions, has resulted in a presentation that visually sobs a bit. We found ourselves trying the game on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e, setting all the graphics settings to maximum and encountering many uncertainties, but that's not the problem. The cutscenes make excessive use of bloom and are ~dirty~ compared to the in-game sequences, giving the feeling of an experience that could be defined as dated in a console environment. On the other hand, nothing to say about the excellent orchestral soundtrack, while we found the dialogues in English lacking in intensity, a little drawn out. The hope is therefore that the authors will be able to further refine their title, also because for the rest c 'there is very little to complain about: Pascal's Wager is sold in premium format at a price of only 3.59 euros on the Google Play Store and 4.49 euros on the App Store, without focusing on microtransactions (we didn't pay any attention to it, specifically): a splendid exception these days, which deserves all possible success.", "date": "2020-06-30", "grade": "9.0"}
