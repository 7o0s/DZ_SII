{"name": "Star Wars: La Guerra dei Cloni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-la-guerra-dei-cloni_a.html", "text": "Pure action The Clone War is essentially a pure arcade without any concession to a minimum of tactical and strategic organization even during the most crowded phases of the battles. We can, as in R.L., through the pressure of the cross give orders to our adventure companions, but the substance does not change much: we go ahead and shoot like madmen at the large number of separatist vehicles paying attention only to the shields and the remaining amount of secondary weapon. The missions are organized into primary and secondary objectives, the former affect the progress of the game while the latter then serve to unlock bonus material and maps for multiplayer. The missions, even if diversified in the name, are actually all a bit the same: convoys are escorted, convoys are destroyed, the ground defenses of a base are annihilated to prepare us to land, at most in an extreme inspiration of inventiveness we infiltrate a base without making a sound. You are not satisfied with the extreme ~diversification~ of the action, sometimes as I have already written, it passes in sections on foot. In the role of either Mace Windu or Anakin we will have the task of destroying myriads of separatist droids using only three attack possibilities: slash, sword throw and a sort of force push. A little bit since they are Jedi knights, even if the different technique of the two with the sword is appreciable, more martial and elegant that of Windu, aggressive and awkward that of the young Anakin. Audio Video Graphically speaking, the Pandemic title only occasionally reaches the heights of pure visual ecstasy of its predecessor R.L. : we can safely say that it is prey to showy ups and downs, which overwhelm, alas, entire sections. To put it barbarously, we could say that what is well done is absolutely out of bounds and masterfully recreated; on the other hand, what is not well done is really poor and badly done. Visually speaking, the first thing that catches the eye in a title like this is the flash of lasers during a particularly crowded melee. Here we reach a level of ~fantastic realism~ that is, to say the least, exuberant: since every battle is always between a good number of vehicles, we will see lasers and missiles of every shape and color darting in the air: in addition to the classic red, green and blue lasers sure to hit the red plasma cascades of enemy gunships, as well as the green directional lasers of Republic gunships. Honorable mention to the wakes and explosions of the vehicles: seeing a missile launch from our tank, leaving behind a trail of smoke is a beautiful experience, especially when it impacts one of those strange separatist roundabouts, which once hit, they roll backwards and shatter into a thousand pieces. Same situation of excellence for the vast majority of vehicle models and their applied textures. Each vehicle is finely modeled and built with a good number of polygons, especially the aforementioned Gunships and the standard tank of the Republic; the textures, on the other hand, allow us to admire the details and friezes of even the smallest vehicles. The end-of-level bosses are also decidedly evocative (yes, there are these too!) who, in addition to being huge, are also equipped with peculiar attacks that are very beautiful to look at, such as multiple salvos of missiles and bizarre-looking laser beams. The animations with which the vehicles are equipped are certainly convincing, with parts that open and close according to the imprinted movement, as for the flaps of the standard wagon, while the models and animations of the human characters are absolutely negative, poorly modeled with low-poly and worse animated; the same goes for Republic troops and Separatist droids made as public-type cardboard cutouts in a regular sports title. The environments, on the other hand, plunge us back into the discourse of ups and downs: Geonosis, Rhen Var, and partially Kashyyyk are a hymn to modeling, detail and the punctual and precise use of bump mapping; others, however, such as Raxus Primo and more generally all the environments that can be visited in first person, give the impression of having been created by another development team, in how poor in detail, polygons and with frankly flat and sometimes embarrassing textures. Another flaw is the instability of the frame rate which during particularly crowded situations tends to miss a few shots, an all in all acceptable situation given the vastness of the environments on the screen and above all the many moving vehicles. From an audio point of view, the Lucas Arts tradition does not betray: ProLogic2 encoding and sound effects and a weighted soundtrackor from movies: music to our ears in short. Gameplay and control method The playability, on the other hand, stands at high levels: in the meantime, let's immediately say that the control method, despite the great variety of means, comes to our aid so much that going from a tank to the Gunship is not a problem. Basically in addition to the two types of attacks (primary and secondary, infinite laser and counted missiles) we will have a turbo available for each vehicle and the two back buttons to perform the strafe as if we were playing Unreal. In other words, you will never stand still for a moment, you will go back and forth, you will make infinite circular strafes, so much so that the z key which activates a sort of telescopic sight will hardly be used. A big mess and a lot of fun anyway, with missiles, rockets, laser shots and various amenities whistling over our heads as in the most expensive of classic shooters. Given the arcade nature of the title which imposes a simplification of the game mechanics in every aspect, something for sure will have been sacrificed on the altar of the ~simplest and most immediate possible~. In this case the aiming method turns out to be a bit confusing as it does not provide a fixed target lock and a key that allows us to move to another one. In fact, the movement of the vehicle acts as a viewfinder and it is enough to move to change target: changing target means moving, and all this is not very convenient if at the same time aiming at the target, you are trying to avoid a swarm of missiles. As with the vast majority of games, a little practice is enough, even if sometimes there remains a feeling of disorientation and of not having total control of one's actions, which can be harmful during a particularly heated battle. Summing up The difficulty level is well balanced, playing in normal mode the challenge that awaits us is certainly difficult and in any case never too frustrating and boring: playing in easy level the first serious difficulties will only be encountered in the more advanced levels, even if this certainly does not mean go on a trip to Geonosis. Then overcoming the secondary missions to unlock all the bonuses and multiplayer maps is certainly not easy and requires a lot of effort and dedication. Then there is an interesting multiplayer for up to 4 players that allows us to face friends in 4 classic modes: deathmatch, king of the hill, cooperatives and coop resistance, choosing from all the means present in the game. Ultimately Star Wars The Clone War is a title with lights and shadows, which manages very well to convey the emotions and atmosphere of the film (the part on Geonosis is truly sensational), but which pays off in some parts for an excessive variety, to the detriment of the total quality of the product. In other words, too many irons in the fire. Pros: excellent creation of models and excellent sound effects very fun and long-lived (missions + submissions) Cons: fluctuating backdrop graphics poorly made human models. GranTurismo on Geonosis? In no uncertain terms, it is possible to define the new Lucas Arts / Pandemic title as the natural evolution of the gameplay of the now classic Rogue Leader. Contrary to the Factor5 title, the adventures of our heroes, in this case Anakin, Mace Windu and Obi Wan , will not only take place in space, but relatively speaking, with their feet firmly on the ground. This implies a variety of means ranging from tanks to the Gunships seen in the battle of Geonosis, passing through different types of Speeder, At-St old style and Maru, a kind of fully armed super cow. And as if that weren't enough, some sections are faced on foot, relying on sword and strength. The title begins by narrating the events immediately preceding the arrival of Mace Windu on Genosis in aid of Anakin Skywalker, Senator Amidala and Obi Wan Kenobi imprisoned in the arena. Starting from here, after freeing the three you will take an active part in the battle, then the action will move to many different systems, on the trail of Dooku, and his phantom secret weapon. After Geonosis we will see the frozen lands of Rhen Var, the waste planet of Raxus Primo, the verdant plains of Kashyyyk, and several other locations for a total of 16 missions in 6 different planets.", "date": "2002-12-04", "grade": null}
