According to the old adage of ~good things come in threes~, this latest effort should have an easy time in making inroads into the hearts of iPhone users, let's see if it's true... No surprises That Snow Moto Racing is a title without too many frills can be seen from the initial screen, which showcases a rather meager menu: Single Player, Multiplayer, Achievements and Settings are the only selectable options, which unfortunately do not hide particularly exciting content. There are in fact only six tracks, there is no possibility either to choose or to customize the vehicle and driver, and there is no real basic structure: it is simply a question of tackling one track at a time to thus unlock the next one, without the need of points or to reach the first position. The multiplayer mode is equally reduced to the bone, as it only allows you to challenge another user in a head-to-head match via Bluetooth, while the Achievements are few, trivial and devoid of any use. So, is Snow Moto Racing a title to forget? Not exactly. Considering the price at which it is sold (0.79 euros), the Resolution Interactive product is still a worthy racing game, albeit inexplicably much poorer than the software house's previous works. The races are based on checkpoint races against seven opponents controlled by the CPU, within scenarios that objectively would have needed more variety: even the tracks themselves do not enjoy a properly thrilling design, being mainly based on hairpin bends and bumps . Just while you are in flight it is possible to perform stunts (by touching the center of the screen or shaking the device) capable of guaranteeing a small dose of boost as soon as you touch the ground. However, the control system is largely delegated to the accelerometer, which manages the steering: acceleration is instead automatic, while the brake is absolutely useless. Taken for what it is, Snow Moto Racing also lets itself be played, but we doubt that it would have had a long life even with hundreds of tracks: the monotonous tenor of the races and the lack of aggressiveness of the opponents constitute significant deterrents, making the title suitable for to some impromptu game from time to time. Even from a technical point of view, Snow Moto Racing is nothing special: graphically it does not push the iPhone's potential to the maximum - on the contrary - showing rather angular environments and polygonal models, although the frame rate is always stable. Some light effects are appreciable, but in general it is an average product, without infamy and without praise. The sound, on the other hand, is not very convincing, characterized by monotonous music and too ~light~ sound effects. The tested version is 1.0.1 App Store links", "date": "2010-01-18", "grade": "6.0"}
