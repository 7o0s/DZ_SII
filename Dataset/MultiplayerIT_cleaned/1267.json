{"name": "Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-3.html", "text": "International intrigues World technology is constantly evolving and new information coding techniques that are potentially harmful to the US pose a serious threat. In order to neutralize any operation against the United States, the National Security Agency has created a project (Third Echelon) that would allow the recovery of data of fundamental importance that had fallen into the hands of hostile organizations. Splinter Cell is the name of the units used for this recovery, they are formed by a single agent in action supported by a remote team, and their existence is totally denied by the government. We are in 2006, a new threat is lurking in Southeast Asia: the time has come for the Splinter Cell team and its agent Sam Fisher to get back into action. As a result of US military intervention in East Timor to train a new emerging defense force, an Anti-American faction led by leader Suhadi Sadono occupied the US embassy in Dili; your task will be to bring to safety all the secret information present in the embassy before Sadono can use it. This is but the introductory part of a highly pro-American storyline, centered on the neutralization of the rebel faction and which will be narrated in a compelling way as you progress through the game. Qualitatively speaking, the story is at a high level, certainly not comparable to that of a Metal Gear, but in any case it does its job very well since it manages to capture the player's interest without being excessively complex. Play your gameplay The gameplay of Pandora Tomorrow has remained largely unchanged from that of its predecessor, but has still undergone considerable refinement. There are many additions and changes that make PT even more playable and fun, including a slight refinement of the artificial intelligence that increases its competitiveness, the speeding up of the checkpoint / save system and the implementation of online play. These are just some of the changes, but considering that not everyone has played SC or in any case does not know the stealth genre, it is good that the structure of PT is explained in detail and in depth. The word stealth literally means ~secrecy~, consequently the aim of this game is to reach the objectives of the missions in the most silent way possible, avoiding being discovered. There are very few moments in which you will be able to go out into the open to shoot wildly at anyone who comes across you, missions require stealthy movements, darkness is your best friend and you will have to take advantage of all its advantages. Whenever you will be seen by the enemy, the alarm will go off and this implies that the soldiers who have seen you will come looking for you and will wear protections (bulletproof vest and helmet) which will make their elimination more difficult, furthermore if you trigger the alarm for three times in a row the game will end. Your main weapon is the shadow, but it is certainly not the only one. Sam Fisher has at his disposal a remarkable number of gadgets that are vital in the most complicated situations. The firearms are only two (pistol and multipurpose assault rifle), but more than enough to knock out the terrorists, as they allow you to shoot smoke grenades, chaff, electric and rubber bullets and adhesive micro-cameras. Even the objects are of great help for your missions, you can use a lock pick to break into the doors, a jammer to disturb the security cameras, a night vision goggle and a heat one to always keep the situation under control even in low light areas. visibility, and a laser microphone useful for secretly recording important conversations. As already explained before, sneaking is the quintessence of SC, and Sam Fisher, in addition to being equipped with an extremely effective war arsenal, can count on his agility to carry out many moves. Standing split between two walls while aiming, climbing ropes to poles, threatening terrorists from behind for interrogation, peeking from behind walls, and ambushing soldiers by whistling or throwing objects, are just some of the things you will be able to do. All these elements make the PT experience something extremely satisfying and nothing short of superlative. The game situations are built to take advantage of every single skill of Sam Fisher and leave the player the choice of the strategy to adopt to complete the mission. Choosing whether to lure the terrorists around a corner to hit them from behind or to shoot a blast to the head is all you needthat's your job, but remember that an action can have side effects and that if you don't hide an unconscious body in a dark area, the alarm will go off. The realism and sense of full control of the character mean that the level of identification and videogame satisfaction reach stratospheric levels, giving life to an experience that you absolutely must try. PT has the misfortune of not having many additional elements in the single player that increase its longevity, the single player game is limited only to completing the main missions and nothing else. To finish it the first time it will take you on average about ten hours, but you will hardly be full after such a short time, so you can try your hand at completing the missions with higher difficulty using always different strategies for completion. The real novelty, however, lies in the online game, with which to try your hand once you get tired of the single game. You can choose to be part of one of the two teams available: Shadownet (the spies) and Argus (the mercenaries). The game system is very simple: the spies have objectives to accomplish and the mercenaries must prevent them from being completed. Each faction has its strengths and weaknesses, for example spies do not carry any type of lethal weapon with them, but can move freely using the same moves as Fisher, mercenaries instead have more limited movements and their view is necessarily subjective , but they can use firearms to kill spies. The levels of the game are well designed and very complex, making a perfect battlefield for four players thanks to the fact that they are neither too big nor too small. Each of the eight maps available has a large number of conduits, secret passages and shadow areas that allow the use of various game strategies. Ars Technique Since PT is cross-platform, the question that arises is: given the limited graphics potential of the PS2, is this version technically comparable to its Xbox and PC counterparts? Unfortunately the answer is no and the differences are quite marked, it must be emphasized however that graphically PT is not at all poor, indeed much more has been done than one would have expected. The textures are of moderate quality, both in terms of colors and in terms of definition and detail, even the light and shadow effects are well done and very realistic. As usual there is a visible aliasing effect, which however we cannot complain about this time since it is also present in the other versions. In fact, PT adopts a particular graphic technique called Rendering to Texture which does not allow the use of the anti-aliasing filter even on the PC version. The animations are of the same workmanship, the movements of Fisher and the other characters convincing and without any slowdown, everything always flows quite smoothly even when we move the camera or use the subjective view. The dubbing, as well as the music and sound effects, have a positive effect on the gaming experience. The voice actors do their job very well, giving the right emphasis to each dialogue (remember that the speech is all in Italian) and it must be remembered that among them there are famous names such as Luca Ward and Morgan. To underline are the environmental effects that perfectly recreate the real ones and a technically good soundtrack that adapts to every game situation, thanks to these elements the involvement skyrockets. Comment Pandora Tomorrow is probably one of the best action/stealth games out there. The PS2 version has the only flaw of not having graphics at the same level as the Xbox and PC versions, but if we consider the fact that the conversion is still excellent and that the PS2 version has a whole extra level, we believe that there is no need of other arguments to convince you to immediately get a copy of the game. Pros: An additional level for the ps2 version High realism Playability that borders on perfection Cons: Graphic design not at the highest levels When Splinter Cell first appeared on the Xbox, the concept of stealth games was greatly enriched, and the Metal Gear series had finally found a worthy competitor capable of countering it. SC and MGS2 are both giants of the genre, and it is still a difficult task to decide which of the two is the best, in fact, although belonging to the same vein, they are two substantially different games, each with its own particular feeling and its game structure. The fundamental element that differentiates the world of MGS from that of SC is the style: the first, with an oriental flavor, mixes action and stealth in equal partswings, and also boasts a very articulated plot and beautifully characterized characters, the second, western-style, has a more concise - but effective - story of the characters that more closely reflect those of the real world and makes the stealth component its fulcrum. Pandora Tomorrow brings back all the winning elements that made its predecessor a colossal in the gaming world, and improves them further, creating something extremely spectacular, as we will see shortly.", "date": "2004-06-28", "grade": null}
