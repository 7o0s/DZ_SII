Arriving in front of the game packaging, one thing immediately catches the eye, namely that for once no expense has been spared on the package and we have wanted to think a bit about the poor consumers tired of being faced with arid packages without comprehensive manuals and interesting content. The manual is truly comprehensive and removes many doubts about the story by also deepening the aspects taken care of in the previous episodes in a comprehensive way (too bad I got the English version! poof!). At a glance we immediately realize that MOO is betting everything on further extending the range of action of this title. The number of races from which to draw has risen to sixteen, each differentiated by particular strengths and weaknesses, which will undoubtedly contribute to making the clash much more interesting. Having reached the selection menu, we also note that it is possible to add new customized races to the existing ones, it will be up to us to create the one most congenial to us by balancing the points made available (but we recommend this choice only to truly expert players) by distributing them in the characteristics to us more congenial. United by similar physical conformations and by the same needs in terms of natural habitat, the races are grouped into species: Humanoids, Cibernetik, Surian, Ichthytosian, Etherean, Geodic, Insectoid and Harvester. This last species completely new in the MOO universe represents the real novelty of the title and the subtle threat that will extend throughout the galaxy during your games. Those who are not new to the saga will well remember the fearsome Antarians who at the end of the second chapter appeared on the map, never seen before, spreading horror and fear thanks to the advanced technology they had. Well, despite the efforts made to drive these fearsome aliens from the parallel dimension from which they had come, the Antarians did not completely vanish. The deadliest weapon ever produced in the entire history of the Galaxy remained of them, a biological weapon, a fearsome parasite created to physically and psychologically dominate the other races by subjecting them to the power and will of the Antarians. Master of the universe! Having said this and summed up the story, let's get to the actual action, the conquest of the stars of the Galaxy. Our empire starts from a small star with characteristics congenial to our race. It won't be long before you understand that MOO is not a game of action, but of reflection and pure strategy: therefore there is not much room for useless frills and everything is reduced to the essentials. By clicking on the numerous buttons located on the upper and lower edges of the game screen, we can quickly access each management section, quickly passing from the economic to the political sector, without forgetting the review of the planets controlled by us, the research status (military, socio politics and technology) and the available arsenal. The map dotted with colored dots immediately highlights the nature of the stars that surround us (in practice you will understand immediately if you are heading towards a white dwarf star or a milder yellow star), by clicking on those occupied by our spaceships we quickly access the menu of planets, through which it will be possible to manage the colonization of the latter. Yes, because once you land in a solar system it won't be all over. You will have to undertake the difficult task of subjecting the planets of the system to your power, and good for you if these will be empty and devoid of indigenous populations when you arrive. It is obvious that over time you will find less and less space for your territorial expansion (better to say spatial) and you will end up fighting with opposing civilizations for supremacy; but as already mentioned before, force will not be your only weapon, you can always use diplomatic channels to bring your reasons and drive away the danger of a bloody (and costly!) war. Also because preparing for battle is not a trivial matter. Fleets will weigh heavily on your economy in the early stages of the game and you cannot afford to waste essential energies on silly skirmishes. Just think of this inevitable chain of events: to increase your economic influence and consequently your production power, several planets will be needed, possibly suitable for the extraction of minerals (which constitute the ideal currency for trade and production) and for the exploitation biological (essential egpopulation growth); to obtain new planets you will have to create vessels capable of reaching them, to then colonize them, but this will take a lot of time at the beginning and you will soon understand that it is not the case to give yourself to useless free and risky aggressions because these could cost you a lot in terms of resources. By following the structure of the turn-based game you will see your skill grow and, if you invest wisely in research, you will soon be able to have your say. This is because the fruits of the research carried out can be used not only for their own benefits but also as a bargaining chip in transactions with other civilizations. Having reached technological maturity, our civilization will soon be ready to leap towards the conquest of new stars and their planets, towards supremacy over the galaxy, and why not, control of the major trade routes. To defend your privileges you will soon know all the weapons at your disposal, and you will soon make use of the results of your research, perhaps exploiting them for the defense of your planets or for the creation of new fearsome weapons to be mounted on the flagships of the fleets you will command. Fleets that will be completely organized by your military genius and that you can customize and reassemble at any time, setting up escort pickets and convoys. Be careful not to underestimate the importance of diplomacy. The latter could prove, in many cases, the trump card of your actions. If you know how to keep yourself diplomatically stable, you can compete for the office of senator of the Orion forum (assigned cyclically through the votes of the members of the races in play), a position that will allow you not only to have greater prestige within the intergalactic community but also to place bans and enact laws pulling grist to your mill (it will be a good example of political fairplay for the little ones, bah...!?). Final Rush. Summing up in terms of the game we can certainly say that MOO3 descends directly from the previous title. It certainly bears the signs of an evident maturity and thoroughly explores every management aspect but totally lacks a clear development in the graphic field. It is obvious that, having reached the third episode of the saga, this game has fully confirmed the almost total uselessness of advanced (and as I like to say a little wasteful) graphics to achieve its goal, which is to concentrate purely on the strategic, but something more was certainly expected, we are in 2003, right? Certainly the real-time fights required greater care in their implementation, both from a graphic point of view and from that of the interface (decidedly sparse) and the versatility of the fights. In fact, it is not clear the reason for such neglect in the details on the battlefield: the fleets are truly stylized and lacking depth. Furthermore, despite being in space (the one with three free dimensions, at least in theory) we are faced with squadrons glued to the plane that move as if stuck to the ground when instead they should make the completely opposite idea. And then the choice to add the possibility of personally controlling the battles is not understood at all if such a bare interface and decidedly poor and malnourished graphics appear, not at all faithful to the tenor of the rest of the game. Final Rush. It goes without saying that in the 80th turn of your game when you have domains that connect the two extreme arms of the galaxy, by controlling dozens of stars it will be more practical for you to skip the combat phases, leaving the elaboration to the computer simulation which in a few seconds will report the final result of the battle. Total rejection for the tutorial, which presents itself as a series of sometimes very intrusive documentation windows ready to appear whenever you press a button never tried before. As a final result you will get only a great confusion with relative frustration for not having understood a tube of what is strictly necessary to continue. However, branding MOO3 as a total fiasco does not honor the good work done by the Infogrames developers who brought the title to full maturity, away from the light-heartedness of the previous episodes. The issue has become much more complex and there has been a great deal of focus on in-depth management of the affair, perhaps forgetting that many might find themselves uncomfortable in the face of such a change of course. If in MOO2 the player could only control a few parameters per planet, now it isforced to take many factors into account. The economic character has definitely taken over and neglecting the details could prove fatal. Maybe it's a bit too much for those looking for a few good hours of healthy relaxation in a game like this. Concluding... How to conclude then? The strategic aspect of the game is certainly well-kept and there is no doubt how much we wanted to focus on this. The graphic counterpart, moreover, is decent if we think of the management section but decidedly disappointing in the fighting sector (almost the doubt remains that it is a sensational unfinished such is the poverty offered by this mode). However, those who have spent sleepless hours on the previous chapters of the saga cannot miss the appointment with a classic of scientific strategy and test their skills on every front of political and military ability. Concluding... Pro High longevity. High documentation Greater weight to diplomacy as a weapon equivalent to military strength Sixteen races available Cons Not very intuitive Combat graphics decidedly neglected Disappointing and uncomfortable tutorial (and trust me, you can't do without the tutorial) ...and the story continues! The Master of Orion (MOO) saga began in the early nineties, with the spread of the first advanced games for the PC. Even if at first glance Star Lords (this was the name of the game that can be considered without any doubt the ~zero~ episode of the Master of Orion saga) looked more like a last generation game, a leftover from the eighties. Although it had very sparse graphics, those star-shaped dots scattered around the screen hid the embryo of one of the most addictive strategy games that has ever appeared on the market. For the first time, the approach to the game of conquest and civilization (Sid Meier docet!) was proposed in a spatial key and offered such a vast playing field that it was even disorienting. Numerous races with different resources and abilities thus had to face each other in a 360-degree battle for total control of the Orion galaxy. For the first time total freedom of action was left to the player who could thus choose the ideal tactic for the conquest; in fact, the inexperienced player could immediately realize that brute force was not the only trump card, but was comparable to diplomacy and trade in terms of effectiveness. The strategy finally focused not only on the military aspect, but also on the economic and diplomatic level, useful tools in a universe made up of spies, trade and embargoes. With the advent of the first two chapters of the saga, thousands of gamers discovered with amazement the vast universe contained in this title and fought for years impersonating the various rival races. A few years have passed and Infogrames thought that maybe a dust-up of an old success like MOO wouldn't hurt. So let's see what came out of the magic cylinder.", "date": "2003-03-12", "grade": null}
