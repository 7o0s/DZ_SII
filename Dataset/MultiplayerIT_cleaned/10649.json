Need for Speed Undercover, an episode of the series that left a bad taste in the mouth of many fans of the saga on home consoles, is ready to make the engines roar within the circle of iPhone users, increasingly invaded by games for their mobile phone. The plot is identical to the home versions in which the protagonist is a policeman who has infiltrated the world of clandestine racing with the aim of defeating a dangerous gang that fits perfectly into that world. To get to the bosses, our cop must earn trust and respect by beating all opponents in the challenges offered within the three cities where the whole game takes place. The modes available are very good, from the more classic circuit races and sprints, in which the aim is to reach a point X by beating the opponent, up to real battles against the police, perhaps using a car that is not exactly ~clean~ or causing anyone who gets between us and the finish line to go off the road. The Challenge mode certainly cannot be missing where to win you have to outrun your opponent. The roar of the engines The real strength of Need for Speed Undercover is the technical sector: graphically, in fact, the product is very accurate thanks to an excellent use of polygons both in the construction in the vehicles and in the environments, perhaps a little too anonymous but really well done. You can immediately notice the attention paid to detail: the interlude scenes are shot by real actors as happens in the counterpart for home consoles, an excellent prelude in short, surrounded by highly inspired audio tracks that are truly perfect for the style of play. Without a shadow of a doubt, the sensation of speed that Need for Speed Undercover gives is comparable to few titles of the genre and slightly surpasses that seen in Ferrari Challenge. The use of the iPhone touch is excellent; for example, if we wanted to activate the nos, just slide your finger upwards, while by performing the movement downwards, the speedbreaker (the slow motion of time) will come into action. No menu keys on the display but only the useful indicators of speed, position and, in some challenges, the integrity of the vehicle. The guidance system is well implemented even if limited only to the use of the accelerometer. By now tested on the iPhone, the driving style already seen in Asphalt 4, Ferrari Challenge and the like is always effective: the accelerator is automatic and the player is called to steer and brake, even if this last option will actually often be forgotten in favor of a drift. The steering is sensitive to the right point but not lightning fast, and it will often happen to end up against some car or truck on the road if the player does not use the right attention during the game phase. Bad news for fans of multiplayer: Need for Speed Undercover only provides the possibility of tackling the career mode without the possibility of using our car in challenges against time. The longevity of the game is therefore affected by this truly non-negligible factor and being able to replay previously won races for the sole purpose of really improving is not enough for the average driver. The feature that has always convinced Need for Speed is the possibility of extreme tuning; even the iPhone version of Undercover provides this particular section where you can increase the vehicle's performance thanks to mechanical modifications such as a new engine, lower suspension or a longer nitro. The aesthetic aspect has not been neglected and beautifying the car is a trivial matter thanks to the possibility of applying airbrushing to spoilers via rims and car colour. The tested version is 1.1.28", "date": "2009-07-08", "grade": "8.5"}
