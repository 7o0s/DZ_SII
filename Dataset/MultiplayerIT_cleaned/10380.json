{"name": "Zombie attack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72246-left-4-dead-2-zombie-attack-atto-secondo.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360Left 4 Dead was one of the best surprises of 2008: a stale premise, that of the zombies, revised with enormous originality both as premises, straddling the continuous quotations and the narration through images with the writings on the walls, which in terms of playability, giving a new and deeper sense to the concept of cooperative and engaging for a long time in the fun, asymmetrical competitive multiplayer. On the contrary, the support that Valve gave to the first Left 4 Dead was one of the most bitter discoveries of the following 365 days: nothing dramatic by the standards we are used to, mind you, but too little for what the fathers of Half Life have used to guarantee, with a few often late updates, a toolset that is not up to par and a merciless term of comparison such as Team Fortress 2. From this point of view, the complaints preceding Left 4 Dead 2 are all there. Instead, what does not convince the writer is the discredit for these causes of a product which, taken individually as it inevitably must be done, is rich in content and ideas much more than sufficient for sale as a sequel, rather going up against the inevitable lack of the original sense of wonder - well hidden by the excellent additions - and by a less inspired campaign than the others. Data for dead, again The foundations of Left 4 Dead 2 are inevitably those of the past, with the four survivors left alone against an infinite amount of undead. This time the setting is that of the southwestern part of the United States, from Georgia to Louisiana, thus going inland, and the first point in favor of the production is the ability to properly characterize every single pattern, making it credible the environments and giving an end to the survivors, traveling to reach the military and the longed-for salvation. Obviously there isn't a plot that isn't a pretext for crossing the maps, but the mixture of writing inside the shelters and small references during the action also work in the second iteration. The campaigns in this case have been brought to five and have a variable number of maps each - four or five - all resulting more or less equal in duration and presenting a greater variety of different mechanics: more moments have been implemented during which to wait an event such as the opening of a gate but also moving towards a given point as quickly as possible, making this a more dynamic experience, also thanks to choices such as fatigue after a certain number of pushes, previously only in Versus post patch, which prevents long sessions squeezed into a corner. The beginning isn't the best for the simple reason that the Death Center campaign is the worst of the five, a run through a hotel in Savannah, Georgia, and then the nearby mall that sees in a couple of steps, in a room invaded by smoke and in search of a carton of Coca Cola, the peaks of an otherwise anonymous experience even if capable of giving an ending, in search of the cans to fill the tank of the getaway car, which acts as a tutorial to competitive Seeker mode. Once the first obstacle has passed, objectively out of the production standards, the remaining four are beautiful variations on the theme of what everyone knows: the lack of amazement for the no longer unprecedented formula is replaced by a thousand situations of great atmosphere, from the final concert of LunaPark Lugubre to the labyrinthine puddles of Swamp Fever, from the moving conclusion along a bridge close to the explosion of La Parrocchia up to the ingenious round trip of Pioggia Battente, which proposes the same stretch of road rebuilt twice, once under normal conditions and the another under a deluge of enormous pathos. The guide Multiplayer.it publishes from today in exclusive the official guide of Left 4 Dead 2, with all the references, the maps and the useful information to survive the second, terrifying iteration of the Valve title. Shopping links. A new Director? The great architect of Left 4 Dead's replayability was the Director: the artificial intelligence routines developed allowed enemies and supplies to appear dynamically, based on the situation of the players, also adjusting atmospheric elements such as music. In this sequel we have worked in such a way as not to revolutionize this process - no totally procedural creation of content, for example - but to adapt it to the greatest number of objects and expand it to the environments themselves, now of very different sizes, from large spaces of a cornfield echo of that Blood Harvest in the first chapter to the narrow streets of New Orleans. Damage is now localzed, specific to individual parts of the body If for the former it was a case of filing the balance, an excellent job of customizing the campaigns was done for the settings, modifying a garden with a small hedge maze in La Parrocchia or the quantity of hurricanes in Pioggia Battente, just to mention two. In this case the secret of success is the discreet way in which the changes are made, small but subtle changes that when they lead to the removal of some paths in Swamp Fever, are noticed only when you are with the waist water and awkward movements. The same goes for the flames, now much more present and guided than in the past. As for the objects, the work done was more than good, with the defibrillator to revive the companions and the additional ammunition, including incendiaries and explosives, to be brought only if you feel like giving up the medikit, while the Boomer's bile , useful to throw against enemies to make them prey to their own kind, as an alternative to the usual pipe bombs or Molotov cocktails. Still present the painkillers to which adrenaline is added, perfect for increasing speed and strength for a short time, also streamlining the operations of lifting injured comrades from the ground. Similar and different speech for weapons. The absolute novelty are those for hand-to-hand combat which come in a great variety - frying pan, katana, baseball bat, truncheon and so on, around a dozen in all - and occupy the slot otherwise reserved for the pistol, killing the normal infected but are each equipped with different characteristics; if for example the ax allows you to kill the closest enemy and unbalance the others closest, the chainsaw does not seem to inflict area damage but is extremely quick to use as well as having a finite amount of fuel. A lot of testing will have to be done in this sense to discover all the strengths and weaknesses of each one, but the introduction is certainly significant and changes the way of dealing with the waves a lot. Firearms are instead increased in number and for many that seem to be revisited - the old Uzi and the new silenced machine gun seem to differ only in the rounds in the magazine, at first glance - others are completely new like the Ak 47, very good from medium and short distances, the Magnum or the grenade launcher, equipped with thirty shots and devastating when you manage not to use it even against teammates, aware that the ammunition scattered around the maps and in shelters will not be able to replenish it. Xbox 360 goals The objectives of Left 4 Dead 2 are very well studied and go from completing the campaigns, even at the highest difficulty levels, to obtaining a given number of kills or performing particular techniques. There is no shortage of references to competitive challenges and, in general, it will take a long time to unlock them all. Superstar spitters By now the speech relating to the infected should be clear: three new ones are added to the special ones already present in the past plus other semi-special ones - the writer was unable to find a better term - characteristic of the individual campaigns. The three main introductions are the Charger, who charges the group by disuniting it and then focusing on a single unfortunate victim, the Jockey, who jumps in front and controls the movements leading towards the nearest danger point, and the Spitter, who spits acid on the ground creating pools capable of great damage. The latter is the key to the success of the other two, which alone are not very dangerous but devastating when combined with the presence of the aforementioned impassable areas; a survivor devitalized in the midst of Spitter's vomit is a survivor close to the change of denomination. There are also changes to those seen in the past, such as the Witch who now walks rather than standing still and also shows up over and over again within some specific environments. The ending of La Parrocchia The semi-special infected are instead endowed with the same energy as the common ones but with different defensive or offensive characteristics: the policeman in riot gear must be unbalanced to have the aim on the back, the only exposed part, while the mud man walks on all fours in the high water of Swamp Fever, also dirtying the view so as to complicate the perception of what is around. The addition seems marginal, but knowing that men equipped with biological containment suits can pass through the flames opens up many corners considered safe. These infected can also drop specific weapons and supplies on the ground. In general, the cooperative experience of Left 4 Dead 2 is excellent, rich in content and above all different from the past, much more varied and frenetic. Selftherefore, with Borderlands, it stands at the top of the genre in this 2009, the sectorial nature of the offer remains and therefore the regret for a price that on Xbox 360 will perhaps be able to keep away the curious looking for something new or only partially convinced by the previous episode. On the other hand, fans and enthusiasts of the first hour will have them for a long time also thanks to the Reality mode, which maintains the four difficulty levels but introduces a series of complications such as the absence of auras around companions, enemies or objects, the impossibility of being reborn outside of shelters and the different amount of damage done to common zombies based on the anatomical part affected; a further complication of great effectiveness and capable of significantly increasing the challenge. Similar speech for Survivor, a game that can be played on particular portions of some maps and focused on survival for as long as possible, with a medal system based on the results obtained. No patches this time Left 4 Dead introduced a competitive component of great effect, one of the few cases in which the differentiation between the sides did not send the balance and even more the fun to cards and forty-eight. The problem at the beginning was the support for only two campaigns, then expanded through a hard-earned update. Here the situation is very different: the Versus is immediately available on every single setting and involves, in addition to the four survivors, also the whole variety of new Special Infected, leaving out the usual Witch and the semi-special ones. The novelty is the Seeker mode, during which, as mentioned when speaking of the Center of Death campaign, collect a given number of objects and bring them back to the pre-established point. Once again: it was decided to push on the movement and this last modality responds to the too wait-and-see strategies often adopted in the past, forcing a quartet to move and to do it very quickly so as not to end up in the clutches of the other. Regarding the use of the new Infected, the peculiarities are those described above and the more in-depth tests of the next few weeks will allow their full value to be appreciated; for now - during the review phase it was not easy to find people online to play Versus and Seeker with - the impression is that you are immediately in the presence of a complete offer and perspective.

One year later, five years later Visually, the game still rests on the beloved Source Engine, which practically every year since its first adoption with Half Life 2 has been updated and adapted in a more than convincing way to the various needs of Valve & co. The weight of the years was felt and is being felt, but the atmosphere - apart from the first campaign - is still rendered very, very well, with the team perfectly capable of exploiting the strengths of an engine that is capable of making the vegetation, the animations of the characters and their facial expressions are at their best, as well as a series of lighting effects that have been renewed for the occasion and, especially on PC, manage to render the warm twilight light of La Parrocchia well or the start of a new day in Swamp Fever. The rest is all artistic, atmospheric work - the night of the past is no longer dominant, you might not like it but a greater variety pays off in the end - and zombies, lots of zombies, now ready to die by losing different parts of the body, in more believable, showing more details such as the radius and ulna of the forearms. The undead then underwent a decidedly intense and well-done skin diversification work, with for example the boomer who now has a female variant. The music is still good, largely the remake of those already heard but adapted to the tradition of the southern United States, the noises, the verses and all the other atmospheric elements are always fantastic. Putting the two versions, Xbox 360 and PC side by side, the differences are more or less those of the past: in addition to the aforementioned lighting, on PC the higher resolution makes the work done on the textures better and the colors also benefit from it.", "date": "2009-11-17", "grade": "8.8"}
