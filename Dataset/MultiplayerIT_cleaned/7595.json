{"name": "Occasione sprecata", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/123524-takedown-red-sabre-occasione-sprecata.html", "text": "Serellan is a small developer founded in Seattle by Chris Allen, whose curriculum includes important productions such as Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter and Halo: Reach. The Takedown: Red Saber project was born in April 2012, after having successfully completed the fundraising campaign on Kickstarter (exceeding the $200,000 threshold necessary to start the alpha phase in extremis), also thanks to the patronage of Robert Bowling, former community manager of Infinity Ward. After a year and a half, the tactical shooter which - according to the programmers - aims to become the spiritual heir of Rainbow 6 and SWAT 4, has been released on the Steam platform, waiting to be published also in the digital distribution channels of Sony (where it will transform into a third person title) and Microsoft. However, it seems that at the moment the developers have many other problems to think about, given the hornet's nest of controversy that has been unleashed on the Valve forums a few hours after the launch. The product, in fact, is far from being presentable, with an endless list of bugs that betrays a largely embryonic stage of the game. The version of Takedown: Red Saber released on Steam is embarrassing to say the least Do I or don't I? In the light of what was written above, a debate was opened in the editorial staff regarding the opportunity to proceed or not with the review: in the end we decided to continue with the evaluation of the title, from the moment in which it is proposed and sold (at a price of 13.99 euros) as definitive. From the initial screen, one realizes that something is wrong: the options menu only allows you to select the level of detail and resolution, without presenting further items; that of the equipment is instead excessively cumbersome, characterized by icons compared to which those of Windows 3.1 seem to be in high resolution. It is not even possible to customize the commands, nor is it known what action is associated with a particular key. The list of defects, already worrying up to now, is unfortunately destined to get worse by starting a game session, whether it is a local game or you decide to try (what should be) the natural habitat of the work before Serellan, i.e. the international network. The single player offers three modes: in the one called Mission (the only one in which the leader is helped by three allied bots) you have to complete a series of pre-established tasks within an hour of starting the game, while in the remaining ones the objectives include to eliminate all enemies or, alternatively, disarm the bombs present in the level, always respecting the haunting countdown that appears right in the middle of the screen. Having determined the type of action, one must choose one of the two entry points available for the five maps present and one of the four equipment put on the plate by Serellan. The settings, albeit not very original, have been studied with care and are combined with the dynamics of the game; we will therefore find a congress center, a chemical laboratory, a radar station, a sort of silo and the inevitable merchant cargo. There are sixteen models of rifles and two types of pistols with which to customize your arsenal: they have been available from the beginning because the developers wanted to avoid discriminating against players by introducing perks. The ballistics are really well done and a good deal of practice is required to master them perfectly; on the other hand it cannot be hidden that certain ~surgical~ killings give smiles of satisfaction. The multiplayer section is a real mysterious object. From the server list it would appear that all are deserted; trying to enter a lobby at random, however, you may find that it is populated by other players. The problem is to join the games: in our case we never managed to do it, despite having opened all kinds of ports and disabled any firewall. Comparing ourselves with some users, we discovered that some lucky ones succeeded in the enterprise, but the joy only lasted a few minutes since, for who knows what mysterious reason, they found themselves forced to restart the title. It is sad to note that even in a similar project, conceptually designed for keyboard and mouse players, support for the beloved LAN networks is missing; it would have at least given us the opportunity to do some tests in the company of friends. The official site talks about a competitive mode (with team deathmatch, capture the flag and last man standing variants) in which the maximum limit of participants is set at 12 units; and a co-op where half a dozen people pit against bots. The pace of the game is decidedly slow and reasoned: pTo get an idea, just know that running in Takedown is equivalent to walking in Battlefield. This is because even a single rifle shot is enough to be killed and thus forced to start the action over again; each corner therefore represents a potential death trap, also because, at least in solitary mode, the enemies are reborn in always different points. In multiplayer instead it should (we use the conditional as we have not been able to test it) be necessary to wait for the round to end with a winner before taking part in the next one. This precise choice of design, which we had already seen for example at the time of America's Army, persuades the participants to adapt to the philosophy of the game, avoiding rash actions in favor of a silent approach, favored by a level design that develops both horizontally than on the vertical one. Too many bugs undermine the whole experience Artificial intelligence is catastrophic: from time to time the bad guys recognize us and are able to send us to the other world with half a bullet, but the times in which they remain perfectly still staring at the wall are much more frequent. And what about the IQ of our fellow venturers? Useless puppets that when it goes well serve to replace the leader who fell in battle. Only on a couple of occasions did they deign to return enemy fire, while most of the time they got stuck behind doors or limited themselves to making the New Year's-style train being shot down by the terrorist who arrived from the only point of view. 'access they should have controlled. Also from a graphic point of view we are faced with an incomplete work: the textures are very few and in very low resolution; it lacks any type of filter and even the shadows are desired, even at the highest level of detail. The characters then all seem to be graduates of Michael Jackson's dance school, as they move from one point to another. We can agree that it is a title designed for online and that the developers, rather than looking for the unrealistic special effect, were focused on functionality and cleanliness of the visual system, but in this release the union minimums that every commercial product should meet. The soundtrack is limited to the initial screen: a choice perhaps intended to increase the rate of realism, but perhaps something more could have been recycled from the old Unreal 3, of which Takedown uses the very expensive toolset. The sound effects are just enough and poorly placed in the environment, as are the sentences spoken by the bots. In short, it's really hard to find something that works in the technical system of Christan Allen's thinker shooter. A disaster all along the line Undeserving is the best adjective for this old-school FPS: Serellan, probably due to meeting the inexorable commercial deadlines, has released a largely defective version. Not only are there huge bugs that de facto prevent the multiplayer gaming experience, but real chunks of code are missing. Equally reprehensible is the work of Valve, which should at least verify the correct functioning of the games it offers in the Steam store. The unfortunate users who let themselves be persuaded by the programmers' promises are organizing to ask for a refund; for our part, we strongly advise anyone to stay away from Takedown, at least for the moment. A real pity because, for what little it has been possible to see, the title has taken an interesting path that could give great satisfaction to a niche of players that has been neglected by large-scale distribution for many years. Let's hope that the publisher 505 Games will be able to inject the necessary liquidity to restore in a very short time the reputation of an intellectual property already heavily undermined by the wicked desire to respect the delivery dates at all costs.", "date": "2013-09-30", "grade": "3.0"}
