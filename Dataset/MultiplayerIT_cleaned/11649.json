{"name": "5 Card Slingo Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/5-card-slingo-adventure.html", "text": "Have you ever played a game of Slingo? It is a game created just over ten years ago, which combines elements of poker and slot machines. In practice, you have a board made up of a variable number of boxes that form rows and columns. Each spin of the slot machine brings up five cards, and we can arrange the ones we want within the boxes. The goal is to score as many points as possible (also because we will often have a minimum to reach in order to move on to the next stage) by composing pairs, three of a kind, full house, four of a kind and so on both horizontally and vertically. It only takes a few seconds to learn how to play, everything else is pure fun... From the 5 Card Slingo Adventure start screen, we can decide whether to play a quick game, complete with tutorials, or try our hand at the career mode. In the latter case, we will face a long series of ~thematic~ stages, with the appearance of the board changing according to the city in which we are. A friendly character introduces us each time and tells us what are the minimum scores to reach in order to move on to the next stage, after which we can start pulling the lever (left function key) and arrange the cards as we please on the board, trying to total the maximum possible points in the rounds available. Very often we will understand right from the start whether we will be able to score astronomical scores or not, let's say that the ~luck~ component is important but strategy also counts for something. However, as we progress, things will get more complicated with ~blind~ areas on the board, which will force us to make different choices depending on the situation. Composing a pair or a set will result in a certain number of points, but doing it quickly will unlock extra bonuses related to the time spent, as well as the use of the cards indicated as ~bonuses~ for that round. Already after a few games, we will also find ourselves facing the mechanism that takes away points for pulling the lever during the last few rounds, which will make it absolutely necessary to arrive in that phase with a substantial loot, under penalty of game over. Technically, this new I-play product isn't and doesn't need to be extraordinary: the graphics are nice, the ~environmental~ differences of the scoreboards are noticeable and everything works very well. More than anything, the problems appear when you activate the sound: the effects are simple but nice, but unfortunately they cause a noticeable slowdown in the action when they have to be played. In short, never as in this case will it be better to turn off the audio. And what about the control system? It's absolutely perfect, immediate and very simple: pull the lever of the slot machine with the left function key, move around the board with the joystick and the FIRE button assigns a card to a box. PRO Amazing playability Long and challenging career mode Nice graphics AGAINST Sound slows down the action Only two game modes Multiplayer is missing", "date": "2008-01-30", "grade": "S.V."}
