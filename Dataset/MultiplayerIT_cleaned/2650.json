{"name": "ETERNAL RING", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eternal-ring.html", "text": "The game As you may have understood, Eternal Ring is a role-playing game, a genre known not only for the incredible stories that form the backdrop to the adventures, but also for the complex gameplay, characteristic of titles in this category. From Software's latest product stands out from the majority of the latest titles released, unfortunately not in a positive way. I would start with what you will notice first of all, that is the first person view. It makes movements and a whole series of actions very annoying, which in my opinion could be easily solved if one could use a common mouse. However, the PS2 does not yet enjoy this feature on the games released and you will therefore be forced to move with uncertainty and difficulty within the game. The layout of the keys, despite being variable (but not configurable) is not comfortable and everything is difficult, except the use of spells and rings. Not to mention the game physics: when you hit enemies, for example, you will never have the impression of having hit them. The monsters you will meet in the game are very particular and the last thing they can do is make you apprehensive, or anxious. The combat system, despite the presence of various spells and rings, remains that of a shooter. All topped off with an Artificial Intelligence that does not guarantee interest in the game. Positive notes are the main menu, which will allow you to access all the parameters of your character, and the plot which, despite everything, will involve you for a few hours. Technique RPGs are not particularly famous for the complexity of the graphics nor for the incredible sound. The developers focus mainly on the story and on the management of characters (as well as the fights and everything else). So you'll tell yourself: if Eternal Ring is lacking in terms of playability, it will certainly be a masterpiece from a technical point of view! Wrong. Indeed, very wrong. Crave and From Software have also focused little on this aspect. And this is very serious given that we are talking about a game for the most powerful console out there. The templates aren't horrible, but nothing exceptional at all. The settings are poorly maintained and do not reach the minimum level of other games recently released on any platform (excluding the GBC, of course). The textures used are poorly cared for and certain elements are so sparse as to really make you think you have bought a Playstation with a 2 added just for beauty. Graphic effects are practically non-existent. But the worst aspect of Eternal Ring is the synchronization between the movement of the mouth and the character's voice: it very often happens that he is silent and the mouth continues to move. The animations are very bad but even more so is the fogging that undermines many areas of the game. The sound is not bad: the sound effects are simple but not bad and the music is typical of fantasy role-playing games. However, you will often think that the sounds used have been taken directly from games of a very different level such as those of the Final Fantasy saga. The voices chosen for the characters are not suitable and do not fit well with them. Sad conclusions The last thing I can tell you is that Eternal Ring has many flaws and also the story is not very intriguing. In short, the purchase is recommended only for those who are hyper-enthusiasts of RPGs or for those who are collecting all the games released for PS2. The eternal ring The fantasy RPG genre is almost always characterized by the presence of a magical object for which humanity could be in great danger. Even the new title of From Software Eternal Ring has this feature: in his case the magical artifact is a ring called Eternal Ring (the Eternal Ring). This object with immense destructive power will be the one that you, in the role of Cain, will have to go and recover on the island of no return, a place full of dangers of all sorts, of course. 3", "date": "2001-01-10", "grade": null}
