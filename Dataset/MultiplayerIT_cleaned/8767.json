Of course, doing it more than two years after the release, also on Switch, of Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered and Assassin's Creed: The Rebel Collection, highlights a great confusion on the part of Ubisoft, given that many users in fact, they will find themselves having already played the conclusion of the story of Desmond Miles in advance of its central phase, the one that takes place through the memoirs of Ezio Auditore. Assassin's Creed 2 Assassin's Creed 2 and its extraordinary Florence, which still holds up today Still considered today as the best chapter of the franchise, Assassin's Creed 2 undoubtedly had the merit of consecrating the brand of the French house after its debut in 2007 and that ending which opened up many different possibilities for the protagonist, Desmond Miles: a simple bartender who is captured by the mysterious Abstergo Industries as the owner of particularly valuable DNA, but manages to escape and joins the Assassin Brotherhood. Supported by Lucy, Shawn and Rebecca, the people who freed him, Desmond connects again to the Animus to relive the memories of Ezio Auditore, a shrewd and rebellious young man who becomes an Assassin to avenge his family. His adventure takes place between Florence, Monteriggioni, San Gimignano, Forl and Venice: scenarios that the game still visually represents today in an effective and fascinating way, despite such an outdated polygonal modeling. Assassin's Creed 2, the face of Desmond has undergone a substantial evolution in the following episodes In this sense, it is above all the characters who pay the price, with some faces that already at the time had the flavor of a previous generation and which today, inevitably and despite the improvements of the remaster, appear unwatchable. However, the Nintendo Switch version takes off the weight of that blurry effect which in the days of PS3 and Xbox 360 was used to soften the graphics and which we also find in the Ezio Collection for PS4 and Xbox One, with the result of a visibly superior. From the gameplay point of view, the second chapter is the least sophisticated of the collection, clearly, and this is felt in particular in the presence of boring fetch quests, tailings and so on. The pace of the spectacular rooftop parkour is often interrupted by unwanted interactions, but the climbing stages involve puzzle solving and it's a shame that this aspect has been lost over the years. The combat system also shows the signs of aging and confirms a cumbersome organization of the commands, but at the same time boasts a discreet degree of challenge, so much so that in the first hours one is often forced to flee rather than fight: another element that Assassin's Creed series then sacrificed on the altar of accessibility transformed into trivial challenges and combos of dozens of chained kills. Despite its obvious limitations in mechanics and on a technical level, Assassin's Creed 2 nevertheless remains the most inspired episode among the three included in the collection: thanks to the suggestive Renaissance locations, but also to an enchanting mix of music and direction, as well as an excellent, extremely rich and capable of immersing us in the atmosphere of the time. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Assassin's Creed Brotherhood dramatically improves the faces of the characters We have mixed feelings towards Assassin's Creed Brotherhood: on the one hand this episode presents a very notable technical improvement as regards the characters and their faces, but in some cases the style is not fully convincing and Renaissance Rome, despite its extremely suggestive glimpses , perhaps appears too large and in the peripheral areas it loses a lot, resulting empty and dull. In the same way, some of the innovations introduced for the occasion, see for example the possibility of exploring the settings on horseback, clash with some graphic limitations that unfortunately we find also on Nintendo Switch, in this case there is a really marked pop-up effect, with assets that appear out of nowhere when you move quickly: a defect also present in Assassin's Creed 2 in the same situations. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and the magic of the Colosseum In terms of gameplay, this episode witnesses the transformation of Ezio into a real unstoppable war machine, between combos andweapons that can now be picked up from the ground, albeit for impromptu use. This component unfortunately reduces the degree of involvement, the tension that was previously breathed in the face of challenges from which to escape when necessary, while at the same time there is a growth in the open world component, with a map that is not only larger but also full of things to do. As already happened on PS4 and Xbox One, also on Nintendo Switch The Ezio Collection lacks multiplayer modes, but it is a lack that frankly does not weigh that much. On the other hand, the presence of the tombs is interesting, with their puzzles, but also getting lost in the analysis of all those elements that the developers have improved in terms of interface and quality of life compared to the second chapter of the series, and there are many. Assassin's Creed Revelations Assassin's Creed Revelations, Desmond's face has been greatly improved The most sophisticated game of the collection from a technical point of view, capable of substantially improving the polygonal models of the characters and offering us scenarios that are vast but rich and detailed at the same time, in this case the fascinating city of Constantinople but also the village of Masyaf where Ezio follows in the footsteps of his ancestor Altair, Assassin's Creed Revelations offers a fluid and convincing parkour but at the same time very banal fights. Narratively the experience is very strong and strikes the right chords, marking a meeting point between the first chapter of the series and the saga of Ezio Auditore, but from the point of view of the structure and gameplay we move a bit between ups and downs: as mentioned, the challenge is decidedly inconsistent, but some innovations immediately prove to be interesting and increase a pinch the variety of experience, more compact and less dispersive than Brotherhood. Additional content Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection not only includes Assassin's Creed 2, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Assassin's Creed Revelations and related DLCs, but also two interesting short films: the live action one Assassin's Creed Lineage, which tells the adventures of Giovanni Auditore before the events of the second chapter , and Assassin's Creed Embers, a cartoon that illustrates the final stages of Ezio's life. Graphics and sound Assassin's Creed 2, the statue of Amunet. Did you remember it? Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection allows you to observe the graphic evolution of the franchise as you move from one game to another, and some elements are truly baffling, such as the aforementioned characters' faces and a general attention to detail, especially the design of NPCs. On the other hand, little to say about the scenarios, which are truly evocative and fascinating: locations such as Florence and Venice will certainly awaken some nostalgic memories and still hold their own today, despite a modest overall polygonal count. The remaster itself is well done but not extraordinary, there there are still many low-definition textures in the foreground during the Assassin's Creed 2 sequences but we really appreciated the greater sharpness of the Nintendo Switch version and a frame rate that remains firmly anchored at 30 fps, even in portability and in the most crowded and chaotic situations . Too bad instead for the marked pop-up that is noticeable in some situations, especially when moving on horseback.", "date": "2022-02-20", "grade": "8.0"}
