We said right away, when our journey began last summer, that this last season openly attempted to recreate those same atmospheres in the player, almost as if it were retracing that journey that had been Lee and Clementine's. The last episode definitively closes the circle, sinking the knife with even greater force into the flesh of our feelings, trying to move those memories and throwing us one last anchor for a possible redemption, in a world that does not give anyone discounts. The good news is that the expectations for this conclusion have been well rewarded, net of a work that has perhaps experienced a few too many reshuffles, as is obvious given the incredibly troubled production events. The story of a homecoming Talking about the plot of the last episode is essentially impossible, without revealing details that would ruin the experience for any player. Never like this time, an episode of The Walking Dead lives on its own past, reducing interactivity to the bone, even giving life to the shortest of the chapters of this final season. You will hardly manage to exceed the two hours of duration, aware that you are experiencing a farewell in grand style to a journey that began seven long years ago. This is why the recovery from the end of the third season is fast and dramatic, soon leaving room for the final turning point which launches a second part entirely dedicated to the ~greetings~ of the protagonists. We know that Clem, AJ and their friends managed to thwart the threat of predators who had decimated their ranks, enlisting young boys to turn them into real war machines. The explosion of the ship attacked by the group of orphans has generated the right mess capable of setting in motion hordes of walkers. For this reason the group split up in order to find a way out or a shelter. There is obviously still time to close accounts with important characters like Lily, but the focus of the episode immediately reveals itself to be AJ's awareness of his own actions, and the first verbal clashes with his teenage guardian: Clementine. The relationship between the two is always on the verge of crisis, with a child now aware that the girl is not always right and capable of processing and reacting to Clementine's actions, scolding her and releasing that grit that had hardly been seen until today. However, being alone and battered again represents an opportunity to open up as never before, managing to face a problem as difficult as it is now everyday. The strength of the episode lies in its hectic times, which however know how to take the right detachment, to leave room for emotions and the last lessons, before AJ is ready to start thinking only with his own brain. Let's not hide that we were moved by hearing some very well written and acted dialogues, even snatching a satisfied smile from some directorial choices of great impact. The inclusion of an important flashback never really told is the backdrop to the tragedy of an episode that also carries a strong dose of hope. There is no doubt on the will of Telltale first and then of Skybound, to want to touch the most intimate and empathic chords of the viewer, putting the two protagonists in front of the most deadly of decisions, from which everyone will come out profoundly changed, some in body, who in spirit. AJ's maturation comes to fruition with a crescendo of decision-making responsibility and importance, putting to use all that Clementine has been able to teach him and in turn has learned from the bond with Lee. That Lee who returns to the lips of the protagonists again, as if he were still that latent driving force that never abandoned the series, despite his death already occurring at the end of the first season. Probably The Walking Dead: The Final Season is not as compelling and satisfying in its entirety as Telltale's greatest success was, also having to discount its now well-established structure; but it is impossible not to appreciate the desire to close such an important job with passion and dedication. The graphics that count (little) As regards the technical and purely playful sphere, we have learned over the months to appreciate the decisive step forward from a graphic point of view. Telltale's idea to bring The Walking Dead into the set of third-person adventures with an over the shoulder viewit always seemed right to us. Also thanks to a general improvement of the engine and a not indifferent artistic quality, able to make the most of the cel shading and to get lost only due to some slowdown too many, totally unjustified by the type of work. Skybound has not spent the little time available to get lost in putting something in place that already worked sufficiently overall and, for this, there is very little to add compared to the past. However, where the episode puts an extra gear and tries to stand out is the audio field, with a series of effects and a soundtrack that accompanies the end of this journey in a more emotional way than it has been up to now. The return of some pieces from the past, then, only accentuates a nostalgia effect that applies the right grip on the public.", "date": "2019-03-28", "grade": "8.0"}
