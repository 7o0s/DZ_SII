This time it's the guys from Fatshark who try, Swedish developers behind titles such as Lead and Gold and Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, who with Krater not only respond to the dictates of the category but also try to put some fresh ideas on the plate to give life to a interesting mix. Unfortunately, not everything went the right way and several problems keep their latest work away from the hoped-for excellence. The setting chosen by Fatshark for Krater calls to mind the Fallout series, and sees humanity fighting for survival in a post-apocalyptic future. The crater that gives the title to the game is an area that has mysteriously remained fertile, where some lucky travelers have settled and founded a prosperous city, a place where you can start over. Once a background has been established, the developers plan to explore it not only with Krater but with possible future DLCs and expansions, but unfortunately the game didn't particularly convince us from a narrative point of view, focusing the heart of the experience more on the actual gameplay than on the storytelling. The humorous vein with which the characters and settings are outlined definitely stands out, as well as the various dialogues. Choosing his native country as a setting also allowed Fatshark to joke about some clichs that characterize the view of Sweden, such as the important furniture company called IDEA (remember anything?). Good ideas, poor implementation Krater is proposed as an ARPG with an isometric view, freely rotatable, in which we control a group of three characters, corresponding to different classes to choose from among four. Initially the title looks good, teasing the player with some atypical ideas, starting right from the presence of a party, passing through inviting glimpses up to galvanizing once you gain access to the world map, which promises numerous and varied locations to visit and occasional seemingly random events. The management of the three protagonists, then, would seem to guarantee a certain strategic depth given the clear differentiation of the roles they play. In fact, we have the classic expert in close combat, more resistant to the attacks of the other companions, another specialized in inflicting substantial damage from a distance as well as slowing down or paralyzing the enemy up to the classic healer. Despite these foundations, going into the experience offered by Krater, the flaws began to emerge, starting with the management of the party itself. For example, not being able to pause the action combined with the speed of the fighting flattens the tactical possibilities, taking away the user's room for maneuver. The monsters, dangerously not very varied and with little artificial intelligence, which is evident in the assortment of groups against which you find yourself fighting, do not help to keep the interest high, apparently random since they are not able to exploit the different abilities to your advantage. Even if the powers of each character are only two plus a gadget each, the potential was not lacking to give life to a simple but still deep combat system. The dramas of permanent death The death of our heroes produces permanent damage that can only be solved by the doctors present in the cities, while a repeated sequence of game overs (the number of which depends on the chosen difficulty level) will mean the definitive demise of the character. We are thus forced to recruit new recruits, starting from zero level. As intriguing as an idea, a bad calibration of the difficulty level creates frustration, causing completely gratuitous deaths due to monsters with an arbitrarily too high level or invisible due to a map that darkens again every time we leave a location even if it is already visited. It seems like an obvious detail, but seeing the fog reappear on levels that have already been explored is confusing and annoying. Furthermore, the permanent death system, as it was designed, forces an accentuated grinding, necessary to evolve each new character. Note how these, when they pass away, take every upgrade installed with them, ruining the work done. The skill system implemented in Krater is quite simple and provides for the installation of upgrades in special slots, which can be unlocked by advancing in rank. Upgrades can be found from slain monsters or even produced through basic crafting in the game. And speaking of evolutionone of the three heroes, note how these are blocked by an arbitrary level cap, which forces the player to get rid of them once the maximum is reached, in favor of a new character who in turn can only grow up to a certain point. Furthermore, everything is not explained by a tutorial or contextualized by the narrative background. This, like the other design choices, are not in our opinion negative in an absolute sense, but it is their implementation that creates disorientation as well as a certain frustration. Finally, they ruin the identification in the game, as frequently rebuilding one's party certainly does not lead to becoming attached to the characters, devoid of characterization. The ancient taste of the isometric view From a purely aesthetic point of view Krater is quite convincing, even if it lacks in some important aspects. In fact, on the one hand we have captivating and varied settings, even if always limited in size, while on the other the characters who populate them all tend to look a bit alike. Furthermore, the character design, which in some ways recalls the cartoony style of Team Fortress 2, fails to completely convince. The same goes for enemies, flat and not very varied. The graphics engine is still capable of a good level of detail, caressing the view with successful effects, lights and shadows, even if the optimization leaves something to be desired. Leaving aside the chronic lack of settings (really reduced to the bone), Krater proved to be not very fluid even on configurations capable of handling much more demanding titles such as The Witcher 2 or the recent Max Payne 3 with agility, and from a title with an isometric view one would expect better. Finally, it should be noted that among the minimum requirements there is a graphics card with support for DirectX 10, perhaps a little too specious for such a title. The sound accompaniment is more appreciable, made up of catchy music and standard effects.", "date": "2012-06-25", "grade": "6.5"}
