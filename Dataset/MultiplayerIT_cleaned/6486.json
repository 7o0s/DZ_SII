The strong impression offered by Visceral Games' first attempt with the series is in fact that of a project whose shot seems to have been corrected in the running, to make it an episode in its own right. Not that the game lacks content, on the contrary: with the longest and most structured Campaign and the largest number of unpublished multiplayer modes in the series, together with undeniable production values, Hardline has the numbers on its side. Where this declination of the Electronic Arts saga in cops and robbers sauce shows a little too short of breath and confused ideas is on a conceptual level. Our review of Battlefield Hardline, in PlayStation 4 and PC version In this episode... The Battlefield Hardline Campaign looks great. The developers have in fact decided to try their hand at the detective theme through the format that has made it shine in recent years: that of the TV series. The story of the protagonist, the Cuban-born police officer Nick Mendoza, is in fact conceived as a telefilm in episodes (eleven, counting a non-playable prologue) complete with a rundown on the main characters in the opening credits and an incipit and a closing for each. Not only that: abandoning a game is accompanied by a trailer relating to what awaits in the next episodes, while resuming it is proposed a summary of the previous episodes. Hats off. On the other hand Electronic Arts has really left nothing to chance, pushing in a much more convinced way a speech that had already begun in Battlefield 4, with the involvement of Michael K. Williams (unforgettable Omar of a ~certain~ The Wire and Chalky of Boardwalk Empire) and Jessika Van, hiring for the occasion names of the caliber of Benito Martinez, Adam J. Harringhton, Kelly Hu, Mark Rolston, Alexandra Daddario, Nicholas Gonzalez and Eugene Byrd. Professionals to whom it would be necessary to devote an entire paragraph to list the most significant things in which they have participated in both television and cinema and who here lend their faces to the service of what between interlude sequences, dialogues, car rides, walks and other ~differently interactive~ solutions is undoubtedly the Battlefield with the highest concentration of story-related content. Too bad that the latter is the aspect that ends up making such a huge amount of effort unproductive. From a narrative point of view, in Battlefield Hardline everything is perfectly in the part: the tones, the characters, the jokes, the little characterizing touches. It's the facts that aren't particularly compelling, given that we live an ordinary matter of fighting drug trafficking, feuds between criminals and corruption that can't be more ordinary. And which, moreover, unfolds through rivalry, manifestations of complicity, sudden turns on comedy and twists and turns placed exactly where you expect them. It's all so usual, predictable and already seen that one begins to lose interest relatively soon, and so to the end, to the point that the small final shot at the end, although also a bit obvious, almost manages to surprise, leaving at least with a touch of satisfaction. A blunt bullet A similar argument also applies to gameplay. Visceral Games has tackled the detective concept well, introducing some new features and giving a well-known structure a direction that manages to make you feel adequately in the shoes of a Miami detective. The game beats a lot on the stealth component, only mentioned in the past, which with some exceptions always proves to be a viable alternative to solve problems. The ~tagging~ of enemies has been deepened, thanks to a scanner that allows you to locate them, constantly keep track of them and hear what they are saying. Reconnaissance finds its climax in a new dynamic, namely the arrest: by pulling out the badge, an enemy is ordered to surrender, then pointing the weapon at him until he reaches and neutralizes him. In the event that there are multiple subjects to be addressed, it is necessary to proceed by alternating in keeping them aimed, to avoid that one of them gets the dot of trying to surprise us. All of this is enriched by the possibility that a partner can intervene to support us, helping us to reverse a situation of numerical inferiority. Although in a somewhat mechanical and often crude way, Visceral has in short managed to capture the spirit and the subtle balance of forces of such moments of tension. Not only that: starting from the ~arcade~ setting of Battlefield 4, with itsscoring system, the Dead Space team has shored up the Campaign with concrete rewards that incentivize playing according to Nick's ~role~. Not on purpose, arrest is the option that scores the most points, even more than a particularly well-orchestrated sneak stun. Among the enemies we can identify some wanted people whose capture gives a bonus, not to mention that they can have evidence relating to optional investigations on them, with which to further increase the results. Similarly, you are urged to find as many clues relating to certain secondary cases, always acting with the scanner, during passages dedicated to pure investigation. Through the points it is possible to unlock new weapons, accessories and pieces of equipment, while in a very happy way it was decided to link the single player progression to the multiplayer component only through simple Battlepacks, avoiding forcing those who play Battlefield solely for the multiplayer to suffer violence to obtain specific weapons. Added to this is that the direct approach is also a little discouraged by the facts, given that in the event of a firefight, a few shots are enough to be remembered as agents who fell in service (on Veteran difficulty, which is the one we played , more often than not a couple is enough). A fragility that can be partially compensated for by choosing to equip Armored Insert and Medical Kit, without waiting for the latter to be extended to us by any partners controlled by artificial intelligence, in a fluctuating way to say the least. The painting drawn up to now undoubtedly appears to have been made with care and reasoning, but it deforms when it is placed in a lopsided frame which is the same as always. We really hoped that, thanks to the excellent competence shown with the saga of Isaac Clarke, the arrival of Visceral would have led to a leap in quality and instead Hardline continues to rest on the very fragile foundations of its predecessors, unable to properly handle even a simple overview of shootouts with a large rate of spectacularity, a la Call of Duty, let alone a type of gameplay that requires more flexibility. All kinds really happen: from the proverbial situation in which if you are spotted by even an isolated enemy, all the others suddenly go alert, miraculously sensing where we are, even before the comrade has fired a shot or even said something , to people who seem interested in doing something else during the shootings. It can happen to crawl behind someone and see him instantly turn towards us, without fail, or to arrest a criminal five meters from his cronies, without them batting an eye. All in the usual course stretched like a violin string, with a very rigid progression, bordering on laser game, especially as regards the sections in the car, which are always identical without allowing any margin for improvisation, accompanied by the usual level of refinement despicable, with people (still alive) who penetrate parts of the scenario or whose brain suddenly shuts down. The shootings themselves, for the most part, are short-lived hit-and-run skirmishes, in which enemies with major problems of movement and relationship with the environment are faced, compensated in an inelegant way by an aim with often suspicious precision. Hardline's single player doesn't even have particularly intense and spectacular moments, even limiting itself to the context of the series, compared to what is shown in the most successful passages of Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 or 4. The novelty effect for the new one has vanished. setting, on whose grip Visceral herself puts a spoke in the works given that ~playing well~ it is possible to accumulate points up to ~capping~ (Level 15 Expert) more or less already halfway, there is not much left to entice to pull off a mode that can take about ten hours to complete, apart from that Gold Battlepack obtainable with the last mission... Password: freedom If the single component fails to free itself from the role of simple filler this time too, the multiplayer one is characterized, as usual, by a very different caliber, although it too is not without contradictions and gray areas. First of all, Hardline gives a nice refresh to the progression system. In accordance with the new theme, money comes into play, thanks to which you can buy the weapons, accessories and gadgets you want without waiting to have reached particular criteria or condemn yourself to sad ~farming~ operations to unlock them. It must be said that the concept is not applied in an absolute way, given that in some cases in an understandable way, in others more sosmoky, certain accessories, the countermeasures of certain vehicles and other items are subject to the accumulation of points or the fulfillment of assignments, as in the past. To safeguard the taste of taking the field with a set-up that fits as much as possible to one's personal inclinations and at the same time as an incentive to experiment a little, without becoming fossilized, another appreciated novelty intervenes: for each Class it is possible to prepare up to five different Equipment (four actually, since the last one is reserved for Premium). For the rest, although they have changed their name, the types of fighters contemplated reflect the archetypes that have established themselves from Battlefield 3 onwards: the Operator is a stormtrooper who can heal and resurrect his companions, the Mechanic is able to repair vehicles and to damage them (although instead of an RPG he uses the 320 that was once supplied to the Assault), the Assassin - like a Support - replenishes ammunition, places charges on command and has a ballistic shield, while the Professional he is a sniper who in addition to mines (this time against the wall) can have training that makes him more silent. There is no shortage of card reshuffles (the portable spawn point is now the Mechanic's prerogative) and real novelties, among which the most interesting are the Teleferics, taken from Special Forces, which plant cables above which you can move at speed between two points , creating new navigation opportunities in the maps. Also appreciated were Stuntman (which equips vehicles with a turbo), Sabotage (which creates a trap) and the Gas Mask, a natural countermeasure for the Gas Grenade, which together with the Molotov cocktail stands out as the most interesting new entry in terms of ~consumables ~. During meetings over the past few months, Visceral's Ian Milham has always spoken to us proudly of the increase in pace and the increased speed is actually a quality that we would welcome in the new context of the game, underpinned in an apt way by innovations such as Reputation (which allows you to choose the Upgrades on the fly) and that of leaning out of the vehicles to shoot, and characterized by the confinement of heavy weapons such as RPGs and MGs to resources to be recovered on the field, of which you may have a mobile endowment, with adequate Upgrades of cars. It is a pity that, again, certain accounts have been miscalculated. First of all with the excessively low TTK (time to kill), which not infrequently makes the ambition for more eventful and intense games a chimera destined to crash in the hiccups of deaths that occur too suddenly. And then we still find ourselves having to deal with Frostbite, an engine that doesn't stop appearing problematic, right at the root. Let's be clear: we are far from the serious malfunctions that characterized Battlefield 4 at launch; Hardline is a game that works, but even in front of the final version, both in PC and PlayStation 4 format (already updated to version 1.01), we cannot see how the title signed by Visceral seems built on outdated builds of the product signed by DICE . Deaths that occur clearly behind a wall, shots that don't start one-on-one as if you were under the effect of an additional suppression, trade kills (dying at the same time as the enemy, even if it wasn't an equal confrontation at all) and ad kills the work of shotguns and snipers that can only be understood through the Kill Cam are filth on the agenda, with which it is better to surrender as soon as possible to the idea of having to deal, if you want to try your hand at game. How and where Hardline features nine maps (like Battlefield 3, one less than Battlefield 4) and seven modes, five of which are new (a record for the series, considering the base games). However, it appears symptomatic of a certain design tribulation, as - in fact - the only types of 64-player games are old, a sign that in all likelihood the game would like to go with something else, but cannot do without bringing back certain features. And if the speech is understandable for the always very playable Conquest (present in 3 and 5 flag variants), it is less explained with the terrifying Team Deathmatch, which has never worked, since it was introduced in Battlefield 3. After a few days and with several more hours spent on the game, we feel like confirming the impressions about the five new modes, expressed in this article. In summary: Short Circuit and Rescue ensured our preferences, while having gained further confidence we fully re-evaluated Robbery and Dirty Money. To continue to appear inspired in a fluctuating way are the maps, in fact asc", "date": "2015-03-17", "grade": "7.0"}
