{"name": "Foretales", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/foretales-recensione.html", "text": "Card video games continue to be popular among fans and the reason is simple: they can take on many forms, always different and interesting. A new example of this rule is available from today, September 15, 2022. Let's talk about Foretales, which we already told you about a few months ago through our proven. Don't expect a Hearthstone-esque trading card game or even a rogue-lite adventure like Slay the Spire, because Foretales is all about storytelling and exploration, with less emphasis on combat and virtually no deckbuilding mechanics. If you want to find out every detail, continue reading our review of Foretales, which is available in PC version (the one used in our test) and Nintendo Switch. The world of Forestales Volepain, protagonist of Foretales, sees the future of the lyre Foretales takes us to a medieval-like world populated by anthropomorphic animals, a sort of dark Sherwood where we steal from the rich as well as the poor. We are, in fact, an ordinary petty thief, Volepain, who together with his friend Leo (a tiger) accepts a commissioned job to earn some money: steal a lira from a mansion in his city. However, the theft does not end in the best way as Leo is captured and Volepain is cursed by the lyre, which causes visions of possible nefarious futures. Indeed, the world is on the verge of destruction and our task is to avert catastrophes, or at least a part of them. The plot will make us explore the kingdom, going from cities and forests to caves and tropical islands. Each area will represent a mission that will give us the tools to prevent future Volepain visas from happening, if we make it in time. Each completed mission counts down the time and each bad event has a countdown. Getting the best result on the first try is almost impossible, but that's not a problem: Foretales is meant to be replayed (a game lasts five to seven hours). Volepain's dialogues themselves will change in subsequent games as the bird retains part of the memories. A simple board of Foretales The plot is fairytale-like, but not obvious: until the end of our second game we remained in doubt about who were actually the good guys and who were the bad guys, also because if we want we can even become real monsters, leaving trails of corpses on our way. Freedom of action does not apply, in fact, only on the choice of missions to complete and on their order, but also on our approach to them. For example, trying to complete an entire campaign without killing a single opponent is complex, but it allows us to notice how deep the game structure, cards in hand, is. Exploration, combat and morale Some locations are locked behind a fight in Forestales While it is true that Foretales is not a game in the deckbuilding category, it is still a card game and every action takes place with them. Each mission takes us to a place, such as a city for example, and places us on a board that has three, four or five squares. Each square is an environment, such as a market or an alley. A deck contains all the main environments, but there are always additional ones that can only be placed if we use an action card from our characters, who in turn have a predefined deck. For example, in an alley, Leo can use his nose to find a tavern where further actions can be performed with other cards. The adventure is based on this mechanic: playing a certain card in a certain place to reach certain environments, where we can find what we need to advance. Foretales tells us in advance what will happen following a certain action, so it's not about trying your luck. It could therefore seem very easy, but the more you advance, the more complex the combinations of places and cards become and, even with various clues, it is not always obvious to understand what to do. In some cases you can even ~get lost~ and certain passages are sometimes unclear: those who want to have a ready answer right away could easily be annoyed by the Foretales structure, know that. We also feel that in the final stages the difficulty level is much higher than everything else in the game - it's a shame because Foretales only works great when it strikes the perfect balance between elaborate but not too challenging. Some tweaks to certain sections would be welcome, but on average we can still be satisfied with the design of the missions. But exploring is only part of the game. Many environments and actions are not used to advance the plot, but make us accumulate valuable resources valid for the current mission.or, as food, money, fame, and wickedness. These are used to obtain temporary allies but also specific objects that are used for special actions and are very important for combat. Allies can be used for our characters in Foretales As a rule, combat is simply a confrontation between the hero and the enemy facing him, on a dedicated board. Damage is inflicted and suffered and through allies, upgrade cards and objects such as a throwing knife or a Molotov cocktail it is possible to get the better of it, killing enemies. However, our characters are fragile and as you progress, finding cures will become more and more complex, so the real challenge is being able to make your enemies flee by spending money, fame, wickedness or with certain special cards. Enemies usually have a morale level, and making some enemies flee resets it, causing the remaining enemies to flee. The game invites us to act without bloodshed, so we are pushed to collect resources in secondary areas, to act in such a way as not to increase the number of enemies chasing us and which could appear in the places we explore. The characters then have a limited number of cards and to get some back you have to spend resources or suffer some penalties, so each mission is like a huge timed chess game, in which we try to figure out what to do while optimizing the collection of resources. All this mix of mechanics works very well and is fun, also because each place has its own unique dynamics and also offers secondary tasks to complete to get bonuses. Adding to the fact that we won't be able to see every setting in a single game, Foretales is fun and interesting even after more than one adventure. Foretales combat, action cards can be used to stun opponents Everything is then embellished by the artistic side of Foretales. The soundtrack is pleasant and there are many sound effects that make us feel like we are inside a city or a forest, even if in reality there are only static cards in front of us. The real strength, however, is the narrator who comments on our every action, like a Dungeon Master who tells his players what surrounds them. The dubbing of Travis Willingham (Critical Role, The Legend of Vox Machina) is perfect. The cards are then designed perfectly and always very detailed, so much so that we would like to have them in physical format to collect them all.", "date": "2022-09-15", "grade": "8.5"}
