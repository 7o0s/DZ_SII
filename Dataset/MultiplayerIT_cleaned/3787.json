{"name": "Dead or Alive 6", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-or-alive-6-recensione.html", "text": "As we will see in the review of Dead or Alive 6, it is an emblematic product, the latest effort of a development team that has shown that it knows how to do great things (see Nioh: creating an excellent soulslike at the first attempt was not easy at all) but also aware to now address a niche of enthusiasts. In fact, if in the 90s fighting games represented a new, successful genre, extremely popular even in arcades, over time that trend has not been able to reinvent itself, giving way to much more ambitious experiences. In the specific case of DOA, we are talking about a project that tried to distinguish itself from the various Tekken, Virtua Fighter and Soulcalibur simply for the marked sexualization of its fighters: an element that on the one hand has undoubtedly created legions of diehard and passionate fans, from 'other has had to give way to many other media useful to meet the same needs. It is probably for this reason that the new chapter relies less on the eroticism exercised by skimpy girls with huge breasts, while leaving the options intact (in this case the unlockable costumes) that allow players of the old guard to remember what it was like to go from the underwear section of Postalmarket to the sophisticated algorithms that regulated the bouncing of the virtual bowls. In short, we find a mix of tradition and modernity in the package that is being offered to us today at full price by Koei Tecmo, in the form of an all too classic single player offer similar to that of Dead or Alive 5, with its story mode at parallel inserts, the DOA missions and the outline made of training, versus, survival and arcade sequence of fights, assisted by a multiplayer sector that gives a nod to eSports but appears for the moment all too essential, devoid of basic options and with some technical flaw. History The first thing you need to do before trying your hand at the story mode of Dead or Alive 6 is absolutely to change the dialogues from English to Japanese, keeping the Italian subtitles active to understand something. Not that the plot of the game demonstrates who knows what narrative maturity, indeed especially in the early stages the situations represented easily fall within the average of a genre that from this point of view has never passed puberty. The problem is that when this type of approach is associated with the excessive emphasis of the interpretation in English, something literally unlistenable comes out, whereas instead the Japanese dubbing manages to enhance the absurdity of certain sequences which ultimately draw on to that kind of imagery and do not benefit from a translation. But let's go back to the story, which once again sees the organization of the Dead or Alive tournament by Helena Douglas, but with a series of events in the background that change the picture of the situation quite a bit. In fact, it seems that the young Honoka is hiding a secret, and three different factions try to approach her to find out: on the one hand the trio made up of Kasumi, Ayane and Hayate, on the other Helena herself who sends the exuberant Marie Rose on her behalf, and finally one of the new entries in the game, the nerdy scientist NiCO, in the pay of Christie. Around the confrontation between these groups, subplots develop that see the other new entry Diego as protagonists, as well as the various Eliot, Rig, Tina Armstrong and her father Bass, the crazy Zack, the champion Mila and others: the completion of all the chapters it takes some time and this can only be a good thing, even if the degree of challenge is generally trivial and you have to commit a little only when you get to the final stages. Structure The full-bodied story mode is not the only content available for the single player sector of Dead or Alive 6, which also includes a traditional arcade mode, a survival mode, the inevitable training and the return of the DOA mission. It is a series of challenges based on a traditional progression system, in which specific objectives must be achieved to earn from one to three stars and therefore be able to try new missions. Completing these progressively more complex tasks helps you become familiar with some of the more refined mechanics of the gameplay, such as lateral movements and what you need to do to counter them, ground strikes, holds and counter-holds, the ability to pull off quite effective combos and so on. However, a modern match fighting game must also offer quality multiplayer, especially if it aims at eSports, and in this context the new Team Ninja title unfortunately disappoints both in terms of quality and quantity. The servers have been shut down for Mayr part of the time during our tests, but they opened their doors on the last available day and we were therefore able to play some online matches with Italian colleagues and beyond. Beyond the fact that for the moment it is not possible to organize customized games with lots of lobbies and invitations, but only to search for ranked challenges (we will have to wait for a free update for this to be fixed), it seemed to us that the netcode and the quality of the competitive experience is in line with what was experienced in the beta, therefore very far from perfection. The indicators of the responsiveness of the connection often turn out to be unreliable, it happens to run into conspicuous blocks and episodes of lag even in games that on paper should work perfectly, and this clearly does not bode well for the usability of Dead or Alive 6 in professional circuits; but above all it makes the game substantially crippled, fragile precisely in those aspects where one should have bet with great conviction. Characters and gameplay The controversial nature of Dead or Alive 6's offering is confirmed by a cast of characters which, as mentioned, includes only two new entries, Diego and NiCO, while guest Mai Shiranui will arrive as DLC in June, along with a another star of The King of Fighters still shrouded in mystery. Mind you, the roster of the Team Ninja fighting game is already quite rich and varied, but a really long time has passed since the release of the previous chapter and it was therefore reasonable to expect some more effort from this point of view. The characterization of the fighters is solid, not so much in the aesthetic categories (at first glance it is easy to confuse some of the female characters) as in the fighting styles, reproduced very well in terms of animation, timing and general rendering on the screen. Diego, for example, is a rough and impactful street fighter, well planted on the ground, who uses his fists a lot but does not disdain kicks, while NiCO represents the by now classic figure of the nerd with glasses, equipped with devices that allow her to emanate powerful electric shocks but also physically able to have his say, thanks to a quick and effective approach. For all the others, the changes fall within the nuances, in some cases they are clearly noticeable and in others not, partly masked by a gameplay devoted to greater immediacy, greatly simplified in certain respects. With the default layout it is in fact possible to access the special moves by simply pressing the right backbone, ringing a spectacular combo that can end with a devastating final blow if you have both ~fury~ bars. The Triangle System is confirmed by the traditional order of priority for strikes, holds and counter moves, the latter having a further category of great strategic value. The impact of the attacks has been very well represented, which is fundamental, but longtime fans may turn up their noses at an approach clearly devoted to inclusiveness, which while introducing new tactical aspects actually makes it easier to inflict consistent damage to the opponent. Speaking of damage, the interaction with the scenarios is also present in Dead or Alive 6 and produces consequences that are as spectacular as they are painful for those who suffer them, with a couple of really crazy sequences (see the giant octopus or the dinosaurs) which however they inevitably go to influence the balance of the matches. Playstation 4 trophies The Dead or Alive 6 Trophies range between the various contents of the game, allowing us to unlock achievements by simply completing certain actions for the first time, specializing in certain operations (getting a certain number of stars in the DOA Mission mode, winning twenty games ranked, play ten or a hundred) and putting in enviable performances online. Technical realization The technical aspect is certainly not the flagship of Dead or Alive 6, which from this point of view is still in good company if we consider the latest fighting games available on the market. The general glance is that of a title that has not made who knows what steps forward compared to the previous episode, and this trend is also highlighted by the presence of mostly recycled costumes and looks. Of course, there is no shortage of graphic improvements and there are situations in which they appear in all their evidence: some blows damage the characters' clothes, make their glasses or hair ties jump off (the latter rendered very well), as well as naturally causing grazes and swelling without exaggerating. In general, fightersthey boast a good expressiveness and the effects allow themselves the luxury of representing the sweat on the skin, the dust that is continuously raised in some stages, the fire and of course the very rapid, engaging changes of shot that occur when one of the contenders is pushed off a cliff, grabbed by a pterodactyl (yes) or by the huge tentacles of a sea monster. The internships reflect this desire for interaction, but not all of them shine from a design point of view and ~synthetic~ locations, in general, give very little satisfaction. On PlayStation 4 Pro there is an option that allows you to emphasize resolution or performance, but with the naked eye it is difficult to notice big differences between one preset and another: we are waiting for the usual technical analyzes to understand something more. What is certainly noticeable is a frame rate firmly anchored at 60 frames per second in most situations, but also subject to some bizarre dips. The soundtrack that accompanies the action boasts a decent selection of songs, some valid and some less, while in terms of effects and dubbing there is the aforementioned imbalance between the quality of the Japanese voices and those in English, frankly unlistenable.", "date": "2019-03-01", "grade": "7.5"}
