In this case the protagonist of the game is actually a very strange creature, a sort of celestial jellyfish with two external eyes, almost a reminiscence of the classic Rayman with his floating hands, who moves in an aquatic context looking from time to time for the right path and completing musical puzzles to ~liberate~ a series of worlds apparently trapped in a rock prison. Gameplay In The Lullaby of Life we will have a precise task, that is to activate certain switches through the emission of sounds that can be recalled by acting on the buttons of the interface or by pressing the relative icons on the body of our little travel companions. The latter must be unlocked during the missions, and each of them is characterized by a different symbol, which we find precisely in the puzzles to be solved: ~padlocks~ that must be unlocked by playing the right notes with the correct timing. campaign the game becomes more complex and multifaceted, rather quickly betraying the promise of a relaxing experience. In fact, not only do the puzzles begin to require a certain degree of readiness as well as the ability to understand the mechanisms that regulate them, initially very trivial, but also some connecting sections appear in which it is not clear what to do and where to go, ending up proceeding groping and without the possibility of receiving any indication: something that is very rarely seen in the mobile sector. Difficulties and commands Therefore, if the introductory phases of The Lullaby of Life prove to be far too simplistic and linear, with puzzles whose resolution is practically already written, after a while the situation changes and the scenarios become substantially more complex, introducing obligatory passages, barriers to deactivate and vibration transmission systems that must be exploited in the right way, and with the necessary timing, for our notes to reach their destination. The touch control system of the title developed by 1 Simple Game is of the traditional type, with a virtual analog stick placed on the left side of the screen, which appears and disappears or repositions itself as needed, proving to be sufficiently precise and reactive with respect to the actions that come to us asked to carry out during the campaign. Of course, some maneuvers (see the shot) remain quite obscure and in general there is a balancing problem that manifests itself precisely in the sequences in which the game takes a strange turn, avoiding providing us with help. Technical realization The atmosphere, as mentioned, is one of the main elements of The Lullaby of Life and there is no doubt that the game manages to create it effectively, thanks to a successful mix of graphics and sound. The music and sounds are practically the star of the adventure and do not disappoint, with pleasant tunes and enough variety to keep the melodies from repeating themselves excessively, while the design of the levels and the color tones chosen from time to time also give the maps the right charm. The problem, probably subjective, lies in the design of the character we control, which seemed sketchy and approximate, substantially less brilliant than the rest of the graphics. There are also some small naiveties in the rendering of the physics of the objects, for example when we move some stones with our weight, which betray a certain lack of refinement: maybe something can be done with the next updates.", "date": "2020-07-28", "grade": "7.4"}
