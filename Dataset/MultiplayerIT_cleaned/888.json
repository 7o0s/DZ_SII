{"name": "La Recensione di Boiling Point", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-recensione-di-boiling-point.html", "text": "The main storyline of the game closely resembles the canons of a classic action movie GTA goes into the jungle Boiling Point has certainly been influenced by GTA 3 in its supporting structure: as in the title made in Rockstar Games, here too we will have total freedom of action in the over 625 square kilometers that make up the vast game environment (and we will never have any loading blocking the action but some indigestible shots in moments when the hard disk is whirling) with the possibility of using a really high number of vehicles (25 to be precise) starting with cars, vehicles for water and for the air, up to a very savage tank. But the Deep Shadows programmers have a higher civic sense since to carry the various gimmicks, it will be necessary to take various licenses (a sort of tutorial that is very useful for gaining confidence with the peculiar characteristics of planes, motorboats, etc.). As in GTA then, in addition to the main mission (that is, to save Meyers' daughter and I assure you that the unexpected will be the order of the second) we will be able to embark on many other secondary subquests capable of bringing the gaming experience to longevity peaks really impressive, as well as essential to get the money needed to buy upgrades for weapons, vehicles, etc. Another point of contact with GTA will be the relationship with the factions present on the field: these will not only be useful for us to obtain various missions but diplomacy in some cases will be essential to have good allies in particular circumstances. However, this aspect has been decidedly little taken care of by the programmers given that the transition from conflicting to friendly relationships will take place in a decidedly approximate and careless way. In practice, a positive or negative action against the faction cancels the previous situation in a single instant and this can sometimes happen fortuitously, for example by entering a jungle area controlled by the rebels by chance without having the faintest idea (hardly the guerrillas put up signs to inform of their presence). In this way, everything that could have been a management component is transformed into a sequence of mechanical and sometimes even involuntary changes. The title of the Deep Shadows programmers is proposed with a highly developed role-playing game soul Role Playing inside Boiling Point, however, is by no means a clone of GTA, far from it since it has many peculiar elements. In addition to the fact that it tends to be an FPS, the title of the Deep Shadows programmers is proposed with a highly developed role-playing soul starting with the many multiple-choice dialogues that will directly influence the unfolding of events, to then move on to the management of our equipment which closely resembles the role playing archetypes. The pesos will in fact be essential for acquiring means and weapons but will also become indispensable in certain situations in order to obtain the information necessary for our mission. So don't be surprised if you find yourself working as a taxi driver or shopkeeper to get some ~dineiro~. It therefore becomes essential to rummage in the inventories of the gringos that we will kill and take all the objects that may be useful to us later. But where is the fun? As you can understand, we are faced with a very ambitious game structure that succeeds in its intentions given that it has proved capable of making us experience the sensation of truly being in a complete and living microcosm even beyond our presence. Therefore, if Boiling Point takes our blessing on an ~ontological~ level, the same cannot be said for the more interactive and playful aspect: here the fiasco by the Deep Shadows programmers is absolutely colossal. It is difficult to even begin to list the defects present in BP: one could start from the impressive amount of graphic bugs (but which also affect the interactive component), from a damage calculation system that has nothing to do with Soldiers of Fortune 2 and it turns out to be absolutely careless. But, and this is the deleterious aspect, it is difficult to have fun playing Boiling Point in the non-RPG parts: driving the vehicles proves to be mortally boring and there will be sections in which we will have to cover dozens and dozens of kilometers without doing anything other than pressing the forward arrow (and be careful not to break the vehicle: there is no way to find an alternative solution to walking for hours other than committing suicide and waking up treated in hospital but without money and with an almost empty inventory!). Even in the more typically FPS parts, the comparison with a decent shooter sees Boiling Point come out absolutely broken: thegame always seems to be on the border between simulation ambitions and arcade approach without however demonstrating that it has a very precise nature but above all unable to stand out qualitatively at any time. Not to mention the low value artificial intelligence, capable of surprising us only when the enemies are absolutely hidden from our sight (and from a playful point of view, this is certainly not pleasant ...). The game always seems to be on the borderline between simulation ambitions and arcade approach without however demonstrating that it has a very specific nature but above all unable to stand out qualitatively at any time AAA: desperately looking for a stable frame rate On the technical side, Boiling Point offers us joys and pains. Undoubtedly, from a quantitative point of view, BP is impressive: I am not referring only to the size of the immense map, but also to the amount of elements on the screen with a horizon that is not only very distant but capable of presenting many objects even at a very distant distance. Particular attention was then placed on the creation of the vegetation and in this respect BP absolutely does not look bad with any title on the market today, including Far Cry. The special graphic effects are equally of the highest quality as well as the polygonal realization of the various buildings present in the villages in which we will find ourselves. On the other hand, however, we unfortunately also have to note a mediocre visual realization of the characters (with the poor actor Vosloo who in the digital version seems to have gained 20 kilos) and of the means that show a rather low aesthetic level. But even more serious is the problem of the frame rate: despite the fact that the test system had much higher characteristics than the recommended hardware specifications, despite the graphic parameters decided by the auto setting have not been modified, the frame rate proved to be unstable in some situations for reasons not easily understood since these were not moments with many characters and action on the screen. The only way to have a fluidity that was almost never questioned was to lower the detail and video resolution by a lot but with truly abject visual results. Odi et amo also for the sound: from the moment of installation we will be accompanied by a Latin rock-pop in the style of ~From Dusk To Dawn~ which is sublimely suited to the atmosphere of the game. The dubbing of the characters stands on a very high quality, absolutely worthy of a feature film and also all the sound effects present prove to be very convincing. Too bad then having to also note some sound bugs with music sampled at a very low frequency, frequent asynchrony between the speech and the lip movement of the characters and a rather abstruse choice in starting the songs when we are on board a car. although the test system had characteristics much higher than the recommended hardware specifications, although the graphic parameters decided by the auto setting have not been modified, the frame rate proved to be unstable in some situations for reasons that are not easily understood A great missed opportunity. This is the comment in a nutshell for Boiling Point. If on paper, the new Atari production could have given a hard time to the same Grand Theft Auto series thanks to the implementation of a greater RPG component in a very free structure similar to Rockstar Games' goose that lays golden eggs, the programmers of Deep Shadows have failed to forge their creature with a sufficiently valid and engaging gameplay, lacking in terms of artificial intelligence, interaction with the environment and the playful component in the strict sense. As if that weren't enough, there are gross graphic bugs that also undermine its aesthetic credibility: so don't be surprised if some vehicles go against every law of physics or various enemies get stuck with the walls and doors of the buildings. Let's not talk about the frame-rate, unstable even on very powerful machines and fluctuating sometimes for reasons that are not easily understood. In spite of all these elements just listed, Boiling Point deserves a very difficult pass given that it presents the best pulsating and living virtual microcosm that has been seen in a videogame production, capable of immersing the player until the listed defects become too evident and annoying. We chase the news on the release of various patches that will fill the shortcomings of Boiling Point: we hope that at least in part the title can be optimized given that Deep Shadows had a masterpiece in its hands but perhaps the excessive pretentiousness of Russian programmers has port to the creation of a giant with feet of clay. Pros: A living and pulsating microcosm like never before seen RPG component of excellent workmanship Very free and dynamic game structure Cons: Insufficient gameplay Obvious and macroscopic graphic bugs Frame-rate instability incorrigible Mixed boiled meat The free structure of Grand Theft Auto, the depth of an RPG in the style of Vampires or Deus Ex, a damage calculation system worthy of Soldiers of Fortune 2. There is undoubtedly no shortage of noteworthy references to Boiling Point, the Atari production created by Deep Shadows programmers and which was heralded by the software house as a title capable of surprising and satisfying even the most demanding players. Will things have gone like this? Let's find out together The main plot of the game closely resembles the canons of a classic action movie: mister Saul Meyers (who has the features of the actor Arnold Vosloo seen in the role of Imothep in the first two episodes of the Mummy but also in Darkman 2 and 3) is a quiet retired ex-mercenary enjoying life after a rather adventurous existence. When everything seems to be going right, however, he receives a desperate call from his daughter, an assault journalist by profession, who finds herself embroiled in a not too pleasant situation since she is kidnapped by an unspecified criminal organization in a nation that remembers very close to Colombia (ie paramilitary groups, anti-government guerrillas, drug traffickers and the traveling company). In such a chaotic background, Meyers will have to make his way out and save his daughter: luckily for us, our virtual alter ego is quite familiar with such situations...", "date": "2005-07-06", "grade": null}
