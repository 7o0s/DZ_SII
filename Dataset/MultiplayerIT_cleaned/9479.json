This is what happened to Inazuma Eleven, a lucky football RPG that has only just arrived on the European market, but released in 2008 in Japan and instantly became a real phenomenon. Clearly winking at the historic Captain Tsubasa series (Holly and Benji), Level-5 has given life to a full-bodied and interesting game that combines the best of the role-playing genre with the competitive atmosphere that only a sport like football can convey, making leverages distinctive and charismatic characters to captivate the player. And, considering the results obtained in the Land of the Rising Sun, it would seem that the authors of Professor Layton have hit the bull's-eye again. Ball in the center! Those who have already followed the episodes of the animated series certainly already have an idea of the target to which the game is addressed, the protagonist characters of the adventure and, above all, the exaggerated tones that the various games take on. The protagonist of the game is Mark Evans, a young goalkeeper of the very poor Raimon Jr. High school team who, tired of conceding 20 goals in each game, decides to roll up his sleeves to bring him and his teammates to success. Obviously to the sound of acrobatic jumps and plasma balls on endless playing fields. However, despite the premise, the game is totally different from any attempt to get Holly and Benji behind a gamepad. In fact, from the first minutes the player finds himself in front of a full-blown RPG, where the real games take on unexpectedly strategic hues. The gameplay of Inazuma Eleven is basically divided into two parts: the first, exploratory, allows you to wander around the city and in the various buildings, chatting with other more or less important characters to obtain information or complete certain objectives. From this point of view, the experience is very linear, while the player's freedom is rather limited; all the objects or characters with which it is possible to interact are characterized by a specific balloon, while the direction in which to go and the current mission are always indicated on the upper screen. The characters move comfortably using indicating the direction on the touchscreen, although often the player is blocked by very long and unfortunately futile dialogues. The action is sometimes interrupted by animated cutscenes, which are made even more enjoyable by the excellent Italian dubbing inherited directly from the animated series. It's just a shame that these sporadic cutscenes, while well integrated into the action, help to highlight the rather dull and outdated graphics of the actual game. Outside of the playing fields, Inazuma Eleven is an RPG in all respects, giving the possibility to enhance its players, learn new techniques or assign objects capable of improving their parameters. It is even possible to hire over 1000 different characters, each with a different design and characteristics, bringing to mind the hours spent hunting for Pokmon. In this regard, the two systems with which you get new athletes into your team are very interesting: if you meet some requirements and have enough Charisma Points, you can sign other players from your contact list, where you can ' the champions to the defeated teams. So far everything seems normal, but it is only once you take the field that you realize how much that of Level-5 is a decidedly atypical RPG. The matches against other teams replace the classic battles in all respects, in fact becoming the main means of obtaining experience points and objects. By tracing some lines with the stylus it is possible to choose the direction in which the players must move, sprint and kick, while the game pauses at each direct confrontation with an opponent: both in defense and in attack, in this tactical phase it is necessary to decide between a safer action and a more risky but equally effective one, and the outcome of the dispute depends above all on the characteristics of the two players and on a Chinese morra system based on elemental alignment. Each character can be of the wind, tree, fire or mountain type, gaining benefits or handicaps depending on the situation. For example, a fire-type technique is more effective if the player using it is of the corresponding element, whereas in a direct confrontation it is easier to win if your element beats that of the opposing athlete. This interesting gimmick adds a huge dose of strategy to the game especiallyin the preparation phase, making it necessary to balance the team and decide which players to take on the pitch. Pressing L and R also enters the so-called Fury mode, which can be used only once in the whole game and which temporarily increases the skills of its players, allowing for a lower consumption of Technique Points when performing special attacks. Once activated, the latter start a short 3D sequence, in which a devastating and often unstoppable cannon shot is launched on goal amidst flames, lights, thunder and special effects. Each match is fun to play and refreshingly strategic, capable of delivering a heavy dose of euphoria and satisfaction with every goal. More questionable is the choice to insert random challenges during the exploratory phase, although the developers have tried not to weigh them too much, making them infrequent and inserting a specific result in each one to be completed.", "date": "2011-02-11", "grade": "7.8"}
