As happened for our review of the iPad version, we will not examine, if not marginally, the gameplay aspects of the very successful game (which has become so popular as to generate competitions and rankings worldwide), as it has already been extensively covered in the PC review , but we will review the smartphone adaptation, with strengths and weaknesses of this conversion, comparing it with the computer and iPad version. Hearthstone arrives on smartphones with a perfect conversion, destined to amplify its success Smaller, more comfortable The application, when launched, is identical to that of the iPad version (reviewed at this address). After having shown us the daily missions, if they are still to be completed, we arrive at the main screen where we can immediately notice the first differences concerning the presence of the four selection buttons for Shop, Opening Packs, Personal Collection and Missions positioned above the typical box of Hearthstone instead of below it, while the remaining coins indicator, the options menu icon and the friends list icon are positioned at the top instead of the bottom. Some new buttons have been added to the card collection that make various filters appear or disappear that are normally always visible thanks to more space available in the other formats: for example, the filter for dividing the cards based on their cost of flip or filter to view only cards of a single class. Wanting to verify the presence or not of defects in the consultation of the collection we noticed that, although the cards can be enlarged to read the text, when we place our finger on one of those that is in the bottom row and that has a double ability, such as example Charge and Battle Cry, the tooltip box is shown with the text cut off: something of very little importance, especially for those who already know the game, but it is clear that some tweaking is still needed. The card creation interface, using dusts, shows some minor changes in terms of positioning but is essentially unchanged. Let's now analyze the beating heart of our Hearthstone game, the game table, the interactions with it and the visibility of the cards and mana crystals. The first thing that catches the eye is the lack of two of the four corners of the board to make room for displaying the cards in hand and their backs. The mana crystals are not lined up like in the iPad and PC versions but displayed numerically within a single crystal divided by a bar which, on the left, will give you the number of available mana crystals and, on the right, the total ones. Don't worry if the cards seem very small to you, as it will be enough to ~touch~ them to have them all larger and more visible. The effect is very fluid and immediate and it is impossible not to appreciate the splendid conversion work that Blizzard has carried out by expertly exploiting every space on the small screen. Here too, wanting to nitpick, we noticed a small difficulty when we targeted ourselves, using a card in hand, as the hero was covered by the cards so much that he had to make space between them with fingers: it will take some practice to avoid making mistakes, even if, perhaps, here Blizzard could have thought of a different solution. Everything in the right place The game has been tested mainly on iPhone 6, 5S and Galaxy S5 without any system crashes or slowdowns. With less performing systems, such as the iPhone 4S or Galaxy S3, the uploads are much longer and one gets the feeling of ~lagging~ a bit when moving through the menus. As for the sound sector, music and sound effects, we are faced with a perfect conversion as had already happened for the iPad; the voices of the characters represented on the cards react to the pressure of our fingers by pronouncing their sentence in a precise and completely analogous way to a mouse click. The cross platform of each existing version has also been maintained on smartphones: the Battle.net service works great and it is practically impossible not to find opponents at any time of the day or night, whether you want to play friendly matches or try your hand at climb the ranks to become Legend rank. Naturally, the version of Hearthstone on smartphones is the latest distributed and for this reason the spect mode is also includedactor. Also for the smartphone version we have the device stand-by problem that we had noticed in the iPad version therefore, if this device function is activated, you will be disconnected from the game and, unless you reconnect by restarting the app within a few seconds, will be irrevocably lost. Also be careful, because Hearthstone consumes the battery of your smartphone in a rather important way so make sure you close all the other open apps: we have not carried out a real test but we have consumed 30% of the battery after just an hour of play ( with iPhone 6).", "date": "2015-04-22", "grade": "8.5"}
