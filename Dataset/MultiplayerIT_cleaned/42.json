Both Sonic Adventures tried to establish themselves on new shores, to introduce new concepts, but none of them completely succeeded in the enterprise: due to design problems, technical incapacities or simply because all the speedless sections, even if well done, of Sonic they had very little. However, SEGA has not given up, also given the affection of the fans and the great commercial value of the brand, and is still trying to insert the hedgehog in an appropriate three-dimensional context: Sonic for 360 and Play Station 3, however unsuccessful or badly made , is clear proof that the experimental phase is not finished, and who knows that in the future something capable of restoring glory to this legendary character may not really be born. The episode for Wii on the other hand is a sort of acceptance of the impossibility of adapting the brand to three dimensions, which could make long-time fans turn up their noses but which could certainly benefit the brand and above all the players. If Sonic can no longer be a masterpiece, let it at least be a good, solid, fun and adrenaline-pumping game. The Secret Rings is, in intention, the re-proposition in three dimensions of the linear stages that made the porcupine great. Let's run! The game is divided into eight worlds (one is a simple mosaic of tutorials), each consisting of various quests: in most cases these missions are set in the same stage, limiting themselves to retracing the same stretch with a different objective or enemies but of course there are exceptions. To play Sonic you need to place the Wiimote horizontally, since you'll just move the hedgehog left and right by tilting the pad: the character will go on by itself, it's up to you to direct him in the right direction. Luckily, you can stop his run by bending the remote back, and of course you'll need to use the keys to perform certain moves, such as jumping. Let's specify right away that the control system in the fast stages works very well: the sense of speed is high, the concept is the same as the 2D titles with the difference that you go deep, and everything is a lot of fun. The game requires excellent reflexes, and in some cases it forces you to memorize the track to cope with the various obstacles that arrive one after the other: the race is adrenaline-pumping, and spectacular as usual. The level set in the ocean, about halfway through the game, is as exciting as only the first stage of Sonic Adventure probably managed to be (limiting the discussion to this saga). The only comment that could be made in these parts lies in the fact that very often the limits within which Sonic can move are not understood, given that they are generally represented by invisible walls and not by the setting. The serious problems arise during the slow sections, problems that you can choose what to attribute: to the control system, because it was not designed for such parts and therefore works very badly, or to the level design, since these sections with shouldn't have existed. The character, as mentioned before, moves forward automatically at all times: when you run or jump at speed you don't have major impediments, everything works well, while when precise leaps are required, the situation becomes frustrating, given the impossibility of grading them adequately. Even worse are the parts in which you have to kill all the enemies on the screen, because, closed in a limited environment, you will not be able to control the character freely, but you will have to move him by dosing the run forward and moving him sideways: these situations are really boring, not they add nothing to the game and are present, more or less frequently, in every level. On the other hand, the battles with the bosses are commendable, quite challenging and well done, as are the various objects that use the sensors of the wiimote, never forced and rationally inserted into the context of the game. Eight chapters The game is quite demanding, it takes about fifteen hours to complete it, rather tiring: of course not for what Sonic will do, but for what you will do with your arms. In fact, every time you want to hit an enemy you will have to move the remote control forward, not to mention the vases to be raised by quickly shaking the Wiimote up and down. Completing the title 100% instead will take you much more time, both because some missions are difficult and because even the easiest goal becomes difficult if the goal is perfection. A novelty of this game lies in the introduction of amechanics similar to that of rpg, as at the end of each level you will be given experience points, which you can use to buy new skills. This change, which could have been important, on balance is quite marginal: the additional abilities that you will unlock will often be superfluous, and it would have been better to simplify the whole procedure and limit it to those few really significant actions. We only talked about it towards the end of the article precisely because this function is not as fundamental as it might initially appear, and takes on a certain relevance only when, in fact, you want to retrace each stage trying to finish it without any errors: in this case even the smallest nuances, therefore even the least important skills, will be essential. The multiplayer takes care of extending the experience even further, which for being in a pseudo-platform is unusually pleasant: nothing exceptional, but thanks to the freshness of the Wiimote some minigames can be played willingly. To be an extra mode it is well done, but as such it should undoubtedly be considered. The thousand and one nights Technically the game is very good, it never slows down and above all boasts pleasant polygonal structures; the protagonist has been both modeled and animated with care, the landscapes are complex and the light effects are excellent. Overall, it lives up to the best games seen on the GameCube, which would be nice to say for any Wii title, and in the economy of the saga it represents a middle ground between Adventure and the recent Sonic for 360. Even in this field though ~ The Secret Rings~ has problems, not on a technical level but on an artistic one: as much as it can be criticized, there is no doubt that in the transition to three dimensions Sonic has found a new, easily recognizable style. Set in ~The Thousand and One Nights~, this last episode brings the typical childish style of the old games closer to the coolest of the new ones: in fact, in the comic videos, the hedgehog is much more similar to its initial form than to its recent, which unfortunately did not affect its in-game representation, equal to that of the Adventure. The two styles do not amalgamate, on the contrary they clash with each other: it would have been appropriate to either create everything in a childish key, or everything in a more modern and aggressive one. The same goes for the sound, excellent in technical quality but often inappropriate and invasive, not bad in itself but unable to adapt to the changes in the pace of the game; the dub in English, moreover, was performed in a superficial way (you can always insert the one in Japanese). Comment Sonic for Nintendo Wii is certainly the hedgehog's 3D game conceptually closest to two-dimensional episodes: decidedly less ambitious than the Adventure or the recent title for 360 and Ps3, but probably the best among the polygonal ones. ~The Secret Rings~, albeit with many flaws, first of all the structuring of the slow-paced parts, is in any case an important potential first step: not towards a Sonic 3D capable of repeating what has been done in the past, but towards an enjoyable and concretely feasible game . The same introduction of character development, simplified and refined, could be interesting for the future of the series. Right now this way of understanding Sonic has given birth to a pleasant and rather fun title, decidedly attractive for supporters of the hedgehog who already own the console. Pros Excellent running sections Discreet multiplayer Valid technical realization Cons Uneven artistic direction Tedious slow parts Talking about Sonic means talking about the only character capable of rivaling Mario both from a playful and commercial point of view: during the 16-bit period the fight for supremacy was played both on and off the field, with both internal differences to games and stylistics: Mario was an intelligent, refined and sophisticated title, while Sonic focused more on speed and instinct. The blue hedgehog was created by analyzing the plumber's shadow, not because he was obscured by it, but because he was designed to do everything his rival didn't. While the Nintendo icon, thanks to the SNES episode, was laying the foundations for his future, inserting the exploratory component that would later be the key to the creation of Super Mario 64, Sonic continued to run, certainly always more decisively, on Mega Drives. The plumber, making use of the three dimensions, managed to evolve while remaining himself, as opposed to his antagonist, who still today struggles to find a new form.", "date": "2007-03-09", "grade": null}
