Wikipedia, as usual, helps us: it is the only mammal belonging to the order of pholidotes and it looks like an anteater but with a sort of ~tile~ armor covering its back. The pangolin can close in on itself like a hedgehog, thus trying to discourage any predators, but in the action game developed by Feedtank for iPhone this ability is used mostly to obtain a ~spherical~ character, which is not controlled directly by the player but which in each level must be ~addressed~ towards the exit. As? Using two fingers to place rubber bands to bounce him to freedom. Available on the App Store in free format, Pangolin offers ten playable levels without any outlay, after which to unlock the second scenario (and another forty levels) you have to pay the canonical 89 cents, which therefore constitute the price of the complete product. The mechanics that characterize the gameplay are interesting and in many ways original, and they immediately won us over. In fact, the top of the screen indicates the number of ~trampolines~ that we can create to allow the pangolin to reach the ~finish line~, and if we have run out of them all, we can even buy more via in-app purchase. More than such a solution, however, the game suggests a ~trial & error~ style approach that can lead us to calibrate the jumps, positions, timing so that the journey from the starting point to the arrival point is dotted with collected objects , in this case coins and diamonds, which determine the degree of completion of each level. Bounce what a bounce We start with a map of the scenario, then the pangolin is released and we have to bounce it in the desired direction, using the force of gravity and the angle of the trampolines to achieve certain results. Depending on the distance of the fingers on the touch screen, the rubber band created will be more or less powerful and therefore will cause a different rebound, but at a certain point external factors will also intervene, such as rubber bands, movable walls that act as obstacles and even traps which, if touched, they trigger game over. All this is assisted by a good quality technical sector, characterized by very particular and pleasant stylistic choices, see for example the dithering effect which gives the colors a ~cartoony~ appearance. The problem is that unfortunately in the transition from normal to ~paid~ levels, the jump we expected did not occur. Let's try to explain ourselves better: a product like Pangolin, based on such simple mechanics, has a fundamental need for variations on the theme and those inserted by the developers seemed rather weak to us, so much so that it is hard to distinguish the first level from the last. There are moving walls, of course, there are traps and some almost Sonic the Hedgehog-style sequences, but the charm of the first moments is quickly replaced by the lack of interest in an experience that can't take off and that really aims too much on the ~trial & error~ in the face of practically zero rewards. What is the difference between completing a stage without collecting any objects or managing, after several attempts, to collect every coin and diamond? None, given that the next test will also be made accessible.", "date": "2013-02-07", "grade": "6.3"}
