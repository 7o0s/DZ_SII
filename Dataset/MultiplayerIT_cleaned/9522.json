{"name": "Tin Can: la recensione del survival spaziale a bordo di una capsula di salvataggio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tin-can-recensione.html", "text": "Space has always been a mystery and, as the nature of human beings, this drives scientists, astronauts and scholars of the cosmos to try to reveal all the secrets it hides. Since the middle of the last century with the landing on the Moon, we have now arrived at the race for Mars, with ambitious projects in search of answers towards another of the most enigmatic planets of the cosmos, or at least of the known ones and of less proximity, reachable with the current resources of space agencies. Its vastness and all the secrets it hides have inspired works of all kinds, becoming both in the literary and cinematographic fields, one of the most renowned and appreciated genres by the public. Of course, video games set in space could not be missing, and there are countless sci-fi works, with high-budget productions such as the eternal development of Star Citizen or the next Xbox exclusive, Starfield. Between these two exponents there is an abyss and in the middle there are many games that have conquered a solid community such as Elite Dangerous, Everspace and really many others. Fortunately, not all of them put us in command of a spacecraft with the aim of exploring and fighting in the vastness of the cosmos. There are many variations on the theme and in today's Tin Can review we will tell you about a survival game that landed on Steam last year and is now also available on consoles. This is the production of Tin Can Studio in which we will literally have to survive inside a can, or rather, an escape pod with a thousand problems. Houston we have a problem The problems in Tin Can will be many and will hinder your hope of survival continuously Tin Can casts us as a cleaner who finds himself having to survive in space after an emergency launch from the space station he was working on, performing tasks while waiting to be rescued and rescued. Before this fateful event we will be able to familiarize ourselves with the game functions thanks to a short tutorial, which, although it explains the mechanics in very broad terms, is rather short and simplified so as not to adequately provide us with all the information necessary to survive in the ~campaign~ missions . This lack of notions left us rather bewildered once we started the Rescue scenarios, the five situations in which we were engaged in resisting inside the escape pod. Although there are five of them, the scenario is identical for all missions and the purpose is the same: to survive. What differentiates them is the duration, starting from 6 minutes up to 30, and the problems and damages that the spacecraft will suffer in this period of time. As mentioned, the tutorial only gives us basic knowledge about oxygen, carbon dioxide and how to keep the systems online thanks to the use of batteries if the primary electrical source fails, and small spoiler, it will always happen. In addition there is also rather superfluous information on how to manage damage from the main computer, a very valuable aid except that it is never present during survival scenarios. Try again you will be luckier Since there is no comprehensive tutorial in Tin Can, in some scenarios you will have to do nothing but guess This lack of information turns Tin Can into a trial and error rather than a not too rigid space survival simulator. If you are not a fan of the theme or do not have even a mild knowledge of the systems on board a spacecraft, the 6 or 30-minute mission will take place in an attempt to understand what is causing the alarm to sound wildly. In our aid there is a manual of about 30 pages with a list of errors of the various components that will appear on the monitors, and some of the possible causes that generate them. Our task will therefore be to repair damaged electrical components or create new ones, replace the oxygen and carbon dioxide cylinders and plug any holes in the capsule caused by external debris. Said like this it could also be quite simple but the problems we had to face inside our tin can were incessant and not so easy and immediate resolution. The further we go on with the scenarios, the greater and more contemporary the problems will be, especially the failures of the electrical systems that have left us in the dark without oxygen and internal temperature control together with the gravity calibration failures. The sense of challenge in Tin Can is not lacking, but completing the most complex scenarios without adequate training can lead to a slight but decided frustration in having to repeat everything from the beginning in search of the right combination ofsystems to survive. It is the aim of the game, of course, but since it is not a question of missions generated in a procedural way, by dint of making mistakes and dying alone in space, the solution is slowly found and we will be able to breathe a sigh of relief as the countdown runs out. Survival Challenge Tin Can will put your patience to the test in some circumstances: imagine being alone, without skills, in the dark and without oxygen.... Once the missions have been exhausted, Tin Can offers a sort of asynchronous multiplayer, where you can compete online with other players thanks to the Challenges and the Ranking, a ranking of the best times recorded in each situation. Unlike the Rescue campaign which has a fixed duration, in these scenarios you have the opportunity to get involved and prove that even an ordinary cleaner can become a first-rate space engineer by following only the instructions in the manual. Added to this is a Sandbox mode where you can experiment and have fun in complete freedom, a noteworthy and certainly pleasant addition. The offer of the Tin Can Studios work is rather limited and if only the campaign missions did not have the same events, the duration of the game would become much longer, keeping us glued to the screen for many more hours. The time to complete the Rescue activities is therefore variable; it's all in our hands and in our cunning and speed, but even the less practical in replacing batteries will be able to conclude the experience in about 4-5 hours, multiplayer excluded of course. All in all, trying to survive in the depths of space was fun, except for some situations like weightlessness or electrical storms, events that tested our patience. Having said that, the game is solid on the technical side also in its porting to consoles, where our test on Xbox Series X turned out to be fluid and without a hitch, thanks also to a rather simplified general graphics and a rather balanced number of objects on the screen .", "date": "2023-05-14", "grade": "6.5"}
