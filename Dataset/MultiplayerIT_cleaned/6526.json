In order to confess, one lies. What one is cannot be expressed, precisely because one is.~ In the last episode we left Barry with a disturbing dilemma related to Moira's fate: will something terrible have happened to her or will she be fine, intent on cursing every two steps somewhere else in the world? The answer to this question, let's face it right away, doesn't come in this episode, but some clues about the truthfulness or otherwise of the ~feeling~ that little Natalia had did. In reality the story continues in a fairly linear way, between Kafkaesque quotations and some discoveries, but without real narrative peaks or particularly shocking twists. Of course, there is curiosity that drives us to go on to find out what happened on the island, who is Claire and Moira's jailer, to understand if whoever spies on all the protagonists is always the same person, and so on, but it seems missing that something more able to involve the player more. Yet there would be plenty of ideas, given that the premises of the whole story remain intriguing, since the whole adventure is set on a mysterious island from which no more human voices come except the desperate cries of some Earth survivors. Save. The second installment of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 sees the protagonists looking for a way to escape Fathers and daughters The story continues moving on two different time frames for the two pairs of protagonists, albeit in the same settings. The first part of Meditation sees Claire and Moira finally out of the penitentiary, decided to reach the mysterious jailer who seems to be in a tower that rises at a certain distance, immediately after a fishing village and a sort of citadel complete with bars and employee apartments. This act, in which the two girls will meet other survivors of Terra Save and will have to deal with mutant four legs and a new type of Afflicted, explosive and capable of throwing blinding toxic substances from the pustules of its body, is the longer of the two that make up the episode. And in some ways it is also the most varied in terms of mechanics: in fact, in the village it will be necessary initially to explore the various houses in search of useful material to put a vehicle back on track, while at the same time paying attention to its now changed former inhabitants. For a while it will prove useful to act with circumspection to avoid open confrontation, but at a certain point it will be possible to relive, in a lesser tone, a more action-packed situation very similar to one already seen in Resident Evil 4. In reality, as well as from the fourth chapter of the regular series, the ~quotations~ (or copycats) in this episode are wasted: the general atmosphere, for example, always remains on excellent levels from a visual point of view due to the settings, and sound, but in some moments you have a feeling of dj vu. In fact, the village brings to mind a bit of an area from The Evil Within (which in turn took up a location from Forbidden Siren), while the building that can be explored further on with lots of apartments and an attached hospital, even Silent Hill. The second portion of the game, shorter than the previous one, sees Barry and Natalia continue to follow the trail of Claire and Moira. Even former S.T.A.R.S. will meet two new types of enemies, in addition to the mutant ~dogs~: a creature that hurls fragments of itself similar to large parasites, and a sort of invisible insect that can only be perceived by the sound emitted by its wings or by a sort of ~ visual deformation~ of the surrounding area. However, only from Natalia can it really be seen and eliminated, identifying it and thus indicating the exact point where to shoot. The girl is very precise, and spares no effort in signaling as much detail as possible to the player where to aim to try to hit the target. Which is not particularly difficult if you find yourself meeting these creatures in narrow environments such as a corridor. Otherwise it can be more difficult to eliminate them before they attack the characters. Towards the tower However, nothing comparable to the two bosses at the end of the area who, at least at the level of difficulty we played, gave us a lot of trouble. Especially the second one, the one encountered by Barry, who also recalls a famous enemy from Resident Evil 4, also thanks to the narrow spaces within which he must be fought, proved to be particularly difficult. Be that as it may, this time we liked the part with Mr. Burton less than the one with Claire, even if in the final moments, when faced with some disturbing and ~Silenthillian~ images, and a mysterious character, we almost laughed.valued. In all cases, if the plot portion of both acts has not completely convinced us, the story is different for the general gameplay. In this episode we appreciated the fact that in some ways the different approach that each couple and each character must adopt to get to grips with certain situations is a little more amplified. Furthermore, compared to the first episode, the supporting characters remained more involved in the action, and when they were managed by the CPU they finally appeared more active and useful, not only for carrying objects, but also for adequately supporting their companions when needed. If certain skills have been unlocked at the end of the previous chapter, it becomes even easier to obtain these results. As written in the previous review, at the end of each ~level~ you can spend the skill points acquired in the game to unlock new features for the team or for individual characters, or to level them up, for example getting more damage if you shoot crouch, or more effective support from friends when you're injured and need healing, or are surrounded and need a diversion. More emphasis is also placed on the usefulness of extra items, such as secondary weapons and healing items: the combination of collected elements, especially empty bottles with alcohol or gunpowder to create Molotov cocktails, smoke bottles or disinfected gauze and therefore more powerful or useful for curing altered states and blindness as well, it proves to be a decisive option in the long run in order to progress in the adventure. We close our review with a small side note relating to graphics and audio: in the first case we confirm that we have still encountered some frame rate problems and that we have come across decidedly flat textures, especially those that cover some scenarios, with some ~phenomenon~ of invisible walls and interpenetration with floors or objects. We hope that Capcom will resolve this as soon as possible. In the case of audio, on the other hand, the goodness of the soundtrack and in general of the entire sector is reconfirmed, where, if anything, it is only Moira's voice that is out of tune. But not because this is bad or not suitable for the character, who is a bit obnoxious by the way. The dialogues themselves are simply not convincing, where the swear words, used by the girl practically to open and conclude each sentence of semi-complete sense, are also added by speeches sometimes of a unique flatness that add nothing to the narrative context of the game.", "date": "2015-03-03", "grade": "7.0"}
