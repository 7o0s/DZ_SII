The plot tells of four girls equipped with unique weapons and powers with which they fight monsters, called Grimm, who populate the world of Remnant. The heroines are named Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, BlakeBelladonna and Yang Xiao Long, known as Team RWBY. They all attend the Beacon Academy in the city of Vale, where monster hunters are trained and where many of their adventures take place. It is not useless to report the history of the series before talking about RWBY: Grimm Eclipse, because the game doesn't bother to introduce us to its world, either in the form of animated sequences or textually. While playing, some characters actually contact us via a smartphone to provide us with information on what we are doing, but the narrative holes still remain enormous. Strange so little care for storytelling in an animated series tie-in; evidently the development team thought it for the fans, i.e. for those who do not need explanations. In more strictly video game terms, RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is a cooperative action game in which two to four players can work together to foil the Grimm menace. If desired, it can also be played in single player, a mode perfected only with the release of version 1.0 (the title has spent several months in Early Access), but to make the most of it, it is better to enter a server populated by other human beings. Only in this way is it possible to mitigate the extreme repetitiveness of the gameplay, which manifests itself from the first levels. But let's go in order and let's not draw hasty conclusions, otherwise the mid-seasons will regain strength. RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is out of Early Access, let's find out if it turned out well Seen one, seen all As we said, RWBY: Grimm Eclipse literally throws us into the action, without giving us a shred of information about what we have to do and why we have to do it. Also missing any tutorial. It really wouldn't help much, since the game mechanics are very simple, but at least they could create a room with puppets to freely beat up to try out the RWBY team. Let's recap: starting a game you select the desired character and you are immediately in one of the maps. However, getting familiar with the controls is not difficult, since the control scheme copies the most famous action titles without too many problems. There is a fast attack button, a power attack button, a dodge button, a jump button, and so on. Each of the girls is also equipped with a firearm and special skill-related attacks. The first map is set in a forest full of vegetation and ancient ruins. We begin to wander and find chests. We break them and collect a sphere that gives us some experience points. We go further and stumble upon the first fight. Enemies are weak and go down quickly: a couple of well-placed combined hits are enough. Further on, facing a second kind of enemy (werewolves), we discover the possibility of stunning opponents by pressing a key when an indicator appears on their head; and to have a super attack that is performed by pressing two keys together. But let's continue our walk. With the first creatures out of the way, we explored the combat area where we found a poorly hidden ancient artifact, which gave us a lot of experience points, then we continued our journey to the next group of monsters. In truth we can stop here in describing the game, because in fact it has little else to offer in terms of variety: throughout its development it is a continuous repetition of what we have told you, only with increasingly difficult monsters and different level decorations. Does it seem repetitive to you? It is beyond a reasonable doubt. Little substance The conformation of the levels, very linear and without big secrets, also takes care of increasing the feeling of always having to do the same things. Of course, there are artifacts to collect, but the extra effort involved is very minimal and often they are so poorly hidden that it takes very little to find them. The only variants that deserve to be mentioned are the control centers, which must be defended from waves of enemies of increasing strength and which become challenging when played in cooperative mode, and the bosses, which are really bland, including the final one, which is really disappointing and very stupid (ATTENTION ANTICIPATION: it has short-range attacks that it uses even when we are many meters awayanza. Beating him is just a matter of knowing how to wait when you find yourself staying out of his reach. END ADVANCE). In all of this RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is only seemingly difficult. In the beginning you die often, especially if you play on a server with three other players. However, it takes very little to understand how to attack and defend yourself from all kinds of enemies. Basically the best tactic is to hit and run. Especially when the Aura (another way to call the energy bar) is very low, it is advisable to run away to recharge, and then return to the charge. However, as we have already mentioned, by accumulating experience you level up and you can unlock new skills that greatly simplify your life... For the short time you want to play, at least. In total RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is made up of only a handful of levels, lasting about twenty minutes each, which run out within three hours. Luckily the advanced maps are better than the first ones (at least this satisfaction). The developers promised extra modes for the final version, but apparently to get something, like the ~Rush~ mode, you have to wait for a future update, while the new playable characters will arrive, but will be sold separately as DLC. All this to say that the current offer is really poor in content, to the point that after having finished and refined it, the only reason for continuing to play is rank growth, as well as perhaps having some online friends to spend an evening with calm.", "date": "2016-07-11", "grade": "5.0"}
