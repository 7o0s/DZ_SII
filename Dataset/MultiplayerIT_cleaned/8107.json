While you refresh your memory by taking a look at our review, let's take stock of Mountain Sheep's debut title on the iOS platform. It was a twin analog shooter characterized by an excellent control system and solid gameplay, but rather weak on the structural front. In the guise of the wily survivor John Gore, in fact, we moved within a single completely ~flat~ scenario, that is, devoid of any interactable obstacle, while hordes of hairy monsters appeared out of nowhere to kill us. With only three different weapons available to defend ourselves, our goal in the game was simply to last as long as possible; and it was precisely this lack of a sense of progression that annoyed us, beyond the indisputable stylistic value of the ~toy~ graphics, full of really well-crafted characters. After a large number of basically accessory updates (the game arrived a few months ago at version 7.0), the developers have finally released a sequel, Minigore 2: Zombies, proving that they have learned from their mistakes and smoothed out the rough edges of what was in fact a rough stone, now capable of shining like a precious diamond in the vein of twin analog shooters for iPhone and iPad. The protagonist is still him, John Gore, but this time he is accompanied by a plethora of unlockable characters with different basic equipment: his father Jerry Gore, his daughter Jenny Gore and a lot of special guests, from Zombieville Guy to Hook Champ , from Enviro-Bear to Evan Hsu, passing through Christmas skins, ninjas, bunnies and more. Lots of stuff When we faced Minigore 2: Zombies, the first word that came to mind was ~revolution~. Although in fact the core of the gameplay is the same as in the first episode, equally solid if not more, a castle of possibilities and variants has been built around it which all appear in the ~virtual shop~ screen that can be visited between one game and another , and which can be unlocked using the coins that the game gives out quite generously when we kill the undead and their fellow monsters. From the three weapons of the original Minigore, this sequel has increased to ten (light machine gun, shotgun, grenade launcher, assault rifle, explosive sheep launcher and their ~double~ versions), accompanied by momentary upgrades (a heart more in the health bar, now finally represented on the screen, shoes to increase the character's speed, extra ammo and more), seven increasingly challenging scenarios (each with a different final boss) and the list of characters we have mentioned a while ago. In short, from a simple ~test of skill~ the Mountain Sheep product has become a shooter of great substance, expressing its full potential to the fullest and giving us a terribly engaging, playable, fun and challenging experience. Substantial progress has also been made on the technical front: the engine created by the Finnish team now moves up to one hundred and fifty enemies on the screen at the same time, with procedural animations that give life to different reactions for each hit scored and very colorful, stylish and well-characterized scenarios , which unlike the past now have some ~obstacles~ that we can exploit in the defensive phase to shelter from hostile fire. Finally, the sound sector is extremely full-bodied and atmospheric, thanks to a mix of convincing effects and excellent music.", "date": "2012-12-19", "grade": "9.0"}
