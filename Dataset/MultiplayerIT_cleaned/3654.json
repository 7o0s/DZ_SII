Do you want to test the shock absorber of the new gaming chair with exaggerated fear jumps? Have you stocked up on toilet paper? Whatever category you belong to, you have opened the wrong page: Layers of Fear 2, the sequel to an indie released at the end of 2016 which, thanks also to the complicity of a generous Humble Bundle giveaway, has entered the circuit of art house players , it's not at all the kind of game you expect, although the title may be misleading. The layers of fear are those of an artist who, due to a difficult past, risks losing his mind. We are therefore faced with a psychological thriller that focuses on the script, on a scenography reminiscent of dioramas and on the sound effects which, as per tradition, represent the most important pillar of the third game by the Polish Bloober Team. Follow along as we detail what the main elements of this sequel are in our review. Winning idea you don't change (too much) If in the first Layers of Fear the player took on the role of a painter on the verge of madness, in this sequel the point of view is that of a famous actor who embarked on the ocean liner Icarus to shoot a Hollywood blockbuster in the middle of the ocean. The idea of spending several days on a ship does not excite him, but his agent is convinced that the game is worth the candle and persuades him to embark on the journey unaware of the consequences it may have. The adventure begins in a cabin, where you return at the end of each of the five acts that make up the game. A projector, initially empty, will be used to display the frames collected during the chapters, while the walls will be enriched by the posters of the films which are in turn scattered in the most disparate corners. All pieces of a puzzle that allow you to get a clearer idea of the reasons that cause so much heartache of the protagonist. The first few minutes are spent wandering through the corridors and deserted rooms of this relative of the Titanic, collecting some objects, newspaper clippings, notes that tell the parts of a story. Voice-overs will often help to understand what happened; other times there will be mechanical automatons, apparently immobile, to roughly reproduce scenes from the past or emotional states of James. Although it is set exclusively aboard the Icarus (where the progenitor took place inside a villa), Layers of Fear 2 boasts a remarkable variety of locations, all united by the narrow and claustrophobic spaces characteristic of a cruise ship of the first twentieth century. It will soon be discovered that the structure of the boat only acts as a trigger to fathom the innermost depths of the human mind, in a sort of Dantesque descent into hell, where the first levels are the most similar, in terms of architecture and color tones, to the daily reality, to gradually become more and more twisted and monochromatic. The designers took advantage of the historic setting (between the 1930s and 1940s) to draw inspiration from the timeless classics of stars and stripes cinema. Freebies are present at every turn; we found references to 2001: A Space Odyssey; The Wizard of Oz; Journey to the Moon; Alice in Wonderland, but we are sure that movie lovers will be able to find others. Door simulator From the point of view of the actual gameplay Layers of Fear 2 does not bring substantial improvements compared to the predecessor which had earned the unenviable title of door simulator: in practice the main activity remains precisely that of opening the doors. To make the exploration a little more lively, thus also raising the level of suspense, the developers have included some successful technical tricks. A typical example is the following: you reach the door at the end of a corridor; trying to open it one discovers that it is closed, but looking back one realizes that the setting has changed and that there are new ways out to go. The imaginary line that leads to the next level is intuitive and there is practically never the risk of getting lost, but there are some ~secret~ rooms (or better to say not highlighted), which deserve to be found because they contain clues that make the story more intelligible. Fortunately, in this psychological thriller not only the doors open: certain passages require you to flee from a shadow that has been haunting us since the first minutes (these are the sequences where the tension reaches its maximum peaks, without becoming unbearable), or to avoid beams of light which, hitting the player, force himthey repeat the sequence. There are also some easy-to-solve puzzles; after all, one could not expect much more from a title that decides to deprive itself of the inventory (which in the key mapping should be consultable, even if in practice it does not work) and which, by its very nature, develops throughout interior of ridiculously sized rooms. There are even ~sliding doors~ (forgive the pun): detailed situations in which to choose between two paths - the second of which is not always intuitive - thus directing the final outcome. Armored doors Technically the work of the Bloober Team guys is well made. For this sequel, the bar was raised thanks to the use of the Unreal Engine 4, which replaced the Unity of the first title and which allowed the creation of environments even richer in detail, albeit always not very interactive. To be honest, however, we would have expected to see something more from the change of technology. More than the technical quality, the ability of the designers to be appreciated in being able to reproduce very evocative scenarios, capable of projecting effective images even with few elements and in limited environments in three dimensions. It is a trademark of the Polish software house, which we had already had the opportunity to appreciate also in the valid Observer. It goes without saying that the lion's share is played by the soundtrack and above all by the environmental effects: hearing a door close behind you, moving with the anxiety of the noises coming from some adjacent cabin, running like hell with the enemy who is always approaching moreover, they are all situations which, although they cannot be defined as original, work well by preventing the journey inside the Icarus from turning into a carefree Sunday outing. The dubbing, despite being entrusted among others to Tony Todd (one who is at home on Broadway), did not convince us at all, resulting in the final analysis almost out of place. In the press kit, the developers announced a longer duration of the adventure than the first Layers of Fear: a promise not kept, given that it took us just over three hours to complete our first game. Once finished, the plus mode is unlocked, to be tried also to be able to visualize an alternative ending, but we remain on rather low levels of longevity, also in relation to the proposed price.", "date": "2019-05-24", "grade": "6.6"}
