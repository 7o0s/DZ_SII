In Winter Assault there are two different campaigns: on the good side we will be able to control the new faction of the Imperial Guard (a rather human and ~normal~ army without particular special abilities) and the splendid Eldar, an incredibly ancient race endowed with unparalleled psychic powers who once ruled a vast empire, and who in Warhammer we could only control in skirmishes. With the villains instead, we will finally be able to experience a story mode with the wild orcs and the cruel space marines of chaos, also already present in the base of the game but usable only in multiplayer. It should be noted that, in addition to the unprecedented imperial guard, the already known factions have also been enriched with new means and units, thus greatly enriching the organic and mechanical arsenal at our disposal. As in Warhammer, in both campaigns we will be involved in an intricate plot full of twists, intrigues and deceptions where it will be increasingly difficult to understand who the allies and the traitors are. Alternatively we will have to lead the factions just listed and the experience is further enriched by the possibility, in the final missions, of choosing the group to control, thus leading to a different conclusion of the two story modes. There are not many missions to face, 10 missions in all, but in addition to the already mentioned possibility of choosing the faction in the final part, those who have already played Dawn of War know well that the missions have a rather high duration, so much so that to complete it it will take you around 12-15 hours, with a strong ability of the game to attract your attention until you find the right way to complete the set objectives. Winter Assault confirms the most typical characteristics of its predecessor or frenzy of action combined with a fundamental tactical component For the rest, Winter Assault confirms the most typical characteristics of its predecessor or frenzy of action combined with a fundamental tactical component to bring home the three points with the confirmation of the importance of the places called ~strategic points~ that we will have to conquer and keep (also through the construction of fortifications) to have more credits to use in new troops and vehicles. Another relevant element is that each team can be strengthened by new elements but also by more powerful firearms. The updating of the troops, even if quantitatively limited (and different depending on the units), therefore makes the action much more continuous and rapid since only if we do not withdraw in time will we have to send brand new units from our headquarters to the points nerves instead of replenishing the troops already in place. The differentiation of the races present is also highly confirmed: the peculiarities of struggle and logistics are really very different and therefore leading the orcs instead of the Elders for example will also mean resetting tactics and strategies with respect to the specific characteristics of our cannon fodder. Also unchanged is the multiplayer (online or via LAN) which from two to eight players, in teams or in all against all without mercy for anyone, will allow us to collide on a good number of maps designed ad hoc depending on the number of players at stake . Timeless wartime beauty Like any expansion, not even the graphics engine has undergone any revolution confirming the visual qualities of Dawn of War. Clearly with a year more, the engine is less competitive than other new releases such as the excellent Act of War but all in all it hasn't aged too quickly since the production of THQ is capable of handling many units on screen without excessive frame rate problems even on computers of not the latest generation. Moreover, the almost maniacal care with which all the game units have been created with an accurate and ~massive~ set of animations (especially in hand-to-hand combat) between the various units still leaves a good sense of amazement. If that weren't enough, some choices such as the pods of new units and structures that arrive at an impressive speed on the ground (or crash in an uncoordinated way if you take the orcs) or the possibility to customize all the colors of your units, are those little touches of class that only the great titles can boast. the graphics engine has not aged too quickly confirming the visual qualities of Dawn of WarThe ~military-war-fantasy~ aesthetic is further elevated thanks to a sound sector which, in addition to a work of interpretation of the dialogues (in English but with Italian subtitles) carried out with professionalism and conviction, can boast epic compositions. first class warfare. My completely peaceful-pacifist soul will regret it but making war in Winter Assault with these so immersive sensory suggestions turns out to be really exciting and frees the most primordial instincts that we all carry inside us like it or not better to vent them here than in real life , don't you think? Without distorting an absolute masterpiece in the field of RTS, Winter Assault gives Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War lovers the opportunity to return to play with Games Workshop's digital toy soldiers, obviating the only flaw of its predecessor: a decidedly too much single-player campaign mode short and that put us in charge of only one of the warring factions (the Space Marines). Once you have completed the 10 missions of the game, you will be left with a videogame void as Winter Assault has the strong ability to attract your attention until you find the right way to complete the set objectives. We can only warmly recommend the purchase of the game and if you missed the first Warhammer you should find the base and add-ons bundled at a very affordable price. To err is human but to persevere would be truly diabolical Pros Excellent expansion Ability to use all factions in single mode Excellent durability Cons The imperial guard has little appeal No major changes Once you're done, you'll miss it... More toy soldiers... In the chaos of real-time strategy, a genre that knows no stops in terms of number of releases, one of the few titles that in recent years has managed to emerge close to the most renowned series, was undoubtedly the videogame transposition of Warhammer. The conversion work by Relic Software has taken a very important brand and an imaginative universe of incredible impact such as that of Games Workshop, transforming it into an RTS of excellent quality, a perfect alchemy of action and tactics, with a ~military-fantasy~ aesthetic  with a devastating impact characterized by attention to every detail as well as an absolutely exciting differentiation of the various breeds. Therefore, if expansions also come out for second-order strategic ones, an add-on for an excellent product like Warhammer could not be missing and here we are going to present this Winter Assault to you.", "date": "2006-01-20", "grade": null}
