And not only. In fact, it appears evident that the project intends to ride the enormous media appeal of the imminent arrival at the cinema of The Force Awakens, trying to position itself in the widest and most popular basin possible. This can be seen from the great production values deployed for the splendid commercials created for the occasion, for example, but also and above all from the structural and design choices that Electronic Arts has decided to give to the game, which seems designed to intercept the tastes of the little man on the street who grew up on bread and Star Wars. The user who maybe doesn't follow video games much anymore and could decide, out of the blue, to go home from the supermarket with a nice console and a copy of the game. Compared to the typical DICE productions and to what a certain slice of users could expect, Battlefront in fact has an indisputably ~casual~ shot, a soul that is profoundly different from Battlefield of which, unfortunately or fortunately (depending on the point of view), one does not a reskinning is not revealed at all, although it is still related to it and for genetic reasons, and for various somatic traits. But if you want to know more about the strictly playful and content features of the game, we refer you to the review of the PlayStation 4 version, published a few days ago. The focus of this article is all on the quality of the creation of the Personal Computer edition. Our in-depth review of the PC version of Star Wars: Battlefront Space graphics Since its debut in Battlefield: Bad Company (or Bad Company 2, to stay on PC), the Frostbite Engine, EA DICE's proprietary technology, has stood out as a particularly cutting-edge graphics engine: the combination of a of accurate lighting, the ability to manage large spaces, a high number of players and other entities and above all a large rate of destruction, both massive and capillary, have made it a development platform capable of immediately catalyzing the attention on of itself, also always remaining on the piece, thanks to progressive updates. All very nice, on paper. Anyone who has assiduously or even not too casually attended the battlefields to which he gave life, has reluctantly become acquainted with terms such as ~hitbox~, ~hit detection~ and ~trade kill~ (if you have never had the please look for them on Youtube, where the sources to get a quick culture on the subject are overflowing). In practice, more often than not the Frostbite has therefore proved to be problematic, coming to make it clear, in its darkest periods, that it was really broken at the foundations. All the more so when netcode has a hand in it (especially on servers with savings tick rates) or an extensive and almost certainly hasty multi-format development to hit the launch window of the current generation consoles, which has decreed among another a disaster not only on the stability of the gameplay but also in raw functional terms (read: performance and stability). All this preamble is necessary to put in the right perspective both the expectations and fears that users could have towards DICE's new work, as well as the choices made by the latter, in our opinion more than wise. If reducing the maximum number of players from 64 to 40, giving up destructiveness (to tell the truth still present, albeit in a narrow way), designing more collected maps, reducing the room for maneuver of vehicles and aircraft (sometimes to the limits of quick time event, all right) served to avoid as many ~reasons of stress~ for the game engine, preventing the occurrence of its chilling malfunctions, or even healing them, each of these ~waivers~ is welcome. The quotation marks become a must when it is finally realized that this is not and does not want to be Battlefield, but a proposal with a different approach and vis. Furthermore, in Stockholm we did not work solely by subtraction, but a lot, a lot was also added, making Frostbite take a truly remarkable leap forward. The use of PBR (Physics Based Rendering, the calculation of the properties of materials on physical attributes) and of Photogrammetry (the technique already seen at work in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter), in particular, shows everything: the leap in of yield and perceived detail compared to a Battlefield 4 it is almost generational. The credit certainly also goes to an improved (but still not without flaws) management of the LOD and to a more harmonious technical-artistic management, capable of capitalizing better on the feature available to fold them chorally in the service of a more uniform, cohesive and powerful overall impact. Of course, there is no shortage of unconvincing aspects or scenarios or conditions that are not on the same photorealistic peaks and one gets the impression that everything stops a little on the surface, thanks to the fact that most of the maps are structurally and architecturally less complex, but the result in any case proves to be one of the greatest shows currently around. And, thanks to the skill with which each element of the film license has been recreated, already abundantly highlighted in the console review, the feeling of finding yourself playing ~in Star Wars~ is truly overwhelming. All this goes to cloak a game substance that is finally standing and offers a pleasant feeling of ~certainty~ of the clashes: there is no shortage of ambiguous situations, which leave some bitter and well-known aftertaste, and probably the particular nature of the weapons gives a nice hand to mask things, but the precision and consistency of the dynamics of engagement appear overall satisfactory. How much does your speeder bike push? In terms of graphic options, nothing has changed substantially compared to the Beta a few weeks ago: we find ourselves with a congruous number of settings, mostly traced from Battlefield. Exceptions are those dedicated to anti-aliasing, which lose the deferred anti-aliasing (MSAA, in practice), probably incompatible with the new rendering solutions, and gain four distinct settings dedicated to post-processing solutions : FXAA Low, Medium, High and TXAA. Indispensable corollaries return, such as the ability to adjust the Field of View and the very welcome plus of being able to choose an internal rendering resolution that fluctuates between 25% and 200% of that of the display, applying upsampling and downsampling in a simple and immediate way. Satisfactory performance across the board, it being understood that we can express ourselves, of course, only on the experience of the configuration listed in the appropriate box. The Beta had already provided us with a promising signal, but the hypothesis that a new Battlefield 4 case could occur (which had an overall acceptable Beta, apart from the ~Windows 8 affair~, only to reveal what it turned out to be , once launched...) or that the full game presented situations of a much different load or less optimized could only rightly hover in the air, until dutiful proof to the contrary: Star Wars: Battlefront runs fine and without a hitch. To speak to the (indicative) precision of the numbers, at a resolution of 1080p, with all Ultra, FXAA High (our solution of choice, since it covers the scales less but does not give the image a ~creamy~ feeling like the more expensive TXAA), a Motion Blur Intensity at 50% and a Field of View set to 80 we average between 70 and 100 frames per second in ground combat and over 100 in flight. Things remain satisfactory and fully playable even pushing us to 2560x1440 via Nvidia's DSR function or, alternatively, setting the Resolution Scale to 140% always keeping us above 60 frames per second, except in the forest areas of Endor and its moon, where the frames also drop around 50-55, but in a gentle way. To give a term of comparison, going back to Battlefield 4 (updated to the Fall Update, released last October 27th), in broadly comparable situations we have slightly higher performance but also stuttering and micro-stuttering problems and, more generally, a type of performance capable of making the variations in fluidity ~feel more~. DICE has therefore done a really great job on the optimization front, also in terms of stability: the game client has never crashed and always responds quite well when it is ~alt-tabbed~ or reduced to the window, signaling itself among the 'other for peak usage we've seen it settle around 5.7GB of memory overall. To the detriment of what was feared by the recommended official requirements, therefore, in our experience 8 GB of system RAM allow you to enjoy Battlefront really great. In short, what, if you like, could have been an interesting historical recurrence did not occur, when exactly ten years ago Battlefield 2 proved to be the first title to force the switch to 2 GB of system RAM to run really smoothly at maximum details . Battlelog is dead, long live Battlelog? On the other hand, the work done on other aspects was not as exciting. First of all, we don't like the drastic reduction of the options regarding the controls, especially those for the mouse. Agree that you are not in front of youof a particularly demanding shooter in terms of skill, to the point that the developers themselves remember among the in-game advice that the precision of the weapon does not change according to the aiming mode, but at least leaving the possibility of adjusting their sensitivity independently would be it was an act of welcome courtesy. The same goes for the lack of in-game voice chat, which can be replaced with the one integrated into Origin, which necessarily implies that the teammate is on the friends list. But the real price lies elsewhere. As has been known for a few months, for the occasion DICE has given up on the by now traditional Battlelog, the browser-integrated platform with which various aspects of the game had to be managed externally, including access to matches: now everything goes through a new system, directly in the game. If you are one of the detractors of the infrastructure introduced by Battlefield 3, however, you would do well to wait to uncork the bubbly, because the new reality is far more restrictive. In fact, the search for matches relies on a matchmaking algorithm that manages almost everything automatically, only allowing you to choose the mode and possibly the map. It might even seem like enough for a casual user of online gaming, which is probably the target towards which special attention has been paid when making certain decisions, but those who are a bit savvy will immediately realize how much they lose in flexibility and comfort . Not only that: it also goes hand in hand with the exclusion of servers that can be rented by the user and the relative administrative powers, the possible affirmation of custom rules and, finally, also the possibility of playing in LAN. All aspects that naturally determine the acceptance and stabilization of an online title, the development and cohesion of its community and any competitive outlets. Last on the scoreboard, which does not indicate ping or offer any other clues about the connection status of the game. A lack that has also had excellent precedents in the triple A field (Call of Duty: Ghosts and Destiny at launch), but which for this reason never ceases to appear paradoxical to say the least, especially for a title almost exclusively focused on multiplayer. Just as paradoxical is the fact that whatever mode in which you are playing among the crowd of those prepared by DICE, only killings and deaths are reported in the table, tending to favor the development of a ~culture~ more interested in the kill ratio than to the goal. May the last landed in the magical world of online gaming, becoming passionate about it, one day become a conscientious player instead of yet another selfish lamer.", "date": "2015-11-19", "grade": "8.5"}
