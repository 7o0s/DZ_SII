Let's start with the sore points. Table Tennis at first looks like a real Rockstar approach to the next generation; a hint of the potential that the polygonal engine, called RAGE, will be able to develop in the next titles. There are no frills or frills, no career mode or the possibility of creating your own virtual alter ego to grow around a virtual world up to the top of a hypothetical world ranking, much less going through training or under arcade games a la Virtua Tennis. There are four difficulty levels, each of which corresponds to tournaments to be played offline and thanks to which you can unlock 11 players and a series of extras, i.e. four shirts and two arenas for each of them. Once you have passed these tournaments, which will still keep you busy for some time, given their increasing difficulty, and after passing the essential but absolutely functional tutorial to the game, all you have to do is try your hand at online or multiplayer games with friends . after the tutorial you find yourself entangled in a strange gear, made up of immediacy and depth Where is my player? However, these are only the first steps, because after the tutorial you find yourself entangled in a strange gear, made up of immediacy and depth, which you can play right away, but in which you feel you can improve with each game played , solo or against friends. Each button on the joypad, or each of the four directions of the right analog stick, corresponds to four types of shots, each with different effectiveness. Before hitting the ball, and after choosing the type of effect to impress, you have to choose which way to direct the shot with the left analog stick. The coup of class is that there is no direction indicator, the pad simply starts to vibrate when you push yourself to the extreme edges of the table, with the risk of sending the ball out. The skill lies in being able to load each shot with the right intensity and go to the limits of the field, without going over. In addition to the basic shots, there are soft shots, to force the opponent to frantic recoveries under the net, and concentrated shots, real sabers accompanied by camera slowdowns and close-ups (only in single or local multiplayer), which they underline its intensity and power. The latter can only be carried out when the player has accumulated sufficient concentration, which is obtained by loading the single shots for a long time. When both opponents activate concentrated shots, the field is shrouded in shadow, the music becomes claustrophobic and real sequences of breathtaking, hyper-fast exchanges begin, up to the inevitable mistake of one of the two contenders. Multiplayer, online and offline The real protagonist of Table Tennis is multiplayer, both offline and online thanks to Xbox Live. In truth there are not many modes (for game design choices the double has also been eliminated), except for tournaments for four players on the net and timed matches (unavoidable when players are equal and the matches risk going on for too long) , but against human opponents the Rockstar-crafted playability really shines. Should you like it, you will find yourself playing it with friends for a very long time. Visual adrenaline One of the objectives, certainly, best achieved by Rockstar in the development of Table Tennis, is the video rendering of the emotions of the protagonist players. True, there are not many (11 as mentioned), but they are all perfectly recognizable and are made with true next-gen attention to detail. The lips contract following a wrong shot, the hands mold perfectly around the grips of the rackets and the shirts flutter showing abdomens and sweat until they remain soaked and weighed down. The lips contract after a bad shot, the hands mold perfectly around the grips of the rackets Visual adrenaline The animations are beautiful, with almost always perfect care in collisions, especially those between the rackets and a ball with very realistic physics, which bounces credibly even on the bodies of the players during the fastest rallies. Of course, the arenas, although well made, do not make you cry out for a miracle, but it is clear that Rockstar had a precise project in mind, or rather to be able to make people understand what the Xbox 360 hardware can be used for in a new generation sports game. that is, making certain visual sensations previously impossible without falling into trivial spectacularizations. The same care placed in the graphics can be found in the creation of the audio sector, where extremely realistic sound effects do the right thingcounter altar to rhythmic and essential music. Perfect for creating moments of real suspense. Goals In Table Tennis there are one thousand points distributed over 29 goals. It goes without saying, therefore, that each goal achieved is very generous in points towards the player, who can be recognized up to 60 for some goals. All this good things do not mislead you, however, it will take time to unlock them all and grab the loot. Comment Multiplayer, the real one, the one that has made other houses great in other years, Nintendo and Sega first of all, arrives in the next gen with a game that really no one expected: a Ping Pong from the softco made famous by the gangsters of Grand Theft Auto . Works? Great. Simple, immediate, profound and with a disarming pandering, especially if you have a group of friends with whom you can spend hours in front of the TV, or an Xbox Live subscription. Unfortunately, perfection does not live here, since some fundamental components are missing to make a sports game of this generation complete, first of all a single player career mode or the possibility of creating custom players. However, considering the price ( 39.90), the quality of the work done by Rockstar and the fun that Table Tennis is able to give, it would be foolish not to recommend its purchase. It causes addiction you have been warned. Pros: Immediate and irresistible playability Excellent technical realization Infinite with friends Cons: The single player is too short Career mode is missing Double is missing Sometimes, I like easy bets, those that are impossible not to win. One of these would certainly have been to challenge a gamer, even an expert, to try to guess the first next generation game from Rockstar, the software house responsible for the Grand Theft Auto cyclone. I'm sure gangsters, robberies and cataclysms would come up, but never a game of table tennis, Ping Pong. Is it possible that a company of this level could launch the assault on Xbox 360 with such an unusual title? Is it possible that a ping pong game can stand out among titles such as Oblivion or the same sports series published by 2k? Absolutely yes and the result is pleasantly surprising for the freshness it leaves on the joypad and for the immediacy with which it manages to capture those who play. You need friends or an Xbox Live subscription to fully enjoy it, but in the end there is something to be satisfied, however.", "date": "2006-05-24", "grade": null}
