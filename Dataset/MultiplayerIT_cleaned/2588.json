{"name": "F1 Championship Season 2000", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-championship-season-2000_a.html", "text": "Let's all go back to driving school You read right! F1 CS 2000 has an interesting driving school system that allows us to learn some driving techniques that will come in handy in the race. I must admit that this was a pleasant change and I can assure you that even the difficult Suzuka circuit, after the explanations given to us by our instructor, will be easy and immediate. I hope that the work introduced with this title will be followed by all other manufacturers of driving simulators. The car we will use is also very striking, as it has two seats. Really interesting. To top it all off there is a scoring system based on the performance achieved on the pitch. Very good. Another novelty consists in the condi-metos which this time also include rain. The result is good and comparable to what we saw on Grand Prix 3. It must be said that the physics of the car changes radically in the wet, becoming incredibly difficult to control. In these situations we will need all our experience. I remember that even in F1 CS 2000 we will find a whole series of selectable aids that will allow us to precisely adjust the degree of difficulty. Do you want to retrace exactly the entire fantastic 2000 season? Then the F1 CS 2000 is the product for you. The reconstruction is very thorough and arrives on time even in the smallest of details. It goes without saying that Monza was proposed with a modified 1st chicane and Schumy's new helmet is also present! Even the starting grids and the weather conditions, if you like, reproduce the real events of the season that has just ended. A tweak here and one there EA technicians have improved almost everything, and the experience is much more convincing than before, reaching levels previously only glimpsed. The graphics are faster and the sound department has been improved and new music has been inserted, the AI has been radically changed, which previously was noted only for its macroscopic defects. The driving model has also undergone significant improvements. Driving a CS 2000 F1 car is a remarkable experience. The management of the cameras has reached a truly remarkable level, with the possibility of creating personalized shots, the replay, however, remains a bit limited. Also worth a mention is the network mode which has also been improved. Oh I almost forgot: the blue flag has also been introduced. Let's sum up All that glitters is not gold! So far good, but it must be highlighted how many of the defects of the old title are still present in a massive way. It seems incredible to take care in inserting the modified Monza chicane, but leave the rest of the circuit with macroscopic errors. To name one, the parabolic dish is always formed by two curves!! And the thing is repeated for almost all the circuits, including Monaco, which do not reflect the real tracks of the world circus. Then the graphics disfigure with the most recent products. Do you know Monza from SBK2000? Well it has nothing to do with that of F1 CS 2000. This is due to the graphic engine of F1 CS 2000 which was not created from scratch, but imported from an old EA game called SCGT and which bears all the weight of the years . In fact, the comparison with more recent titles is decidedly penalizing for the EA title, just look at the screenshots of Nascar 4, Nascar Heat or all the other more recent productions. EA strikes again! Everyone knows how the historic Formula 1 championship of the year 2000 ended. Ferrari is back as champion and EA wanted to celebrate its successes with this new(?) title which comes out a short distance after its predecessor. Before continuing, it seems right to me to re-read what I wrote previously about F1 2000. Done? Then keep in mind what you just read, because F1 CS 2000 is practically the same as its predecessor except for the following additions and changes.", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
