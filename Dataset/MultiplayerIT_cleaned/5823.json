Even if by now it doesn't represent the fulcrum of the gaming market, the graphic adventure is by no means dead, on the contrary, it lives on in the independent market. An example is the game available from today, September 28, 2022, on PC, Mac and Linux, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, which offers a small but intriguing point and click adventure, with its mix of puzzles and plot, which falls into the genre horror. For all the details, keep reading our review of The Excavation of Hob's Barrow. A disturbing story The protagonist of The Excavation of Hob's Barrow in front of the inn The protagonist of The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is the antiquarian Thomasina Bateman, who is writing a book dedicated to the burial mounds of England. The young woman receives a letter from a man from the remote village of Bewlay, who reveals the existence of a tumulus outside the town. The woman arrives by train and stays at the only inn in the town, but her guest doesn't show up. Not only that, the village - surrounded by fog and often grayed by the rainy sky - is full of people who don't exactly seem happy at the idea of a foreigner who gets to poke her nose where she shouldn't. Hob's mound (barrow means barrow) is supposed to be a famous place, but people seem to know nothing about it and change the subject quickly. Within a few days of stay, Thomasina (or rather, we for her) will not only have to shed light on the mystery that revolves around this burial place, but also to discover more about her past. A series of flashbacks will take us back to when the woman was just a child and began to learn the profession from her father. The adventure of The Excavation of Hob's Barrow lasts approximately six hours during which we will be able to immerse ourselves in the strangeness of Bewlay, making the acquaintance of various citizens of the village. The large cast of characters is pleasantly varied and detailed, managing to create a believable village, but always a little strange. A strange cat from The Excavation of Hob's Barrow The Excavation of Hob's Barrow aims to create a place simple but adorned with an air of suspicion, where even a single cat seems a threat and where the first glance can never reveal the true nature of the people around us. The plot and the setting above all remind us of some of Lovecraft's stories, with his obsession with the ancient, the rotten and with all the unsaid that trace the boundaries of an invisible world. The game is in fact also classified as a horror, but don't expect ~jump scare~ or an exaggerated use of gore: the goal is ~only~ to make you anxious and never make you feel completely calm. It succeeds, even if perhaps it ends a little too quickly: as soon as things get serious, we immediately enter the final sequence and expose what is really happening behind the quiet facade of The Excavation of Hob's Barrow. A few additional game sections would have helped, but the adventure already works like this. Point and click The Excavation of Hob's Barrow church Like any point and click adventure, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow asks us to advance by solving a whole series of puzzles and puzzles, on average simple. We will have an inventory in which to gather the collected objects, in some cases even to combine with each other, and we will have to explore the few settings available to understand how to find what we need to advance. Mostly it is a matter of solving the problems of the citizens or convincing them to move to other places so as to act undisturbed in other sections of the map. The ideas fielded by the development team are very classic and rarely complicated. Just exhaust the speeches of each character available and act logically. A menu also helps us by keeping track of the active ~missions~. Only towards the end will we have to face more structured puzzles, but still locked up in a few rooms and which can also be completed by simply clicking around. The simplicity of The Excavation of Hob's Barrow makes it very fluid and also suitable for those who are not particularly familiar with the genre. A memory of the protagonist of The Excavation of Hob's Barrow Speaking of the more artistic side of the game, the pixel art graphics, in addition to satisfying the nostalgic, also convince the eye. The environments are detailed and the final result satisfied us. Instead, what struck us the most is the dubbing: the adventure takes us to the English countryside and consequently the various characters have much clearer and less ~citizen~ accents. The whole game is dubbed and orEvery single dialogue is a pleasure to listen to. The soundtrack is also of excellent quality and helps set the right mood for the whole adventure. However, it should be noted that the game is not translated into Italian. Normally we don't consider it a big flaw for a small indie, which has understandable budget limits, but in this case we admit that it could be a problem for those who are not comfortable with the Albion language: there is no shortage of technical terms and idioms dialects.", "date": "2022-09-28", "grade": "8.0"}
