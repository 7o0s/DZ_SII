Currently the best performing mobile devices can run infinitely more complex titles, from a technical point of view, than the first two DOOMs. Nonetheless, those who fought to get them to run on their PC in 1993 will inevitably feel a pang in the heart to see them reproduced in near-perfect on a phone screen. The space marine armed to the teeth against demons; Aliens meets The House 2; The Carmacks, Romero and Tom Hall who developed by alternating work with long D&D sessions, seasoned with french fries and other junk food; Tom Hall's plot ideas that were discarded (later he will be discarded himself) because for Carmack the plot in video games is like that of porn movies: maybe it has to be there, but it's not so important. What mattered was the orgy of technology and brutality that was to fill the screen, drawn by a graphics engine that literally made your jaw drop. DOOM for mobile is something else. Basically they are a mere celebration, which as such is completely superfluous. They have nothing new to say and don't even pretend to. They are simply an attempt to transplant one of the most important pairs of video games ever onto systems that risked rejecting them without too many compliments, such is the ideological distance with the platform for which DOOM was created. So, myth aside, there's nothing here to shock anyone. On the contrary, played today DOOMs have something naive, with that ultra-violence that has by now been largely digested and outdated and with those level design and single player campaign conception solutions that have practically disappeared from the market, because they are too complex and, according to some, unnatural, in the name of opening up the genre (and the world of video games as a whole) to the masses. Forever DOOM In DOOM, the space marine, better known as the Doomguy, is sent to Mars after refusing to kill unarmed civilians on Earth and punching his superior. Ours has to investigate an accident caused by some experiments made with teleportation between Phobos and Deimos, the two moons of Mars. Upon his arrival, the situation has already precipitated: the staff of the base have been exterminated, Deimos is unreachable by radio and the base of Phobos is full of infernal monsters. The Doomguy just has to grab his gun and give himself to the massacre, scouring the levels that make up the base in search of more powerful weapons, protections, medical kits to heal himself in case of injuries (the energy does not recharge by itself) and areas dungeons where the best resources are usually found. In DOOM 2 Hell on Earth the action moves to Earth (as can also be guessed from the subtitle): since the Doomguy proved too tough for them on Mars, the demons decide to attack our beloved planet by massacring everyone. Upon reaching Earth, the marine helps some survivors to escape, in exchange obtaining information on the source of the evil, which he obviously decides to stop with shotguns. In general, the two DOOMs share the same game mechanics, as well as the same graphics engine. DOOM 2 has enemies and the extra super shotgun, but otherwise it's simply DOOM revised and corrected. It's a bit more graphically heavy, but nowadays it's really hard to realize that. It must be said that the two games are structured in a slightly different way: DOOM is divided into five selectable episodes, each consisting of about eight levels, while DOOM 2 has a single campaign divided into thirty levels and as an extra it includes the twenty 'Master Levels'. sold as an expansion proper at the time. Touch controls DOOM's gameplay is still the one that canonized (not invented, mind you) the first-person shooter genre, but frankly it makes it dodgy with touch controls. By default, the left side of the screen is used for movement, the middle for interactions, and the right for weapons. Although the block of the Y axis (it was the same as the original) makes the control system simpler than that of the most recent FPS, after a few minutes of play it becomes evident how the DOOMs adapt poorly to touch controls, which are too slippery. However, the problem is also another: modern FPS for mobile systems are already designed with touch controls in mind, not only at the interface level, but also in the level design and artificial intelligence of the enemies. The DOOMs, on the other hand, have a labyrinthine structure that requires constant turns and the enemies are those of the time, therefore absolutely indifferent to some inaccuracies imposedby the new control system. In short, with the touch controls we were not able to play decently beyond the third difficulty level (out of five). Probably with a little effort it is possible to do better even in the two advanced ones, but our experience in this sense has been quite frustrating, despite starting from an excellent knowledge of the two DOOMs. Instead, tried with a bluetooth controller (the Gamesir 4Gs ed) the situation improved enormously and we were able to play both chapters without problems even at higher difficulties. Technical details As already mentioned, from a technical point of view the DOOM mobile are identical to the other versions. Three notes can be moved to him: the first concerns the complete lack of graphic configurations, which requires the presence of the screen interface, decidedly useless for those who have always been used to playing without. Another note concerns the need to connect to the Bethesda account to play (only on first start), an account whose function is not well understood. After all, the multiplayer side is completely absent, so what's the point? Many have seen it as annoying DRM for titles that don't need it, given who they're aimed at. The third note concerns the support for mods. Consider that on Android it is possible to download the Freedom application which allows you to take the original files for PC and have the complete games, moreover much more configurable. Freedom also allows you to launch mods, so why not open up the mobile version more? That is, why expose yourself to a comparison that mercilessly favors an amateur production? For the rest there are no particular notes to move to two games that by now you should all know very well, even if only by name: they are DOOM and DOOM 2, if you liked them, you will also like them in the mobile version.", "date": "2019-08-12", "grade": "6.9"}
