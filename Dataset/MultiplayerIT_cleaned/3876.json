{"name": "Last Year: The Nightmare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/last-year-the-nightmare-recensione.html", "text": "Even before arriving at the release of Last Year: The Nightmare and this review, the Elastic Games game made headlines for the distribution method chosen by the Canadian team (which is also the publisher) at launch. Last Year: The Nightmare has in fact arrived as an exclusive time of the internal store of the Discord application, until a few months ago used only for chatting via text and voice by the players. In an attempt to expand with its Store, Discord has entered into an agreement with Elastic Games which will bind the two parties to an exclusive ninety days, after which Last Year: The Nightmare will also arrive in other virtual stores on PC and possibly on consoles. Beyond the purely commercial issues, Last Year: The Nightmare has in any case been able to intrigue us with its announcement for the asymmetrical multiplayer dynamics, linked to a niche with high potential in terms of fun in which we can find titles such as Dead by Daylight and Friday the 13th: The Game. But let's not waste any more time, because the killer may be around - it's time to act! Plot and mode: I know what you did... For its setting, Last Year: The Nightmare is inextricably linked to the most typical figures of the slasher films of some time ago. Therefore, the choice to place the action during the Halloween party back in 1996 is not accidental, the year in which the aforementioned genre found itself experiencing a second youth thanks to the release of Scream in theaters. Perfectly repeating the classic lines of this niche of horror cinema, in what is currently its only mode Last Year: The Nightmare puts us in the shoes of five students on the run from a maniac killer, for a total of six players participating in the game . The objective for the fleeing group is to find an object on the map, using it in a specific context to thus gain the ability to leave the area and thus end the game. The killer obviously has to prevent all this from going through, hindering the operations of the five boys. To do this, he can scatter traps of various kinds around the map, but above all he can face them several times to carry out his heinous murders. Who plays the maniac currently has the possibility to choose between three different characters: the Strangler is fast and equipped with a chain with which he can attract the boys to him, the Giant is a slow mountain of muscles but able to catch and throw with force anyone meters away, the Slasher is finally somewhere in between equipped with an axe. The Gameplay: Prey or Predator? In order to simulate the movie scenes where the assassins seem able to always be one step ahead of their prey, the developers have included in Last Year: The Nightmare the Predator mode, which allows whoever controls the maniac to teleport to any area of the map. The only condition is not to be in the field of vision of the five boys, who also for this reason must work as a team to ensure that the killer remains at a safe distance. The secret to arriving unharmed at the end of the game lies in coordinating to avoid being isolated, in the latter case allowing the Strangler or someone else to attack. Even if escape is often the best option, as a group you can also go on a counterattack to buy time, exploiting the characteristics of each character to try to eliminate the assassin. In fact, we have four classes available, which are also quite classic in their characteristics: Assault, Medic, Scout and Technician. Exploring the map, each of them can find material to build and upgrade their equipment, creating for example in the case of the tank (Assault) a football helmet to protect themselves, or weapons such as flamethrowers and turrets. In the event that the assassin manages to eliminate one of the members of the group, the respawn of the latter takes place inside a closet, from which the other survivors must free him to allow him to continue his escape. Even if Last Year: The Nightmare does not provide a tutorial, it is still possible to learn its dynamics in a fairly short time. The main problems at the moment concern the scarcity of content (there are only three maps) and the absence of a tangible reason to continue playing games after the first two hours of the game, unless climbing a ranking for you is not already . The period indicated is the one more or less necessary to see everything that the Elastic Games creature currently has to offer. With the increase of knowledge of the game, the request to review a balance that at the moment seems to go too much against the assassin, has also arisen online.which in fact in some games risks becoming prey to a group of players who know their stuff. What awaits us in 2019 In terms of entertainment Last Year: The Nightmare undoubtedly manages to have its say, but in its current state the game runs the risk of attracting only the most die-hard fans of Scream and the like. For 2019, the Canadian team has already set some stakes, promising the publication of new content related to additional maps, weapons and characters (including assassins), as well as game modes other than the current one. Among the promises of Elastic Games there is also the desirable progression system, thanks to which it should be possible to keep interest in Last Year: The Nightmare alive over a medium-long period. Graphics and sound: clean and well-groomed In addition to the game class, those who connect to a game can choose the type of character that best suits them, also in this case drawing from a series of classic figures: the school diva, the bespectacled nerd, the football team quarterback , and so on. Even if the choice is purely of an aesthetic nature, once the action has started the player has the opportunity to appreciate the work done by Elastic Games to give Last Year: The Nightmare a noteworthy setting, starting precisely from its protagonists. In technical terms the game performs quite well, with a significant attention to detail both for the protagonists and for the map, accompanied by good animations of the characters. The game also boasts good optimization against bugs and various quirks: even the disconnection problems that plagued the games in the days following launch seem to have been resolved. The sound also knows its stuff: going around the map means in fact listening to a whole series of sinister voices and noises, undoubtedly useful for creating the Friday the 13th atmosphere that the developers had in mind . The protagonists also offer some interesting lines of dialogue, without wanting to expect the development of a plot that obviously doesn't exist.", "date": "2018-12-29", "grade": "6.8"}
