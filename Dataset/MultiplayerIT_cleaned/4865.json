{"name": "World to the West", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/183414-world-to-the-west-seguendo-una-direzione-errata.html", "text": "Rain Games rose to prominence a few years ago thanks to a very particular title, a game with a unique style capable of sublimely merging platform sections with particularly intelligent puzzles: Teslagrad. The production was certainly not perfect but it showed all the potential of this small development studio. We therefore welcomed the arrival of World to the West on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, which is nothing more than its spiritual sequel, however we were amazed by Rain Games' choice to abandon the two-dimensional view to switch to one bird's eye camera, complete with polygonal characters and a semi-open world setting that reminded us at various times of the old chapters of The Legend of Zelda. Revolutionizing is always a courageous choice but will it also be the most suitable one? World to the West is an adventure with many things to say but at the same time unable to express itself properly A wrestler, a miner and a thief walk into a bar World to the West starts very slowly taking all the time necessary to introduce the four main protagonists. Perhaps too much time on closer inspection, because the incipit of the adventure wearily drags on for a couple of hours before entering the heart of the action, forcing the player to go through sections that are not very exciting and with few ideas in the middle, with characters non-players with dull and predictable dialogue and nothing that stimulates deeper exploration of the game areas. The dungeons are linear and the things to do are really limited, in short, not a great crackling start as we would have expected. And until you have assimilated everything well there will be no way for the game to change pace, not even when the protagonists start interacting with each other. Rain Games has decided to take a non-canonical path, opting for single character management rather than uniting them into a single group as usually happens in these cases and in our opinion the choice proves to be unconvincing. Thus it happens that you find yourself repeating the same sections of the map over and over again just to find an additional passage or see a previously unreachable road. Even the teleporters between the various areas of the map work individually for the four protagonists, lengthening the broth in a senseless way and essentially requiring you to activate them four times. It would have been enough to allow the player to choose which hero to use at the moment, perhaps jumping from one to another as many exponents of the genre have already done with a simple click on the pad or a much more practical wheel choice, structuring the party as a single identity and with multiple skills rather than dividing the whole experience into watertight compartments. In fact, each hero has special powers, Lumina is a Teslamancer who can teleport for example, Lord Clonington can punch enemies and break through reinforced doors with a charge, Miss Teri can use her scarf as a whip and Klaus can dig deep tunnels. and sneak into ravines too narrow for his travel companions. To proceed through the intricate map it will therefore be necessary to use a single character from time to time to unlock the intended path, go back, change heroes and retrace the same path using the passages opened by the previous hero and so on in a rather tedious cycle. Things start to get interesting as the hours go on, as we start to get hold of extra abilities, with the puzzles getting more complex and the doors harder to open, but you never reach a point of absolute quality like had been for Teslagrad, there's always that something that doesn't work properly to leave a bitter aftertaste on the player's palate. Only the bosses have lifted our morale, surprising us with the variety of situations and ways of fighting, a feature that alone, however, absolutely cannot support the weight of a gameplay that is really too boring and unnerving. Don't make me play it four times! Exploration was supposed to be one of the strong points of this World to the West but instead turns out to be one of the most forgettable elements. You are prompted to continue through the story, to discover the fate of the various protagonists and you advance accompanied by pleasant music in a world with an extremely simple polygonal construction but at the same time endowed with a pleasant style. Such a violent change of genre has obviously forced Rain Games to have to forcibly exploit a different engine and perhaps the studio was not yet ready for such a leap, so much so that on your way it will not be unusual to find incorrect tooltips or annoying bugs, a symptom that the polishing phase did not go the wayRight. Even the movements of our four heroes are woody and the heavy gait lowers the visual quality of the work, completing a picture that fails to fully satisfy us. We found the design of the monsters and the various little creatures that crossed our path excellent but nothing incredibly memorable, making the eight hours of the campaign rather anonymous. There are other elements that betray the team's desire to create a truly memorable game, or at least on a par with Teslagrad, such as a substantially useless currency system, recoverable from monsters, and a quantity of collectibles (about thirty in all) that it does not stimulate exploration, also becoming a nuisance when you realize you have to retrace your steps once again to collect the missing objects in order to gain access to the secret ending. Very frustrating situation if you haven't manually noted their position during your game (often it is impossible to recover them because you lack some skills to open blocked accesses) since the game map, not really easily readable, does not provide any kind of clue or note.", "date": "2017-05-21", "grade": "6.8"}
