Leo's Fortune, however, is not exactly an average product. Originally released a year and a half ago on the App Store and Google Play, the platform developed by Senri brought many valuable elements to the table: a simple plot made fascinating by its protagonists, a family of furry little beings who are suddenly shocked by a mysterious theft; defined, fluid, colorful and inspired graphics, entirely hand-drawn; an almost perfect, precise and responsive touch control system; platforming mechanics that compensated for the lack of enemies with a large number of puzzles to solve, almost always based on physics; and finally a splendid orchestral soundtrack, capable of creating an atmosphere close to that of Tim Burton's film productions. An excellent title with only one flaw, that of brevity, which unfortunately is magnified precisely in the transition to a platform other than the mobile one. Leo's Fortune is an atmospheric platformer, beautiful to look at and addictive, but a little too short Pelosetti to the rescue As mentioned, the plot of Leo's Fortune begins with a mysterious theft: the treasure of the protagonist, a hairy creature with two huge moustaches, was stolen by someone; a family member, as only Leo's relatives knew the location of the treasure. Was it cousin Victor, who loses his mind when it comes to gold? The strange Aunt Olga? Or the grumpy uncle Sergej? We will discover the truth at the end of a single player campaign consisting of five different scenarios for a total of nineteen levels, to which are added extra challenges that are unlocked when we get hold of a sufficient number of stars. The latter are obtained by completing the stages within a time limit, collecting all the coins and avoiding dying, with a view to a factor that significantly pushes towards replayability. All in conjunction with a level design that is very inspired by the original Sonic The Hedgehog, and which offers loops of the loop and an inertial context in which you have to take a run, run and jump in order to reach certain platforms. The action is so fast and immediate, very simple to master thanks to the just two buttons used, which are used to allow the protagonist to ~inflate~ or to stop, to become lighter or heavier depending on the situation. Brilliant minds There are quick sequences in Leo's Fortune and others where you simply jump from platform to platform, but the core of the gameplay is the physics-based puzzles scattered throughout the levels. We are talking about switches that must be activated by moving objects and most of the time exploiting the peculiar abilities of the protagonist, who, as already mentioned, can inflate and make himself light or flatten himself to give more weight to the ground. In some situations this means, for example, rapidly descending and ascending in the water, but also exploiting the different dimensions to push buttons, open passages, avoid obstacles and so on. The moment Leo misses a jump and ends up in a chasm or on spikes, game over is instantaneous; however the presence of numerous checkpoints effectively cancels any frustration for an accidental death. To make the experience even more engaging there is then the splendid graphics which, even on consoles, at 1080p resolution, manage to enchant you with the sharpness of some elements, the excellent choice of colors and the skilful use of lights to create atmosphere. There are truly evocative, enchanting landscapes, and the hand drawing guarantees the originality and variety of what is shown on the screen, which is therefore not the result of the use of pre-packaged assets and boasts its own personality. However, it is above all the excellent soundtrack that works in the direction of the atmosphere, accompanying the action with well-made music, which, as already mentioned, closely resembles Tim Burton's films. Playstation 4 trophies The fourteen Trophies present in Leo's Fortune are quite simple to obtain, moreover in most cases to unlock them it is enough to get hold of the ~secret token~ placed inside the stages. However, one of the achievements of the game also consists in obtaining all the stars in all the missions, which means making several attempts to succeed in the enterprise. From mobile to console The limits of Leo's Fortune, in particular in the landing on consoles, lie in its original nature of mobile game. First there is onedifficulty balancing issue: although the touch controls were almost perfect in the iOS and Android version, they didn't offer the pinpoint accuracy of a DualShock and therefore acted as a barrier against completing the stages too quickly. Outside the mobile context, this factor has failed and there are moments in which the duration of the missions proves to be a little too skimpy, in line with a portable use but far from what is normally expected on consoles and PCs. Even the management suffers in this sense, remaining anchored to the original nature of the project, therefore without taking the necessary time to develop certain concepts, see for example the splendid introductory sequence in which Leopold begins to tell what happened to him. What has been said must also be seen from the perspective of a defect from which Senri's title already suffered in its first incarnation: excessive brevity. If it is true that there are experiences that manage to give a lot despite a small playing time, in this specific case it would have been desirable to add some extra stages to go beyond the two hours it takes to complete the adventure. The unlocking of a difficult mode, from this point of view, represents a welcome but not decisive extra.", "date": "2015-09-26", "grade": "7.0"}
