The Puny Human guys, based in North Carolina but with branches in other countries, had already distinguished themselves for Dystopia, a total conversion for Half-Life 2 (available for free) and for Blade Symphony, their first commercial project released shortly over a year ago to a moderate critical reception. With Galacide they decided to marry two of the oldest genres of video games, namely shoot 'em ups a la Galaga and puzzles a la Puzzle Bubble; everything was then ~remixed~ and brought up to date thanks to the futuristic fourth version of the Unreal engine. The premises for an explosive mixture would seem to be good, but in practice we are faced with a hybrid that fails to fully convince. Galacide seems to convince immediately for a well-chosen mix of action and reflections, but soon loses its bite Double personality The principle of Galacide is therefore quite elementary: under the mask of a traditional horizontal scrolling shooter there is a psychotropic emulator of Tetris. The continuation of the stage is in fact dotted with moments in which the screen is literally full of small squares colored in blue, purple and orange: these blocks can only be destroyed by creating sequences of at least four units of the same color. To succeed, it is first necessary to collect the spheres that are dropped by the opponents in place of the classic power-ups and then ~shoot~ them in the correct space, in a sort of Force 4, to clear the way. The main difficulty is not so much that of taking out the enemies, a task in itself quite easy thanks also to the choice of using a single offensive weapon, but of recognizing and above all collecting, in the chaos of bricks floating on the screen, those who the more they are useful for quickly clearing the road. The needle of the balance is forcefully moved right on the puzzle component, and requires a considerable dose of reflexes especially with increasing level of difficulty, when on the one hand scrolling, becoming faster, leaves less time to reflect, while on the other the danger of the enemies rises exponentially. Fortunately, a single missile is not enough to lose a life: there is an energy bar that can be restored with special medkits - an acceptable choice because it reduces the dangerous risk of frustration. The general structure, however pleasant, didn't completely convince us because it didn't allow us to give the right emphasis to the action component typical of eighties shooters: in particular, we didn't like the very few power ups with which to enhance your spaceship (e.g. there are four distinct variants). More generally, the feeling that a lot of additions are still missing to make the title more complete and usable is concrete and after a few games you run the risk of having already seen everything the game has to offer. Spaceballs We didn't expect Galacide to make our jaw drop to the ground, but with the super famous Unreal Engine 4 some more special effects could also be expected; instead, we are faced with a sampling of explosions already seen at least a decade ago, anonymous and lacking in detail enemy ships and final bosses that honestly seem to have not yet come out of the alpha phase, since they are just sketched. Overall, however, the graphic style, despite being very colorful, is clean and appropriate to the type of gameplay. On the other hand, the soundtrack is very good, a fair compromise between the legendary arcade sounds and touches of electronic pop: it's just a pity that there aren't many tracks, but as it should be clear at this point in the review, it is a limitation that distinguishes the entire production. The multiplayer component allows four players to help each other complete the main campaign, but only locally; to expand the offer there is also an infinite mode in which there are no enemies but only walls to knock down.", "date": "2015-07-28", "grade": "6.0"}
