Always disinterested in following market trends and not inclined to indulge the idiosyncrasies of gamers, it has pursued a kind of splendid isolation since its foundation, when it was still only launching short adventures for the web. Over time, the vision of the studio, always directed by the founder Jakub Dvorsky, has been refined, losing all desire to compose easily definable works, although visible in the first, however splendid titles such as Samorost and Machinarium. Chuchel, Pilgrims and Creaks, the last three games by Amanita Design, are an ode to playful surrealism, to the magnification of style and visionary as the fulcrum of the experience and to the concept of subtraction as the cornerstone of game design. Happy Game's review shows that the studio has taken a new step in the same direction. Happy Game asks us what happiness is A child falls asleep and ends up in a terrible nightmare. Will we be able to make him happy? This is the whole story of Happy Game, a psychedelic and surreal horror adventure. In terms of game mechanics we are talking about a very bare-bones point-and-click adventure, in which it is possible to make the character move only to the right or left, dragging him with the mouse, and in which objects do not get stuck in a inventory, but are manipulated directly on the screen. At best they can be grabbed by the child to carry them from one part of an area to another, but that's all. The idea of such a bare-bones design is to focus the player's attention on the audio-visual experience, of which the puzzles should be an integral part and not a distraction. For this reason, despite the presence of more complicated situations, the adventure progresses with a certain agility, managing to complete it in two hours or so. Not many? Honestly, it seemed like the right length for a title like this, which doesn't aim to colonize the player's life, but offers itself to him as a small revelation, taking the space it needs to manifest its themes and ghosts. Happy Game is filled with monster toys Happy Game is a game made up of bodies that explode or are quartered, of monstrous toys that come alive to devour the protagonist, of ancestral creatures that echo childhood memories never elaborated, of grotesque landscapes that hide the unspeakable horrors hidden in the unconscious, of blood, escapes and screams. If, as Salomon Resnik writes in The theater of dreams, ~Telling a dream is a way of revealing oneself, of discovering oneself, of opening up to the other. Communicating, establishing an emotional contact with the other, with the world,~ then the creative by Amanita Design invite us to sink into the protagonist, staging him in videogame form to make us reach his innermost depths. We don't have to psychoanalyze him, mind you, because in fact we are only on the scene as his agents, allowing him to face his fears, in search of a happiness prevented by some real events, always represented in an ethereal way, as if they were shrouded in fog, which are then the engine of his tormented night. For example, we discover that a bully stole his ball and that his favorite soft toy ended up in a lake, two events that can be highly traumatic for a child. Despite this, the relationship we establish with his world is essentially aesthetic. We make it advance, of course, but along pre-established tracks on which we have no freedom to intervene. We have to think to solve the puzzles, but we have no way to bypass or ignore them. We are faced with what appears to be pure fruition, in which we are only asked to interpret. From a technical-stylistic point of view, Happy Game is the usual jewel of Amanita Design, capable of taking inspiration from multiple sources, reworking them, to offer an original as well as peculiar aesthetic, focused on the smile and how this can decline into something terrifying in turning of a few moments. Even the audio follows the same concept, transforming itself as needed to underline the change in atmosphere of what is happening on the screen.", "date": "2021-10-27", "grade": "8.8"}
