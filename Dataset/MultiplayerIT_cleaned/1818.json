{"name": "Project Earth: Starmageddon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-earth-starmageddon.html", "text": "Living Outside In the not too near future, men will set out to conquer space. After trying more complex avenues like terraforming, researchers realized that the best way to survive off the land was to build city-sized motherships that could source raw materials and build at their own pace. internal all the facilities necessary for expansion. At the helm of these gigantic queens of space are people endowed with particular powers, a kind of Captain Kirk stuffed with psionic powers and various genetic mutations. Our task within the game will be, as good puppeteers of the third millennium, to move the strings of these leaders. New ideas and old glories As soon as you are projected into the heart of the action, you become aware of some evidence. Mainly the comparison with the successful Homeworld series is inevitable: both are RTS, both are set in space, and both enjoy a fully three-dimensional game system. Indeed, the word 'clone' may come to mind, but after all it is inevitable that a good idea, sooner or later, will in all respects become a separate genre (3-dimensional Real Time Strategy? How does 3dRTS sound?). The gentlemen of Lemon Interactive, however, had something different in mind when they conceived their 3dRTS. Not really a revolution, but rather a change of perspective. The peculiarity of Starmageddon is a sort of dove's egg: the game is Simple. Not easy, but simple, almost a kind of chess game. Routines and Gears The game mechanics can be learned easily in a short time: you start with only the mother spaceship (behemoth) and with a limited number of resources. The first thing to build are the harvesters, ships delegated for the collection of raw materials. The collection takes place automatically. Every basic action happens automatically, unless otherwise indicated. Furthermore, each unit performs one and only one specific function, to which are added some general functions. That's pretty much all there is to it, other than the fact that units are left-click selected and right-click deselected. The shifting of the player's point of view takes place with combinations of the mouse and arrow keys, as well as a series of convenient shortcuts. Pressing the CTRL key allows you to switch to the management interface, which is always visible. Add a couple of orthonormal maps and you have one of the most immediate command systems in recent times. The dances begin This makes Starmageddon the ideal game for beginners approaching strategy, and at the same time makes it a valid alternative to more complex games for experts. Starmageddon has more strings to his bow. Mainly a truly remarkable graphic apparatus, complete with light effects, particles, and the whole range of special effects in full Hollywood style, among other things not too burdensome for the system. The soundtrack, as per deliveries, mainly includes songs of the ambient genre, which in a certain sense recall the grandeur and alienness of cosmic magnitudes, even if they intelligently give way to more rhythmic sequences when the action gets underway. The sound effects are also noteworthy, if not for their quality, then for the precision with which they adapt in intensity and direction to the position of the observer. The models of the various spaceships are made with considerable care, especially considering that very often they are simple units, while maintaining a fair lightness in terms of number of polygons, which allows you to display a good number of units without too much effort (on a mid-range system, the engine begins to fatigue when the total units exceed a hundred). Harness the potential On paper, therefore, a potential best-seller, above all by virtue of its simplicity and spectacularity. As we know, however, the world is dotted with excellent potential that does not mature and, unfortunately, Starmageddon risks belonging to this category. The reason probably lies precisely in the desire to keep the game within everyone's reach. The first consideration to make is on the game environment: despite being completely three-dimensional (so much so that nobody prevents you from overturning your Bahamuth if you want), the battles, especially those between two factions, tend tointended to have a planar development, trivially because straight lines are faster to travel. There are some variations to this theme with regard to resource management: the defense of the harvesters (or the elimination of the opposing ones) can lead you to some displacement from the main axis, but very often it is sufficient to build a flotilla, place it in the set area to maximum aggression and forget about it. Another decisive aspect of the game is the scarcity of resources: very often the game tends to become a gold rush, so much so that one of the most effective strategies is to invest all one's initial funds in the creation of harvesters, ~somatize~ a little ' in the first instance and make up for it when the gap becomes unsustainable for the opponent (a technique that works especially in singleplayer, less so in multiplayer where all players tend to implement this strategy). Conclusions All this could also fall within the sphere of the peculiarities of the game. However, where Starmageddon definitely shows its side is in artificial intelligence. Mainly the problems are related to the aspects mentioned above: it is true that the enemy tends to position his defenses three-dimensionally around his area, but very often an attack from unconventional directions (high, low, or in any case on orthogonal planes) pays a lot, especially having the forethought to direct the fleet in the right way. Then comes the really sore point: artificial intelligence is unable to cope with a human opponent. The basic behavior is practically unchanged for each situation and for each race: I build as many harvesters as I can and one or two attack ships with what is left over, I send them to disturb the harvesters or the mothership of the opponent. I receive the first resources, keep some reserve and build defenses, then bigger ships and send a first wave. More resources, more defenses and even bigger ships, another wave and so on. This is practically independent of what happens on the playing field. Thus the human adversary will manage resources wisely (dividing them wisely between the battlefields), will focus on defense and wild harvesting, and when resources will run out he will build a fleet worthy of the name and send it to launch his attack. Which more often than not will prove fatal. Victory. PROS Smooth and spectacular graphics Simple and intuitive game system Missions well integrated by an interesting storyline CONS Artificial intelligence not up to par Resources almost always too scarce Repetitive game mechanics Space to Space Starting a review of a game set in space is always problematic. The fear of falling back into some commonplace appears at practically every step. The inner battle against the commonplace is something that books could be written about. Starting with pearls like ~space, the last frontier~ or throwing yourself into the minimalist - counter-current with amenities like ~year 3027, how do I wake up every morning and look at the Earth from my window?~. There is a third way, dirtier and, if you wish, cowardly: it is that of the flow of thoughts.
