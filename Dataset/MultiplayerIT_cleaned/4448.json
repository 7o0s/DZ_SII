In this specific case, the title developed by Tuatara Games puts us in command of a soldier determined to defend a mysterious steel door, or simply his own life in a real dead end, from the onslaught of hordes of aliens more or less large, more or less threatening and resistant. Once the unfailing cigarette has been extinguished, the man can lurk behind a shelter with his large machine gun and start shooting as the enemies arrive, alternating increasingly dense waves composed of creatures with different characteristics: from basic aliens to that explode when you shoot them, from jumping ~spiders~ to monsters that proceed clinging to the ceiling, finally passing through the bosses, as difficult as expected. To deal with these threats we will therefore have to hold down the fire button and act with the left thumb on an analog control that regulates the trajectory of the shot, raising or lowering it as needed. How long will we be able to resist? Shoot, die, repeat Death is itself an element of Let Them Come gameplay. In fact, you have to fail in order to spend the money earned by mowing down the aliens in order to buy upgrades, alternative ammunition, melee weapons to use when the enemies are too close, bombs and so on. There are details to which particular attention must be paid, for example the fact that the machine gun ends up overheating when the trigger is always held down, and it is therefore precisely on these aspects that it is better to act immediately, unlocking cooling systems but also increasing the ratio of fire in order to obtain a greater effectiveness of the shots. The upgrades are in fact very numerous and can substantially change the experience, transforming seemingly unstoppable waves into health walks and thus shaping the progression developed by the developers, giving it a pinch of depth and variety. The problem, however, is that in the end the game begins to feel repetitive already after a few games, and unfortunately there are no solutions to this inconvenience: the extra modes allow you to scrape together some money to spend or to face single bosses unlocked up to that point, but without offering variations on the theme. It's a pity, because from the point of view of the graphics and the interface, a great job has been done, with an inspired and interesting pixel art even in some touches of class, such as the representation of our vital energy in DOOM style, that is, with the face of the protagonist that begins to bleed and swelling as he suffers damage. The electronic soundtrack is also beautiful, equipped with a browser for manual selection of songs.", "date": "2018-01-23", "grade": "7.2"}
