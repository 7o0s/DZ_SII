{"name": "War Front: Turning Point - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/war-front-turning-point-recensione.html", "text": "A long gestation There was a lot of expectation around this title announced at E3 two years ago, especially for the original setting: a geopolitical scenario in which Europe is imagined if Germany hadn't been defeated in 1945 and consequently the Second World War world had lasted for further years. The imaginative interpretation of the past has allowed the programmers to give life to all those projects that remained only on paper: the result is a coexistence of weapons and means that actually existed and were used, such as the Panther or Calliope tanks, names now known to most and which they plunge the player into the historical roots of the conflict, together with bizarre gadgets and equipment, such as the Soviet Union's ice bomb or the Wehrmacht's jetpack, which project him into an (im)probable future. The usual soup In spite of this innovative facade, which demonstrates how the world war topic is not completely exhausted and indeed can still open spaces for further and intriguing interpretations, there is actually a strategic hidden that rests its foundations on the very canonical rules introduced over a decade ago by the various Command & Conquer and StarCraft. There are three factions available (Germans, Russians, and allies), each of which is characterized by intrinsic abilities but sufficiently uniform in substance; there are resources to collect and upgrades to make and there are heroes, super-powered soldiers capable of turning the tide of battle. Of course, the Chinese rock rule applies: there is no such thing as the strongest unit, but each unit has weaknesses that make it particularly vulnerable. That said, we do not hide the fact that, more often than not, one ends up always preferring the best armies of one's team: in the case of the Germans, for example, the artillery is by far the most powerful, and one will end up making extensive use of it unlike the land infantry that is useful only in a few occasions, such as the conquest of strategic buildings (banks, drills) that provide a significant increase in resource production. The single player is structured in two campaigns (one allied, the other German) consisting of 11 missions each. The maps are always the same, regardless of who you choose - the difference lies in the point of view from which you experience the story; a decision in our opinion questionable because it definitely lowers the replayability factor. The plot, entrusted to young American set designers, is also very light, fictionalized and full of clichs: just think that the fearsome German commander Hellmann, who in the introductory film single-handedly exterminates a dozen American crawlers, to incite his men to conquer London finds no better motivation than the threat of having to drink English beer in case of defeat. Strategic choices and execution errors On the battlefield the computer AI gets along pretty well, especially in the more advanced missions when the initial numerical difference can create headaches for the player; however usually it is sufficient to resist until creating a couple of armies strong enough with which to first weaken and then annihilate the enemy positions. If you fail in this feat, you can always take advantage of a generous choice of programmers that allows you to build anywhere on the map. Strategic choices and execution errors The more savvy will use a lot of building freedom to give life to the ~erosion~ tactic which consists in the indiscriminate building of defensive towers of any type (there is no limit) to arrive with the polished army close to the camp governed by the CPU which, as almost always happens, uses defensive tools too sparingly. A flaw of no small importance is the pathfinding, i.e. the movement of units on the map. Too often you'll find yourself wasting time ~directing the traffic~: the tanks get in each other's way, leaving you trapped and vulnerable to the enemy's rain of fire. We would not have honestly expected such a blunder from a developer as experienced as Digital Reality, whose skill emerges instead in the technical realization. The technical aspect The strong point of War Front are the explosions that season each armed clash and make the action pleasant and spectacular; otherwise the title is doing well without excelling. The units are detailed and move fluidly on the screen, but the absence of anti-aliasing leaves some perplexities, as well as some night settings that are difficult to interpret. An interesting feature that we will see heavily used in the next Field Ops is the possibility of using the defensive turrets in first person or following the supply trucksit gives you an isometric view. However, we believe that this option will only be used out of curiosity and on very few occasions by players, because it naturally takes attention away from the battlefield. Always a strong point of Digital Reality, War Front's soundtrack is undoubtedly evocative, but what is missing is the variety of speech. Troops will always respond with those two or three comments (the copy we tested was in English) that could quickly get bored. The technical aspect The multiplayer sector can put against up to a maximum of 10 players via local or international network and provides, in addition to the usual Deathmatch (solo or team) and Conquest modes, the pleasant Secret Orders variant: as in Risk, each player is given a different goal  whoever reaches it first obviously wins. Comment After trying War Front: Turning Point for several hours, a little bitterness remains in the mouth for the excellent premises developed in a too superficial way and without the dose of innovation necessary to compete not only with the champion of the category, that Company of Heroes awarded by the editorial staff of Multiplayer.it as the best PC game of 2006, but with two other blockbusters of the caliber of Supreme Commander and Command & Conquer 3, on which the attention of the players is totally concentrated. At the same time, however, we would like to recommend the Digital Reality game to insatiable strategists or to those who, due to personal tastes or not having sufficiently powerful hardware, cannot afford the aforementioned ~heavyweights~.
