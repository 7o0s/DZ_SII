{"name": "Full Metal Monsters", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/full-metal-monsters-recensione.html", "text": "Full Metal Monsters, the new mobile game produced by Azur Interactive Games and the subject of this review, clearly draws inspiration from a television series from the late 80s, Dino-Riders, from which a very popular toy line was born, also in Italy. The idea of taking a large roster of dinosaurs, having them ridden by a human ~pilot~ and equipping them with high-tech weapons was fascinating at the time and still is today, it seems, so much so that the Cypriot development team decided to use it as the basis for a multiplayer shooter for iOS and Android devices. Downloadable for free, the game adopts a relatively elastic freemium model but which gives vent to inevitable pay-to-win mechanisms. By completing matches and leveling up, it is possible to unlock new beasts and use two different types of currency, virtual and precious, to enhance their characteristics and improve their equipment; however, those who decide to invest sums of real money can immediately access the most powerful dinosaurs and weapons, making this concrete advantage count once in the field. The games take place within a small set of maps, with a good number of objects and walls to take cover behind, as well as rules that determine whether a team wins whether it has a higher conquest score or if all opponents have been eliminated. The teams are made up of five participants and the matchmaking appears very fast, keeping the experience enjoyable on all occasions and without showing problems related in any way to latency. Dinosaurs, controls and gameplay Among the strengths of Full Metal Monsters, the large number of dinosaurs that make up the roster must certainly be mentioned: there are more than thirty of them, divided into three different classes and equipped with increasingly better characteristics, with a view to progression which unlocks more powerful creatures as we grow. The beasts can equip two weapons and boast a successful, cartoonish design, which however clashes with rather generic and uninspired settings. In short, from a technical point of view, more could have been done, but it is said that with the next updates the situation will not improve: the game is still at version 0.7.5, so it is an open construction site, looking for a large community that can grind respectable numbers. This operation, however, must also take place by carrying out a very careful listening phase to identify any critical issues. In fact, if the touch control system works decidedly well, thanks to the two repositionable virtual analog sticks and very clear, large and well-spaced buttons that allow you to lock-on, open fire and resort to jumping (a maneuver subject to a cooldown), the mechanics that regulate gunplay are not as brilliant and unfortunately make the experience a little too trivial, devoid of challenge and character. If we consider the clear risk of pay-to-win situations mentioned above, it is clear how the whole project can easily derail if a punctual balance in the matching of users is not guaranteed. For the moment things work quite well in this sense, maybe some filters are already active, but the risk remains and must obviously be considered if you want to invest your time with Full Metal Monsters.", "date": "2019-06-19", "grade": "6.8"}
