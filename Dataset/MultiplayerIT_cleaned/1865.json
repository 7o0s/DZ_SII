{"name": "Way of the Samurai", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/way-of-the-samurai-2.html", "text": "The good game does not last long! As already mentioned, the story mode of Way of the Samurai stands out more than for the originality or care of the script, for the extreme brevity. It takes 4, maximum 5 hours to complete it, and it is certainly not the Versus mode that brings the longevity of the game back to sufficient levels. The decisive factor that can make it truly long-lived is replayability, a real sine qua non to fully enjoy the experience proposed by Way of the Samurai. With every single character available, one can in fact join the various family factions that keep alive a sort of civil war, and joining one or the other means experiencing the story mode from a partial and exclusive point of view, with the constant sensation to actively change the course of events. Too strong is the temptation to relive the adventure at least once from a different point of view, perhaps with another character with different fighting characteristics. This possibility can be understood immediately in the first minutes of the game: we are immediately called to a decisive choice, namely whether or not to defend a girl kidnapped by a gang of shady figures of our own centenary order. While the girl struggles and screams and we begin to realize that it will be possible to decide her fate, it will be easy to get carried away by the euphoria and think that we have stumbled upon the first truly free game. In reality Way of the Samurai is certainly not an open book with as many authors as there are players hacking on the pad, but it must still be admitted that the illusion of this freedom is really well recreated. And consequently the impulse to relive a situation by facing it in a different way often manifests itself. Certainly one cannot think that this stimulus will recur indefinitely and that the problems of poor longevity will be completely resolved. But so be it. Good game? What is the latest Acquire work sorely lacking in? First of all, in the technical realization. Way of the Samurai is absolutely not considered a ~new generation~ title, its defects are so evident: flickering and aliasing are rampant everywhere, collisions that have not been seen so gross for some years, particle effects (blood for example) ridiculous and , as soon as the horizon extends, so much fog rises to make the Japanese village look like any small town in the lower Po valley in November. The graphics engine, however, does not seem to have to suffer heavy burdens either as regards the polygons on the screen, in a rather small number, or for the management of a particularly refined or complex AI, which the enemies certainly cannot boast, or for the respect of some algorithm for the management of physical laws, of which the coders seem to have mysteriously forgotten. Only the facial expressions, discreet, and the constant frame rate are saved; the title is also equipped with a 50/60 Hz selector, so you can enjoy the speed of the Japanese counterpart on multi-standard televisions. Returning to the purely aesthetic component, the flaws extend to some purely stylistic choices: improbable James Dean-style nails sprout between kimonos and katanas, perhaps placed to symbolize the impending westernization of Japan (?). We didn't like the choice at all, just as we didn't like the omission of spoken dialogue replaced by speech bubbles, which seemed a little out of place to us, and by guttural-Fantozzi-style exclamations, placed to further emphasize the climax, with relative unexpected comic effects. The sound turns out to be more than good and suggestive in the background music, while the absence of speech is serious, also given the consequent presence of the aforementioned ambiguous exclamations aimed at remedying the lack, together with the comics. Classic melodies give way, Devil May Cry-style, to hard rock rhythms in the combat phases; we wonder how appropriate a similar choice is for a title that certainly does not enjoy the frenzy of Capcom's action game, but which instead prefers a markedly more technical and so to speak ~simulation~ approach. Comment Way of the Samurai is an innovative, well-developed idea, which lacks a technical realization that is not up to par and some style drops in character design and sound. A pleasant appetizer, waiting for Tenchu 3, that all lovers of old-style Japanese culture shouldn't miss. For everyone else, Way of the Samurai is an offbeat, deceptively free story mode adventure with a polished combat system. Pros + Innovation + Spot on combat system + Good replay value Cons + VaVarious style failures + Technical realization not up to par + Sound effects not very well cared for and hard rock music out of place Acquire, waiting for the next chapter of the successful Tenchu saga, offers us an appetizer with a rather unusual flavor with Way Of The Samurai. Momentarily shelved the ninjas, here come the samurai, grappling with a progressive westernization of Japan that seems to want to forget about them: the industrial revolution is in fact looming, and for a solitary samurai life has never been so hard... Enjoy our clan  It is really difficult for us to classify Way Of the Samurai and therefore bring it back to a genre. While the storymode could make it appear as the most classic of adventures, the brevity of the same and the possibility of facing it several times with different characters and alternative endings, complete with acquired score and game over bonus, reveal a distinctly ~arcade~ component , also confirmed by the presence of an unlockable VS mode almost from the beginning. Better therefore, rather than venturing improbable definitions, stick to the harsh reality of the facts. After selecting one of the three initially available characters armed only with a poor sword, you enter a tutorial phase, which describes the essential commands to be able to face the game. With the circle button it is possible to dialogue with the other characters, with L1 the sword is extracted from the scabbard, with square and triangle the attacks are carried out, while with R1 the blows are parried, finally the jump function is assigned to x. The initial paucity of feasible actions and weapons should not deceive: through an accurate and at the same time intuitive learning system we will see their number rise decidedly quickly. The mechanism is simple: starting from the basic actions already described, by pressing keys in an apparently random way (for example triangle + triangle) one discovers combinations that constitute real new ~strokes~, which, once discovered, are signaled with their screen name at the bottom, far right. Progressively, therefore, one arrives at the mastery of kicks, dodges, special defenses and also customizable and different attack combos depending on the weapon adopted (it is possible to collect the weapons of enemies who fell in battle), which make the combat frenetic and fairly ~technical~. . These elements converge in an undoubtedly successful mix, which, even in front of a horde of over 50 enemies, to be faced strictly one at a time, does not make us bored but rather keeps us firmly anchored to the pad, in a grim apotheosis of edges that collide and cry out in pain. The only reportable defects are a response to commands which in some cases is not exactly lightning-fast and the presence of some ~custom~ animations which sometimes appear a little inappropriately and displace the player, who perhaps has to suffer a blow that would have been easily avoidable. However, nothing that seriously compromises the balance of a gameplay that is deep and well designed.", "date": "2002-12-22", "grade": null}
