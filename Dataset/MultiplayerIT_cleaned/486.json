What we didn't expect was an attack on the historic heart of Will Wright's production, the matrix of urban simulators, the mythical and hitherto untouched, Sim City; and instead, just when you don't expect it, a title with marked corsair ambitions emerges from the Franco-Russian forges of Montecristo, ready to plunder the concept of the glory of one of the greatest glories of the Maxis house with both hands. Assuming that such an affront is forgivable, and joking aside, it fully is, we have decided to approach the analysis of this title with the critical eye of one who goes looking not for nitpicking, but for any justification for a eventual abandonment of a Sim City (which, moreover, still runs on the undersigned's PC) in favor of this new and sparkling City Life. Lark mirror? What immediately catches the eye, even before fully savoring the game itself, is certainly the graphic impact. Except for an imperceptible but annoying sensation of persistent dejavu, sparkling colors and a discreet realization of the interface surround a graphics engine capable of presenting a truly inviting range under our noses, in a few words and in a few seconds everything that at least superficially it could be missing from a Sim City. Finally a graphics engine applied to a management system like this able to offer a totally three-dimensional experience. And it's no small matter, given that one of the greatest enjoyments given by a game capable of reproducing the city of one's dreams is precisely that of being able to ~experience~ firsthand the streets of one's own creature made of asphalt and virtual bricks. finally a graphics engine applied to a management system like this able to offer a totally three-dimensional experience Lark mirror? The engine is able to offer a total immersion in the landscape up to the exaggerated possibility of penetrating, degree by degree, at the level of extreme detail, highlighting the excellent realization of the models of the buildings and of the textures used. At the maximum zoom level, it is even possible to walk the streets like an ordinary citizen, admiring the city from the point of view of those who live there. The streetcar of the ''buy-sell'' The game setting focuses on the concept of buying and reselling large areas of land on which to build the foundations of the future urban center. From this point of view, the player comes into contact with the scenario and consequently, depending on the availability of money and the requirements of the scenario, the user enters the heart of the game preparing to draft the first sketches of the master plan. The philosophy of the game is based on the concept that a city wants to grow and develop on the basis of the social needs of its citizens. as can be seen from the effective animated tutorial, the world seen through the eyes of the developers is divided into six macro categories, similar to castes, which identify the types of citizen The streetcar of the ''buy-sell'' While Sim City has always preferred a technical approach to the problem, linked to the economic-financial, social and technical aspects, City Life leaves more room for organization based on the type of citizen who will occupy the various areas of the city. Certain choices immediately affect what will be the effective distribution of the population in the territory. In a nutshell, as can be seen from the effective animated tutorial, the world seen through the eyes of the developers is divided into six macro categories, similar to castes, which identify the types of citizen. These six ~urban classes~ make up the totality of the population, without exception; each faction has relationships of esteem and good coexistence with the two closest and similar to it, while it cannot bear proximity to citizens belonging to the most distant factions, placed, so to speak, at the antipodes. The inhabitants of the city are divided as follows: Elite, the more affluent, refined and snobbish class of the cities; White-collar workers, characterized by high incomes and positions of maximum responsibility; Radical Chic, they represent the progressive and democratic soul of the white-collar cousins, with a marked taste for free time and fun; Blue collars, the working class, serious and founded on the principles of work and family; Alternatives, a class of progressives oriented towards a middle income; Landless, representatives of the most disadvantaged class, at the antipodes of well-being. The presence of a certain class of people in a residential neighborhood affects numerous aspects ranging from the development of the buildings, obviously shaped by the nature of those who live there, to the social tensions that can develop should dangerous overlapping or proximity between factions occur incompatible. When you say ''living the city'' Leafing through the game manual (among other things really well done both from the point of view of the contents and from that of the localization) we noticed a ~NdA~ written in bold and clearly visible: in the chapter relating to the urban classes, the nature caricature of this game. In fact, this is precisely the difference that puts a barrier between City Life and Sim City. it should be emphasized that while the first few bars of the game focus on the formation of the first urban core, late in the game the social situation can explode, giving way to real internal battles in the city When you say ''living the city'' The Maxis title places its objectives beyond pure and simple entertainment, proposing to provide a serious approach to urban management that is not limited exclusively to pure playful imagination. City Life offers another vision, or if we want it shows us the other side of the coin. What matters in City Life is to experience the difficulty of managing a city not only from a managerial point of view, but also from a social one. The ~Life~ of the title indicates the nature of this approach to the subject. It should be emphasized that while the early stages of the game focus on the formation of the first urban nucleus, late in the game the social situation can explode, giving way to real internal battles in the city, in which the citizens of the antagonistic classes can reach the point of clash until the outbreak of a real civil war. Preventing this kind of clashes is the basis of success, for this reason it is advisable to structure the city in sectors in which the development of the various classes can be kept under control as much as possible. There are several techniques to ensure that coexistence is peaceful. The presence of police centers can guarantee good order management, but it can also repress the development of the more extravagant and wealthy classes. The growth of a specific class within the city is enormously influenced by the presence of companies and industries, if in the initial stages of the game it is only possible to choose between the development in favor of the representatives of the less well-off classes (blue collars, alternatives and prudent development will bring representatives of the richest classes to the city, and consequently development and greater well-being for all. Regulatory plans The structure of the game would recall in many respects that already seen in Sim City if it weren't for the massive use of 3D graphics, absent or almost absent in the Maxis title. Yet the similarities that at first glance seem to be shameless diminish on a deeper and more attentive look. Starting from the layout of the urban areas on the map, we realize that there are many differences. In Sim City, at the base of everything, we found the concept of urban planning, or rather the player's need to manage the allocation of land and the location of services as in front of a master plan. In City Life the development is mostly controlled by the player, who in the first person must arrange the lots one by one, forming the neighborhoods that will form the heart of the city. The differentiation of industries and productive activities in general according to the urban class means that the arrival of a specific type of citizen is the exclusive responsibility of the player, and not of the migratory flows imposed by the economic currents decided by the game. Wanting to leave room for three-dimensionality and the player's total freedom to position roads and buildings in the most disparate ways, one immediately collides with one of the biggest catches, perhaps the real and only scourge of the game. The buildings are placed along the streets and with them they take part in the formation of the city plan. Due to the irregular nature of the lots, formed by basic units of a variable number of boxes, we often find ourselves creating mixed areas in which holes will necessarily be created in which it will not be possible to build anything due to lack of space. This problem did not exist in Sim City as the player was not asked to place a particular building, only ttrace the area used for a certain type of construction, the program would then have done the rest by placing large or small buildings where the right requirements had occurred. the roads can be placed at very different angles, with variations of even a few degrees Regulatory plans Another neo is represented by the management of the roads. Following a criterion of absolute freedom in the design of the city plan, one would expect all-round flexibility also from the other elements and instead we often run into the unpleasant sensation that the ~joint game~ does not work and that certain areas go annoyingly out of square, preventing build in apparently free areas. In fact, the streets can be placed at very different angles, with variations of even a few degrees, but the buildings do not adapt to these designs with the same flexibility, creating real problems of placement of the construction areas; in similar situations, then, it's easy to lose your temper and see entire neighborhoods left half-finished due to the impossibility of putting everything in order. House with a view Once the foundations for the colonization of the territory have been laid, it is possible to get to the heart of the action by savoring what this title has to offer. Through the so-called alarm interface it is possible to follow the needs of the citizens who from time to time will put the player in difficulty with their requests. For example, citizens will be able to request the construction of supply points, medical centers or leisure facilities. through the so-called alarm interface it is possible to follow the needs of citizens who from time to time will put the player in difficulty with their requests House with a view In case of poor security on the streets, a small icon will appear on the houses which will draw attention to the need to build police stations in the area. In the same way, education and public parks enter by force into the expectations of those who want to live comfortably. Through the same interface it is possible to follow the progress of the work: the relative icon will appear on the homes of those who are still looking for a job, just as an indicator with the number of vacant positions will appear on the industries, companies and services without a workforce. As per tradition for any self-respecting management system, City Life will also find a robust system of graphics and tools to evaluate the development of the city in every aspect. At our disposal there is an interface for evaluating the subdivision and citizens' expectations, one for analyzing the infrastructures (quality of services, traffic flow, electricity production capacity and waste disposal), one for visualizing the entry and exit flows of citizens (including flows relating to tourism), finally there is a method heavily inspired by the one already known with Sim City for the management of ~marked~ citizens who can be followed in their every move and who provide a continuous sample analysis of the quality of life in the city. A special box continuously highlights the most sensitive information relating to urban development, like a real and proper news bulletin that is always in operation capable of reporting the mood of the citizens and the most visible problems like a litmus test. Big city, big problems When the size of the city will be increased the player will inevitably have to run into the typical problems of the great metropolis. Overcrowding and the overlapping of the antagonistic classes is only one of the aspects to be carefully evaluated for the good management of the urban centre. Pushing boundaries, for example, is one of the first things to keep in mind. Once certain objectives have been achieved, it is possible to purchase new plots of land adjacent to those already at our disposal. The arrival of national televisions, then, marks one of the first significant events in the expansion of the city. There are six specific broadcasters, one for each class, which will come to life from one of the homes already present in the city. The media buildings have helicopters that will begin to fly over the city in search of scoops to feed to a population increasingly hungry for news and gossip. It should be emphasized that the presence of the media in the city will give rise to a series of social tensions, just as happens in reality where televisions dominate the debates and political vicissitudes of a country. The media are one of the fundamental elements for the development of the city, a step that cannot be avoided, but the conflicts ch", "date": "2006-05-31", "grade": null}
