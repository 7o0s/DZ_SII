In any case, it is a very welcome return for those who, almost three years ago, appreciated the debut of the roguelike shooter developed by 17-Bit on PC and PS4, the protagonist of an experience that at the time really convinced everyone thanks to the ruthless hardcore and the many references to Japanese anime of the 80s; last but not least the presence of a spacecraft, the Galak-Z in fact, which could, if necessary, transform itself into a robot. This particular mechanism has unfortunately disappeared in the new episode, replaced by a system that allows you to choose one or the other configuration to face the missions of a campaign made up of seventeen sectors, characterized by an increasingly higher degree of challenge, in which our objective is to recover objects, eliminate enemies and leave the area. There are stages in which the choice between spacecraft or robot is imposed, but in most cases it is possible to proceed as we see fit, naturally paying attention to the damage that the vehicles have suffered in previous shipments, and which must eventually be repaired through the use of the virtual currency or waiting a few hours. Well, we are still talking about a freemium title, downloadable for free from the eShop, App Store and Google Play, and which therefore must obey certain rules in terms of monetization. Approach and challenge The abandonment of the transformation, which was a strategic element in the gameplay of the original Galak-Z: The Dimensional, leaves room for different but less consistent tactical choices. In fact, there remains a great emphasis on energy shields and their role within each fight, against the background of randomly generated scenarios but which sometimes inevitably end up looking alike. The more you go on, the more cunning, quick and resistant the enemies become, which leads you to face each duel carefully, launching yourself head-on only when you are sure of inflicting significant damage on the opponent on duty, as well as when the defenses are to the maximum and you therefore have the possibility of taking a few hits before the health indicator is actually scratched. However, the biggest threat in Galak-Z: Variant S and Mobile is represented by the inertial movement system, which makes it extraordinarily difficult to carry out otherwise mundane actions, such as simply chasing a hostile unit so that it can be destroyed, or hit the target with the lasers equipped by the spacecraft configuration. This aspect has therefore not changed and works hand in hand with all the other elements of the gameplay to build an experience that is also distinctly hardcore, so much so that it is easy to exchange the increase in difficulty that is experienced after completing the first two or three sectors with a paywall. But is this actually the case? For what is our experience with freemium productions, we can safely say that the 17-Bit title is difficult, at times inevitably frustrating, but it is an approach similar to what we had encountered on PC and PlayStation 4. Not we are therefore talking about a challenge deliberately made impossible, but rather about a curious mix that on Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android does not set time limits on use and therefore allows you to carry out all the grinding we want, reserving however the greatest rewards for short challenges that arise like an asynchronous multiplayer (in fact you go to invade another user's base) and that need a few hours to recharge, once completed successfully. Gameplay and outline How have Galak-Z's mechanics been adapted to work best on the Nintendo console and mobile devices? From the point of view of the interface, it is possible to use the touch screen to make navigation operations between the various menus, a bit obscure at first, much simpler and faster. There is the hangar where you can select the robot or spaceship configuration of your vehicle, a workshop where you can examine the loot (waiting for a few minutes or using hard currency to speed things up) in order to obtain fragments of equipment or tickets with which to purchase the prize boxes, the map of available missions, the list of unlocked achievements and related prizes, and finally the screen where it is possible to select and upgrade some droids (obtainable with lootboxes) which, once equipped, allow you to improve the attack, increase speed and more. The original upgrade system has been translated into this free-to-play version in the traditional wayional but interesting, also because obtaining new and more powerful weapons or extended health really requires a lot of effort and patience. Choosing to play with the robot or the spaceship implies a very different approach to the action: the former is equipped with a shield that he holds high in front of him, and hits enemies with a lightsaber, ergo he has to shorten the distances, with a special move that grabs an opponent and throws him towards a partner or a dangerous surface, such as a lava lake, an explosive or sharp object; the spacecraft instead uses a standard cannon that is effective from the medium length (but hitting the targets is more complicated), a shield that completely covers the vehicle and a special that launches some homing missiles. The control system changes according to the platform, but is in all cases well implemented: on Switch the reactors are activated using the triggers and attacks with the main buttons, while on mobile there are large keys to manage fire and reactors, the latter, however, mixed together between ~accelerator~ and ~brake~: a solution that in the most agitated battles can create some headaches, although the virtual stick on the left side of the touch screen is very precise and responsive, going to smooth out these edges. Little to say regarding the graphics: the procedural system invariably ends up making the scenarios a little repetitive, but otherwise the assets are practically the original ones and this makes us turn up our noses a bit, since we expected some news. The music is less brilliant than usual.", "date": "2018-07-18", "grade": "7.5"}
