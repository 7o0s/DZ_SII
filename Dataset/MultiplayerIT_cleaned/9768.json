Today, with the ever-increasing affirmation of the Apple platform as a gaming system, several contenders have appeared on the App Store with prominent names such as Pro Evolution Soccer, or real ~underdogs~ that came out by surprise such as the excellent X2 Football. It goes without saying therefore that if in the past the lack of alternatives could push towards a direction in a rather forced way, now instead the lovers of our national sport can allow themselves the luxury of choice; a fundamental element also to stimulate software houses to improve their products, so as to be able to earn a place in the sun. The first to take the field for this season is Gameloft, with its Real Football 2011. A kick in the past? Last year's episode wasn't exactly able to make its mark, due to numerous gameplay issues. For the 2011 chapter, the French house has therefore decided to roll up its sleeves, at least on paper; the list of new features is in fact quite substantial, starting from the renewed graphic design and reaching the available modes. Speaking of the technical component for example, the greater quantity of polygons on the screen is appreciable, up to 5 times higher than last year; an improvement that contributes above all to making the players less angular, even if the close-up shots still demonstrate the very little resemblance to the real counterparts and a general questionable quality in modeling. A reason of particular pride for Gameloft was instead the use of motion capture to give life to animations as realistic as possible; once on the field, however, one realizes that its implementation has not been the best, in the face of the fact that each player's input is put into practice only after the animation is over. An ingenuity that makes the control anything but reactive, if not woody, cumbersome and slow: a capital sin for a football title, which therefore confirms for Real Football 2011 most of the defects of the predecessor from this point of view. On the other hand, on the positive side there is the choice of delegating the release to a special button, thus giving this movement greater reliability; but conversely the unfortunate decision to associate the through ball, one of the fundamental moves for the construction of the actions, with the prolonged pressure of the B key (the same as the pass), subordinates its implementation to a slowness of execution that immediately appears frustrating as well as deleterious for the construction of elaborate actions. But what probably weighs more in the final judgment is the artificial intelligence of the CPU-controlled players, whether they are teammates or opponents; in all cases the reaction speed is really questionable, as well as more generally the ability to perform realistic or simply coherent and effective movements. Similarly the goalkeepers, almost always nailed to the center of the goal unable to make any hint of exit, do not give any kind of guarantee to the rear. On the other hand, a point in favor regarding the available modes, numerous and varied and ranging from friendlies to tournaments, championships, cups, and the more complex Club Master (in which you will have to play the role of the coach) and Enter the Legend ( where you assume command of only one player to grow). On the other hand, online multiplayer has been eliminated, an obligatory choice given the bad results obtained last year. Finally, the section linked to the Historical Challenges is pleasant, which takes up a concept born with the prehistoric International Superstar Soccer for Super Nintendo; in practice it is a question of entering into play in matches that have already begun and more or less seriously compromised, with the need therefore to overturn the result before the triple whistle. Turning instead to licenses, it is difficult not to be disappointed in the face of the great gaps in the agreements that Gameloft has managed to obtain; the club teams have neither names nor crests or official uniforms (and not even remotely similar), and even most of the players are fictional. For example, Juve is called Piedmont, Inter is Lombardy and Milan becomes Milan; and again, Barcelona have all complete strangers in their ranks, with the exception of the game's testimonial David Villa. This is because the FIFPro license allowed players to have Italian, French and English leagues, but not Spanish and German. The internal editor could allow the most willing to change the various names one by one, but frankly we believe it is a feat that few will have the will and the time to do. inchice down also for the sound, especially with the irritating and immediately deactivated English commentary.
