An extremely relative problem to tell the truth, considering how most of the users to whom the products related to the bespectacled wizard are addressed cannot properly be defined as a public with a refined palate. The important thing is therefore that this new Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is faithful to the original story and that it offers elements of interest to fans: let's see if EA has managed to achieve at least these two objectives. Postponed to September In the basic setting of the game, the developers of EA Bright Light have referred to what was experienced for the first time in the previous Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, thus offering users the opportunity to explore Hogwarts in total free-roaming: from technical point of view the digital transposition of the school of magic is remarkable, it is a pity that on a structural level the differences with the prequel are very minimal. Anyone who has been familiar with the fifth episode of the videogame series will therefore find themselves wandering through the exact same rooms, recognizing in the presence of the ghost of Nick-Almost-Headless (which can be called at will to indicate the direction towards the goal current) the only significant change. Right from the start, it is evident how the greatness of the setting has been exploited in the most wrong way possible: instead of filling Hogwarts with quests and sub-quests, the developers have preferred to dilute the playful experience with tons of boring backtracking and a cloying collectible component: hidden in various parts Throughout the academy there are various crests to collect, and any on-screen item that glows can be called with the Remote to award a set amount of mini-crests. In addition to being basically useless, this activity is far from being the least bit fun or engaging, even though it actually represents the only element of interaction with the game scenario. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince therefore does not carry out an excellent task from these points of view, and the situation does not improve at all if we look at the treatment of the plot: the events are mentioned in such a superficial and unrelated way as to be literally incomprehensible to anyone I haven't read the book of the same name carefully. Worse still, the cutscenes also suffer from very poor direction and a selection of mediocre and inexpressive voices to say the least, which are not by chance the ones responsible for dubbing the film. In short, even if you want to look exclusively at the fan service, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince does not represent a positive turning point for the series of dedicated video games. The prince seeks gameplay As for the play structure itself, the EA title is basically divided into three very different sections, connected by the tedious treks and the questionable cutscenes mentioned above. A very substantial part -unfortunately- is occupied by a subspecies of Cooking Mama in magic sauce, in which our Harry must successfully make the required potions by carefully dosing the various components: an idea that is also interesting on paper, and which makes good use of motion sensor of the Remote, but which takes the form of something extremely tedious and repetitive. It's better when playing Quidditch, even if the action has been deliberately reduced to the bone: all the user has to do during the games is move the broom guided by Harry using the Remote, trying to pass through as many circles as possible until you reach the coveted flying snitch. The roundup closes with a section based on duels with spells, in which the user has a handful of spells available to cast by performing certain moves with Remote and Nunchuck: the idea is good, but the transposition into playful terms is not as good. given the limitation of the entire structure. The spells are few and the artificial intelligence of the opponents is decidedly poor, to the point that it is possible to easily win each challenge starting with a powerful blow and then storming the unfortunate person with quick attacks while he is on the ground. It's a pity that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince misses the target on the key elements of its gameplay, because on a purely technical level the EA Bright Light work is more than decent, considering the Wii standards. The environments are vast and detailed, sirgoverned by a graphics engine that sometimes hiccups a bit, but which still performs its duty very well. The polygonal models of the characters are then sufficiently cared for and well animated, except for the unfortunate cutscenes which end up highlighting only the most negative aspects, such as the poor facial expression. Beyond the cheap Italian dubbing, the sound is also good, particularly with regard to the musical accompaniment that punctuates the on-screen action well. Finally, the developers were good at exploiting the characteristics of the Wii control system well, adequately dosing the moments when it is necessary to make use of the motion sensor and those reserved for the analog stick and conventional keys.", "date": "2009-07-09", "grade": "6.2"}
