Commercial implications aside, it is obviously a great pleasure to be able to get your hands on a classic of the genre using an iOS and Android device, all the more so thanks to a very affordable price (just 3.49 euros) and, last but not least, support for Bluetooth controllers, which makes up for some fairly obvious shortcomings of the touch controls implemented for the occasion. In fact, there is a rather clear qualitative distinction between the use of the game on the go, using the touch screen, and the use of the same in a home context, perhaps by placing an iPad on a support surface and using a controller for Xbox One to pilot Alucard, the supernatural warrior protagonist of the adventure. The touch controls are, let's say, of the ~old generation~: fixed and non-repositionable virtual d-pad, buttons that are quite small and close together on the right side of the screen, all without any options to customize the layout. The inevitable result is the lack of the necessary precision in various phases, in particular the fights that require the execution of shots in mid-air, and therefore the concrete possibility of running into frustrating unjustified game overs. The diametrically opposite is the case if a controller is used: even in this case there are no options, but you play almost perfectly. An element to take into due consideration before purchasing. Gameplay and structure Castlevania: Symphony of the Night welcomes us with a cutscene that definitely feels the weight of the years and that Konami hasn't bothered to refresh for the occasion; after which the action immediately starts, which opens with the final boss fight of the previous episode (dutifully rounded off in terms of difficulty) to provide a narrative recap and better frame what happens next, with Alucard's debut and his meeting with Death in Dracula's castle, when the character is stripped of his abilities and therefore finds himself having to face the infernal monsters starting over his growth path. If you are familiar with the term metroidvania, you probably know that the word derives from this work by Koji Igarashi, which represents the dark manor of the Prince of Darkness as a maze of corridors and towers manned by skeletons, zombies and other demonic creatures. or less threatening. The unlocking of new skills and items to equip allows you to move towards previously inaccessible areas, thus facing new opponents and striding the distance that separates us from the final showdown with our nemesis. Well, these mechanics have practically not aged: the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night experience is also confirmed on solid, compelling and demanding mobile, but at the same time capable of creating a welcome bridge with modern productions by adopting a more permissive approach from the point of view from the point of view of the checkpoints, specifically allowing us to resume the game exactly from where we had interrupted it in the event of a game over rather than returning to the last save point and therefore forcing us to repeat different sections. The technical sector also holds a punch, characterized by a design full of personality and ideas with a great visual impact, without losing sight of the stylistic tradition of the franchise, as well as the practical utility of certain choices (see the ubiquitous candelabra). Here too, however, we note a somewhat sloppy adaptation work, see the unpresentable game over screen (the pixels are so large that it is difficult to read the writing) but above all the lack of extra graphic options, which would have been appreciable although playing with two black side bands at the end of the day is not a drama. Instead, the localization of the texts in Italian is excellent.", "date": "2020-03-09", "grade": "8.5"}
