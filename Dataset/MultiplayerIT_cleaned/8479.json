Touch devices lend themselves particularly well to this sub-genre of RTS, given the type of interface, but today we feel the need for a pinch of originality to win the interest of a population of enthusiasts who have now seen everything. Defender Chronicles II: Heroes of Athelia responds to this type of need? We say yes, or at least partially succeeds. Developed by Gimka Entertainment, the game takes up the structure of the first episode and therefore sees us take on the role of a general who has the task of defending a series of territories by preventing enemy armies from passing. Each scenario presents itself with a series of interconnected ~floors~, which soon become crowded with hostile troops intent on overcoming our blockade and in particular the commander's post. In fact, if a certain number of enemies manage to evade our surveillance and ~leave the screen~, it will be game over. Therefore, it is better to organize yourself well, trying to understand what type of path the attackers will follow and, above all, what type of unit they will use for their attack. As long as the clash takes place on the ground, in fact, our standard knights, suitably enhanced, will be able to have their say and create an impassable wall. In the presence of flying enemies, however, all the responsibility will fall into the hands of archers and units expert in ranged attacks, who will have to target dragons and evil birds to the best of their ability. You will not pass! The gameplay of Defender Chronicles II: Heroes of Athelia is practically unchanged from its origins, and therefore offers a mix of immediacy and depth. Within each scenario there are icons that indicate our potential locations: just touch them once to bring up a menu with the list of available units, then select one of these and touch the icon again to create a ~station dedicated to resistance. The cost of each unit varies and gold coins are earned by eliminating enemies, so when the battle becomes more intense, our possibilities of creating new stations or enhancing existing ones will likewise increase. The upgrade operation is similar to that of creation: just touch an outpost, select the update and touch it again, after which it will take a few moments for the modification to be operational and our units capable of suffering more hits and attacking with greater effectiveness. The completion of each stage implies the total annihilation of the enemy troops, and in the more advanced levels this can also translate into a considerable duration of the battle. To overcome this inconvenience, as well as to eliminate any downtime between one wave and another, we are given the opportunity to activate the fast forward of the action. Furthermore, between one mission and another, we will be able to access a menu and use the experience points earned to upgrade our general, improving skills that will also and above all reflect on the efficiency of the various units. In the end, these aspects are what constitute the novelties of Defender Chronicles II: Heroes of Athelia, not substantial but interesting. On the other hand, it is a pity that great strides have not been made in terms of technical implementation: the game displays hundreds of two-dimensional sprites on the screen, whose animations however leave much to be desired and constitute, in fact, the least brilliant part of the Menara Games production.", "date": "2012-06-25", "grade": "8.0"}
