This is the case of Dynasty Warriors, a franchise that has been copying itself for twelve years now (from the second episode, considering that the first for PSone was a fighting game) and has produced a certain number of spin-offs in which the protagonists fundamentally change but not the formula, which is that of third-person action games and which sees this group of powerful warriors stand out over the average of soldiers who populate the battlefield; leaders capable of wiping out dozens of opponents with a single gaseous emission, not to mention when they take up the sword. On the showfloor of the last Tokyo Game Show there were a lot of people lining up to try the new episode of Tecmo Koei product for PlayStation 3, not to mention the incredible success obtained by One Piece: Pirate Warriors, even if in that case to sell was the license of the manga created by Eiichiro Oda more than anything else. In short, the gameplay of Dynasty Warriors does not seem to have bored Japanese gamers or the numerous Western fans of the series, enthusiastic about trying each time with the same war for the unification of imperial China. For the launch of PlayStation Vita, therefore, it was decided to create a new portable version of the game, capable of exploiting the technical capabilities of the Sony handheld not only in terms of mere graphics, but also by bringing into play a touch screen, rear touch pad and gyroscope; devices that are called into question quite frequently during fights, sometimes with leading roles. The Path of Remorse Dynasty Warriors Next's single-player campaign sees you take on the role of various warriors in the context of the same war, rather than just having to choose one faction and work with it until the final confrontation. The game plot unfolds through a series of cutscenes between one mission and another, after which only the fury of our blows will speak: we will be able to choose a region to assault with our troops, eventually decide whether to implement a ~ploy~ ( which translates into the activation of some upgrades for the characters) and finally select the leader we will control, as well as those who will be his ~generals~ on the field. In short, as mentioned, nothing new under the sun. The map of each location highlights the positions that we can make our own simply by eliminating all the units that guard them, positions which, depending on the type, can provide us with further help (by enhancing our offensive capacity or that of our allies, for example). In most cases the mission ends successfully when we conquer the enemy base, but that doesn't mean we can rush headlong towards it ignoring everything else. Indeed, our opponents could send groups of soldiers to take over our base, which would result in a game over. The best strategy is therefore to take all the necessary time, conquer every single position and only then close the games by defeating the last outbreaks of resistance. The seven strokes of the death knight One of the historical limitations of Dynasty Warriors lies in the fact that our character has to face entire hostile armies with a rather small number of moves available; which translates, in most cases, into a very repetitive experience, in which the possibility of performing special moves is greeted with particular enthusiasm not for the value of the attack itself, but for the possibility of breaking for a moment the monotony of basic combos. Once the appropriate bar has been filled, therefore, we will be able to perform a devastating supermove that changes from character to character and calls into question the touch screen or the rear touch pad for its practical execution: in the first case we are asked to ~draw~ with the fingers of mega-slashes able to wipe out dozens of opponents or to compose ~circles~ that allow our warrior to swirl sword in hand, in the second case to ~drum~ the lower part of PlayStation Vita to cause powerful jolts in the ground. The idea is nice and works well, but the developers of Omega Force wanted to do more, also inserting a series of minigames that occur during the missions and which see us hit enemies trying to ambush them in mid-air ( by touching them on the screen after framing them by moving the console), deflecting the arrows of archers stationed to treacherously skewer us (always using the touch screen) and once again try your hand at a sort of obstacle course on horseback, probably the least successful variation on the theme due to controls are not enoughza precise and reactive. Furthermore, when our character comes into contact with a general of the enemy troops, an Infinity Blade-style duel automatically starts which, however, is governed by less sophisticated dynamics than in the Chair mobile game. In this case it is not possible to parry the opponent's blows and the only way to defend oneself is to get the timing of certain moves right, to then sink a series of hits without mercy. PSVita trophies There are forty-nine Trophies contained in Dynasty Warriors Next, and also in this case their obtaining is subject to a mix of more or less complicated tasks. Trophies that are unlocked simply by completing levels are the easiest to add to your collection, but there are others that are decidedly more difficult, such as those that involve eliminating a thousand or more enemies in a single battle, completing combos from five hundred hits or the collection of all available items. Violent hand wave! The minigames based on the touch screen and the gyroscope can be played individually by accessing a special mode from the main screen, but fortunately they are not the only extra offered by Dynasty Warriors Next in addition to the single player campaign. In fact, it is possible to play in four of the cooperative missions (unfortunately only locally), as well as face a sort of ~synthetic~ version of the aforementioned campaign, in which it is possible to choose one's faction from the start and wage war on the others. On the technical front, the game derives from the last episodes released on PlayStation 3 and therefore boasts detailed graphics, with a good design and a good set of animations for the characters, spectacular sequences as regards the special moves and scenarios that succeed in the arduous feat of not being particularly desolate, given the absence of any interactable element whatsoever. Unfortunately there are also some big flaws, above all the scary ~pop-up~ effect that renders enemy troops on the screen only when we are at a very short distance from them. In practice, a situation often occurs in which it seems that there is absolutely nobody around our character, but taking a few steps forward, things change drastically. The sound is discreet, with intense and heartfelt interpretations (in English) but few acute notes when it comes to music and effects.", "date": "2012-03-21", "grade": "7.2"}
