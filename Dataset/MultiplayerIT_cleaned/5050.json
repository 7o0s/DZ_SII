{"name": "Best for business?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/179920-wwe-2k17-best-for-business.html", "text": "In the review of the console version, we wondered if Yuke's choice to pursue the path of slow and strategic ~simulation~ for WWE 2K17 was sensible, in the face of what seemed like a hemorrhage in sales for the franchise compared to the episode in which there was the substantial graphic boost, in conjunction with the arrival on the new generation platforms. Well, according to the results of the first four months, about a million copies are missing to even the accounts with what WWE 2K16 has totaled; and it is possible to see in this perspective the sudden desire to bring the game back to PC but to do it in an at least questionable way, i.e. without including the DLCs in the package as happened instead for the previous edition and indeed asking for the separate purchase of the Season Pass or directly from Digital Deluxe to be able to enjoy these extras. The presence of Goldberg, who on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One was a bonus reserved for pre-orders, is naturally not enough to fill this void from the point of view of the relationship between sales price and content, but above all it is the reluctance of a conversion that does not has trouble ignoring the big news that has taken place in WWE in recent months to leave you perplexed, given that a few tricks here and there would have been enough to bring an at least updated edition of the game to the Windows platform in terms of roster and brand. The PC version of WWE 2K17 comes out of time for a variety of reasons Work or shoot? As mentioned at the beginning, the gameplay of WWE 2K17 pursues the simulation ambitions that have characterized the series in recent years, transforming it into something substantially different from the simple but coherent button mashing of the very first editions, much more oriented towards strategy and rhythms that are anything but. what a lock. The key lies in the reversals, entrusted to the right trigger of the controller: when an opponent is about to hit us, grab us or execute a move, pressing that button at the right moment allows you to free yourself and react, taking back the reins of the match. Unfortunately Yuke's made two mistakes in this regard: the first was to make the timing too ruthless, because just pressing the button a moment before or a moment after makes the maneuver useless; the second was to entrust this function to a trigger, which systematically takes longer than a normal key to travel its course and therefore transmit the input. The result of such an approach does not materialize simply in the possibility of accepting a defeat, but in something worse: a monstrous static nature of the action, in which we remain powerless to observe the adversary who beats us down, subjects us to moves of submission and whatnot, without even being able to get up. And while on the one hand the simulative character ensures the emergence of surprising situations, such as for example a manager who interferes in the pin, a wrestler who decides to leave and lose by count out or even our nemesis of the moment who bursts in during a match to knock us down and send a clear message from the point of view of a feud, on the other hand a rule of simple common sense is broken when the enemy becomes the protagonist of a comeback immediately after cashing in a finisher, i.e. when he should have no more energy to move. To this we must add a very evident underlying cumbersomeness and various situations that leave us perplexed: the moves performed near the strings that go to a brango, the bad submission system based on the rotation of the analog (fortunately switchable in a sort of quick time with the main keys) and a real avalanche of more or less serious glitches to make the experience heavy and unpleasant. The handling of situations in which you find yourself dealing with multiple opponents at the same time has been improved, such as the triple threat or the Royal Rumble itself, but these are a few drops in the bucket compared to a facility that appears more and more closed in on itself and which should undoubtedly be reinvented. Also from a technical point of view: the presence of some faithfully reproduced superstars clashes with other less well-finished ones, while on the female roster front there has been a clear improvement in the models but many elements are still ruthlessly old-gen, primarily the hair. In general, the graphics appear flat, the effects are scarce and badly used, but all this does not produce incredible performances on PC: the test configuration allowed us to play even at real 4K, however being satisfied with 30 frames per second or less in the case of three or more superstars in the ring. The situation at 1440p is much better, with the game maintaining the 60 stab framesili with the only exception of the entry sequences, perhaps for some reason stuck at 30 frames per second. Feel the power In terms of content, WWE 2K17 consolidates the offer of the previous editions as regards the two main modes, the Career and the WWE Universe. The first will see us literally starting from scratch, with a wrestler created for the occasion and an audition at the Orlando Performance Center, to then fight in the NXT shows, gradually gaining the popularity necessary to debut on the main roster and from there aim higher and higher. It is at this juncture that one of the novelties of this edition finds space, namely the possibility of trying your hand at promos through a simple mini-game in which you have to intercept the moods of the public and put together sentences to be pronounced in favor of the camera. However, the quality of the script leaves something to be desired, and the fact that all the dialogues are only textual and not spoken takes away much of the charm of this feature. The WWE Universe, on the other hand, is confirmed as a ~total~ mode, in which we can control every single aspect of the shows and decide to play the matches in person, assist them or let them be simulated quickly. The possibilities for customizing the various aspects of the experience are manifold, and go hand in hand with the contents of the editor, never so complete, which allows you to create and share your own superstars by modifying them in all respects, assigning them a set of moves , an entrance, an accompanying video and even animations related to the victory. In the face of the efforts made from the point of view of completeness, the lack of Showcase mode, the story mode which in previous editions even offered different storylines and which in WWE 2K16 saw us retrace the career of ~Stone Cold~ Steve Austin, is striking. An incomprehensible choice, given that in this way one of the most accessible elements of the franchise is eliminated, the mode on which the novices aimed to familiarize themselves with the gameplay of the game and then delve into its facets by dedicating themselves to the rest of the offer. There is also an online sector that allows you to challenge other users or participate in special events, but it is not surprising that during our tests it was almost completely deserted: considering the central role of the reversal and the precision required in terms of timing, it that a little lag is enough to decisively pilot the progress of a match in favor of one or the other contender.", "date": "2017-02-15", "grade": "6.5"}
