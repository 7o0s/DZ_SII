The plot is actually not particularly original or appetizing, on the contrary: the protagonist is a certain Rick Wheeler, a detective hibernated after an accident at work in 2051 and awakened 150 years later by the Galactic Mobile Platoon, a mysterious police unit responsible for controlling and overseeing the regularity of F-Zero tournament competitions. However, Zoda, or the main architect of the above incident, was also awakened together with Rick; obviously the good Wheeler, having discovered this, does not think twice before joining the ranks of the Galactic Mobile Platoon to hunt down his archenemy. These premises are developed in the Story mode, in which it is possible to take on the role of 8 different characters and face a handful of races with varied objectives. The unfolding of the events is the same in each case, but using one pilot rather than another allows you to observe its point of view and obtain more details on the script. The reality the story mode does not represent a particular reason of interest: the events are in fact rather trivial and boring and, above all, the races turn out to be all too easy and short in most cases. Adding to this the impossibility of modifying the settings of the shuttle before competitions, it is easy to understand how the attention for this option is destined to end soon. Much closer to ~tradition~ is the Grand Prix section which can be tackled in the Beginner, Standard and Expert difficulty levels and consists of Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum cups. In this case the situation becomes much more interesting, with as many as 30 pilots on the track and a certainly more consistent level of difficulty, even if never unassailable, in addition to the indispensable personalization of the spacecraft. Lastly, the Test Zero mode closes the picture by offering a further challenge for fans of the series: in extreme synthesis, it is a question of tackling more or less short stretches of track in the shortest possible time, in order to obtain a bronze, silver or gold. Something similar to the Gran Turismo licenses, to be clear, transported into the world of F-Zero. The sympathy of the airbrake From the point of view of playability, F-Zero GP Legend takes a step back from the innovations introduced by the first episode for GBA: in particular, the use of the side buttons for the air brakes regains value in the game economy, even if the strategy some ~tapping~ on the accelerator key is still present and usable. As far as boost management is concerned, however, the programmers have decided to align themselves with what was seen in the Gamecube chapter, thus allowing you to give vent to all the extra speed you want - from the second lap onwards - provided you keep an eye on the energy of the shuttle from which it draws. The graphic side, on the other hand, does not leave you particularly surprised, broadly aligning with what has already been seen previously in the two-dimensional chapters of the series. However, the impeccable use of Mode-7 must certainly be praised, as well as obviously a more general ~style~ that is absolutely excellent and has always characterized the world of F-Zero. The track design is also very good and extremely varied, which can make use of the usual dose of different settings in which to compete. Comment F-Zero GP Legend is certainly not intended to surprise or revolutionize the world of video games, but this was certainly not its intent. On the contrary, the latest episode of the beloved Nintendo series finds its perfect place within the GBA soft library, establishing itself in a genre, that of racing games, certainly not particularly rich in important productions. Without a doubt the feeling of deja-vu will not fail to be felt by those who have played the previous episodes, and equally certainly one cannot help but notice some more or less negligible defects such as the lack of attractiveness of the Story mode or the not particularly challenging challenge level. But all in all F-Zero GP Legend is indisputably a good value title, superior to Maximum Velocity in every field, and therefore worthy of great consideration. The episode on Gamecube and, even earlier, the one for Nintendo 64, introduced the glorious F-Zero saga to the world of the shooting range, with certainly excellent results. Nonetheless, the marked predisposition of the Game Boy Advance for 2D allowed a parallel development of the franchise, extremely close to the original and beloved debut on Super NES.", "date": "2004-06-25", "grade": null}
