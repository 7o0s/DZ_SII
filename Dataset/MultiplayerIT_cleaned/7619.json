And since the three chapters are but artificial pieces of a single game, Ancestry of Lies begins without preamble with Zellner tied to a chair and chloroformed. The blurring effect caused by the chemical is rendered very well due to the blurring of the image and the range of colors shifting from red to blue. Once he's out of the way, Zellner will tell a shocked and distrustful crew, especially Inspector Nicolas Lagrand, what he discovered and how he got into trouble. It would have made more sense to start the second episode from here and insert the capture scene in the first chapter, an error that is also repeated at the end of Ancestry of Lies, a sign that the developers have had difficulty keeping up with production times. In any case, it only takes a few minutes to get back on track, ready to start a new episode. Unfortunately Ancestry of Lies disappoints the excellent expectations of the first The Eye of the Sphinx, only partially exploiting the best features of the game, from the superb voice acting to the splendid cast of characters, which had offered us moments of passionate interaction in the first phase. Furthermore, this second chapter covers a stretch of history that is too short, with few scenarios to explore and people involved. On the other hand, the plot becomes dense and mysterious, the second playable character - this time on the side of the ~bad guys~ - is pleasantly intriguing, even if he dwarfs in comparison with Zellner, and many of the initial questions are explained to us, albeit with some small inconsistencies . Maybe the game takes a breather for the last act, which we imagine will be much longer, but for now we have to stick to what we already have in front of us, reluctantly noting that the flaws outweigh the merits. Anyway, it was said about Cairo... The central act of The Raven loses its edge, but thickens the plot and puts us in the role of the ~bad guy~ The sum of the parts In the original intentions of the developers The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief was to be released all at once and not in three parts. For this reason the judgment is still partial. Only when we have played the entire adventure will we be able to make an assessment that will apply to all three chapters overall. Mask off The beginning on board the ship serves only to find the threads of what happened up to that moment, but it is in the Egyptian museum in Cairo that Zellner will have to prove his deductive skills again. The museum is an ideal place for an adventure and the majesty of the rooms is very well rendered, even if at the expense of the details. Very few rooms can be visited, and among these only one is full of objects and descriptions. Unfortunately, as we said, the dialogues become much more sporadic and the number of characters with whom to interact decreases. The few conversations keep the subplots going but feel a bit scattered and less focused on the action, since everyone is just waiting for the Raven to make his move. The dramatic center of this phase is in fact the case with the jewel inside, which, as expected, will end up in the hands of the thief. To tell the truth, for a master of theft known for his skill, the shot turns out to be too incomplete, so much so as to allow Zellner to trap him and reveal his identity without too much effort - the worst was enduring the copious exchange of jokes with the silly English policeman. So either this is not the real Crow, or the identity of Legrand's archenemy turns out to be somewhat disappointing, also due to the anticlimactic way in which it was revealed. Furthermore, he is such a petty and treacherous villain that any empathetic link is impossible. Different speech for his assistant who, to our surprise, will be the second playable character of the adventure. In fact, from now on we will return on board the train and then the ship to find out how our petty thief had acted. The sensations, in this case, are conflicting: on the one hand we have to revisit environments in which we have already passed, and moreover in an episode that lasts a maximum of two hours, on the other hand the need to move stealthily is a change of pace refreshing, although it precludes the pleasure of the dialogues, the strong point of the game. At least let's get back to solving some puzzles, since the section as Zellner has only one obstacle towards the end, which, due to its importance in the game, should have required a slightly less obvious solution also in the game. Zellner's world. To break a spear in favor of Ancestry of Lies we must admit that the short passage in the role of the Crow's helper has fleshed out the plot a lot. What are his real motivations? What is the link between him and another character who had gone almost unnoticed in the first chapter? These are just some of the questions that will have to be answered in the third episode, hoping that it will make us forget the mediocre interlude in the meantime.", "date": "2013-09-17", "grade": "6.3"}
