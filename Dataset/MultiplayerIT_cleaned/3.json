The reason for the choice of this name by the company lies in the stubborn nature of the seedling, capable of growing and adapting to various types of environments: they may be small at first, but later the shoots will become large and robust plants, able to make a significant contribution to the place where they are. In fact, Toge Productions has managed to make its way into the undergrowth of Indonesian independent development and make a significant contribution to the country's studios through targeted funding programs, as well as publishing high-profile works (this year A Space for the Unbound by Mojiken) and create video games appreciated by audiences and critics, including the first Coffee Talk. Just like A Space for the Unbound, Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is also dedicated to the memory of a very special person: Mohammad Fahmi, creator of the Coffee Talk concept and its developer while working for Toge Productions. Passed away at the end of March 2022, he was only 32 years old; in the last period of his life he had dedicated himself to founding his own development studio, Pikselnesia, and had worked on What Comes After and Afterlove EP. It is comforting to know that his legacy continues to be celebrated even in the sequel to the most famous video game to which he contributed, a product that continues along the path traced by its predecessor, but manages to have a greater focus on the topics covered. We talk about it in detail in our review of Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly. Reality and fantasy In Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly, already known characters return, flanked by some new entries who often do not get the space they deserve Seattle, 2023, a rainy September evening. Like every day, the owner of Coffee Talk is preparing to open his caf. It's a familiar beginning for those who loved the first Coffee Talk, released in 2020, when the pandemic was still at its peak and many were looking for warm and comforting gaming experiences. Toge Productions has provided exactly that: a safe virtual space, immersed in lo-fi music perfect for relaxing and listening to the chatter of the very particular patrons. Yes, because this videogame Seattle suffers from the same problems as our world - racism, overtime, abuse, pollution - but it is inhabited by a lively tangle of humans, banshees, vampires, werewolves, ogres and so on. The presence of fantasy creatures offers developers an excellent hook to tackle even very thorny issues in a not too heavy way, such as illegal immigration, lack of job opportunities for war veterans, sexism and depression. The comings and goings of customers is continuous and gives rise to friendships, advice and contrasts between them and the bartender, with some small narrative ramifications. Junkipatchi and Anna Winstestein's writing lacks a bit of bite in the initial part, to then build on the criticisms of those who had found the first Coffee Talk too distracting: here the main themes are the impact of social networks on human relationships and the The importance of having authentic personal contacts, valuing relationships in a key that does not necessarily rest on traditional conventions. The cast of characters from the previous episode - the policeman Jorji, the werewolf Gala, the vampire Hyde - make a welcome return, perhaps in an all too invasive way, ~cannibalizing~ the new entries, who don't always get the space they deserve. In this regard, it is a pity that for many characters in the first chapter there has been a certain laziness in the design, often not renewed, albeit with some commendable exceptions; the glance of Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is still excellent and well built, even from a chromatic point of view. Over the five hours needed to complete the adventure, we appreciated the relaxed tone of the narrative: although it sometimes expires in some clichs, Toge Productions manages to keep a good pace and successfully accompany the player up to the titles tail. Shy news on the gameplay front In Coffee Talk 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly there is no shortage of comic moments, and the tone of the narration, in general, never becomes dramatic, allowing at most some space for melancholy Every working evening always opens in the same way, i.e. with the reading of the front page of the newspaper The Evening Whispers, which often anticipates some of the topics that will be covered by the patrons during their chats. In addition to preparing the required drinks - sometimes with express indication degingredients, other times with the need to engage a little more with the imagination - in this second chapter the mechanics of delivering objects of various kinds via the tray have been added. The impact of any mistakes or oversights is minimal: forgetting to deliver an invitation will not cause the guest to miss out on an important party, and this lack of incisiveness proves, at times, to be a bit of a shame. options present on Tomodachhill, a social network installed on our bartender's phone from which we can not only consult the profiles of our customers (whose information will be revealed as our friendship grows), but also read their status and see the photos they have posted. You can also read the news from The Evening Whispers or change the music played in the bar via Shuffle. Interaction with its interface is very comfortable via the Nintendo Switch touch screen, which proves to be the platform of choice for relaxed experiences of this type. The drink preparation interface is almost unchanged from the first installment of the series, but some new ingredients and possible mixes have been added They're small touches, sure, but don't forget that the main focus of the Coffee Talk series lies in listening to customer stories. If you want to delve into the mechanics of preparing drinks, in the Endless mode you can access the Free Brew (in which all the desired drinks are prepared, without time limits) or the Challenge Mode (where you have to satisfy the greatest possible number of requests in a limited time). We point out the absence of an Italian translation; the texts in English are excellent, and the small spelling errors that characterized, albeit minimally, the dialogues of the first Coffee Talk are absent. The lo-fi soundtrack is excellent for building the atmosphere of a safe and welcoming bar, and some of the tracks from the first chapter return in nice remixed versions.", "date": "2023-04-19", "grade": "7.0"}
