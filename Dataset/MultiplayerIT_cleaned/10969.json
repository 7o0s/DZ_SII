{"name": "Hero of Sparta (iPhone)", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hero-of-sparta-iphone.html", "text": "After the half misstep with Brothers in Arms: Hour of Heroes (penalized by an absolutely unreliable control system), it can certainly be said that the French software house has got back on track with this Hero of Sparta, but at the same time we can already anticipate how the title is absolutely not the masterpiece that someone expected. The game has the Spartan warrior Argos as its protagonist, in search of a way home after waking up on the beaches of a mysterious island populated by monsters of all kinds: the plot is the most slender and banal imaginable, but at least Gameloft has efforts to keep him alive thanks to frequent cutscenes of good level. The odyssey of Argos develops over eight levels that offer space for exploration, but whose leitmotif is basically reduced to fights with the various enemies: however, everything is supported by a good control system, consisting of a stick virtual analog in the lower left corner of the screen and by two keys on the other side, delegated respectively to attack and defense. We therefore move within the various settings by moving from one group of enemies to another, toying in the meantime with the collection of orbs and various bonuses and with some timid platform sections. Unfortunately, a bad defect of Hero of Sparta is the total lack of originality, which makes every single passage of the adventure capable of instilling in the user the feeling of ~already seen~. As mentioned, the title is literally a cross between 300 and God of War, in the sense that it takes the look of the protagonist and some enemies from the film and almost all gameplay elements from the Sony videogame series. There are therefore red orbs to collect and spend to upgrade your weapons, magical powers to use in battle and even choreographic quick time events thanks to which you can finish off your opponent with a violent coup de grace: for the latter, obviously, it has been exploited the iPhone touchscreen, thus delegating the user to press the indicators that appear on the screen in time. Evidently too focused on copying the characteristics of Kratos' adventures word for word, however, the developers ended up glossing over some ingenuity that end up debasing the overall value of the product. First of all, the camera is almost always positioned too far from the action, making it difficult to distinguish Argos from the enemies and all the more to dodge their attacks: this often results in dramatic -and inevitable- energy losses, but ~fortunately~ the level of difficulty it is so low that the problem does not result in excessive frustration for the user. Furthermore, although the graphics of Hero of Sparta are of undoubted value (excellent in particular the realization of the main hero, well defined and really well animated), the frame rate is decidedly dancer, with annoying slowdowns not only from an aesthetic point of view , as they prevent player inputs from quickly translating into actions. A future update already promised by Gameloft should finally fix the sound, which is currently rather depressing due to mediocre effects and a few continuous looping music.
