{"name": "Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/syphon-filter-logans-shadow-recensione.html", "text": "Siphon Filter seems to have found its ideal dimension on PSP with the excellent Dark Mirror, and now it tries to overcome its limits with a new and exciting episode. In it we find all the characters of the series starting from the protagonist, Gabe, always fit and ready to face a new terrorist threat even though he is no longer a kid. The plot of Logan's Shadow has a large number of twists in store, so there is no need to reveal anything ... except that things are not always what they seem. In this case, what gives the impression of being a very linear story will be enriched by numerous unpublished elements, which cast a shadow on agent Logan's closest collaborators. Training first Before starting the story mode, we'll have to go through a short training session to familiarize ourselves with the game's control system. Guided by Teresa's voice guide, we will understand how to carry out the various movements, use weapons and plan a flying attack strategy. We will also be explained how to attack enemies silently, as well as how to behave in the water... The end of the Agency? The start screen of Siphon Filter: Logan's Shadow allows you to access the single game and multiplayer (see box). The first includes the story mode, as well as the ability to replay missions already completed and to check the level of completion of the same based on the number of secret objects collected. Once the story mode is selected, we will see a series of good quality animated sequences that introduce us to this new adventure, after which we will move on to the real action, with the task of achieving a certain number of objectives within each stage . It is clear that the terrorists will not allow us to wander around the locations without problems, therefore we will have at our disposal the usual boundless arsenal to eliminate enemies from short and long distances. One of the peculiar characteristics of Siphon Filter has always been the stealth action, i.e. the possibility of knocking down opponents silently, without being noticed, to avoid the arrival of reinforcements. From this point of view, Logan's Shadow gives us full freedom of choice: we can advance discreetly towards an unsuspecting enemy, take him from behind and kill him without making a noise (or even carry him around to use him as a shield...), or hit him on the head with a silenced weapon, but also launch the attack without problems and with a machine gun drawn, using the numerous shelters that allow you to manage each firefight in the best way. The trend of minigames As in many recent video games, even in this new Siphon Filter we will have to deal with short skill tests, which are revealed in the pressure of certain buttons where required. This type of situation occurs when we want to eliminate an opponent with our bare hands, taking him from behind, but above all when we have to interact with the numerous devices present in each stage. My strategic plan, thank you As a good action game, the new chapter of Siphon Filter does not skimp on fights and indeed offers them in large quantities, allowing us to choose the approach we prefer to solve them. In each stage we will find numerous elements of the scenario that can shelter us in the presence of enemies: by pressing twice in the direction of an object with the analog stick, Gabe will lean against it with his back and will be able to move from one extreme to the other to take the aim. The control system provides by default the use of the main buttons of the PSP (Triangle, Square, X and Circle) to move the viewfinder, therefore while we are taking cover we can at the same time take aim and only then shoot (back key R), perhaps hitting the enemy between the eyes and closing the dispute in seconds. But we can also shoot ~blindly~, perhaps to make the opponent nervous and push him to move. The crosshair is always present on the screen and regulates the character's view, with the four buttons acting practically like a right analog stick, and therefore it is always possible to direct one's shots in a rather precise way, hitting opponents on the head (especially if are equipped with bulletproof vests) or legs (if they also have a protective helmet). By pressing the backbone L you enter a first-person mode that makes the shots even more precise, and which above all using the sniper rifle allows us to get rid of the bad guys even when they are at a great distance. The special bullets are the same as seen in Dark Mirror: an electrified dart (which actually replaces the old taser), an explosive bullet and one that releases poisonous gas. The systemThe combat theme works really well and excels in terms of precision, with the only flaw of being too slow and cumbersome for comparisons at very short distances: moving the aim is too slow an operation to hit an enemy who is in the middle meter away from us, it takes at least a second to do it and at that point we'll already be stone dead for a while... If in the past we had to pay close attention to Gabe's energy bar, in Logan's Shadow the developers have opted for a more al step with the times: our character's health regenerates automatically, just take cover for a while and avoid taking hits. For a greater degree of resistance, however, we will always have the possibility of wearing the bulletproof vests that we will find in the usual boxes, often also full of ammunition and possibly additional weapons. We will be able to carry a total of four weapons (one for each category) plus grenades, and equip one after pressing the d-pad to the right. By pressing the d-pad to the left, however, we will be able to select one of the special viewers (thermal, night and ~technical~) or use the flashlight. Multiplayer, what a passion! Logan's Shadow features an online multiplayer game mode that allows you to try your hand at five different types of game, within seven settings. We will be able to participate in the classic deathmatches or in the variants of the ~capture the flag~, also accessing aquatic stages, and the system will take care of balancing the teams according to the ability of the individuals (a bit like what happens in Call of Duty 4 ), for up to eight players. Technical realization This latest adventure from Gabriel Logan definitely boasts of quite an eye-catcher. The graphics make use of polygonal models already used in the past, but rather detailed and equipped with convincing animations. The scenarios are well done, with a large number of elements on the screen and without any glitches in the rendering of the polygons. The animated sequences are excellent and in general the direction, even during the actual game, is characterized by very valid choices. Some phases of the game take place in the water, rendered really well both in terms of visual impact and in terms of physics. The only defects are represented by the low definition of many textures (unfortunately a distinctive feature of the PSP) and by a frame rate that reaches very high peaks but which occasionally gives way to some uncertainty. The sound sector is really excellent: the game is completely dubbed in Italian, boasts the usual good quality effects but above all a soundtrack worthy of a high-level production, signed by the singer Azam Ali (who already has several experiences in cinematographic field). The music is full of atmosphere and manages to enhance each phase of the action in the best way, losing its bite only on rare occasions. Always remaining in the context of the technical realization, it is necessary to point out the excellent AI of the enemies: even if sometimes they expose themselves to our fire without worrying about ending up riddled, in many cases they know how to find shelter and look out just to attack, or even change position and they move to avoid being hit. Comment We are probably facing the best episode of Siphon Filter ever made, waiting for a possible passage of the series on PlayStation 3. Logan's Shadow boasts a technical realization of the highest level, but above all it offers a great variety of situations: we will find ourselves coordinating the our actions with those of a support partner, or we will have to escort a tank by directing its cannon fire, or we will still have to cover a companion from a distance using a sniper rifle... There is really a lot of meat in the fire, in the six levels that make up the adventure and that tell a story that is not very original but exciting, capable of surprising until the end (don't skip the end credits...). The combat system is precise and gives great satisfaction, while showing the side badly when the enemies are too close and catch us off guard. . In this sense, unfortunately, the bosses disappoint, which you often end up eliminating on the first attempt, without any particular problems. The presence of the excellent online multiplayer closes the picture of a product made with great care, capable of conquering both the historical fans of Siphon Filter and the laymen of the series. Pros: High quality graphics and sound Varied and thick gameplay Full-bodied multiplayer mode Cons: Some problems with close quarters Artificial intelligence not always convincing Poorly defined textures", "date": "2007-12-11", "grade": null}
