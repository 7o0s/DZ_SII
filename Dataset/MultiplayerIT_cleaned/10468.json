In this area, only the FIFA series has tried in the past years to put a spanner in the works of the team led by the fox Shingo ~Seabass~ Takatsuka, mastermind behind the series from the first Winning Eleven to today. In recent years, however, there have been some signs that PES fans have not failed to grasp, culminating in the colossal flop of the 2008 version of the game as EA and FIFA made great strides to close their gap against Konami and PES. After having revived its fortunes in the Cesarini area with the release of PES 2009, not without problems especially in online matches, the challenge of the Japanese team with their rivals from Canada seems to have finally reached its climax: as already seen on these same pages FIFA 10 has succeeded in putting the definitive arrow for overtaking PES 2010. The Konami title is therefore called to confirm itself as the king of football simulations or to inexorably hand over the scepter to its rival: how will the clash end? Let's go find out! How does Gembions Lig spell? Inspired by a banner displayed by Chievo fans a few years ago, the first thing that strikes you in PES 2010 is the presence with great fanfare of the Champions League license, the top European football competition present with stadiums, brands, graphics and sounds, including the its legendary soundtrack and the possibility of playing it not only in single but also together with your friends. But let's go in order: after the excellent filmed introduction, the game menu offers us, in addition to the usual Exhibition and the aforementioned Champions, also the possibility of undertaking the Become a Legend mode (quite similar to the one seen in PES 2009) and the Master League, the latter renewed for the occasion with the introduction of three different menus in which to manage team tactics and training respectively, the configuration of the game in progress and all the purchase negotiations plus the management of technical staff and sponsors , crucial elements for the success of your team especially if you decide to start from scratch instead of relying on an already existing team. Returning to the modalities, there is the possibility of undertaking various cups and championships (absent the Bundesliga) also with our friends thanks to the new Community mode, with which you can group your favorite gamemates, giving rise to exciting challenges. Confirming a trend that calls for a change of look every year, also in this 2010 edition the PES menus have been completely revisited by the developers, who have however been good at giving birth to a new graphic design - probably the furthest from the classic canons of series - however capable of not leaving the player disoriented at any time. The pre-match Before taking the field it is necessary to choose the usual game options, including the duration of the match and the difficulty: precisely with regard to the latter it is necessary to open a small parenthesis, advising first of all the more experienced players to start immediately with the level maximum Champion, given that on balance the other grades seem to be decidedly leveled downwards, making even the gaming experience at the Regular level (the intermediate one by default) a health walk for the most savvy historical fans of the PES series, who after an initial acclimatization phase they won't find particular problems in winning games even largely. All this, making a comparison with the competition, does not happen in FIFA 10 where the various difficulty levels are more balanced between them offering a type of challenge in steps, the result of better artificial intelligence routines able to adapt to the chosen settings, while on the contrary in PES 2010 there is only a general ~trimming~ of the opponents as the difficulty decreases. In the tactical setting phase, most of the old parameters have given way to the publicized slider system, with which to set the behavior of your players on every occasion, from movement without the ball proposing to the bearer to the distances between the departments, from the height of the defensive line to the possibility of setting a sort of free coverage between the two central players: the values set in the sliders are immediately verifiable in the phases of the game, to the point of being strongly advised not to neglect this aspect at alltactical ect before kick-off. The same goes for the other new introduction this year, the individual card system, with which each player has some distinctive behaviors compared to the others and which therefore makes the use of the player in his ideal role even more likely. Ball in the center Whichever mode you choose to play, the time has come to put on your boots and take to the field: the impact with the control system requires a small initial setting phase, given that with the introduction of the new animations for changes of direction they have become less immediate than in the past, on the one hand preventing the unnatural movements and serpentines seen in the old PES chapters, but on the other hand requiring a certain fluidity of movement in control to avoid losing the ball. Speaking of the game system, one cannot help but take into consideration the notorious 360 movements implemented this year by the developers, movements that seem to be appreciable especially in the phases without the ball, vanishing when the controlled player has the ball at his feet : proven proof that the famous binaries have unfortunately not been completely eliminated, another aspect in which PES 2010 definitely needs to improve. The physics of the game, on the other hand, is confirmed to be the best on the square, proving its success in the clashes between the players but above all in the management of the ball, implemented in a realistic way with trajectories and rebounds identical to those of a real ball. Among the novelties of this year we also find the (re) introduction of the manual goalkeeper and the new management of penalties, to beat which it is no longer enough to press the shot and give a direction but it is necessary to pay attention both to the level of pressure exerted on the button both to the timing of moving the analog stick at the right time and level, mechanics that finally make the penalty lottery a matter of skill as well as intuition and luck in PES. Playstation 3 trophies The PlayStation 3 version of PES 2010 offers 29 trophies, of which 5 are gold and 11 are silver. The most interesting ones are dedicated to winning the Champions League both as a player and as a coach, passing through a series of victories online and offline, in comeback or in the Cesarini area. Photorealism? From the point of view of the setting, the PES 2010 game experience has something magical right from the initial filmed introduction, probably one of the best ever seen in the Konami series, an experience that culminates in playing the Champions League, competing in where all the graphic elements combine to reproduce the moments we are used to seeing on television. Unfortunately, however, the absence of some official license (does London FC mean anything to you?) ends up inexorably out of tune with everything else. Going into the details of the technical sector, given the images and videos circulated in the past months, it is perhaps redundant to say that the graphic detail of the players and their facial expressions in real time reaches new levels of photorealism, especially in the models of the most famous champions, however satisfying even with the appearance of the less famous ones. The further animations introduced contribute, as we said, to making the game more fluid and realistic, limiting the odious phenomenon of sudden changes of direction to 90 and 180, even if the Messi on duty will still be able to give too many headaches with his intoxicating dribbles. The stadiums have good textures as regards the playing field, but unfortunately there are few light and color effects that make everything a bit ~aseptic~. From a performance point of view, the PC version presented in some resolutions part of the historical framerate problems on this platform, making us choose 720p as the best one to play although it was also possible to select 1080p, but practically never at 60fps, probably due to the fact that the optimization of the graphics engine also on PC has somewhat followed that of the console versions of the game, where the title runs without any obvious worries. The soundtrack sees a series of music taken from songs by famous groups such as Keane and Stereophonics, while the support and chants from the visiting fans are a little lacking in the cheering, even on the occasion of a goal that is too cold to celebrate one's team. The commentary, still entrusted to Pardo and Altafini in the Italian version, does not change much compared to PES 2009, presenting the usual traits that have led us all to love and hate the releases of the legendary Jos in diametrically opposite ways.
