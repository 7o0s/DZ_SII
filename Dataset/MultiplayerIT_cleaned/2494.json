{"name": "Gauntlet: Dark Legacy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gauntlet-dark-legacy.html", "text": "Anti-aliasing? Absent! Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is the transposition of the homonymous coin-up. An arcade perfect? No more. Indeed, migrating to a powerful system like PS2 has benefited both frame rate and resolution. The Midway programmers did a decent job porting the game, but didn't try too hard. In fact, the graphics, albeit sharp and colorful, suffer from some defects, first of all the absence of anti-aliasing (lately too ~ignored~ by softco). Even the frame rate, better than the coin-up, is around the now measly 30 fps making rendering quite slow. To give a better idea let it be known that making the virtual ego go from one side of the screen to the other is an operation that requires a lot of time (sleeping experience ndJ). The polygons on the screen are unfortunately not wasted, and give the game that air of ancient style which, however, disfigures in the face of the visual wonder of some available titles. A positive note goes to the textures of discreet workmanship and well lit. Thanks to the presence of these cosmetic limitations, the ~G:DL~ graphics engine does not suffer from problems such as slowdowns, stutters, pop-ups, etc. even in the most frenetic action phases and with a myriad of enemies on the screen. This is precisely because the amount of polygons is directly proportional to the heaviness of the polygonal engine. A question of compromises. Some graphic effects have also been treated fairly, such as the evocation of some summons and some spells, which are equipped with good light effects that are well suited to the gothic-fantasy atmosphere of the game. Nothing special, therefore, on a cosmetic level for a title that can be defined as nice under this POS. However, always keep in mind that this is a game that runs on a PS2! Not a small thing Monotony: an ugly beast A striking thing that can be noticed from the first twenty minutes, in the Midway game, is the omnipresence of monotony. The latter derives as much from the repetitiveness of the game situations, as from the limited playability which, despite having a consistent number of executable actions to its advantage, gives the player the ability to easily get rid of enemies by holding down the magic key ~X~ (attack quick). This considerably limits the gameplay which settles on average levels. Sin! With a little more forethought we would have enjoyed ourselves more. In the game you use all the buttons on the Sony joypad. The commands are simple and effective, and their response is quite fast. With the left stick (analogue in this case) the character moves; with the front buttons you can perform two types of attacks (quick and low) and you can use spells and magic attacks, instead the back buttons offer the possibility to parry, attack with charge, make a strafe and attack opponents en masse (only in multiplayer). While in the single game mode the player is often affected by severe mental disorders of monotonous origin, it is in the multiplayer mode that ~Gauntlet~ offers the maximum of its limited fun! In fact, it is possible to connect up to four joypads to the console after spending a multitap, seriously beat the unfortunate person on duty, and adopt the right team strategies with the aim of reaching the end of the level with as much energy and money as possible. In the Midway game, in fact, it is possible to buy more or less expensive potions and spells (depending on their power) before starting to devastate the monsters. If you want to really have fun with Gauntlet it is therefore necessary to get three friends ready to arm themselves to the teeth, to start this mystical and violent adventure and make their way through a slew of bloodthirsty beasts. The dress does not make the priest As far as longevity is concerned, a separate discussion must be made. If by it we mean the mere length of time necessary to complete all the levels, it must be emphasized that it is quite high, especially in the single player game, due to the difficulty of the bosses at the end of the ~reign~ and not so much for what concerns the frameworks preceding them. If, on the other hand, with the term ~longevity~ you want to represent the desire that the gamer has to continue in the adventure, well ... in this case, the judgment of the undersigned is not very positive. It is undermined both by the presence of a single game mode and by other factors. In fact, unless you play with other friends, the title in question offers very little fun and will certainly not push the user by force to proceed along the various levels (about thirty) due to the aforementioned recurrence of situations andriddles. The latter are characterized by the traditional scheme which consists in pulling the levers (now rusty) and opening the usual gates with the found keys. It's okay that it's an arcade game, but the programmers could have worked a little harder to renovate obsolete game structures and content. A positive mention concerns the musical accompaniment which performs its function in an excellent way and translates into a small show for the ears. The music, which will be the background to the fight against the villains, is in fact equipped with a gothic style that manages very well to give an idea of the situation in which the hero of the moment will find himself. The same cannot be said about the sound effects which, as in other games of the genre, perform their job in a modest way. So nothing particularly relevant in this respect. Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is not evil, indeed. It depends on individual tastes. It is a title that fans of the series absolutely cannot miss, while the others would do well to save those pennies and wait for the near release of the more prosperous ~Onimusha~. However, if someone was seriously considering the purchase of the Midway stock, it is also highly recommended that of a nice multitap that certainly does not harm your health ... but your wallet does! Pros: Arcade perfect multiplayer fun! Cons: Monotone in single Arcade perfect An old acquaintance Any self-respecting gamer has necessarily heard of Gauntlet: Dark Legacy. Although many years have passed since its first release in arcades, the ex-Atari title has revolutionized the way of playing by introducing a hilarious multiplayer mode that succeeded, even in its later incarnations, and still manages to attract hordes of Boys. Fans of the game in question, now developed and distributed by Midway, who own a PS2, will therefore be more than happy to be able to get their hands on an action title that sees their character beating up any enemy on screen. happy with them The plot of the game is simple; the demon Skorne, once imprisoned thanks to a spell by the sorcerer Sumner, manages to escape by instilling panic and terror in the eight kingdoms which thus enter a period of profound darkness dominated by evil. Who has the arduous task of resolving the situation? The answer is obvious. The gamer will be called upon to impersonate one of the eight (but only initially ndJ) heroes who, armed to the teeth, will have to make their way through the long levels teeming with monsters and traps of various kinds. The party increases quantitatively as you progress through the game, for a total of sixteen warriors. Each of them has different peculiarities, leaving the player the choice. We will have the warrior, expert with weapons but incompetent in the use of magic, the wizard (the name says it all), the elf, the classic middle ground between power and magic, etc. The new heroes can be found in some secret sub-levels hidden in the different settings.", "date": "2001-06-06", "grade": null}
