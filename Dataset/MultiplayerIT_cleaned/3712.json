{"name": "Devolver Tumble Time", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devolver-tumble-time-recensione.html", "text": "We have often talked about it: the more inflated a genre is, the more it is necessary to distinguish itself. There are basically two ways to do it: create a traditional product but damn well done, or focus on an original approach but not an end in itself, in other words, something fresh and effective at the same time. It is this last option that Devolver Digital has chosen for its new mobile production: a puzzle game to be played with just one finger, holding your iOS or Android device strictly vertically, which uses a graphic style with ~thick edges~, cartoony and fun, while drawing on the 'large roster of characters available to the publisher. So everything is perfect? In truth, there would be some problems: continue reading our review of Devolver Tumble Time to find out what it is. Gameplay: a colorful bingo Devolver Tumble Time, this is how item deletions work Do you know the bingo wheel? That's where Devolver Tumble Time starts: select one of the available characters, all from the Devolver Digital series (from Serious Sam to Hotline Miami, from GRIS to Absolver, from Downwell to Minit, from Shadow Warrior to Observation. ..) and equipped with different special abilities, we will find ourselves facing increasingly complex levels while we watch the wheel gradually fill up with objects. At this point match-3 style mechanisms come into action which however work in a different from the usual, extremely intuitive: if there are three or more identical objects that touch each other inside the wheel, we just need to hold down our thumb on the touch screen to select them all and make them explode, possibly ringing a combo capable of making a bomb that can help us in our work. What is the goal? Make the eliminations indicated at the top of the screen, respecting a time limit of just sixty seconds. So you have to tap like madmen in search of the right combinations, make the character gauge go up and take advantage of its special move, or press a button to spin the wheel where there is no possibility of going forward. The timer at first appears comfortable and calm, but towards the twentieth level, thanks to the increasingly pressing demands of the game, it becomes really difficult to respect. We therefore come across the game over and the possible microtransactions peep out to continue the game or to obtain infinite hearts (tickets, in practice), so as not to have to wait for them to recharge over time. Structure: wild monetization and regress advertising Devolver Tumble Time, another spin and other objects to eliminate If the Devolver Tumble Time system is pleasant and nice, thanks to the comic graphic style and the hypnotic music, as well as the Devolver characters and a simple but captivating gameplay, in structural terms the title developed by NOPOPO is unfortunately characterized by an annoying tendency towards wild monetization that manifests itself far too quickly. It is true, the price to pay to get infinite hearts (and therefore infinite attempts) is just 3.49 if you want to stop waiting for the top-up, but by choosing to enjoy the experience for free, you end up watching bad advertising trailers that almost always revolve around scam and gambling applications, or ads that even try to offer us an in-app purchase of 119.99 to unlock All.", "date": "2023-02-08", "grade": "5.0"}
