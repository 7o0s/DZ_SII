Restoring importance to a genre that was almost extinct is certainly not a trivial matter, and the US software house has succeeded by exploiting a brilliant commercial model, based on the sale of episodic adventures and on the recovery of some legendary brands. Among the series brought back to life by the house, however, there is none aimed at a purely adult audience. Understandable, if we consider that the only politically incorrect adventures during the golden years of Sierra and Lucasarts were those of Larry Laffer, and that therefore the ~dirty~ material to resurrect is rather lacking. But now we are in 2011, Larry has aged very badly, gamers are totally desensitized, and there is a desperate need for a new saga of that type. A bad saga, cynical, offensive, insane and able to quite shock even the new generations, or at least make them laugh out loud. Straandloper, a group of animators and developers based in Northern Ireland, took on the arduous task of creating a game capable of making any moralist pale. Their first creature is called Hector: Badge of Carnage, it landed on the iPad last year, and it was a stratospheric success that quickly earned the top of the Apple Store sales chart. Despite the boom in purchases, the developers did not release any news regarding any additional chapters until February of this year, during which they announced that the series would be completed by Telltale, and published for PC and Mac. Like Mac Gyver, but fat and mean Hector, the protagonist of our adventure, is a cynical and crude negotiator, devoid of the slightest civic sense and undoubtedly not devoted to safeguarding others. If you're wondering how such an individual can be part of the police force, you have to consider that the place where he works is Clappers Wreake, a fictitious city known to be the worst den of scum and crime in the whole of Great Britain. It is therefore unlikely to find model policemen there. Despite his lack of scruples, our tough, overweight agent seems to have a certain talent for solving cases, so much so that he is called in to deal with a dangerous terrorist with perfect aim, who has barricaded himself in a building with hostages and has already killed multiple negotiators. Too bad the terrorist is as wacky as the agent to whom he has been entrusted, and his only wish is to make Clappers Wreake a model of cleanliness and moral integrity! Hector will therefore find himself having to face the impossible mission of restoring luster to the unhealthy town in which he lives, and to do so he will have to exploit the fundamental tool of every point and click: the inventory. The control scheme is in fact a simplified version of that typical of classic adventures. No menus or specific actions, just one click to examine an object, two to use or pick it up and the ability to combine the tools in your pockets. Even the puzzles won't surprise you with their originality, but at least a couple will force you to think for a few minutes. We also remind you that we are facing a title that is prohibited for children under 16, so don't expect rubber chickens with pulleys in the middle. At Clappers Wreake, problems are solved with used condoms, rubber vibrators and canned heroin addicts. Classy stuff. Innit? Hector: Badge of Carnage is a 2d adventure coming from the i Pad, so don't expect superlative animations and incredibly detailed art. Nonetheless, the background and character designs have a certain style and everything moves quite smoothly in the game's grimy city setting. Really a great job, considering that only two developers from the Straandloper team planned the adventure. The sound is fantastic, with top-level dubbing that contributes greatly to making the jokes funny. The strong point of the production are obviously the dialogues and the irreverent humor from which the video game is pervaded. Unfortunately, however, you will have to know the English language perfectly to fully enjoy the brilliant script, given that there is no Italian translation and that many of the jokes are extremely complex and full of typical British slang terminologies. You will even have to deal with very caricatural chavs (a kind of English variant of the local truzzo, with a tendency to cut words), whose peculiar way ofspeaking will challenge your understanding of the language. The fact that the subtitles are completely missing in the few cutscenes doesn't help. The last problem is the price: the iPad application cost less than 4 dollars, miraculously risen up to 10 euros on Steam. A little excessive for a title that can be completed easily in less than two hours, and an odd choice by Telltale, which in the past has sold entire five-part series on offer at slightly higher prices. Let's hope that the next chapters are cheaper, or take advantage of the clever ~serial~ model of the American house.", "date": "2011-05-12", "grade": "7.0"}
