{"name": "Dragon Ball Z Supersonic Warriors", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-supersonic-warriors_a.html", "text": "The old and the new The first impact with Supersonic Warriors is bizarre: fans will surely notice a large dose of similarities with other titles dedicated to Dragon Ball Z (primarily Dragon Ball Z Densetsu and the aforementioned Hyper Dimension) but also a completely new way of playing a Dragon Ball fighting game. There are many features that differentiate Supersonic Warriors from a normal match beat'em-up: first of all the mechanics itself. In Supersonic Warriors the player takes control of one of the fourteen characters available and must face his opponent as in the most banal of fighting games. Everything changes as soon as you move: in Supersonic Warriors the player is free to move in any direction, even in the air, to rotate around his opponent and even to fly as far away from him as possible, thanks to the enormity of the battlefield and the excellent zoom system. One button for weak attacks, one for powerful ones: this is how you fight in Supersonic Warriors, there are no special moves to be performed by rotating the stick in a thousand directions, but only an infinite number of totally free combos based on the alternating pressure of the two buttons. The parry is risky: the crossing of two attacks cancels them directly, letting the flurry of blows continue with an effect that is very reminiscent of the animated series of the same name; if, on the other hand, you prefer to assume a defensive pose, holding down one of the two keys, it is good to realize that an indicator will signal the stun level of the defending character: if too many attacks have been received, he will remain defenseless for a few seconds, leaving the field free for the opponent to torment him with blows and, even, to throw him into another screen with relative destruction of the rock masses present. Just like in the anime. And as in the anime, energy emissions and special shots cannot be missing: the spiritual energy indicator (the ~Ki~) is back, which allows you to launch energy shots of small and medium density by pressing two keys, or to take advantage of 50% or 100% to cast one of the character's secret techniques used. The realization of the latter involves pressing three buttons simultaneously, and depending on the position of the attacker with respect to the opponent (above, below, on the sides) you will get a different attack, always spectacular and destructive. The combat system is almost the same for all the characters (even if the androids, for example, cannot autonomously recharge the Ki), which are mainly distinguished by the values of attack, agility and defense: the slight differences between the characters prevent the 'user to develop specific war strategies, forcing him to practice on a general use of the combat system and the particular special shots of each character, certainly favoring the practicality and immediacy of the title but, at the same time, limiting its variety. Combat Mode Despite the presence of the most famous and beloved characters of the saga, the choice of fighters inserted by Banpresto leaves rather perplexed, who forgets as many legendary protagonists in the drawer, reserving only for some (such as N.16 or the members of the Ginyu Squad) of the ~extras~ in the most powerful attacks. The characters that the player can select are Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo, Trunks, Frieza, Cell, Majin Buu, to which are added Krillin, N.18, Gero, Ginyu and Gotenks, ~purchasable~ at a later time. Furthermore, each character has three power levels, which vary his statistics and combat skills, as well as sometimes the visual rendering (for example, level 1 and 2 Gohan is in the Super Saiyan child version, while level 3 Gohan is the eighteen year old one from the Majin Buu saga): the number of selectable characters thus acquires a slight increase, also justified by a system that limits the selection of fighters not dissimilar to the one already seen in Capcom VS SNK, so that it is not possible to choose three level 3 characters but a combination of weak, medium and strong fighters. Why are we talking about selecting ~three~ characters? It's very simple: Banpresto has well thought of enriching the combat system with a sort of Tag System that allows you to exchange the wrestler you are using with another previously chosen one; consequently, in order not to make the fights too unbalanced, the Japanese software house has well thought of inserting a system that balances the choice of teammates. All this blends perfectly with the large number of game modes designed for Supersonic Warriors: in addition to a beautifully crafted Story Mode, which allows you to face different fights with each character, outlining their vicapersonal ends (and sometimes elaborating hilarious ~what if~), together with a series of clashes that describe the three minisagas that make up the Dragon Ball Z series (the saga of Namek, that of Cell and that of the Majins), peep out a training mode, a ~free~, a sort of survival and the inevitable mode for two players. By completing each of these modes you will get points that you can spend to ~buy~ new characters, difficulty levels, additional Story Modes and more. In short, there is something for all tastes. Advance! Certainly, this Dragon Ball title takes full advantage of the Game Boy Advance's audiovisual capabilities. Let's start with the graphic design, really excellent: stylized and futuristic menus, which are very reminiscent of those of Street Fighter Alpha 3; large, detailed and beautifully animated sprites; battlefields faithful to the anime and manga, well-kept and sometimes impressive (the planet of the Kaiohshin is a small graphic masterpiece), which show off multiple levels of parallax making a convincing idea of three-dimensionality and adapting to the aerial rotations of the sprites. The realization of the zoom is excellent, which with great fluidity and precision moves the virtual camera closer and closer to the two wrestlers. The wealth of details and the numerous goodies invented by Banpresto (such as the anime-like sequences that introduce some special moves launched at maximum power) make Supersonic Warriors undoubtedly the best two-dimensional fighting game dedicated to Dragon Ball ever made from a graphic point of view. And from the sound one? The writer also had the opportunity to test the Japanese version of the cartridge, and in the American one reviewed here the massive number of vocalizations was replaced by the American dubbing of the animated series. No more Goku with a shrill voice, therefore, but a new set of voice actors who, if at the beginning appear unconvincing (especially for those who love unattainable Japanese dubbing) in the long run one ends up preferring, even if the phrases that replace the names screams of legendary attacks such as the Makankosappo or the Garrick Cannon definitely make us regret the incomprehensible language of our almond-eyed friends. Even the introductory music track has suffered the same fate: the original remix of Cha-la-Head-Cha-la, the historical theme song of the anime, has been replaced by a new rocking track, however quite catchy. The rest has not been touched, and Supersonic Warriors retains and enjoys a good sound sector, with music tracks suitable for the action and never annoying. Incredible to say, not a decent Dragon Ball game... but a good one! Who would have thought, even the two Budokai for PlayStation 2 and GameCube left dumbfounded despite the average quality, but Supersonic Warriors proves to be even superior to them. In a word, the new Game Boy Advance fighting game is just plain fun. The combat system, although not very complex, is original and intuitive, and only lacks in the mediocre specific distinction of the characters. Supported by an impressive technical realization and a large number of game modes and secrets to unlock, Supersonic Warriors turns out to be a real surprise: fans of the Toriyama saga have found the game they were looking for, all other beat'em- up definitely try it. Pros: Finally a Dragon Ball game worthy of the name! Excellent technical realization. Tons of modes and secrets to unlock. Cons: Characters not too differentiated. Few selectable wrestlers. The Dragon Ball fad seems to never end. As interesting as it may be to discuss the negative aspects assumed by the mangaka Akira Toriyama's work due to the extreme work of commodification to which it has been subjected after its recent landing in the West, here it is videogames that we need to talk about and, one Once in a while, we'll talk about a game dedicated to Dragon Ball. Supersonic Warriors is the fourth title dedicated to Dragon Ball on Game Boy Advance: the first two were RPGs (The Legacy of Goku and The Legacy of Goku II, the first poor and the second more than decent), a genre that is ill-suited to a series focused on fighting and action for the truth, the third a horrible rendered fighting game, Taiketsu, heralded as one of the worst video games ever made ever. It's funny to note one thing: until a few years ago, the license for the production of Dragon Ball video games was in the possession of the well-known Bandai, responsible for dozens of titles based on the adventures of Son Goku & friends, very few of which a certain quality (at least Hyper Dimensi is worth mentioningon for SNES and Buu Yuu Retsuden for Saturn); however, in recent years, with the notoriety acquired by the brand in America, the brand has been dribbled by several manufacturers, in particular by Atari and Infogrames, which have given the new generation consoles the Budokai fighting game series, discreet but fun. Now, Dragon Ball Z has been entrusted to Banpresto to develop a new title for the Nintendo portable which from the excellent premises had proved worthy of attention. And now, about a purchase.", "date": "2004-07-22", "grade": null}
