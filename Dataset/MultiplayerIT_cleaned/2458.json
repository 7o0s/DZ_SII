It is with this acronym that triumphantly stands out on the shiny packaging of the game: it wants to be the first Massively Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter, which means a persistent world, in which thousands and thousands of players from all over the world meet, not for break into a noisy DM, as Casa Id teaches, but to fight the most realistic war that has ever appeared on our monitors. The whole of Europe has been rebuilt on a 1:2 scale, reproducing really existing cities, rivers, bridges and roads (in 1940, of course), and it will be in this virtual world that you will immerse yourself, opting for the allied forces of the French Republic, to His Majesty's glorious army, or rather wearing the clothes and shiny boots of a Teutonic soldier of the Third Reich. Historically, Hitler launched his blitzkrieg on the Western Front on May 10, 1940, and it is precisely in this period that WWII Online (subtitled, precisely, Blitzkrieg) is set. Within 8-10 months, the Cornered Rat programmers assure us, we will know if history will be rewritten or not, or if France will actually be occupied (and the Blitzkrieg will have been successful) or if, on the contrary, the Allied forces will be able to push back the troops German. It will be at this point that game add-ons will be made available, related to the Battle of Britain, the Russian Campaign and so on, which in addition to continuing the virtual war in the most appropriate scenarios, will allow you to select the troops of the different nationalities that will intervene in those areas (Italy, China, United States, Soviet Union, Japan). Of course, the respective equipment will be added to all this! Proton rifles and anti-material cannons None of this. All the weapons and vehicles (trucks, tanks, planes, ships, etc.) present in the game are the faithful reproduction of the real counterparts used in the Second World War. Between pistols, rifles, machine guns and grenades, we are faced with about 15 different weapons, not counting future updates, which will expand the already extensive ~fleet~, currently including more than 20 vehicles. In short, a boon for fans, who will be happy to know that in the game box they will also find an exhaustive technical booklet, with the description and ~biography~ of every single piece of iron that appears in the game. Gameplay: or how you go from private to general Once you have decided which flag to take up arms under and selected the game area in which you want to intervene (obviously limited to the areas in which you are actually fighting) you will have to choose the role that is most congenial to you in battle: in fact, if if you aspire to a career as a tank driver (sublime play on words), it will be sufficient to select the tank model that best suits you, while if you feel like a new von Richtofen, you can always try the path of the ace of the skies aboard a single-seat fighter. Unfortunately, your dreams of glory may collide with a control system that to call laborious is an understatement. WWII is a real military simulation and even if you limit yourself to treading the battlefield as a simple infantry soldier armed with a rifle, you will find that aiming and fragging the target in question is not as simple as any sane Quaker should expect. To begin with, it is good to kneel in a shooting position, in order to increase accuracy, secondly, by pressing the shift key, the weapon you are holding will be shouldered. At this point you could already be shooting, but given the obvious lack of a HUD scope, the only way to aim at your target (and have a reasonable chance of hitting it) is to also press the right mouse button, so you bring your eye closer to the barrel of the rifle and use the ~physical~ sight of the weapon. No headshots in full plane strafe then, but three buttons to press simultaneously, in an absolutely static position and exposed to enemy fire... Piloting the most elementary of tanks is an even tougher challenge: each vehicle has its own peculiarities and therefore a totally different driving model: you will therefore have to familiarize yourself with the use of the gears, with the sensitivity of the steering and with all those very realistic (and uncomfortable) features that characterize them. For example, by piloting a chariot, your view of the outside world will be reduced to a tiny window, which will give you many orientation problems (the use of the compass on the left of the screen is fundamental in these situations). In addition to these problems of a technical nature (which can be overcome over time) there are others of a logistical nature, so to speak. Don't forget thatyou are part of an army, and as such its efficiency depends on discipline. Therefore, knowledge of the English language is essential, both in terms of understanding the objectives of the missions, and in order to be able to interact with the comrades and commanders, who will not fail to call you back if you start wandering around on your wagon, ignoring orders. Speaking of orders and missions, one of the most challenging aspects of the game is that if you demonstrate a certain skill on the battlefield, you will be promoted, and you could get to command entire platoons of men and design missions (for example conquer control of a bridge, vital for transporting troops across a river). From this point of view the game is very flexible, although it should be emphasized that the learning curve is so steep, that the vast majority of players will continue to play the role of private. Especially for newbies, a certain initial disorientation is inevitable and the most common feeling is certainly that of feeling useless. In almost all online games, even if you are a beginner, you always manage to carve out a fairly simple role with which to do ~something~ (the doctor-engineer in Tribes2 is a good example). In WWII we really start as the last wheel of the cart, given that our presence or absence is irrelevant for the purposes of a battle involving a few hundred players, especially if we are inexperienced kites, which could appear frustrating for those who are used to changing alone the fate of a fight. Exoso, indeed more WWII graphics are absolutely bare. Much attention has been paid to the creation of individual 3D models, but as regards the landscape, especially outside the city centres, it appears flat and bare, with just a few trees now and then. The constant presence of such large play areas heavily affects performance (thanks to an engine still being optimized), to the point that simply reaching 30 frames per second becomes a serious problem. For the network there are several guides to optimizing the game, which recommend in the first place the elimination of shadows, mip-mapping, specular surfaces, antialiasing and 3D sound. What's left you ask? Very little, I say. In reality the point is that the graphics engine is buggy to the bone. It's always the usual question of commercialized games still incomplete, and WWII is decidedly incomplete, if you think that despite a patch of the impressive size of 70 MB, there is still a plethora of bugs present, such as flying tanks (which, I must admit, they go a lot of folklore) or pilots who occasionally vanish inexplicably, with the result of seeing many ghost vehicles that move by themselves, only to pass through the terrain as they attempt a climb. Unfortunately, beyond these more or less ~cheerful~ bugs, your good mood will pass quickly as soon as you realize that it is practically impossible to perform even offline training without jerks and slowdowns, and you can believe me when I tell you that despite Athlon 600, 128 MB of RAM and GeForce DDR, when I launch the game I can easily have a coffee and an afternoon nap, since the different loading phases last a good 5-10 minutes overall. Add to all this the poor quality of our telephone lines, and you will realize that the flash sessions of Counter-Strike remain only a beautiful memory. But really, is it at least fun? This is the question I imagine you are asking yourself. Over time, the technical problems should be solved at least in part and therefore the question is whether or not it is worth paying the tidy sum of 99 dollars to buy a game (available only in online stores), which in any case requires a considerable amount of 10 bucks a month to be used at the end of the first trial month. Keep in mind that WWII is not a game for all gamers (and not all PCs). If you appreciate the immediacy of shooters and the possibility of obscuring large portions of your brain during their use, then turn to something different or simpler and ~tested~ (such as Team Fortress and its long-awaited sequel). If, on the contrary, you are intrigued by the strategic-warlike elements, you love simulations of military vehicles and you are passionate about the latter, then you have found bread for your teeth, given that beyond the technical flaws, WWII Online is successful in proposing a multiplayer experience of unprecedented scope.

Imagine seeing the scenarios of the Second World War reproduced in a gigantic multiplayer arena, with the possibility of having thousands of soldier-players fight it and giving them the opportunity to rewrite the history we know and that we studied in school.
