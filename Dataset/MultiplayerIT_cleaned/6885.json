But is it really worth spending 4.49 Euros for a non-game like Goat Simulator? Goat Simulator is great for a few laughs, albeit at a not exactly friendly price Meaningless sandbox In this mobile version, Goat Simulator does not try in any way to mitigate its total lack of meaning: from a main menu that already draws the lines of irony that permeates the entire product (with badly placed writing on the keys that allow you to access to the various functions) you can start playing immediately, without the software giving any indication on what to do. You find yourself at the controls of the goat protagonist, with a modest-sized scenario that can be freely explored in all its parts and only a list of objectives to refer to as the only progression model. In fact, however, Goat Simulator does not have a real purpose, and even if there is a points counter that records the evolutions made by the player, even taking note of any combos, these are absolutely useless: the work of Coffee Stain Studios is a sandbox in which there is no shortage of things to do, but they are all activities for their own sake that do not reward the user in any way. Goat Simulator is played only for the sake of seeing the goat's absurd interactions with the delusional game world, with the very frequent bugs that accompany the gameplay to constitute - paradoxically - the real climaxes of the playful experience rather than annoying accidents of route. The only exception to the rule is represented by the statuettes scattered around the setting, which if collected in certain quantities allow you to unlock alternative ~costumes~ for the goat that add to those already initially available: these are variants not only aesthetics, given that they often guarantee special abilities which however - in line with the spirit of the production - work very badly and are almost completely unusable for videogame purposes. If Goat Simulator is a difficult product to frame from a gameplay point of view, it is equally difficult to express yourself on the technical qualities of converting a deliberately bad title. In terms of coherence with the source material, it can be said that Coffee Stain Studios has hit the target: in this mobile version the game scenario is identical to the original one, including all the characters and objects that inhabit it and above all featuring the same ability to produce interpenetrations, bugs, wrong applications of physical laws and so on. As on PC, the various effects are made very badly and there are drops in frame rate, but a generally lower polygonal complexity is also evident. We are therefore talking about a title faithful to its first incarnation but which certainly cannot be defined as pleasant to look at, especially compared to the graphic wonders to which the best mobile titles released in recent times have accustomed us. The same goes for the control system, given that managing the goat's movements on a smartphone or tablet is just as inconvenient as doing it with a mouse and keyboard: the developers have opted for the classic solution of the virtual stick and on-screen buttons that allow the protagonist to jump, gore, drag objects with his powerful tongue and also to leave his body at the mercy of the ragdoll system. Everything works badly, but in such an obvious way as to be fun: this is in a nutshell the essence of Goat Simulator, a title that can easily allow you to spend a couple of hours of strictly non-intelligent entertainment, but which runs out (quickly) its function turns out to be little more than an electronic joke.", "date": "2014-09-30", "grade": "6.8"}
