The images showed a mature style, an almost dystopian, dark and distorted vision of the joyful and smiling Disney world, something that seemed impossible could really find its way into the videogame market, let alone under the official aegis of the film house. Expectations grew further when the involvement of Warren Spector and Junction Point Studio in the project was made official, which therefore assumed the contours of a well-structured concept in the form of a video game, knowing the qualities and experience of the game designer in question, not a simple style exercise to experiment with a new modern look for Mickey Mouse. In short, in one way or another, the hype grew perhaps even more than the developers themselves could have expected and the release of Epic Mickey represented an event of great importance even for ~hardcore~ users, despite the product might seem more relevant to a younger audience. The reception has been varied, generally positive even if in several cases it has been highlighted how the hype has negatively affected the relationship between expectations and actual game performance, but there is no doubt that the path started by Junction Point has led to significant results for as for Disney games based on classic characters. Epic Mickey was responsible not only for a more chiaroscuro and mature redesign of the Mickey Mouse character, but also for a reconceptualization of the thickness of the games focused on the high-sounding licenses of the Disney classics, which perhaps since the days of Castle of Illusion on Megadrive did not reach such structural complexity and production quality. And so we come to Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Adventure of Mickey Mouse and Oswald, ready to consolidate the franchise and evolve it towards new horizons, at least in the intentions of Warren Spector. In truth, the second chapter introduces several good ideas but struggles to give a precise identity to its structure, which seems unable to well compact the innovative thrusts desired by the team into a unitary and engaging experience, despite relying in any case on the undeniable charm and the usual iconic power of the Disney myths to support it all. Back to Wasteland After Mickey's latest effort, the world of Rifiutolandia, a place where all the forgotten or abandoned cartoon creatures meet and lead a relatively peaceful life, is once again shocked by strange events, in the form of mysterious earthquakes of unknown origin. Oswald immediately sets out to save his world, but faced with the looming threat he is forced to ask for help from the usual Mickey Mouse, through Gus who also assumes the contours of the omniscient narrator. Furthermore, both are grappling with a Mad Scientist who, as a negative character, seems to want to propose himself as a controversial savior and helper of the two, but his figure and his real intentions remain somewhat enigmatic throughout the story, forcing Mickey and Oswald never let your guard down. All this is narrated not only by cartoon-style interlude scenes, but also by sequences built with the game engine and set as real musical pieces, a novelty strongly desired by Warren Spector and with an excellent impact. although limited to brief narrative moments and somewhat forced to the needs of the different musical metrics in the Italian adaptation, in any case of excellent workmanship (note, for example, the reconstruction of the rhyming text). The structure of the game essentially takes up the system designed for the original, expanding it to include some fundamental innovations that aim to enrich the experience. We are therefore faced with a 3D action adventure with platform elements and puzzle solving, which essentially recalls the similar products that went crazy between the end of the 90s and the first decade of 2000. In particular, the structure here often splits in two real different game sessions: the central mechanic is the one in which we control the characters in a three-dimensional environment with a third person view, with a certain centrality of the puzzles related to the use of Mickey's magic brush and Oswald's remote control , while between these sessions we encounter areas of connection between the different areas of the game that are structured as real platform levels, with a 2D structure and side view. The latterhave an old-fashioned charm, given the relative old-school structural simplicity and the settings taken from ancient Disney shorts, but their thickness compared to the entire structure of the game is rather limited, acting mainly as moments of detachment and fillers compared to the main action. Rather noteworthy is the accumulation of points of interest and interactable characters within the main 3D areas (excluding the real ~dungeon~-style levels), which now act as hubs in which to weave a dense network of quests, almost of sandboxes. In short, there are a lot of things to do in Rifiutolandia: in addition to the main story it is possible to carry on a whole series of challenges more or less adherent to the main quest that lead us to explore all the game areas with great attention, discover new story snippets, obtain special items and unlock Disney-themed bonuses and extras. The dynamic duo Apart from the passage to the multi-platform regime, which in itself already represents a big novelty, there are two main guidelines for the innovations introduced in this second chapter, although the first probably dominates the other in terms of preponderance and pervasiveness in the gameplay: from on the one hand the addition of the second character, Oswald, on the other the insistence on a more or less open approach to solving puzzles, which allow different strategies through that particular gameplay structure that Warren Spector has repeatedly presented as ~PlayStyle Matters ~. As for the presence of the two characters, the introduction of Oswald not only represents a simple ploy to renew the public's interest with the inclusion of a new supporting actor, but radically changes the gaming experience by founding the entire level design on cooperation between the two. Whether you play in multiplayer or alone, we will always have the two characters in question on the screen and the puzzles will be based on cooperative action and the use of the different skills of both: magic brush and solvent for Mickey and a strange remote control capable to interact with mechanical and electrical equipment as far as Oswald is concerned. It is clear how such a structure calls for multiplayer, present here in strictly offline form (with split screen) and in the drop-in/drop-out mode which facilitates the entry into the game at any time of a second player, appearing particularly suitable for have various family members play together, to underline the broad demographic target of this title. The human playmate is obviously able to entertain much more than the CPU-controlled character, which seems somewhat marred by a deficient artificial intelligence. Playing single it often happens that you have to wait for Oswald who is late to enter the coordinated action, stays behind and sometimes clearly hinders the pace of play. The cooperative action is a founding principle of the entire structure and the presence of the two characters is justified by the level design along the entire route, however there is a certain difference in weight between the two protagonists. Mickey Mouse is clearly the cornerstone of the action and the whole game revolves entirely around the concept of the magic brush, while Oswald's abilities, although fundamental in solving the puzzles, appear to be inserted in a more forced way, almost in retrospect to justify the presence of a second character alongside Mickey. On the other hand, it is no coincidence that playing in single you can only control Mickey Mouse, so the introduction of Oswald seems induced more by the desire to push players to multiplayer than by real innovative game design needs. Choices matter Freedom of choice is therefore the other main innovation introduced by Junction Point for Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Adventure of Mickey Mouse and Oswald, in addition to the presence of the two protagonists. This freedom is revealed on several levels, starting from the broadest one, with the numerous roads that unfold before the protagonists within the aforementioned sandbox-like structure, which by weaving a dense web of quests and sub-quests leaves the players opportunity to choose which adventure to follow and how much to delve into the exploration of the game world. On a more practical level, lowered within the same level design, the ~PlayStyle Matters~ is instead resolved in the possibility of tackling a level or solving individual puzzles in different ways, which determines different consequences. In this case (as well as in the overlapping of quests) one of the main threads of Warren Spector's entire experience is found, which on the variable approach to the game and on the consequences deriving fromthe choices made has also built other of his great successes of the past such as Ultima Underworld, System Shock and Deus Ex. The application of the concept in this case is not as courageous as in the aforementioned illustrious precedents, but the inclusion of a dynamic of the genre in a game with this structure and this particular setting, moreover geared towards a rather young audience. Epic Mickey 2 constantly faces choices, very often between two different rather obvious possibilities or in other cases in a more discreet way, implying a certain moral implication for one line of conduct rather than another and with consequences that in the long term they emerge in how we solve problems in Wasteland and in our relationship with NPCs, even if at the macro-level of the main story it doesn't seem that substantial variations take place based on these choices. Generally speaking, it's not easy to want to start the entire 15-20 hour game over again to see the consequences of the different paths to be taken throughout the story but it is in the abundance of things to do that the strength lies of Epic Mickey 2, which pushes you to explore every corner of Rifiutolandia in depth to discover all its secrets. Xbox 360 goals 46 goals and the usual 1000 points are the loot to be collected in Epic Mickey 2, a game decidedly inclined to reward players more inclined to exploration and collecting. In addition to the objectives related to the normal progression of the main story, many are those to be unlocked by completing side quests, collecting objects and discovering secrets, well integrating the Disney-themed content rewards for the most attentive players with achievements. The other side of the Disney world Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Adventure of Mickey and Oswald is the first chapter in the series to reach all domestic gaming platforms, abandoning the exclusive format that characterized the first chapter, linked to the Wii. This obviously poses new questions from a technical point of view, both for the different computational capacity of the platforms and for the differences in terms of control, now no longer focused exclusively on the Wiimote of the Nintendo console, around which the entire original structure had been studied . However, Junction Point wanted to continue to take the Wii version as a reference, so much so that it dedicated itself exclusively to the first-person one and left the conversion work for the other platforms to other teams. This choice is reflected in a graphic system that does not make you cry out for a miracle, given the limitations of the Nintendo console compared to the potential of Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC, but it is a relatively minor problem. The question is reflected in a not excessively high polygonal count and a certain scarcity of effects (particles, light and reflections), although the higher resolution makes the textures more attractive. The strength of the game, from a graphic point of view, lies in its particular characterization and this transcends the discussions on shaders or the polygon count, once again and forcefully presenting its particular alternative, almost subversive interpretation of the Disney myths. The aesthetic component is probably the game's greatest strength, thanks to the iconic power of the characters and worlds represented, to the excellent reinterpretation carried out by the team and also to a high-profile orchestral accompaniment that manages to restore the feeling of living in the first place. person in a Disney cartoon. Unfortunately, some problems persist that do not seem to have been overcome by the first chapter, in particular regarding the management of the camera and the consequent control of the characters. Despite some undoubted improvements made by Junction Point, the shot always tends to be too squashed down or in awkward angles, forcing continuous corrections by the player. On Xbox 360, the platform on which the game was tested, the matter is further complicated by the fact that the right analog stick is reserved for both camera movement and viewfinder aiming, therefore framing adjustment is not immediate and in more agitated situations, or in those in which greater precision in calculating distances is required, it can be particularly annoying.", "date": "2012-11-17", "grade": "6.8"}
