Instead of proposing a reduced version of the gameplay of the main series, in fact, Tecmo Koei has preferred to follow a path that is still largely unexplored, combining classic elements of the survival horror genre with extensive exploitation of the 3DS camera and its support for augmented reality. An undoubtedly fascinating project, which unfortunately was absolutely unable to convert one's ideas into a satisfying product from a playful point of view. Camera Obscura without fear The first of the (many) problems of Spirit Camera: Le Memorie Maledette involves the narrative system, inconsistent, botched and hasty especially in the premises: the user is informed by a few lines of text that he is the unfortunate recipient of an anonymous package containing a camera and a strange diary (ie the 3DS and the booklet included in the package): from here on the plot unfolds among the most banal and withdrawn horror clichs of Japanese origin, without allowing even a shiver down the spine. Not exactly a turbo start for a title that focuses so much on the atmosphere, even if - as we will see - this is certainly not the most serious sin of the Tecmo Koei product. In the intentions of the developers, Spirit Camera: Cursed Memories was supposed to represent a new frontier in the use of augmented reality in video games, alternating more classic gameplay sequences with interactions between the 3DS camera and the so-called Purple Diary, a booklet consisting of 16 image pages. Basically, to continue the adventure it is first of all necessary to frame the right page through the lens of the console: on a theoretical level this process should be subject to the analysis of the clues collected, a pity however that the small thickness of the booklet and its almost always sequential to the events in the game reduce it to a mere mechanical action devoid of any gratification. The technical limitations of the console's camera, then, only make things worse, forcing the user to have to play in a perfectly lit room by stretching the pages still with his fingers and avoiding the slightest reflection of light, on pain of losing the sensor . When it works, at least, Spirit Camera: Le Memorie Maledette lets glimpse some interesting solutions: the images of the booklet come to life giving rise to short films or polygonal models that mix with the surrounding environment framed by the 3DS lens, for an effect that - if not exactly spectacular - it certainly has few equals in the current playful landscape of Nintendo hardware. Even in this case, however, a potential strong point of the product is debased by an evidently approximate development and devoid of really incisive ideas, guilty of immediately making the visualization of events through augmented reality diminish in a boring routine that is anything but scary or in the least unsettling. The 3D effect As is well known, the three-dimensional screen of the Nintendo console performs at its best when the console is held firmly in front of it: therefore, the need to move continuously in Spirit Camera: Cursed Memories row decisively against this function, forcing the user to completely lower the side slider, otherwise the image will flicker annoyingly. The few times that you manage to stand still, however, you can appreciate a successful depth of the image that goes well with the augmented reality effects. Note on booklet When you are not arguing with the camera to ensure that it correctly recognizes a page, Spirit Camera: Le Memorie Maledette strikes you with how few strictly playful elements it is able to put on the plate, to the point that it is almost difficult to define it as a video game. A good part of the adventure boils down to turning around and looking for the point in the room where Maya is located, one's travel companion whose only function seems to be to lengthen the broth with lines of dialogue that are most of the time useless and redundant. The very fact of having to constantly rotate the console also forces you to play standing up, or at most on a swivel chair, always being careful to stay in a well-lit area for the reasons explained in the previous paragraph. The ~puzzles~ that occasionally need to be solved to unlock access to certain pages are extremely trivial, and the only real obstacle to their resolution lies in the frequent bugs the software encounters. From time to time, then, the game offers sections in which you temporarily abandon the visualization through the camera to be transported in virtual scenarios in which you have to look around using the gyroscope of the console and little more. The only vaguely active component of Spirit Camera: The Cursed Memories is that of the fights, which exploit mechanics inherited directly from the Project Zero series. When a hostile specter appears, you need to aim and take a photo to inflict damage proportional to the time it has been held in the lens: there is also a counter system, which allows you to cancel an attack by pressing the shutter once moment before the lunge hits. However, a sleepy rhythm and an almost zero level of challenge are the only elements that stand out during these situations, and we are talking about the most successful sections of the entire package: in this sense, the fact that the adventure can almost be welcomed as a positive aspect has an incredibly short duration (two-three hours are more than enough to see the end credits), yet another proof of how Spirit Camera: Cursed Memories is more a tech demo than a real game. A sensation supported by the handful of minigames that accompany the single-player campaign, good for entertaining a cousin for a few minutes but whose play value is much lower than even the demo games for augmented reality installed by default on the 3DS.", "date": "2012-07-10", "grade": "4.8"}
