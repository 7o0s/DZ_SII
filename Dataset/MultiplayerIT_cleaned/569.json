{"name": "Super Mario Sunshine", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-mario-sunshine-3.html", "text": "A Mario cubed Mario games have always been created based on the potential and peculiarities of the Nintendo console that hosts them: Super Mario 64, for example, took full advantage of every new feature of the Nintendo 64 pad, from the control stick to the C buttons to move the camera . Sunshine is no exception, since like few others it benefits from the long stroke of the L and R backbones and the second analog stick implemented in the Gamecube pad. The tool that Mario carries on his back, the subject of many heated discussions, is nothing more than a means of exploiting the R key: each different pressure level corresponds to a different way of spraying the water. In Mario's platform games, top priority has always been given to the playful aspect of the video game, and even in Sunshine the potential of the Gamecube has been exploited to improve this component: there are no particular graphic effects, but on the other hand the pop-up is absent . If there is a coin, you can also see it from the other side of the stage, and this is a huge advantage for a platformer. The interaction with the surrounding world and the impeccable implementation of the physics engine, added to the perfect calibration of the control system, allows this title to be fun even in a hypothetical deserted square. In Mario Sunshine you have to learn the rules of the game, but once you learn it you are free as it is difficult to be in another video game: each object reacts to our moves, everyone is free to create their own way of playing. It is this factor more than any other that makes Mario unique and still unattainable for other platformers, the sum of all those little details that other software houses overlook. In Mario Sunshine, even if it doesn't help, if you shoot water at a beehive it starts to sway. The same can be said for plants, or for bridges, or for the many characters who populate the world. There's a feeling of unity and unity that other games in the genre don't exist, that only Mario can offer. This implicitly facilitates the work of game designers, since with such an engine it is possible to create a great game with less effort than with a normal engine. For this reason everyone was a little surprised to find themselves, perhaps for the first time, in front of a Mario who was not impeccable in terms of level design. Exploring Delphinia If at first impact with the game the setting might seem identical to that of Mario 64, with a base area (this time represented by Delfinia, a city) from which to access the various levels, as soon as you enter a stage you realize that the things have changed dramatically. Probably to reconnect with the games of the past, the men of the EAD have tried, as far as possible, to restore linearity to the missions to be carried out within the levels. In the past, in Mario 2d, our task was limited to reaching the end of the stage; in Mario 64, on the contrary, it was necessary to understand what our objective was before being able to reflect on how to carry it out. In Sunshine, as mentioned before, we took a step back, however implicitly limiting exploration: when you access a level you are no longer free, but you have to follow a specific mission, called ~story~. You can no longer take the stars in the order you prefer, but you have to follow the rules of the game. As soon as you enter a stage, the position of the shine to be collected is indicated to us, and our only problem is figuring out how to get it. This is a choice, not a defect, which also allowed the morphology of the levels to be changed radically from one story to another as it was not possible to do, inevitably, with Mario 64. Exploration is not absent in Mario Sunshine indeed, if you want to finish the game 100%, it is necessary. In fact, 30 blue coins are hidden within each level, located in the most improbable corners of the Mariesco universe. The swing These conceptual contrasts are constantly present in Mario Sunshine, so much so that one has the feeling of being faced with a game that contains two: unfortunately it has been Nintendo's fixation during this generation, trying to satisfy the casual and the hardcore gamer at the same time. On the one hand there are the easy missions with jumps facilitated by the use of the ~sprinkler~, on the other the blue coins hidden in the sand or the anachronistic levels to be completed without the aid of water. What was initially a noble intent has turned into a flaw in the game, which has a steep and incorrectly calibrated learning curve. This continuous alternation between positive and negative elements is a characteristic of MarI Sunshine. Very often it is possible to complete the missions in many different ways or overcome the same obstacle with various moves, thanks to the quality of the game engine but also to the foresight of the designers. However, the many perfectly structured and thought out missions are counterbalanced by just as many incredibly boring and obvious tasks, such as the collection of the seven red coins, often all placed in a small portion of the stage, or the pursuit of the 'obscure' Mario; you even have to face the same boss two or three times, and bringing this feature back into the linearity project that the developers had proposed would mean justifying them. Among the stories, it is imperative to mention those set in the sub-levels where you are alone with Mario, without the help of the ~sprayer~: a beautiful reference to the past and one of the features of the game that most influenced the video game market in the following months. Even the collection of blue coins is not without flaws, because, if on the one hand it allows you to appreciate the many details of the levels that are not noticed by completing the stories, on the other it generates a sense of immense frustration. Many of these coins are hidden in unsuspected places, they are placed around the stages without any logic; in Serena Beach, for example, you have to spray on a wardrobe, without any reason, to see the coveted coin appear. Even the level design of the eight stages is incredibly fluctuating: Ricco Harbor and Noki Bay probably represent the highest peaks reached by the 3D platform for their incredible level of interaction and their development both vertically and horizontally, while Mamma Beach is undoubtedly the poorest stage ever to appear in a Mario game. In conclusion, Super Mario Sunshine has improved and refined the already very valid engine of Super Mario 64, but due to not totally successful choices and the pressures of the frenetic modern market, it has not managed to be as perfect as its predecessor, in addition, of course, to not be equally innovative and pioneering. Super Mario Sunshine was built from very solid foundations, which have been further fortified with the release of this new episode. It gives the player an immense freedom of action that is not found in any other platformer, and reaches heights never touched before by 3d platformers. At the same time, however, it is sometimes repetitive and, in certain situations, not very inspired. Some stories are trivial and obvious, some blue coins hidden in a foolish and unmotivated way; the final boss, moreover, is disarmingly simple. Overall, however, it remains the best the genre has to offer in this generation, even if it has a little too many flaws to be universally remembered as a masterpiece. Surely it is to be played, because it offers wonderful moments and, above all, it is fun like very few others. Pros Immense freedom of action No pop-ups Perfect controls Brilliant gimmicks... Cons ... alternate with crappy ones Sometimes repetitive Super Mario Sunshine has never been judged as a game in its own right. The load of prejudices that this title carried with it at the time of its release prevented a valid and objective evaluation. All this was partly to be expected, given that Sunshine was the six-year-awaited successor to the title that had revolutionized the way we conceive video games, Super Mario 64. Everyone expected a new pioneer of the platform genre, a game that would be It was possible to identify how the Super Mario World of 3D: Super Mario Sunshine is neither. It no longer pushes the boundaries imposed by Super Mario 64, in fact, it is more plausibly a parallel episode. It has certainly disappointed the often exaggerated expectations of players from all over the world. Nonetheless, once the generation is over, it remains the best 3D platformer available for 128-bit consoles.", "date": "2006-03-27", "grade": null}
