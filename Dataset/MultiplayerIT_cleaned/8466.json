Registration is instantaneous, checks are immediate and social interconnection already starts on the homepage. Once you have access to the game servers, you just have to decide where to place the village and which buildings to build first. In fact, management, with taxes and resources to be distributed, remains the core of the formula, and it works. Building the most effective village is a real challenge thanks to the complexity and expansion possibilities that are far superior to those of many freemium management RTS. But already in this phase the first and greatest flaw of Stronghold Kingdoms emerges. After the trial period, which lasts only two days, it is in fact necessary to spend a premium token to launch a construction queue and not remain anchored to exhausting and very little playful times. The sound coin also allows you to increase resources and increase production, creating a formula that is very close to the much hated ~pay to win~. The hard life of the medieval lord Stronghold Kingdoms provides players with huge portions of Europe, scattered across different servers, with the inviting silhouette of Great Britain that immediately recalls medieval atmospheres. The complex management component is based on a rich evolutionary tree that allows us to push our community both towards technological evolution and towards military domination. The latter is obviously essential for carrying out or resisting sieges, an inevitable element of any self-respecting medieval title, and is corroborated by an interesting system of strategic cards. The battles are obviously an important part of the online component of the title which also includes alliances and trade routes as well as a decidedly intriguing global ranking system. In fact, the possibilities for development also take into consideration politics, with monks to be infiltrated to influence a vote or fights with players of the same rank to decide who will rise in the hierarchy. A rich dish therefore, at least from a management point of view, with the option, once a certain level is reached, to embark on real global wars capable of giving the winner global fame. But however relevant the clash is, the fulcrum remains the evolution of our community, with research and characteristic skills that make each faction in the game unique and peculiar. In short, the general aim is to grow one's domain by transforming villages into flourishing cities to give life to an important family. But to do this it is not enough to blindly accumulate resources and it is necessary to deal with the global balances, which are obviously linked to the aforementioned political component, and above all with the morale of the population, a thorn in the side of every ruler. So all is well, at least on paper, but in the field the perspectives change with the battles that are really too limited even for a free to play title. You fight in a rectangle, in the center of which we find the fort, with the military forces fighting automatically. The fundamental elements are the defensive structures, to be developed in a specific management section also linked to research and development, and the placement of the units that must protect all sides of the structure. Fighting can be simple villagers, obviously rather weak, as well as archers, warriors and spearmen. Then there are moats, knights and siege weapons, necessary to carry out attacks on the most complex and best defended castles. An experience diluted over time The complex management component makes the online turn of the series very interesting, but Firefly could have done more since it brings us back a 10-year-old engine. The limited combat and the biblical timing of the title, to which non-paying users are subjected above all, bring to mind the first browser games and therefore evoke a gameplay more from the workplace than from hardcore RTS. Furthermore, in exchange for the social component, much of the excellent atmosphere of the first chapter is sacrificed which could have easily coexisted with the online formula. And it wouldn't even have been difficult to introduce new side features with a medieval flavor. Parties and tournaments, in Defender of the Crown style, spring to mind, which among other things would be very suitable for a strategic game that can be played via the web. The side dish is ultimately fluctuating even if fortunately it is not without goodies such as the possibility of watching the battles involving our province on a deferred basis. Unfortunatelywhile the whole title is based on an outdated and cumbersome interface and in this case the lack of a redesign is truly unforgivable. Finally, the Italian language is missing while crashes abound which are decidedly inexplicable given the modesty of the technical sector.", "date": "2012-06-28", "grade": "6.8"}
