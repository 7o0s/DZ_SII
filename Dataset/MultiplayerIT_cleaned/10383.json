His most popular product is undoubtedly Battlefield 2: Modern Combat, but he has also contributed to the creation of highly valuable simulations such as Race and GTR 2. When his career as a game designer began, Commodore computers were already a thing of the past from the past, yet his latest creation, Dark Nebula - Episode One for iPhone and iPod Touch, closely resembles some Amiga 1200 titles. It's a difficult thing to explain, but the spatial setting combined with very fluid scrolling and a certain type of sound accompaniment create that mix of sensations that for years have been the exclusive prerogative of that personal computer born in 1992. The idea behind the game it's very simple, as it uses the accelerometer to transform our iPhone into a horizontal support plane on which to slide a virtual sphere. Tilting the device forward causes the sphere to move forward, tilting it backwards has the opposite effect, and clearly more tilt results in acceleration proportional to the input. Balance and precision Surely you will have seen, in some bar, the rudimentary game of skill that Dark Nebula - Episode One is clearly inspired by. In that case it was necessary to control a horizontal plane trying to get a marble to end up in the desired point, avoiding holes and obstacles along the way, and on the iPhone the same happens but in a different context: not a closed ~maze~ that can be easily controlled from above , but a path that develops vertically and that always confronts us with new pitfalls. We cannot know what awaits us ahead, so it is essential to be ready for anything and react quickly. As mentioned above, the title developed by 1337 Game Design combines action, platform and puzzle elements. Very often the sphere we control has to overcome barriers after acquiring a certain energy shield, support moving walls that can launch it towards places that are anything but hospitable, keep its distance from spikes and chasms, and finally calibrate the speed when there is to make a jump on the platforms. Each stage ends with the coupling of the sphere by a device that transports it to the next area, and the arrangement of the levels cleverly alternates slower and more reasoned sections with others in which speed is the predominant element. Stardust The space setting does Dark Nebula - Episode One justice, creating the necessary contrast to distinguish the metallic sphere moving across the screen at any moment. The colors used are more or less always the same, so the scenarios all end up looking very similar, but the combinations and shades denote a good dose of style and the graphic elements are not repeated systematically, thus creating a minimum of variety . A product like this, which relies completely on the accelerometer for controls, requires very smooth scrolling without uncertainties, which has been successfully achieved. The response to our requests is punctual and all too precise, in the sense that ~corrections~ have probably been made which in some way help us to keep the sphere still when we are about to reach an abyss. And that can only be a good thing. The sound accompaniment is of great atmosphere, excellent both in terms of music and effects. The tested version is 1.0", "date": "2009-11-16", "grade": "8.0"}
