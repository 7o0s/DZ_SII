The search continues... Despite the apparent narrative autonomy of the Game Boy Advance spin-off, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, right from the start and from the splendid introductory computer graphic film it is clear that the cartridge for the Nintendo handheld represents a practically playful experience. essential to fully understand the complex storyline of this sequel. Fortunately, Jiminy Cricket's diary summarizes all the events of the two prequels quite clearly, accessible immediately after the long prologue. And it's really a very long introductory phase, the one in which we will take control of Roxas, a kid from Twilight Town who is spending a fun-filled summer with his lifelong friends. Between one prank and another, however, Roxas is haunted by dreams and visions of an unknown boy and incredible battles he's never had anything to do with... at least until his connection to Sora is revealed. our true protagonist, who once the prologue is over we will return to impersonate, in his spasmodic search for King Mickey and his beloved friends Riku and Kairi. With him again Donald Duck and Goofy, but against him this time there is the mysterious Organization XIII that those who have played Chain of Memories will remember very well: a group of hooded individuals with extraordinary powers who aim to conquer Sora's Keyblade for shady purposes. How will Riku, the evil Ansem, Mickey Mouse and the mysterious world of Kingdom Hearts fit into it are just some of the questions raised by the plot, and gradually clarified through Sora's adventure, which will lead him to revisit worlds such as Atlantica or Olympus Coliseum and landing in unexplored places such as Port Royal and the wild Pride Lands... Gummi Ship! In Kingdom Hearts II, Chip and Dale also return and their Gummi Ship, a mini-game that if in the first one it was almost an irritating interlude, in this sequel it is simply fabulous. Drawing heavily on the legacy of Panzer Dragoon, the new shooter levels aboard the Gummi Ship, to be faced to reach the new worlds, are extremely spectacular, frenetic and complex, with an exaggerated amount of enemies to destroy and secret items to to collect. The latter can be used through a very complete editor to modify and enhance the aesthetic and war characteristics of the shuttle: the limit is only your imagination. Too bad for some sporadic drop in frame, understandable considering the amount of polygons and visual elements present on the screen in the most agitated phases. When style surpasses playability...? With Kingdom Hearts II Square Enix has tried to remedy the gaps in the gameplay of the prequel, significantly modifying the combat system with the addition of new options and possibilities, an operation unfortunately only partially successful. The new battle-system proves to be incredibly more spectacular than the already frenetic first episode, and towards the final stages Sora has an enormous amount of combat and defense skills, which become available as the adventure progresses and Sora increases in size. level: skills can be equipped in a limited number of available ~sockets~, which will increase with the passage of levels or suitable equipment. However, you have to choose carefully which skill to activate and which not, given the essentiality of some and the dubious usefulness of others, but the fact is that Sora will start in possession of a simple three-hit combo, to get to launch even eight in sequence, fluttering in the air and parrying and countering the opponent's attacks at will. The same system applies to Goofy, Mickey and the supporting characters, so there is certainly no lack of variety, and it is possible to discreetly customize your team. The downside for the amount of attack skills already available in the middle of the game is the passing of spells into the background: their usefulness is decidedly reduced as is the frequency of recourse to the canonical elemental attack spells, with the healing spell relegated as a last resort in fights. This also occurs due to the double utility represented by the Magic Point indicator, also necessary for the various summons available during the adventure: only the Genie and Tinker Bell from the old guard return, joined by Stitch and Chicken Little. Summons temporarily affect the fight differently, so while the Genie performs daring special attacks, Chicken Little even transforms the game into a First Person Shooter with some baseballs toammunition. However powerful and fun the evocations are, however they remain bound to a divertissement without being substantially influential for practical purposes, also due to the time necessary to enhance them. A game fairy tale...? It is not difficult to talk about Kingdom Hearts II from a purely technical point of view, since it is incredible from every point of view. Only a handful of minor flaws undermine the visual perfection achieved by Square Enix in the making of this sequel: the camera, more manageable and natural than the prequel, still tends to get a bit confusing, perhaps due to the excessive frenzy of the clashes, which also causes some very slight drops in frame rate. Everything else is great. Once again Square Enix places the emphasis on the animation of the various polygonal models, incredibly fluid in every movement, which together with an exceptional care for their facial expressiveness makes them indistinguishable from a real Disney cartoon, from which it follows the particular facial expressions and gestures. Even Jack Sparrow (in the only world, Port Royal, which clashes a bit with the cartoon style due to its exceptional realism, recalling ~Who framed Roger Rabbit?~) perfectly follows the cinematic Johnny Depp in every movement and detail . The richness of details and the careful choice of colors make each world a jewel of programming, thanks also to the stylistic variety proposed both by the location and by the interface: not only do Sora and his associates' costumes change according to the world visited, but also the graphic style of the menu. Loyalty to the feature films source of inspiration is total, the world of Tron is an example, and the original worlds designed specifically for Kingdom Hearts II are splendid. Almost completely absent unpleasant clipping or aliasing effects, Kingdom Hearts II with its spectacular fights full of explosions and particle effects of all kinds and types definitely looks like a moving cartoon. The musical accompaniment, on the other hand, is equally splendid: the songs by Yoko Shimomura and Kaoru Wada take up the main themes of Disney feature films, reworking them with an often epic trend in the most memorable sequences. The unpublished tracks are equally accurate and always very suitable for the action, without any flaws, guaranteeing a decidedly cinematic play experience. It also contributes to an exceptional voice acting, probably among the best ever made for a video game, thanks to the contribution of professional actors who guarantee the characters an extraordinary vitality and realism. Despite the impressive technical department, Kingdom Hearts II does not fully convince. It turns out to be mostly an exercise in style, a show of skill for the Square Enix artists, who have pulled a beautifully packaged product out of the hat from an aesthetic point of view. For heaven's sake, Kingdom Hearts II is extremely fun and guarantees about forty hours (more, counting the extras) during which a well-thought-out plot unfolds even if it is not without some inconsistencies. The problem is that the main activity, combat, in the long run is affected by the extreme simplicity and linearity, masked by the dozens of skills available: between spells, summons and Drives, in the end the battle-system is reduced to a frenetic pressure of a key. Square Enix has preferred the spectacular, visual and narrative, somewhat neglecting a gameplay that is still interesting and full of potential. However, this sequel remains an extremely valid product, recommended for lovers of the saga, Disney, Square Enix and for those who do not want something too complex or demanding. The road is the right one, if Sora will live another adventure we can well hope that this Kingdom Hearts II will be the basis for a next, true masterpiece. Pros Technically superb Excellent plot and perfect combination of Disney and Square Enix The Gummi Ship is a game within a game Gameplay definitely full of possibilities... Cons ... but little varied battle-system Summons management system and abstruse Drive Difficulty fluctuates Drive and Reaction Another addition to the battle-system is the important Drive Gauge: proceeding in his research, Sora will learn the ability to merge with one or both of his teammates, temporarily acquiring greater power. The selected Drive also influences the fighting style, so while the fusion with Goofy enhances Sora's attack capabilities with new skills and special moves, the one with Donald Duck influences his arcane abilities, increasing the effectiveness of magic and transforming the Keyblade in a kind of gun to be used at a distance. The later forms are obviously more and more powerfuland spectacular, but each form requires leveling up to be effective against new enemies, and unfortunately it's not always easy or fast: if Goofy's form only requires hitting enemies, the others require, for example, defeating only one certain type. It follows that the increase in the level of the Drive does not go hand in hand with the growth of Sora and the progress in the adventure, remaining bound to optional ~grinding~ sections of the necessary experience. A final element that completes the picture proposed by Square Enix in Kingdom Hearts II is the fundamental and frequent Reaction Command: often during the fights it is possible to press a key to activate special actions by Sora, normally in the form of counterattacks or special shots . The Reaction Command basically allows you to launch a spectacular and damaging attack on your enemies, turning every fight that involves it into a fireworks display; moreover, each boss must be faced precisely by virtue of the Reaction Command, which generally exposes its weak point or allows you to damage an equally invulnerable enemy. A prime example is probably the hardest boss in the game, Xaldin, where using the Reaction Command is simply necessary to defeat it. This system, ingenious and aesthetically gratifying, ends up partially ruining the combat system: in case you hadn't guessed, Kingdom Hearts II becomes more and more a continuous and repeated pressure of the attack button, occasionally interspersed with the pressure of the Reaction button, and considering that every enemy or boss requires its use, you can easily play the game on standard difficulty without even looking at the screen. The main flaw of Kingdom Hearts II is in fact the high simplicity and repetitiveness of the battle system: the decidedly small size of the various worlds to explore, reduced to a handful of screens and little more, does not help either. Atlantica, for example, which was probably the largest world in the prequel, is just a sequence of fun musical mini-games in Kingdom Hearts II. Nevertheless, the exploration of the worlds offers a certain variety of play, even if 80% of the game consists in devastating hordes of enemies by repeatedly pressing the X or the Triangle, while collecting the materials necessary to build new objects using the abstruse option in Chip and Dale shop. When Kingdom Hearts was announced four years ago, everyone thought it was an elaborate joke: the encounter (or clash?) between two imaginary worlds as distant as Disney and Square Enix was absolutely unlikely. That Cloud Strife could fight alongside Mickey Mouse was the embarrassing dream of those who remained a little child inside, loving both Uncle Walt's creatures and the heroic protagonists of Final Fantasy. In the end, everything was really true, and Square Enix launched a product on the market that struck the PS2 toy library like lightning, becoming one of the most popular titles ever: an action/adventure in which you explore the worlds of the most famous Disney fairy tales and the bad guys on duty are fought alongside the heroes who filled our childhood, with a wink to existential issues and a much more adult plot than The Little Mermaid. The success of Kingdom Hearts was such that Square Enix developed a spin-off / sequel for Game Boy Advance, working simultaneously with the official sequel for PlayStation 2, in which the great mysteries remained unsolved at the end of the first episode would be answered. In short, after so many years, here we are, with Kingdom Hearts II within reach of joypads and enormous expectations: but have they really been met?", "date": "2006-10-09", "grade": null}
