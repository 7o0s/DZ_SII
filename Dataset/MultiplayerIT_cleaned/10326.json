{"name": "Il mondo di Dyson", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71890-eufloria-eufloria.html", "text": "Eufloria is the commercial version of Dyson, a videogame experiment developed last year to participate in the prestigious (?) Procedural Generation Competition, a contest reserved for videogames based on the ~on the fly~ generation of game assets (level structure, rather than textures or three-dimensional models). The original title of the game was therefore a sort of tribute to the American physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson (here too, the quotations abound) who, as part of the Orion project, dedicated part of his research to theorizing the Dyson Spheres. Particular cladding structures designed to capture the energy produced by celestial bodies. As a corollary, Dyson hypothesizes the conception of genetically modified plants capable of growing on comets and therefore producing a breathable atmosphere simply by exploiting solar energy. Such plants, known as Dyson trees, would have allowed mankind to use comets as a kind of improper starship, thus allowing us to colonize solar systems outside our own. Minimal strategy Eufloria has exploited Doctor Dyson's theories to offer a sort of real-time strategy devoted to the colonization of dreamlike solar systems formed by asteroids halfway between being uni-cellular and the more classic two-dimensional celestial bodies with a spherical shape. The procedural nature of the title means that the structure of each level is never the same as the one played in the previous game, although you will soon discover that, paradoxically, just like in Tomasi di Lampedusa's novel everything changes so that everything remains as it is. At the beginning of each game the player owns one or more asteroids on which trees of different types are planted (Dyson or Defense) and around which special... seeds are stationed. Depending on the difficulty and level of play, only a finite number of trees can be planted on each asteroid, while each tree will always cost ten seeds without distinction. To colonize (or conquer, as the case may be) the other asteroids of the current system it will be necessary to send, possibly en masse, one's seeds. Seeds are born only on Dyson trees, therefore - at least theoretically - the player is left with the choice to carefully decide the balance between generation and defense from opponents' seeds. The whole thing may seem simple, not to mention simplistic. And indeed it is. Although the title is full of charm and charisma, from a purely playful point of view Eufloria fails to stimulate and, even worse, to represent a real degree of challenge. Perhaps in order not to risk too much in terms of balancing the difficulty of the game, the developers have well thought of giving the opposing factions a tactical style that defining wait-and-see is an understatement. Except in very rare cases, the swarms of insects, pardon, opposing seeds do not dare to attack our asteroids unless they have been openly provoked by our aggressions. This translates into the fact that as long as you have planted at least a couple of defense trees, you can literally leave your gaming position, even for several minutes, and then conquer the universe thanks to the accumulation of seed generated in the meanwhile. In this context, personal graphics and stylish music alone cannot save us from this universe of videogame boredom. The same ~special~ levels present within the game and intended for more experienced players fail to revive the game's fortunes. Too often the unknown to finish a level is never the ~how~ to succeed, but the ~how long~ one will have to wait for the production of the units necessary to invade a new asteroid. In short, we just have to place hopes in any content developed by the community, natively supported by the game.", "date": "2009-12-09", "grade": "6.5"}
