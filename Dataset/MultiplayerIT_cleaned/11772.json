{"name": "Undercover: Operation Wintersun - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/undercover-operation-wintersun-recensione.html", "text": "Interface and graphics The game interface is very simple and intuitive, especially for those who eat bread and adventure every day: with the left mouse button you examine the objects, while with the right button you collect, use and combine them in the inventory ( located at the bottom of the screen). There are not many frills to describe, if not the different icons depending on the action to be performed, which are also a canon of the genre. In fact, playing a little, one realizes that innovations, even the minimal ones, can be superimposed on absolute zero (the one that freezes gold armor, rowanberries) and that in terms of gameplay there isn't much relevant to report . Even the graphic style is very conventional and recalls, in the settings and colors, the classics of war films. There aren't many stylistic quirks to tell, given that the developers have chosen to focus on a cold realistic style and without particularly lyrical moments. Some scenarios are certainly good, but generally you get the impression that they fail to make their mark and there is not much memorable to describe. The visually best moments are certainly those that correspond to the twists and turns, which we certainly don't tell so as not to spoil the surprise. The engine that moves the game represents the scenarios in 2D, while the characters are three-dimensional. The latter are objectively ugly, due to the endemic lack of details and the angularity of the faces, accentuated by the mediocre textures. Frankly, we cannot understand what the recommended 2.5 GHz processor is due to to make everything run at its best, since there is nothing exceptional to move. Storytelling and puzzles Having overcome the examination of the technical characteristics, let's move on to the two key elements for every graphic adventure: the narration and the puzzles. Undercover: Operation Wintersun is a good level spy story, with a classic story, fairly articulated but certainly not very original. As already mentioned for the visual style, the narrative style also follows the typical patterns of the genre without trying to venture into gray areas that are little traveled and certainly more risky. The end result is pleasant and interesting, while it lasts. Unfortunately, despite the presence of well-placed twists, there is nothing that will remain in the story. The dialogues are well written and well translated into Italian. The speech, however, is in English. As a side note, we can say that we would like to see more courage from the developers. This is generally speaking. Graphic adventures are dedicated to a niche of players capable of appreciating even more complex plots and stronger themes. We are not hoping for the birth of a kind of videogame intellectualism but, given the genre, we would like to see greater courage and the ability to detach ourselves from certain underlying reasons that now smell a bit old. good level spy story, with a classic story, fairly articulated but certainly not very original Storytelling and puzzles PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 1.0 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: DirectX 9.0 compatible and equipped with 64 MB of DirectX 9.0c memory DVD Player 2 GB of HD space Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium 2.5 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: DirectX 9.0 compatible and equipped with 128 MB of memory Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment Undercover: Operation Wintersun is a decent graphic adventure that fans of the genre will like even if they never manage to take flight. The main problems concern a rather anonymous technical realization and the inability to dare that makes it fly low throughout its development. Some well-made puzzles fail to fully compensate for these ~personality~ problems that condemn it to being a niche product dedicated only to diehard enthusiasts. Pros Discreet plot Good level puzzles and well integrated into the scenario Agile and functional interface Cons Mediocre from a technical point of view Nothing memorable to report It would take a little more courage Undercover: Operation Wintersun is available for PC. How many game developers would be broke if WWII hadn't been fought? The various corns of duty (apart from the last one) and slaps on honor would never have existed and we would certainly have lived better (or worse, according to the carnival dress of one of the English princes a few years ago). In short, this magnificent preamble of a few lines serves to introduce a graphic adventure set duringand the Great War (1943 to be precise) in which you take on the role of a bespectacled English professor (the physicist John Russel) who must be able to prevent the sympathetic Germans from equipping themselves with the uranium bomb, with which they would dominate the world ( if they had exported squalid shows and mediocre formats they would have succeeded anyway, running many less risks). To do this, our hero will have to go to the tiger's den and walk on sandwiches in order to stack them, in the meantime avoiding that big frankfurters kill him mmmmm, no, that's not the game. And there's not even salt to use as a weapon. In reality Undercover: Operation Wintersun is an old-fashioned point and click graphic adventure in which you have to solve a bunch of puzzles managing to find and use various objects in the right way. There is no shortage of puzzles for the enigmatic week with sheets of paper to recompose, clocks to fix, wheels to spin and various other gadgets to stand between you and the final sequence.", "date": "2007-12-03", "grade": null}
