{"name": "Forgive Me Father", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forgive-me-father-recensione.html", "text": "The city where he lives is gripped by unspeakable horrors awakened by ancient creatures whose very existence is a blasphemy. He is a devoted priest who, faced with the advance of the underworld, decides to embark on the enterprise of reaching the heart of evil to wipe it out. Who will he meet at the end of the journey? Suffice it to say that we are dealing with a splatter first-person shooter inspired by the mythology of Lovecraft to understand it (more or less, since things get more complicated as you progress). In fact it is a revealing detail, which should make you understand how this story could end, if it is worth living it, as we will try to clarify in the review of Forgive Me Father, a first person shooter with a vintage taste that seems come from a dimension where Half-Life 2 never came out. Gameplay Lovecraft, were we saying? Forgive Me Father immediately clarifies its adherence to the school of modern shooters that look to the past, or modern vintage if you prefer: the graphics engine seems to have come out of the first half of the 90s, at least from the point of view of the general feeling, with the classic maps with an abstract design, the 2D sprites of the enemies that always look towards the player and a gameplay based essentially on shooting and dodging, despite the presence of a skill tree (the experience points with which you level up are obtained by killing the enemies). So you advance, look for some colored key to open locked doors, read documents to understand what is happening, shoot enemies who, by exploding, smear floors and walls with blood, and manage active skills and health so as not to die before time, in a world designed in the style of a pulp comic whose graphics have one of the elements that most distinguish it from the competition. The enemies, of them, are all creatures that seem to come from the pages of a story Lovecraft. So we have normal citizens transformed into crazy and death-hungry monstrosities, priests who summon tentacled monsters, shady hooded figures who shoot very fast projectiles, cursed beings who shoot bursts of a lethal compound and so on and so forth. There are also bosses, placed at the end of the episodes (each episode consists of several levels), which needless to say are Lovecraftian creatures. In short, the source of inspiration for Forgive Me Father should be clear to you by now ... consider that there is also a mechanic linked to the madness of the protagonist, which allows you to use some powerful skills. The more you slaughter, the better you slaughter, the stronger you get in this game. The arsenal with which our sympathetic priest spreads death and destruction is indeed quite classic: a knife, various pistols, a shotgun, machine guns, a kind of biological cannon and more. As a genre, ammunition and medium kits must be searched for in the maps. The city has gone mad, but luckily the police are there ah no. So don't expect to see the health bar rise by itself, but be prepared to get busy hunting for supplies, often even risking your life. Many of these aspects are also linked to the progression of the character, given that the skills that can be unlocked by spending the points accumulated by leveling up allow you to obtain new weapons, improve some characteristics of the character, increase the amount of transportable projectiles for each weapon, upgrade weapons owned and so on. Vocation problems Some levels are more atmospheric than others Forgive Me Father is a very direct title in its objectives, so much so that it has sacrificed any complexity of the gameplay or narrative to the actual shootings. There are enemies everywhere, and some skill with the genre is required to overcome certain situations. Too bad that, unfortunately, it has several problems that do not allow it to excel and which lead us to speak of a qualitatively fluctuating experience. The most evident one is in the level design and in how the choice to create interactive and fixed checkpoints (therefore no free saves) has led to not just some distortions, which compromise the experience as a whole a bit. Basically to save you have to reach the columns under which there is a drunk homeless person to interact with. What will appear to most as a simple gimmick of little impact is actually decisive for how the levels are built. What did we say about Lovecraft? Basically the save points become bottlenecks in which to bring together the different areas from time to time. The player is actually forced to cross them, otherwise he won't be able to save. This entailsa fairly disorganized construction of the levels, focused as it is on these bottlenecks, which forced the level designers to create real funnels in which to bring the player together, limiting the possibility of opening the levels. Another problem is represented by the positioning of the checkpoints, sometimes too far from each other, other times too close together. Thus it happens that you die and have to redo long sections of the game without having much incentive (the position of the enemies is always the same, as well as that of the consumables), or you end up with two save points close together, the usefulness of which is really doubtful.C 'it must be said that the advanced levels are better than the first ones, because they are more articulated and varied. Unfortunately to get to see the best you have to pass some really flat maps. It almost seems that the developers have learned some principles of map design along the way. Who did this to poor mice? It's also a shame that for almost the entire game they have resorted to some really incorrect tricks to put the player in difficulty, such as making enemies appear behind him in areas that have just been cleaned up, or making them rain a large number on him by making them come from who knows where. Then the problem is not so much dying, which can also be there in a video game, as having to redo entire pieces of a level after having suffered an impropriety. The paradox is that this way of putting the player in difficulty ends up slowing down the pace of a gameplay that gives its best when lived at maximum speed, because basically this is the nature of Forgive Me Father, as well as its greatest point of Force.", "date": "2022-04-06", "grade": "6.5"}
