Brawl - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-smash-bros-brawl-recensione.html", "text": "The Smashing Plumbers Super Smash Bros., beyond any pleonasm brought by time, is on the battlefield showing its essence, without which it would not have become what it is: difficult to label as a fighting game, impossible to insert into another genre, it is a fighting game in which two to four opponents face each other, aided by weapons of various kinds, who are eliminated not by resetting a hypothetical energy bar, but by throwing themselves out of the ring. The more an enemy is hit, the more likely it is to be knocked off the pitch. In this series the aerial phase has always had a decisive importance, so much so that the gravity is different from what we find in reality, it is not credible, the falls are slightly slowed down while the phases on the ground run at normal speed. Because of this characteristic, a sort of idiosyncrasy develops in many of the players who approach the saga for the first time, remaining estranged - often unknowingly - from the unreality of the clash. The controls themselves are not as soft and welcoming as those of other Nintendo games, but rigid, angular, require an effort to be governed: once you understand them, however, they guarantee a great depth, which is probably not found in any other production of the Japanese company. Character you use, custom you find The characters of Smash Bros. (twelve in the first, thirty-five in the latter episode) are characterized by a common denominator: their actions differ in the facts, not in the formulation, which is always the same and is limited to the possible combinations between the various tilting the analog stick and pressing two buttons, one for basic attacks, the other for special attacks (as well as the jump and defense buttons, plus pressing any two of your choice at the same time to grapple). The clashes are a continuous movement of pawns at exorbitant speed, of moves and countermoves, in which the one who is more imaginative and quick with fingers and mind wins. By virtue of the particularity of the play mechanics, Smash Bros. has extremely varied characters: some differ in special moves, others in the basic ones, still others in both. Each of the thirty-five, except for the rare ~doubles~, or almost identical characters but with speed and strength calibrated in a different way, has its own characteristics, so much so that there are fighters who are truly antipodes, some fast, not very powerful and capable of flying, others slow, huge and firmly planted on the ground, some with thrown weapons, others who can only count on physical contact. During the battle you can collect the objects that arrive on the stage, which are also many, aids ranging from useless to lethal; fortunately now it is easy to catch them even while running, unlike in the old games, while it is always possible to throw them and catch them on the fly, in some cases, so as not to suffer the impact. Impossible to describe them all, they would require a separate article, it should be noted that as usual, those who arrive first collect them, therefore they are not subject to the situation of the individual clash, they do not tend to help those who are losing. Sakurai's vivid vision made it possible to maintain a perfect balance despite the impressive amount of detail Character you use, custom you find Two particularly significant introductions in this area: a weapon to be built, divided into three parts, fatal if completed, and a sphere that unlocks the super-smash (a move stronger than the others) of each character, capable of altering by itself , at least partially, the outcome of a tender. The arenas, as well as the fighters, are of an excellent variety, even more than in the past: they range from classic, clean, without interference and with a stable framing, to others that continue upwards, alter, collapse or they are made up of a huge amount of platforms and contingencies. However, the best quality of these elements is that they intersect harmoniously with each other, forming a different melody each time, exponentially raising the quality and variety of the matches, of the tacit conversations that take place between the two wrestlers. Everyone can interpret Super Smash Bros. Brawl according to their needs, removing weapons, putting many of them on, playing time or lives, fighting only in duels or even in melees, in simple stages or in dynamic ones: you can get lost in all these portions of the game, which together form a huge fresco. Nintendo spent a lot to please Sakurai, but it paid off amply: the vivid vision of the single made it possible to maintain a perfect balance despite the impressive amount of detail. The Subspace Emissary The episodeprevious, Super Smash Bros. Melee, had hinted at a single player adventure that amalgamated the platform genre with scrolling fighting games, failing completely in its intent. Now more importance has been given to this mode, so much so that it represents a real game within a game lasting about ten hours, naturally variable according to the skill of the individual and the level of difficulty chosen; however, despite the FMV footage making it more interesting, despite the length and beauty of some sections, once again the goal was not fully achieved. Not that the adventure is superfluous, on the contrary, it is essential in enriching the single-player game, simply at a playful level it is not as perfect as the other parts, especially in the sections most tending towards the platform. As specified before, Smash Bros. has always had a particular gravity in the aerial stages, which works very well with the main structure of the series but which would be out of place in any other context, including of course platform games. Thus, while jumping from one area to another, it is strange to see your character slowly fall: the rhythm is swinging, syncopated, not suited to the situation. The fights themselves lose much of their bite and tactics when they take place against huge bosses, present - almost - only in this mode, which cannot be inserted into that broad but very strong scheme that subsumes all the playable characters. For the rest, the adventure is extremely pleasant, long and demanding, rewarding and appreciable especially in a cooperative, capable of evoking sensations often buried together with the old 8-bit consoles. The offline multiplayer is a total success, flawless as in the past: the CPU is able to keep up with even most of the best players, but the brilliance and inventiveness of the clashes between people are unmatched. the adventure is extremely pleasant, capable of evoking sensations often buried together with the old 8-bit consoles The Subspace Emissary Longevity in Smash Bros. has always been high, both for the quality of the concept and for the many intriguing minor modes (including the level editor), but in this last episode one has been included that could have made it infinite : the online. Heralded as a champion of the Wi-Fi Connection when neither game nor service yet existed, Super Smash Bros. Brawl is sadly its emblem for precariousness and simplicity, badly supported by the worst Nintendo netcode on Wii. Not that it's a total failure: in anticipation of the online Sakurai had accomplished another feat, managing to balance the game as much as the first Super Smash Bros. 64 without however renouncing the main advanced techniques, so dear to the so-called ~pro gamers~, introduced in Melee. The service is simplistic and limited, even anonymous if it weren't for the possibility of recording the clashes and exchanging the stages created with the editor. The worst aspect, however, is the netcode, not up to par with either Mario Kart Wii or Mario Strikers Charged Football, highly unstable, capable of going from almost lag-free games to some that are practically unplayable. Also considering the extremely slow opponent tracking system, it is possible to make perfect matches in terms of speed and quality only with a small group of acquaintances, to be added to one's list through the usual abnormal friend code. Nintendo bible There is another aspect of Smash Bros. that attracts fans, namely its being a kind of Nintendo Bible, a feature hinted at in 1999 and then expanded dramatically over time through information on the characters, its games and the history of the company ; the apex was reached with this last episode, which contains short demos of the titles that made the various fighters famous. However, although it is positive and interesting, especially since many of the Wii buyers do not own the old Nintendo consoles, this element has also caused negative consequences: Smash Bros. has always been able to absorb opposing playful elements, filter them and reconcile them through its wonderful concept, while on an aesthetic level, since its inception, it has been dominated by the charisma of all the series it combines inside. Excluding the instruction manual of the Nintendo64 episode, there has never been a chapter in the saga capable of amalgamating the many aesthetic canons it contains, always giving a signal of substantial inconsistency and dissonance with the impeccable playful synthesis it proposes. On the technical side, however, Super Smash Bros. Brawl is excellent, probably the best game seen on the Wii, including Super Mario Galaxy, but it is still private.or of its own ~style~, so much so that we go from the sublime of a battle set in Onett between Ness and Lucas (all elements taken from Earthbound), to the horror of a battle between Olimar and Ganondorf located inside a Game&Watch. Musically it borders on perfection, the best Japanese composers (in the field of videogames) have been involved, including the famous Uematsu, author of the main theme, halfway between the epic and the demented: this is the path that probably, even at aesthetic, Smash Bros. must follow. Comment A huge game, with complex and deep mechanics, infinitely varied and expensive like no other in Nintendo history, made up of thirty-five characters, about forty arenas and countless objects, despite its size it manages to be perfectly balanced thanks to foresight, persistence and talent by its creator, Masahiro Sakurai. The online is limited, the aesthetics still incoherent and the mechanics do nothing to appeal to players never captivated, but Smash Bros., despite these flaws, has marked the current decade as much as Mario Kart did with the previous one, with a pinch more quality and less historic. Pros Complex and deep mechanics Infinitely varied Awesome soundtrack Excellent multiplayer Technically flawless... Cons ... but the graphic style is still incoherent Online disappointing Single-player adventure not flawless", "date": "2008-07-04", "grade": null}
