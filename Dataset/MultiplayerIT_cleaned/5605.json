As is well known, Nintendo has chosen to take a particular path, trying to create products capable in some way of sowing the seed of the N-difference in a ~virgin~ user, with the ultimate goal of stimulating them to approach as a step subsequent to the consoles produced by the Japanese giant and therefore to its games. Sort of little Trojan horses, to be used with that ~blue ocean~ of largely casual users which until a few years ago represented the majority of the Wii audience. Miitomo is unfortunately too light and impalpable an experience to be able to entertain for a long time ask nintendo If this ambitious project will actually prove to be effective and successful, we will only find out in the future, perhaps when another handful of Nintendo-branded products have been released on the App Store and Google Play. Miitomo, meanwhile, is perhaps an unpredictable first step for those who thought they would see Mario, Luigi, Zelda or one of the ~top~ names in the company's stable take the field. On the contrary, it was chosen to take as a reference that Tomodachi Life appeared on Nintendo 3DS almost two years ago: it was a bizarre and original Life Simulator, a sort of ~The Sims~ in Nintendo sauce just to understand. Miitomo, described in a nutshell, is practically a (small) part of Tomodachi Life on steroids. Specifically we are talking about the more ~social~ aspect of the game in question, or rather the one linked to the relationships between the Miis and the interaction between them. The substantial difference is that if on Nintendo 3DS the other inhabitants were managed by the CPU, in this case they represent the virtual alter egos of real people, friends and acquaintances who can be added either ~in person~ or by picking them from those in one's list of Facebook and Twitter. Each of them, obviously including your own, is destined to have a different appearance thanks to the initial creation process which allows you to give life to a Mii by choosing somatic features, hair, eyes, mouth, nose, mustache, beard, height, weight , voice and so on, with an editor that is practically identical to the one that has been present on Nintendo consoles since the introduction of these nice stylized avatars. Miitomo then basically develops as a very simple social network, in which a large part of the experience revolves around a whole series of questions that users are asked and that friends can then comment on. These are concepts of various nature, ranging for example from preferences regarding the dish, the type of bread, the TV program or the season, passing through the last fun fact that happened, to what one does to relieve stress and what that you love more than cats, the best day of your life and so on. The software can also ask specific questions about one of the friends, such as what is the best quality of one of them. By accessing Miitomo you will then be able to read the answers of your friends, and possibly interact with them via a ~like~ (little heart), leaving a comment or reading those of others. In addition to this aspect, which represents the core of the product, it is also possible to customize the Mii with numerous items of clothing of all kinds, to be purchased through the appropriate shop with coins collected during one's activities or obtained through in-app purchase with figures capable of reaching even 74.99. Alternatively, they can also be obtained through the Mii Release, which is the closest thing to a real game in Miitomo: it is a minigame that resembles a Pachinko, in which one can have the hope of winning clothes and special items. Finally, there is the opportunity to take pictures of your Mii and retouch them in various ways, and then share the images with your friends. Unfortunately, however, all the element of personalization of the furniture of one's room is missing, present instead in Tomodachi Life, which would have helped to guarantee more substance and thickness. Miitomo is therefore basically all here: a limited software, intended to arouse initial curiosity, but then capable of probably only holding back for a few minutes a day users who want to tell their own stories and read those of others without a real and concrete purpose . Certainly the general slowness of the experience does not help, with frequent uploads that always last a few seconds too long, or with requestsfriendship tees to be approved strictly one by one (we do not wish you to have more than a handful to accept at the same time). And even the integration with My Nintendo and the consequent ability to collect platinum points to spend on prizes is a stimulus destined to prove insufficient after a short time. One last note on battery consumption, which is truly remarkable: the advice is to immediately activate the energy saving option, which improves things slightly.", "date": "2016-04-04", "grade": "6.0"}
