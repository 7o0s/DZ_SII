{"name": "Ministry of Broadcast", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ministry-of-broadcast-recensione.html", "text": "As we will see in the course of the review, Ministry of Broadcast tries to make us understand what it means to live in a dystopian world, oppressed by a regime that treats its citizens as cannon fodder, sacrificing them on the altar of propaganda. The plot puts us in the shoes of an inhabitant of a dictatorial state, who has only one way to reach his family: to win a bloody reality show in which the contestants must overcome arenas of increasing difficulty to gain freedom. What are we willing to do when given no other chance? How far are we ready to go? Can we really hope that our torturers will give us freedom? These and other questions will be answered in the course of what is essentially a cinematic platform game  la Prince of Persia, with very strong references to Flashback and, by themes, to more modern titles such as the Orwells or Inside. As the title suggests, one of the main references of the entire work is the novel 1984 by George Orwell, from which the Ministry of Broadcast takes the obsession of the regime for the control of its inhabitants, between cameras placed everywhere and an obtuse bureaucracy that brakes human relationships and every form of personal initiative. However, there is no shortage of hints to the Netflix series Black Mirror, with which it shares a lot, or to that Altered Carbon. But let's get back to us. Gameplay Arriving at the studios where the reality show is being recorded, the protagonist of Ministry of Broadcast will have to take up accommodation in one of the dormitories furnished for the contestants, under the careful supervision of the military, put in place to prevent escapes and problems of any other kind. The gameplay is made up of mechanics that without too many mysteries recall the titles already mentioned, Prince of Persia in particular. Our hero will then be able to run and jump, he will be able to cling to the platforms, positioning himself precisely under himself, or he will be able to lower himself down, he will be able to push crates, pull levers and interact with some elements of the scenarios, all to reach the end of the arenas in the shortest possible time. In general Ministry of Broadcast does not offer big news from the point of view of game mechanics compared to the competition, but it has a certain ruthlessness on its side which makes overcoming the levels interesting. In fact, on certain occasions we will have to exploit the other participants in the reality show, whether they are competitors or simple spectators, to get the better of certain obstacles. Incidentally: is there a 'spike trap' that is too long to jump normally? We can fill it with the corpses of normal human beings whose only fault was being hired for the network and then move on using them as a bridge. Is there a ferocious dog blocking our way? Just divert it to some unwitting protesters and the game is done. This is essentially the nature of the choices of the Ministry of Broadcast, which never poses real dilemmas for us, but puts us in front of abysses, metaphorically speaking, throwing ourselves into which we are forced to commit real atrocities if we want to survive and have any chance of completing our mission. It is certainly an interesting idea, but quite exploited and, in this case, completely subjected to the player who is never given alternative solutions to those established by the regime (is the game designer the real dictator?). For the rest Ministry of Broadcast is a fairly traditional title, which does not offer big ideas in terms of mechanics and meaning. Despite the mask of commitment, we are faced with a very normal platform with graphics that we could define realistic pixel art, between gray and flat buildings, pale skies, pink undergrounds, long-limbed characters and so on. It is certainly well designed and well animated, but already widely seen elsewhere. If we want the same can be said for the puzzles, all environmental: well designed, but already seen, based as they are on levers and timing. The first work by Ministry of Broadcast Studios therefore sins a little too much in excess of deference towards its models, which weakens its identity, transforming it into a pleasant experience, but in general a little too marginal to be truly memorable . Also noteworthy are some inaccuracies in the control system, which cause a few too many errors, and the drama of the chase sequences, which seem designed to be frustrating beyond measure and keep killing us until we understand exactly how to move. Luckily checkpoints are frequent, so you are never forced to redo long pieces of the level in case of death.", "date": "2020-02-08", "grade": "7.5"}
