{"name": "Control", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/control-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "The review of Control for Nintendo Switch undoubtedly marks an important moment for the Japanese hybrid console, which officially launches cloud gaming in Europe after having experienced it in Japan two years ago. Thinking about it, this is an unprecedented and exciting possibility, which allows you to ~run~ virtually any game on Switch, however complex it may be, through the simple transmission of streaming data. The downside is naturally represented by the requirements necessary to make everything work at its best, without perceptible latencies, compression tricks and various problems. So how does the cloud version of Control Ultimate Edition behave on Nintendo Switch with a 100 Mbit fiber connection? History The latest effort from Remedy Entertainment, Control tells the intricate story of Jesse Faden, a girl with telekinetic powers who suddenly finds herself playing the role of Director of the Federal Bureau of Control: a government agency that deals with identifying, isolating and study paranormal phenomena. The headquarters of the FBC, an ancient building called the Oldest House, has in fact been corrupted by the evil presence of the Hiss, an entity from another dimension who has taken possession of various operatives and transformed them into dangerous puppets in his hands, effectively creating an army that presides over all areas of the huge palace. Gameplay Equipped with the powerful Service Weapon, a modular pistol capable of assuming different configurations, as well as with an increasingly complete set of powers, our task will be to explore the agency's headquarters, eliminate threats, save any survivors and discover the origin of the evil in order to close the breach and save the world. The gameplay is that of a particularly frenetic and spectacular action shooter, made exciting by the supernatural abilities of the protagonist, who in addition to exploiting the numerous configurations he can grab and throw any object at enemies using his mind, create walls of debris to protect himself from attacks, and even levitate for a few seconds. The mix of these skills creates truly memorable sequences, in which we will find ourselves firing precision shots at some opponents, defeating others by crashing objects into them with the power of thought and quickly collecting the vital energy left on the ground by killed soldiers in order to restore health before suffering fatal damage. In correspondence with each area freed from the presence of the Hiss we will be able to conquer a control point, which not only acts as a checkpoint but also gives us the possibility to use the resources obtained for upgrades and travel quickly towards a another area of the setting, following the directions on a map that can be consulted at any time. Structure The structure of Control clearly refers to the metroidvania subgenre: as Jesse gains possession of new powers, objects and abilities, it becomes possible to access previously inaccessible sections of the map, which present a naturally increased degree of difficulty. By collecting the numerous documents scattered within the scenarios, secondary tasks are also unlocked that we will be able to complete to obtain extra rewards, thus enhancing the Service Weapon and our own skills, but at the same time accepting to try our hand at challenging boss fights that the authors have relegated among the subquests: a certainly original approach. The cloud version for Nintendo Switch The free demo of Control available on the eShop allows you to try the cloud version of the game for a few minutes and then check the quality of the experience over the connection. This is a fundamental aspect, which must be considered with lucidity given that it is not possible to ~rent~ the security but only buy it at the price of 39.99 Euros. In short, you must be reasonably certain of what you are doing, and even so expect some inevitable drawback due to the often fickle nature of the network infrastructure. Maybe it will happen (it happened to us) that the servers don't work well, or that Wi-Fi reception deteriorates, or that someone else connects to the internet at home, causing more or less perceptible drops, which however in an action shooters like that can easily translate into game over. Once the application has started, you can choose between two different modes, one focused on graphics quality and one on performance. The first allows you to play remotely on a PC equipped with an RTX video card, therefore with ray tracing to embellish the reflective surfaces, but mysteriously produces ana higher and clearly perceptible latency compared to the inputs. With a stream there shouldn't be such differences, but in this case there are. Better therefore to opt for the performance mode, which works well in a stable connection situation and therefore allows you to shoot enemies and use Jesse's powers without particular problems , enjoying a smooth experience, which in handheld mode also manages to well mask the inevitable video compression present in this cloud edition of the game. However, both modes have annoying delay problems in the audio transmission, which unfortunately ends up losing its charge of involvement and atmosphere between jumps and hiccups. At times it almost feels like sitting in front of a television with a faulty antenna, so it is clear that those looking for a flawless multimedia experience should not consider the streaming version of Control in the slightest. inevitably dirty, the many sequences in the dark are dotted with compression artifacts and, in general, the resulting experience is a lot 'arranged and shaky compared to what is available on PC, PS4 and Xbox One. If we then add some of the problems we encountered during the tests (such as full servers and the queue to respect: after paying 39.99 Euros? Seriously?), it is clear that this interesting experiment must be seen exactly for what it is .", "date": "2020-11-13", "grade": "7.0"}
