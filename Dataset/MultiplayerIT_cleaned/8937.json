{"name": "Gemini Rue", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/95609-gemini-rue-ho-visto-cose.html", "text": "Unlike what can happen with a good FPS or a high-level RPG, it's always difficult for an old-fashioned graphic adventure to be able to immerse the average player as effectively. The fixed screens, the repeated dialogues and the puzzles that inevitably end up breaking the pace of the game, are all elements for which the player often does not feel really projected into that alternative world created by the developers. The only way to emotionally involve the player is thus to leverage an excellent atmosphere and a strong narrative component, powerful weapons of a genre too easily given for dead. And that's exactly what Gemini Rue does, a cyberpunk work by Joshua Nuernberger that seems to mix narrative cues, tones and settings taken from the most varied cults of the sci-fi genre: from the obvious Blade Runner to the lesser-known Strange Days, while everything is proposed through a story  la Memento. Taking advantage of the recent launch on Steam, we have thus decided to tell you about what, on balance, is one of the most successful graphic adventures of the year. The two faces of adventure The Orwellian-tinged plot narrated by Gemini Rue opens on the gloomy and rainy Barracus, one of the planets that ended up under the dominion of an organization known as Boryokudan. The streets are constantly monitored, communications under control and soldiers visit the inhabitants in search of potential splinters or simply to have fun mistreating someone. Anyone who has strolled through Half-Life 2's City 17 will have a strong sense of deja vu, but in this case Azriel Odin, the game's protagonist, is there for a very specific reason: suspecting that the Boryokudans are involved in the disappearance of his brother, went to Barracus to meet a mysterious informant, spark that will kick off a rich and articulated plot. Among other things, the narrative choice is quite successful for which often, from the first minutes, the player finds himself controlling Delta-6, a boy held prisoner in a secret laboratory and subjected to some experiments by unknown figures. It should be emphasized that, despite this ploy, the game manages to intertwine the two stories very well and to carry them forward in parallel without ever breaking the rhythm of the narrative, and this is perhaps one of the greatest merits of the Californian developer's work, which never stops to be believable thanks to perfectly crafted and pleasantly dubbed dialogues. Precisely with regard to dubbing, the publishing collaboration with the independent label Wadjeteye Games has undoubtedly helped, considering that Gemini Rue shares almost all the entries with The Blackwell series. Also playing an important role in immersing the player even more is the retro style that characterizes the graphic component, with backdrops and sprites which, although far from the visual excellence found in other splendid 2D graphic adventures, manage to render impeccably the noir hues and the murky atmosphere. Atmosphere that is further highlighted by the spot-on soundtrack composed by Nathan Allen Pinard and which mixes ambient sounds with jazz pieces, reaching its peak in the melancholic pieces composed on the piano and bringing to mind the degraded futuristic world of the title thanks to some particularly you succeed. Between puzzles and shootings If so far we have insisted on the excellence of Gemini Rue in terms of its atmosphere and its ability to tell an intriguing story, this does not mean that the game lacks substance when you put your hand on the mouse, although this is precisely the moment in which the few but obvious flaws of the game emerge. Bouncing from Odin to Delta-6, the experience offers a successful mix of investigation and exploration, peppering the whole with a series of intriguing puzzles to solve or characters to interrogate. Unfortunately there are some moments in which it is necessary to give oneself to pixel hunting in search of details on the screen which, also thanks to the gloomy scenarios, end up being very little evident; fortunately these are quite rare cases, but if you combine them with the fair amount of backtracking required it is clear that they could annoy less patient players. It must also be said that, although the structure remains heavily anchored to the more classic point and click adventures, there are some more interesting and original ideas, an example of which is the way in which the player is able to push other characters to perform certain actions, or the use of terminals to gain access to confidential information. However, not everything went perfectly: from time to time Odin gets involved in intense discountsfire trios that see the player juggling a cumbersome combat system. You look for cover, hold your breath, aim and fire, but the number of keys required and the woodiness of the mechanism ends up making these shootings almost frustrating, although it is to be appreciated the attempt to at least want to break the 'tranquility' of the investigative sessions. Finally, to add further pepper there are some puzzles in which Boryokudan soldiers are on their heels and which must be solved within a time limit, increasing the tension and marking a clear departure from the relaxed and relaxed rhythms that usually characterize graphic adventures.", "date": "2011-11-16", "grade": "8.8"}
