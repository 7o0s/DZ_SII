A far from simple undertaking, since their dark companions immediately launch themselves in pursuit to prevent the two from achieving their goal. These are the premises of an action game that focuses heavily on form, perhaps leaving the substance a little in the background... Dynamic duo Crowman & Wolfboy belongs to the category of so-called autorunners, i.e. those typical games of the mobile world in which the protagonist runs independently along the scenario, while the user has the task of issuing specific commands to make him avoid obstacles, collect objects or take out enemies. In this case, however, there are two characters on the screen, but it doesn't take much to understand that it is a purely aesthetic implication that does not affect the gameplay in any way: the two monsters move in unison by responding to the same commands, with the only peculiarity of dividing the tasks according to their physical characteristics (the crow takes care of the jumps, the wolf of the climbs and so on). The progression during the adventure follows a classic level scheme, while it is precisely within them that the Wither Studios title brings out some slightly more personal touches, even if the play structure rests on well-known foundations: acting with one finger, the player must interact with the screen to reach the exit avoiding all the pitfalls and in the meantime collecting as many bonuses as possible. Initially, Crowman & Wolfboy can count on few skills, proving to be capable only of jumping, climbing stairs and reversing their direction of travel, but their baggage of knowledge gradually increases, also paving the way for backtracking processes to visit stages already completed and get 100% using the unlocked moves. In fact, each level has three objectives: to complete it without taking damage, to obtain all three spheres of light scattered around the scenario and to free a creature most often hidden in the most hidden recesses. The challenge is made more challenging by another peculiarity of Crowman & Wolfboy: the two are in fact constantly chased by the black wave of monsters who want to prevent their escape, and to keep it away - and thus avoid game over - it is necessary to collect with a certain frequency the orbs that dot the path along the stage. Crowman & Wolfboy remains impressed more for its beautiful atmospheres than for its gameplay This element, combined with a level design that allows very little room for error, makes Crowman & Wolfboy a particularly demanding title, which often approaches the threshold of frustration: many obstacles can only be overcome with millimeter jumps, and even the most negligible waste of time can lead to being caught up and suffocated by darkness, forcing you to start all over again. In this sense, the fact that the control system does not always respond perfectly to stimuli does not help: especially when the moves available increase in number, it is not uncommon to swipe across the screen expecting an action to see the two protagonists do it another, with all the unfortunate consequences of the case. We therefore proceed with the adventure with some effort, and there is no doubt that the experience with Crowman & Wolfboy is much more enjoyable if you are captured by its audiovisual qualities and its particular setting. The game objectively has a very fascinating impact, with graphics based exclusively on black and gray tones (with a result not too dissimilar to Limbo) and a soundtrack that perfectly underlines the melancholic tone of the story that forms the backdrop to the action . Once the initial effect is exhausted, however, this setting can also get boring when you realize that the stages are all basically the same, with changes that are felt only when you move to a new world.", "date": "2014-02-19", "grade": "7.5"}
