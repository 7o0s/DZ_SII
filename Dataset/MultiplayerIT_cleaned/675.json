{"name": "Peter Jackson's King Kong - Recensione Xbox 360", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/peter-jacksons-king-kong-recensione-xbox-360.html", "text": "King Kong died for our sins My name is Carl Denham, I'm the best director in Hollywood and, even if my producers don't think like me, today I'm going to mark the history of cinema by making the most beautiful film of all time. When everything seemed to turn against me, I luckily came into possession of an ancient map representing Skull Island and, may history not say Carl Denham doesn't jump at the chance of a lifetime, I immediately looked for a ship to sail into the unknown and beyond. Rumors surrounding me have made it difficult for me to find a suitable actress for the lead role, but I was lucky enough to meet Ann just when it seemed my plan would fall through due to lack of time. Ann Darrow is the result of Hollywood these days, an out-of-work New York actress just waiting for the first chance to dive into it. Hollywood has never understood Ann's greatness, I have. The ship left New York with a small crew at 8 in the evening, shortly before departure Jack Driscoll, my screenwriter, also joined us. Everything will work out perfectly, I'm sure.[...]After several days of travel, the Venture almost collided with the endless cliffs of Skull Island and my heart sank: the perfect location, the actress perfect, the perfect director. We have just disembarked and our crew's boats split due to strong currents, I didn't see when this happened, I was too busy with the preliminary environmental shots. Here on the beach I would like to shoot a couple of close-ups of Ann, they may come in handy: Scream Ann! Scream as if your life depended on it!... And so begins King Kong for 72 years now, and this is where the adventure begins: on the beach, with Ann's screams and the dark response from the hinterland. A frontline adventure The character on which the story will revolve almost completely will be the screenwriter Jack Driscoll who, armed with luck, will have to take on the responsibility of bringing to safety the small crew of the Venture landed on the island. The sections entrusted to him will be completely structured in a subjective view and will concern tasks such as solving puzzles, covering his companions from enemy attacks and paving the way for the rest of the group by extricating himself from the dense vegetation. During his wanderings he will be temporarily joined by other members of the team who will be able to provide him with useful support: Hayes, first officer of the Venture, will be our reserve escort of weapons, when we find ourselves in difficulty due to lack of weapons it will simply be possible to talk to him to have the one he's currently holding delivered; Jimmy is the youngest of the group and also the only other user of a firearm, Ann will be useful for opening the doors (more than once she will leave alone climbing the walls courageously to go and unlock unreachable levers) and for treating the wounds of comrades; and finally Carl useful to get into trouble in situations that are humanly impossible to imagine, just to have thirty seconds of extra footage. As a preliminary setting to the game it will be possible to set the absence or presence of aids such as the viewfinder displayed on the screen and the inventory of owned objects. Depending on this choice, it will be possible to set one's own level of approach to the adventure, but some considerations must be made: first of all, inventory means the simple display of the weapon in use at the top right of the screen and the number of bullets left , therefore no management of items, potions, bullets, keys and so on, as it should be, we must remember at all times that we find ourselves on an island forgotten by God, following a makeshift landing and that as far as the fate may be favorable you will never find trees dripping with healing potions, the skill of the player will be in managing weapons and forces to move from one area to another; the second consideration concerns the viewfinder, although it may seem immediate to think of a 'simplified' version of the game with the viewfinder of the weapons clearly visible, it must be said instead that the mode that does not have it is a little simpler due to the system of game that quietly overlooks accuracy and accepts even those close enough to the target as winning shots. Returning to the island and its hostilities, although the lack of weapons is sometimes felt (without going into too much detail: going through the valley of the brontosaurs armed with a disposable pike can be frustrating at times) it undoubtedly gives the game a much more realistic air, effectively increasing the tension of the player who must pay more attention to sipping strategiesevery single shot. The game is divided into chapters, each of these punctuated by a first short sequence in FMV which marks the path taken on the map (the graphic design closely resembles the one used for moving around in Indiana Jones, the film), and a second which retraces the highlights just experienced and sometimes anticipates those to come. Jack's journey within the island is defined a priori: it will never happen to find himself in front of an inextricable jungle and have to come out of it, the never acclaimed invisible walls guide the character and avoid him bad wanderings in unknown lands, it remains this is probably the only limitation to reality, a limitation on the other hand that is inevitable due to how the game is structured. the actual shortage of weapons leads the player to waste nothing A frontline adventure Along the way the player will have the opportunity to collect various weapons found in crates hanging from trees (parachuted from planes) or simply broken on the ground, when Jack picks up a weapon he will be forced to abandon the old one, this type of choice associated with the The actual shortage of weapons leads the player to waste nothing: more than once it will happen to find a chest on his way, temporarily abandon the ammunition and continue to look for animals to kill in order to completely run out of ammunition and then go back to the chest just passed to take the new load and start again. There will be various moments in which, once the ammunition is finished, it will be necessary to settle for the spades found along the way or simply the bones of dead animals extracted from the abandoned carcasses: as if to underline that the universe of King Kong is real and tangible the spades will be in number finished, if there are four leaning against a wall, only four can be taken; live in a different numerical universe instead the bones of animals that can be recovered in almost infinite number. Spades and bones will also play an important role in terms of puzzles: these can be set on fire to reveal secret passages, to light hearths or simply take down the most difficult enemies faster. The name is Kong, King Kong. Opposed to the figure of Jack Driscoll there will be Kong, the king of Skull Island. Kong is the second (and last) playable character during the adventure, his mission will be to chase and save Ann and fight against any enemy that will jeopardize his salvation. Kong will be played in the third person, with a control system that closely resembles the one used for Prince of Persia: it will be possible to move by running along walls, climbing trees and columns, jumping and clinging to branches to swing and jump again. The sections dedicated to Kong thrive on a constant dichotomy: on the one hand the task will be purely circus, or moving within a pre-established setting without falling or being too slow for the purpose of the mission; on the other hand, it will essentially be necessary to fight (big) hands against everything that moves and stands in front of us, Ann excluded. In the combat parts, the gorillon will have the possibility of performing different moves and countermoves, even if to be cynical everything could be resolved in a normal incoherent pressure of keys; things become different when you go from small enemies to bigger ones: V-Rex. Here a greater basic strategy will be needed to complete the fight and give Kong the possibility of executing one of the two final moves (a sort of animal-like fatality in which one takes the opponent by the jaws and opens him in two or hurls itself into orbit). The parts of the game where it is possible to use Kong, while representing the peak of enjoyment of the game, are undermined by two defects: excessive ease (as opposed to the rest of the game) and some evident stability problems in terms of frames (it will happen more than once the game slows down while performing your evolutions between walls and trees). Darwinism and the food chain. These are the two concepts behind the entire game strategy that can be implemented in King Kong, the real aspect towards which the game experience has turned weighs heavily on the life of Jack and his companions and so expedients are devised to avoid the direct clashes, to divert attention, not to waste bullets, to survive. One of the possibilities offered by the game is linked to the concept of the food chain: there are some non-dangerous animals on Skull Island that represent the last link in the chain, Jack will just have to stick one of themon his pike and throw it on the opposite side of the direction useful for him to move and distract the other animals present in the location; the carcasses of the larger animals will offer a succulent banquet to other smaller animals, leaving the protagonist's presence almost unnoticed. In the first encounter with the V-Rex, the only way to be able to distract him long enough to allow the others to escape, will be to shoot the pterodactyls flying above his head and thus offer a tribute of meat to the large dinosaur. The fittest survives said Darwin, but in King Kong cunning pays off. The fittest survives said Darwin, but in King Kong cunning pays off. Skull Island in the spotlight The graphics of King Kong on Xbox 360 must be considered from two distinctly different points of view, that of those who own an HDTV and that of those who are forced to play it on a normal CRT television. Compared to the excellent versions for the other consoles and PC, in fact, the Ubisoft game maintains the same engine and the same polygonal structures, but takes advantage of all those graphic effects that come naturally to the new Microsoft hardware: more defined textures, bump mapping on all the surfaces, the accentuated blur of when King Kong goes berserk and the dinosaurs that seem even more alive. However, this approach and the improvements made need high resolution to be better appreciated, with the risk, especially for the first levels set mostly at night, of resembling too much the other versions (among other things on TV 4:3, the image is not scaled, thus showing the black bands at the edge of the screen). When you get to the more advanced stages flooded with light and where the effects manage to make a difference, which otherwise would remain too little marked, unless you play it on an HDTV set, then skull island comes out in all his hostile poetry. The chromatic choices and certain visuals, however, confirm the personality and taste with which this game was conceived, a pity, however, that the team did not have more time to take full advantage of the new hardware. The results could have been truly excellent. Fully promoted the audio sector of the game, especially as regards the sound effects, beastly and gloomy. The dubbing, all in Italian, as well as well done is also functional to the gameplay, given that you have to follow the instructions of the npc in order to better overcome the different phases. Goals Like all Xbox 360 games, King Kong is also divided into a series of objectives which, if achieved, give the player points for online rankings. The Ubisoft game distributes 1000 points for 9 objectives, some have to do with the simple completion of the adventure, others, however, are recognized if some features are exploited properly. For example, ~King of the food chain~ is awarded if you pass a stage by exploiting the possibility of having dinosaurs of different species attack each other. Given the low aggressiveness of the title, if you are looking for 1000 Live points to get while having fun, King Kong is for you. Comment After years of mediocre tie-ins, published only to trivially exploit billionaire film licenses, the Ancel/Jackson union has given life to a small historical anomaly, a video game that manages to entertain more than the film it is inspired by. This, at least, is what we happened to think on several occasions for a game that conveys much more anxiety and uncertainty than the film on the screen can do. So off to skull island exploration, for a fun and fascinating adventure, but a little too short and which, if it had some form of online support even just for a cooperative mode, could have leave quite another mark on the longevity side. King Kong on Xbox 360 is confirmed as a good title and one that we cannot fail to recommend to all fans who want to explore Peter Jackson's project in every detail. Pros: The strong realistic component forces the player to think before acting Excellent sound Intuitive and comfortable control system The beasts in the game seem real Cons: The sections with Kong, although fun, are too simple poor longevity Xbox 360, on the graphic side, can give more The film industry has always been hand in hand with the video game industry, since time immemorial we remember more or less successful conversions of the most successful films in the cinema. The video game therefore intended not only as playful entertainment but also as an alternative advertising vehicle for a film.
