If numbers really matter, those of BtS are incredible and testify to a decidedly massive expansion. In fact, in front of us, 12 scenarios unfold plus a handful of mods, to which are added 10 new civilizations, 16 leaders, 8 wonders, 18 buildings and 25 units. if Warlords had imposed a decidedly militaristic turn, BtS also wants to broaden the other horizons, providing a wide range of alternatives to war All this represents only the purely quantitative part of the product, to which must be added the powerful innovations in terms of gameplay and game resources. BtS focuses the efforts of its authors in the most advanced eras, effectively filling what was the grossest lack of the basic version, i.e. that scarcity of content that manifested itself in Civ4 from the Renaissance era onwards, afflicting the second half of the game and revealing a certain haste in the realization. If Warlords had imposed a decidedly militaristic turn, BtS also wants to broaden the other horizons, providing a wide range of alternatives to war that allow supremacy to be obtained even without bloodshed. Well, ~almost~ without bloodshed. The most important innovations are undoubtedly a renewed espionage system and the presence of corporations. The rules of espionage have been rewritten from scratch and are now entrusted to a complex intelligence system, which acquires points in the same way as culture and research. Greater prominence was then given to the corporations, which borrow an existence similar to that of religions and whose propagation is entrusted to special emissaries. All of this of course, enriched by a greater number of rounds available for future eras. But Firaxis has not forgotten the modder community and has drastically enhanced the tools at their disposal, to the point of including in the game some mods developed jointly by the internal team and by groups of enthusiasts. Among these, Final Frontier certainly stands out, which brings expansion and conquest on a galactic scale, with totally renewed graphics, and Afterworld, with its tactical combats that mimic the legendary X-Com. Power wears down those who don't have it Let's say one thing right away, which certainly won't make Warlords owners happy: BtS includes the contents of the previous expansion. There are no scenarios, of course, but there is everything else, from Great Generals to civilizations, leaders and everything in between. Why? Why not. In this way, BtS is a candidate as a definitive expansion, capable of completing the game in all respects, without forcing the purchase of the previous module. A decidedly courageous move, which deserves the applause of passionate buyers. BtS is a candidate as a definitive expansion Power wears down those who don't have it As soon as the game is launched, we are faced with two possibilities: to play a free game from the beginning or to play one of the many scenarios proposed. Common sense recommends starting a game from scratch, so as to familiarize yourself first with the new features introduced, while you prefer to keep the scenarios for later, when you have become more familiar with the game. The thing that immediately catches the eye is the care with which the units of each civilization are made, which now show a characteristic aspect of their origin, so a Khmer settler will be different from a Japanese or a Dutch settler. As soon as you are contacted by an opposing leader, the first big news appears: the espionage indicator. We can assign points to it, subtracting them from wealth in the same way as we do with culture and research. From now on, intelligence operations assume a capital importance in the development strategy of civilizations. There are two types of espionage, active and passive. Assuming that we have accumulated a sufficient score, passive espionage allows us to take a look at the screens of the opposing advisers and discover the details of the civilization observed, for example the technologies possessed or the type of government established. Active espionage, on the other hand, requires an agent in the field to carry out missions of sabotage, poisoning, incitement to revolt and other nice little tricks that are done between one G8 and another. This means that we will have to take care to produce a spy and send him to foreign territories. Naturally, the spy will be invisible to other players, unless they have developed an adequate counter-espionage system, this means that we will be able to establish ourMrs Mata Hari or our Sam Fisher in any enemy square and let him stay there for a few turns. The more time passes, in fact, the greater the chances of success of the missions, but also the chances of being intercepted. Power wears down those who don't have it Naturally, setting up a substantial intelligence system requires money and so, in order not to suddenly be left with a deficit like that of Burundi, or even of Italy which does the same, that failed Nobel Sid Meier transforms the players into many managers of company and puts them at the head of one or more megacorporations, which soon assumed international if not global dimensions. The corporation system allows you to sacrifice some resources and turn them into fixed income and global benefits. To create the headquarters of a corporation requires the sacrifice of a particular Great Person. For example, the Creative Constructions was born through a Great Engineer and gives a production and culture bonus in every city where there is an office, but consumes iron, copper, marble, stone and aluminum and requires an expense for maintenance. Each turn, the guild owner receives a cash bonus for each city that hosts a headquarters. It becomes convenient, then, to assign the least used resources, to then see them pay off economically. A real low blow to the opponents is to create offices abroad, in order to use their resources and increase the expenses of the host cities, while the player enjoys the well-deserved revenues. Si vis pacem para bellum As mentioned, BtS emphasizes the less aggressive and brutal aspects of the game but this does not mean that it forces the player to sit idle when the going gets tough. The new units introduced are designed above all to fill certain gaps left open up to now, but they are no less powerful for this and, indeed, reserve more than a surprise for those who know how to use them well. BtS emphasizes the less aggressive and brutal aspects of the game but does not force the player to sit idle when the going gets tough For those concerned with coastal defense, the ultimate unit comes from the air and is the airship, capable of spotting submarines and effectively countering other ships, having a 100% bonus against naval units. But if you want to act dirtier and cause serious economic damage to your opponents, then you will certainly be happy to know that it becomes possible to block trade routes by sea, imposing embargoes on the main ports. The embargo is a feature available to naval units and of course worsens diplomatic relations with the affected leader, so you may feel more comfortable hiding your hand and sending a privateer to do the dirty work. This unit has the not insignificant feature of concealing its national identity and allows ~anonymous~ embargoes to be carried out, in order to leave everyone with a clear conscience and avoid unpleasant diplomatic consequences. Always remaining in the aquatic environment, another nice surprise is the attack submarine which not only allows you to transport a unit inside it, with all the advantages that this entails, especially if you want to infiltrate beyond enemy borders, but provides a very useful +50% attack against other submarines. Si vis pacem para bellum And again, BtS arms the player with tactical nuclear warheads, with limited range but easier to transport, stealth bombers, mobile artillery and more, but we don't want to take away the surprise of discovering all the new units introduced. Surely, the level of strategic depth reached is enriched by a wide range of different possibilities, allowing the player to choose whether to face a conflict openly or with underground sabotage actions, perhaps hitting the opponent's economy or health, rather than launching a full blown attack. The new units take into account many different nuances that are not necessarily military and when they are, they become crucial variables in the outcome of a clash. The siege rules, until now the cross and delight of every player, have been rewritten to give a better balance between the attacking and defending forces. The introduction of shock troops guarantees a quick and cheap resource to counter the arrival of armored vehicles in the city, while siege weapons can now no longer exceed a certain percentage of damage inflicted, beyond which it becomes necessary to use other unit to defeat the enemy. So a tank will be able to reduce the defenses of a city but will not be able to conquer it by itself. Nemesis of the besiegers now become the units capable of attacking on the sides, inflicting a large amountamount of damage to siege units. the siege rules, until now every player's cross and delight, have been rewritten to give a better balance between attacking and defending forces Si vis pacem para bellum With this in mind, the forts have been strengthened and made into real citadels, in which to land planes, albeit in limited numbers, and to dock ships, if there is naval access. They no longer have an upkeep cost but rather can be used to connect resources, so you can replace a mine with a fort but without losing the use of the resource in the box below. Last but not least, BtS finally adds a number of promotions for air units. The airport will work the same way as the barracks, for ground units, granting an initial experience bonus to newly built aircraft. New promotions increase intercept capability, view range, and the chance to retreat from an engagement. Fundamental skills to survive the newest mobile SAMs available after discovering the laser. another Brick in the Wall As always, in order to take full advantage of certain technologies and resources, you need to build the right buildings. BtS provides the player with a series of buildings which, for the most part, replace other existing buildings with unique versions, typical of certain civilizations. For example, the Byzantine Hippodrome takes the place of the Theater, while the Sumerian Ziggurat replaces the Palace of Justice. Each of these buildings has a little more bonus than the normal version, for example the Hippodrome has a +1 happiness, which the Theater lacks, and so on. Therefore, each civilization now has small characteristic features that make it unique but without major imbalances in the overall picture of the game. the player can ~liberate~ some cities, creating independent colonies, managed by the AI, which will effectively behave like vassal states another Brick in the Wall These buildings are flanked by others, common to all civilizations, which allow a sort of ~fine adjustment~ of civic parameters. By building a public transport system, the population gains in terms of health and with the customs, the revenues of the maritime trade routes increase. By building an embankment, on the other hand, it will be possible to obtain an extra hammer from each river space in the vicinity of the city. Naturally, the Dutch will prefer to build a dam, which in addition to giving a bonus on rivers also gives one on water tiles in general. It will also be possible to make the intelligence service more solid, providing the cities with a headquarters for the Secret Services, while the construction of a Security Agency will make counterespionage more effective, increasing the cost of enemy missions. An interesting feature of this expansion is the introduction of colonies. When a civilization reaches new continents, the maintenance costs become higher to the point, in some cases, to significantly slow down the development process. In this case the player can ~liberate~ some cities, creating independent colonies, managed by the AI, which will effectively behave like vassal states. The creation of colonies lightens maintenance costs but also allows you to take advantage of the resources they produce. Each colony will have a relationship of trust with the state of origin, but over time it is not excluded that relations cannot be spoiled, even to the point of leading to a real war. War with a colony is certainly unexpected, but not inevitable. On the contrary, random events that affect players from time to time and which can produce both unimaginable catastrophes, such as an earthquake or a tsunami, and real missions, complete with a final reward, are inevitable. Sometimes we will be faced with choices that can enrich our coffers but spoil relationships with another leader, or give up some benefit to keep these relationships strong. Random events add some spice to the game, especially in case of carefully planned matches. However, they can always be disabled. As for the new wonders, Firaxis does not disappoint in this respect either and gives us eight new wonders of human creativity, divided into six great wonders and two national wonders. another Brick in the Wall Of these, the most impressive and important is certainly the Apostolic Palace. By discovering Theology, and provided that he has a state religion, the player can build the Apostolic Palace and have access to global elections even before the advent of the United Nations. Voters are all civilizations that have atm", "date": "2007-08-02", "grade": null}
