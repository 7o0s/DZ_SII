{"name": "Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-burst-limit-recensione.html", "text": "Comment Burst Limit represents in several respects an involution compared to the previous chapters, with fewer characters, scenarios (which however have no interaction) and game modes. For the rest we have a story that retraces the beginning of the saga for the umpteenth time, a title that again embraces a more fighting game-oriented style and which is only enriched by a really good graphic impact and by a rather meager online section. Because of all these reasons, we recommend the game only to the most ardent fans or to those approaching the video game transposition of this famous manga for the first time (or almost), waiting for a more complete and satisfying sequel for those accustomed to the world of Son Goku and Co. Pros Great visual impact: looks like a cartoon Beat 'em up style makes the title a bit deeper Fun, replayable main story Cons Online at minimum wage Few characters, scenarios, modes Zero interaction with the environment Burst Limit is the subtitle chosen for this new production by Namco Bandai and, we say it immediately, the game system largely takes up the Budokai series, offering typical fighting game mechanics and inheriting most of the moves from the chapters that appeared on PlayStation 2. All of this, from a visual point of view, taken to the highest levels, where the perfect and flawless creation of the characters, the overflowing graphic effects of the various waves and final moves, the graphic palette with faithful and fired colors, are aspects that make the game often and willingly indistinguishable if not better in some ways than any episode of the animated series. All as long as you focus on the fights and sections in flight, because on the other hand the zero interaction with the environment definitely makes you turn up your nose, which makes the scenarios meager and somewhat sideline. The clear detachment is noticed, for example, when a character is thrown to the ground by a series of combos or holds, in which case it remains static and there is only a patch of smoke, a situation which makes the unequal care of this immediately visible component of the technical aspect. If we add that there are only five different settings, a certain haste in the programming of the title in this sense is denoted. As mentioned, the control and combat system are oriented towards a combo system revived to the nth degree, with the X key for parrying, the square and the triangle for light and strong attacks, the circle to release the aura at one's disposal . By combining the various attacks with each other and with the back keys, it is possible to counter the blows, avoid them and appear behind the opponent, or even free one's aura to show off the various special blows, up to the supreme ones, which require of your aura at the maximum level (indicated at the bottom of the screen) to be released, and which in any case can be avoided with the right timing. There are also the classic grips and the possibility of throwing enemies far and then chasing them and starting a sort of mini-game where the attacking character, to successfully complete the offensive, must press the four front buttons faster than the opponent. pad. Another situation where the same procedure happens is when two waves of the same intensity meet in mid-air, and also in this case, to prevail, you have to press all the buttons frantically. The main game mode is called ~Chronicles Z~ and is divided by sagas, for the umpteenth time we start from the very beginning of the series, with the arrival of Raditz, to end with the Cell saga, after various clashes interspersed with sequences non-interactive that take up some points of the cartoon. Precisely for this reason there are only 21 characters available, well characterized visually from each other and in the moves, but which in reality are all performed in the same way and therefore introduce little variety in the choice of one character over another, if not for aesthetic reasons . Fortunately for each of them there are also the first transformations, such as Goku's Super Saiyan rather than Piccolo's, and therefore it is possible to modify one's power during matches. What keeps the interest high is precisely the game progression, where in fact each completed scenario returns a vote (derived from the number of moves and combos performed and the duration of the battle) and allows you to unlock new characters, scenarios, transformations and special moves , then available in the other modalities. Dulcis in fundo, it allows access to the so-called ~animated scenes~, automatic animated sequences (but which are generated in particular points of one's energy or afteror certain combos) which act as support for your character by increasing its defense, energy bar, resistance to special blows and so on. At the beginning of each fight, therefore, three can be chosen together with the companion who will give support but, to tell the truth, most of the time they only break the action and are of little use for the purposes of actual combat. If in any case the clashes are fairly fun, it is precisely the outline and longevity that are very deficient, first of all because in addition to the story mode, which in any case lasts just the right amount, there is the classic one on one, a survival mode and some where it is necessary defeat your opponents in the shortest possible time, a bit few especially when compared with those of the other chapters, which among the many included the various types of tournaments present in the cartoon rather than the possibility of importing the characteristics of the previous characters. In Burst Limit, on the other hand, everything is reduced to the bone, and consequently the fun offered by the title soon diminishes. The online mode could have been present to improve its fate, but even in this case it is really basic in its implementation, and several times we have encountered lag in the fights against other remote opponents. Let's close the circle on the game with sound, which does its duty honestly, with the classic acronyms of the series, and offers texts in Italian and dubbing chosen in the options between English and Japanese.", "date": "2008-06-26", "grade": null}
