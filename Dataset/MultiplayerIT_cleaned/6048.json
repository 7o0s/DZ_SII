But the strategic element is the beating heart of this setting and Regicide makes it the fulcrum of its experience. The protagonist Legion this time is that of the Blood Angels, one of the oldest and most glorious Chapters that can boast of being faithfully in the service of the Emperor for thousands of years. How does all this fit into the game of chess? Now we explain it to you... Space Marine and Orks play chess in Warhammer 40,000: Regicide The violent side of chess The basic rules are those of chess and this brings us back to the famous Battle Chess series, which has found success by emphasizing the skirmishes between pawns, knights and kings with hilarious and often incredibly violent animations. All bearing elements of Warhammer 40,000: Regicide, which in this case dares to make several changes to the most classic of strategy games. If the movements are those of the board game, the gameplay refers to the classic turn-based tactics. The game turn is divided into a movement and initiative phase during which we can move a unit and carry out an offensive or defensive action, until we run out of action points which are generally three but can be accumulated up to a maximum of five. Furthermore, the range of the attacks is different and the pieces have special characteristics and abilities. The classic chess capture move, possible in the movement phase only, instantly eliminates an enemy who leaves the battlefield in a cloud of blood, but all other attack actions are affected by the to hit percentage and stances, as in a normal turn-based strategy game a la UFO. There's the snapshot, there are global special abilities that can be used regardless of the unit selected, there's the aimed shot and there's even the grenade. There are shared Cooldowns for special abilities, generally by class, such as grenades and there is no shortage of buff and debuff abilities. Chess intersects with these elements, giving us a chessboard full of possibilities, which also allows us to sacrifice a wounded unit in order to force the enemy to eat it, perhaps exposing an important unit. Warhammer 40,000: Regicide includes a classic mode that slavishly follows the rules of chess representing a sort of Battle Chess in Warhammer 40,000 edition, but it is clear that the core of the experience is Regicide and it is highly advisable to tackle the campaign before setting foot in multiplayer in order to acquire the necessary mastery of the rules. The first missions are easy and are played between pawns who can only proceed vertically but even so, with only the basic elements, the complexity of the title clearly shines through, to then increase when you add the rooks, bishops and horses that carry the movement dynamics on a whole other level. The classic balance of chess, of course, blows up and the type of complexity we are talking about is purely videogame, but the possibility of eating a pawn by moving like masters of strategy in the midst of grenades, special abilities and showers of lead can give great satisfactions. If we add to all this secondary rules such as the impossibility of carrying out some moves if certain checkers have moved and the skills to be unlocked by playing, which can be purchased immediately by putting a hand in the wallet, the picture becomes even more complex. Even if this mix can't aspire to the fine balance of the king of strategy games, what matters is that it works and is probably more fun than Sheldon Cooper's fearsome three-dimensional chess. Among other things, the recipe does not lack the fundamental possibility of skipping animations destined to become repetitive, the loadouts to speed up the choice of different builds and the indicator of the last move made which fits into the sufficiently intuitive interface of a title that also includes online statistics, matchmaking and progression system. In addition, the Hammerfall game includes fully customizable online or local skirmish, a dedicated friends list and cross-play functionality with iOS and Android which completes a decidedly attractive picture for a title that, although modest in its setting, is complex, long-lived and quite rich . A universe in sixty-four boxes The launch patch raised the total campaign missions to fifty and added five new sub-factions to the pile for a total of eleven possible choices between Space Marines and Orks that, by the way, can now count on a total of forty-six skills. In short, the variety is guaranteed even if such a title, limited in spatial dimension, could have included a greater number of factions, proposing the entire imaginary instead of a small part of it. Of course, balancing the Genestealer movement would have posed some problems in relation to the chess dimension but the campaign, which among other things is surprisingly robust from a narrative point of view, could have welcomed creatures of all sorts without problems. Among other things, playing on the same board, even with the background and lighting variants introduced in the final version, could prove tiring, if only compared to what happens with the classic turn-based tactical game formula a la Space Hulk. In any case, the units deployed in an ever-changing way and the cover scattered on the maps change the cards on the table, forcing us to carefully consider the movement phase which, thanks to the possibility of hitting the opponent's pieces in one fell swoop, can be decisive. On the other hand, the latter, in combination with the careful use of defensive skills, can save us from enemy fire. Unfortunately, however, the difficulty does not derive from the enemy's intelligence, often capable of real suicidal actions, but from the surprising ability of the Orks to almost always hit regardless of the target percentages and this while our Space Marines manage to ring together sensational series of failures even with very high probability of hitting. Hoping for a future patch, we can only advise those who love the challenge and don't appreciate multiplayer to aim for secondary objectives that can be quite difficult to achieve even for the most savvy players. In all of this, the graphics are certainly not jaw-breakers but the fulcrum of the entire technical sector is made up of the killings whose animations are decidedly spectacular. Each unit has a fatality in store for each type of enemy and probably the Terminator that acts as a tower is the one that gives the greatest satisfaction. Instead, the standard combat actions are not much to look at and in general the technical sector stands at modest levels. On the other hand, the soundtrack is excellent, not always varied but powerful and seasoned with sci-fi sounds, epic percussions and martial choirs. Furthermore, the interlude scenes are surprisingly good and the excellent English dubbing, accompanied by Italian subtitles, manages to involve us by balancing the inevitable distance from the narrative dimension of a gameplay that lives enclosed in a board of eight squares by eight squares.", "date": "2015-09-10", "grade": "7.5"}
