{"name": "Ritorno a Lunar", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76905-lunar-harmony-of-silver-star-ritorno-a-lunar.html", "text": "It was the year 1993 when the small but lucky owners of Sega CDs had the opportunity to get their hands on a video game that, they still didn't know it, would become a cornerstone of the JRPG genre. To intrigue, of Lunar: The Silver Star, was above all the character design of Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, at that time known above all for the animated series Nadia (and the Mystery of the Blue Stone, in Italy) and from there shortly especially for having given life to the characters of another successful series, Neon Genesis Evangelion. Lunar's strengths were the excellent audio and video quality granted by the format, which made the CD the second best-selling game for the ill-fated Sega console. To underline the importance of Lunar, at least on the oriental market, there is an impressive number of reissues. Apart from the splendid sequel, Lunar: Eternal Blue, the first episode of the series enjoyed a remake in 1998 for Saturn and PSOne, supported by almost an hour of high quality animated sequences, which unfortunately would be eliminated in the subsequent remake at the rosewater for the Game Boy Advance, in 2002. Fast forward to 2010: Lunar: Silver Star Harmony comes to PSP. Same story: new remake, final version? A tale from another time What makes Lunar still such a magical game today is the delicacy and simplicity of a story whose merit is, above all, to be told really well. There are no complex protagonists, impossible love stories, pseudo-scientific explanations: Alex lives in a small rural village, together with his adoptive stepsister Luna, his greedy friend Ramus and the funny talking dragon Narl. Alex's dream is to experience a great adventure like those experienced by the legendary Dragonmaster Dyne, who saved the goddess Althena from the clutches of evil together with three other mythical heroes. What begins as an outing in search of a treasure is a series of events that will lead Alex to make his dreams come true: Lunar: Silver Star Harmony thus begins, like an aventurine and little more, but between dragons and witches, arcane magic and unlikely bandits, Game Arts' RPG manages to give us some of the most memorable characters ever and one of the most bastard antagonists in the history of video games. Alex and Luna will be joined by the womanizing bandit Kyle and the rebel Jessica, the vain Nash and the shy Mia, and the group will inevitably find themselves facing a threat that threatens to destroy the planet. The Re(make) of Re(make) It goes without saying that, unlike the Game Boy Advance release, this latest remake of Lunar maintains all the best features of the series. The UMD contains all the original animated films, remastered for the occasion, which will frequently interrupt the adventure to show us the highlights through splendid fully dubbed cutscenes. We're talking about an hour of movies that introduce the characters and best express the script when needed. For the occasion, Game Arts has not only doubled all the cutscenes, but also most of the most important dialogues are now fully recited. The introduction film, for example, maintains the splendid opening song but with an entirely new text, sung by the same artist as the 1998 western edition, and more faithful to the original Japanese text. The same goes for Luna's famous song on the ship (yes, in Lunar: Silver Star Harmony there is also a sung sequence with a very Disney-like scent): same song, more faithful text. Simultaneously, the entire soundtrack has enjoyed a rejuvenation that makes it even more enchanting than the original. The script of the story has been tweaked here and there to add short narrative sequences or correct some weird translation error that escaped the revision of ten years ago. And of course from a graphic point of view, the developer Xseed has reworked the entire world of Lunar and its characters with an excellent two-dimensional cosmetic that is incredibly detailed and defined. Where the trend sees the old 2D games come back to the fore with polygons that perhaps betray their original spirit, Game Arts' choice to maintain extremely improved two-dimensional graphics really deserves respect. The world of Lunar has never been so beautiful, colorful and detailed. The sprites of the characters and their enemies are animated and well-kept, especially during the fights. From this point of view, there is nothing to criticize apart from the sometimes excessive frequency and length of the uploads: a negligible sin after all. Vintage! Also from a purely playful point of view Lunar: Silver Star Harmony is a very faithful remake of the original. And this is both good and bad.Mind you, the mechanics of Lunar: Silver Star Harmony are so simple as to be highly enjoyable for those who have indigestion of the rules and bizarre combat systems that characterize the RPG genre in recent years. Those who have already played Lunar years ago will be perfectly at ease, but new players may perhaps turn up their noses in the face of such linear and simplistic gameplay. As a good JRPG, Lunar: Silver Star Harmony is structured in the canonical process that sees the player explore cities and labyrinths in order to progress in the main storyline. A contact with the appropriate monsters will lead to the loading of the battlefield, on which we will deploy up to a maximum of five characters against a variable amount of enemies. Each party member can perform a simple physical attack, defend, cast a spell or use an item. Combat takes place in turns: after indicating the party's actions (or letting the AI do it via a practical option) the sprites on the screen will exchange loud blows in order of speed. An interesting feature concerns the positioning of the sprites: the player has no direct control over this element, but must consider that every enemy must be within range if a specific character wants to attack. If not, that character will move towards the target but will have to wait for the next turn to cover the rest of the distance and hit the enemy. This feature makes the fights a little more strategic, as well as the unprecedented addition of a sort of indicator which, taken to the maximum, allows you to launch spectacular special attacks. As we said, it's an incredibly simple, almost naive battle system: it works wonders but the lack of a real cast customization (limited to the choice of equipment, in practice) and the dear, old acquisition of skills based on level achieved make Lunar: Silver Star Harmony an ~old~ game with ~new~ graphics. But as they say, old barrel makes good wine.", "date": "2010-05-11", "grade": "8.5"}
