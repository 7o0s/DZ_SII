Necropolis, almost two years after its announcement, arrives on the market aware of the complexity of the challenge set. Those who have already peeked at the vote at the end of the article will have understood how not everything went the right way, but its procedural nature and some interesting gimmicks could make it attractive for a part of players who really appreciate this genre. Punitive enough and very unbalanced in favor of group play, the rogue/soulslike Necropolis, based on your needs, could give you several smiles or as many grimaces. Necropolis tries to unite two extremely well-known genres, succeeding more in the premises than in the substance Trolling, what a passion Searching for something capable of being defined as a ~narrative arc~ in Necropolis is at least pretentious. Despite what one might think by interpreting the title of the game or the gloomy atmospheres, the developers have made an effort to establish an ironic note in every element of the production. Starting from the dubbing, made using a series of guttural sounds that have no meaning but which are quite funny, up to the phrases that accompany the descriptions of the objects or the jokes that accompany the beginning of each game, everything is tacked to total grip around a genre and a way of narrating that the developers obviously appreciate, but that they wanted to pay homage to with a goliardic spirit. It is here that the first great sin of Necropolis occurs: the possibilities induced by this method of narration turn out to be all too superficial, being reduced to a small series of sentences that already after the third or fourth game will begin to repeat themselves cyclically. And the lack of a real common thread during the ten levels that make up the dungeons, do nothing but remove any type of narrative attraction from the title. After a couple of hours, you will find yourself paying absolutely no attention to those phrases that the first time seemed full of a hidden meaning, but which in the end will turn out to be simple digressions without a real purpose. This factor significantly reduces the curiosity of going in search of the - few - inscriptions on the walls of the dungeons, which tell the story of invented deities in an always ridiculous guise. For example, there will be stories about divinities who, while eating, release their own air in the intestines and so on. A real shame, because the conditions for something fun and stimulating were all there, close at hand. Die and try again, always, unwaveringly Let's come to what made the two main genres that amalgamate in Necropolis famous. It is obvious how much Harebrained Schemes has staked on the notoriety both roguelikes and soulslikes currently enjoy. The idea of taking key design elements from both sounds like a winner on paper. Hence the procedural generation of dungeons and irreversible death; as well as the styles of the combat system on the other, with the same mapping of the commands. The pains come when you realize that the dungeons are always very similar to each other, with minimal differences in terms of design and with too few types of enemies that are tirelessly repeated throughout the continuation of the adventure. The presence of a good dose of weapons, shields and armor is not enough to generate that feeling of variety that the game needs. Most of the blades, among other things, always behave in the same way, with moveset, heaviness and power delegated to a simple number that cannot be changed in any way. It is clear that all this was necessary to compromise with the procedural nature of the title, but some compromise could have been found that would make each game more useful also in view of the following ones. In this sense, a series of upgrades that can be purchased once and then activated during all subsequent games are not enough, as they modify the build of one's alter ego in an extremely mild and not very effective way. Even the initial choice of which class to use does not substantially change anything, except the name of the divinity to which you are linked and the color of your clothing. This does nothing but dampen the player's enthusiasm even more, aware of having to start over again, without any difference and with a combat system that unfortunately only half works. The latter is in fact based on a series of attacksand counterattacks typical of the reference genre, but which lack bite and are limited to being frustrating and wooden. The smile generated by the new weapon acquired and not yet tested quickly fades when you realize that the only degree of challenge posed by the title turns out to be the amount of enemies that this vomits on us. All assisted by a limited artificial intelligence and which leads the opponents to get stuck anywhere on the map. It is truly a pity to realize the decrease in enthusiasm as the title is played, because it is evident how Harebrained Schemes has really tried to re-propose those atmospheres from which it was inspired. The premises and the initial impact of the title are extremely positive, but it is the frenzied repetition of the game that is always the same as itself that decrees its partial failure. Let's say partial, because those who madly love this genre will still be able to find something to their liking, but one cannot hide a lack of replayability which should be an absolute source of oxygen for a roguelike. Cooperative is better What saves Necropolis from taking a simple sufficiency is the presence of the coop up to 4 players. This is fun, well balanced and gives bite and laughter to a title that otherwise, played alone, would risk tiring too much too soon. The gem in terms of design turns out to be friendly fire, which will only often lead you to simultaneous killings, which however will almost always result in laughter, thanks to the possibility of reviving your companions, until all the players die. Mom, look: without feet! The visual impact with Necropolis, regardless of the tastes of each player, is something that certainly cannot leave one indifferent. On a purely artistic level, the title represents a small pearl. The style used to represent the protagonists, the various elements of the scenario and above all the enemies oozes style from every pixel. It is impossible not to be enchanted by the flames that emerge from the braziers around the dungeons, or by the details that characterize this or that other enemy on your path. Even the weapons and armor are different from each other and all treated in detail. The only thing that leaves us dumbfounded is the re-proposition of the settings, which are always very similar. This detail obviously derives from the procedural nature of the title, from which no exponent of the genre has managed to get away. The raw technical aspect is affected by a quantity of pop-ups and polygonal interpenetrations, which although in most cases do not negatively affect the gameplay, still ruin the whole, which instead finds one of its major points in the graphics sector of strength.", "date": "2016-07-19", "grade": "7.0"}
