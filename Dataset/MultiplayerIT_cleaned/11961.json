{"name": "Hummer Jump and Race", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hummer-jump-and-race.html", "text": "Hummer Jump and Race is part of the controversial family of 3D driving games for mobile phones, a genre that doesn't always manage to guarantee a correct balance between graphic quality, rendering of the sensation of speed and goodness of the control system. It must be said, however, that, at least as regards the first two aspects, the Red Pyramid title certainly manages to assert itself. In fact, the game offers a totally three-dimensional cosmetics, with scenarios, objects and cars made up of a good number of polygons: the Hummers, in particular, enjoy a remarkable attention to detail, making them among the most impressive virtual vehicles on the mobile scene. Another point in favor of Hummer Jump and Race is the constant fluidity of the frame rate, always stable and capable of giving the player a genuine sensation of speed. The icing on the cake is the physics of the cars, perhaps not 100% realistic but a faithful demonstration of the developers' commitment on that particular juncture. Impeccable from a technical point of view, Hummer Jump and Race unfortunately it is not the same as regards the actual playability. The faults of a poorly reactive and poorly structured control system weigh above all on the Red Pyramid product, which soon end up having a negative impact on the entire gaming experience. Particularly condemnable was the choice of the developers to manage acceleration and braking through a series of steps: in essence, with each pressure of the dedicated button, the speed increases or decreases by a notch. An expedient undoubtedly created to simplify the use of the game, but which ultimately leads to the exact opposite, preventing the user from being able to correctly control his car. In Hummer Jump and Race, therefore, you end up in front of a crossroads: always stay flat, however, risking constantly hitting the guard rails, or face the curves properly, however, losing too much speed compared to your opponents. And it's a shame, because the Red Pyramid product certainly has no shortage of substance: in addition to the aforementioned technical goodness, the game can count on a satisfying championship mode, online scoreboards and three Hummer models to drive on six different tracks full of jumps and roughness. Sadly all of these things end up crashing into a wallliterally.
