Abundantly mentioned in the opening credits, the Serious Engine 2 is the new graphics engine created specifically for this game, and of which you have already had the opportunity to read the Croteam development diary. If Roman Ribaric's perhaps slightly enthusiastic words and tones hadn't fully convinced you, let me remove all doubts: Serious Sam 2 is a feast for the eyes. The amount of polygons is miraculous, considering the size of the levels and the amount of enemies on screen at the same time, which in the ~clue~ moments of the game easily reaches several dozen. Yet, if the buildings and the levels in general do not boast particular complexity in terms of modeling - but the textures used are the best there is around - you will hardly be able to identify the sharp edge of a polygon on the enemies, which even without reaching the level of detail of the most recent productions, are absolutely adequate and modern. ...the gameplay remains the same as ever - a headless massacre perpetrated with abandon and enjoyment... Now, that's some SERIOUS firepower...! And let's not forget the inimitable color palette that is the trademark of Serious Sam, which has rightly remained unchanged over the years: very bright environments with vibrant colors on alien planets with two or three suns, green meadows, lush forests and postcard beaches. Only Far Cry has gone so far as to set an FPS in such unusual scenarios. Serious Sam 2 went even further, with explosions of color such as the Chinese-themed city or the fairytale world complete with flying citadels and evil dragon (those who have seen Shrek can get the idea) where the king is ~King~ of name and factual (i.e., it's Elvis). At the same time, the game also offers us some more conventional settings, even if no less stereotyped and extreme, such as the volcanic planet populated by the undead (obtained by the evil Mental by unloading a few million tons of napalm on it...) or the classic level in the sewers (so classic that Sam is the first to say that a video game could not miss). As you can see, irony is like a second skin for Serious Sam: not only enthusiastic comments once you have collected the most charismatic weapons - the Duke is his master in this - but in the opening and closing of each of the approximately 40 levels that make up the game, some simply hilarious movies have been inserted, which act as a ~glue~ between one action sequence and another and illustrate us better than anything else, the aberrant and imponderable obtuseness of our protagonist, of his allies and his enemies. A whole universe of tangible stupidity that will surely win you over. Dwarfs with disturbing features and great powers, who oppose the intergalactic domination of Mental, the three hateful aliens who have recalled us from Earth are constantly the protagonists of a comic theater in which they ask us whether or not Sam can be the Chosen One destined to defeat Mental - ~You also said that about that blond guy a few years ago... and he was always late~, no comment! - making themselves generally responsible for the misadventures that happen to us once we reach the surface of hostile planets. It is a more than pleasant addition and a clear example of the flexibility of Serious Engine 2, which with its multiple editors allows you to manipulate the contents of the levels in various ways and with great simplicity. At the same time, however, some defects are felt, two in particular, the same ones that then influence the technical sector of the entire game: the sound and the animations. [C] How to say... even the heroes get bored and decide to cut it short. The 'gigantic' level is the 'gigantic' level. among those by far the most; beautiful to see. These fetid lizards are the classic example of good cannon fodder for Uzis. [/C] Double the gun, double the fun! Many of the weapons in Serious Sam 2 come from the glorious tradition of ~tamarri~ FPS: the double shotgun and the automatic one need no explanation of course, as well as the huge grenade launcher or the bazooka, which has the same unmistakable feel of Duke's repeating missile launcher Nukem. However, other trinkets of death and destruction are original and completely crazy ideas that you will not find elsewhere: an example is the hand cannon, the cartoon classic from Warner Bros, capable of firing (obviously) huge cannonballs stuffed with depleted uranium, which not only mow down the enemy ranks like a meteorite in a field of flowers, but at the end of their run they explode in a devastating way. Equally crazy is the kamikaze parrot, a cute green bird armaterial of explosives, ideal for shooting down planes and helicopters because as a kind of homing missile, it will follow its route, detonating itself on impact. And how not to mention the mother of all bombs, the Serious Bomb. The ultimate weapon, this big black sphere is once again the classic fuse bomb, this time to be blown directly into our hands: while we will remain safe within a protective force field, the dazzling explosion will make a clean sweep of all enemies present at that moment. Double the gun, double the fun! There are a total of 15 weapons and it is appropriate to say that any further addition would have been redundant since the entire spectrum of possible means by which to cause pain to others is covered. After all, the offer of cannon fodder of the diabolical Mental is very diversified. There really is something for everyone, from reimaginings of old glories like the headless exploding soldiers and ram-rhinos to some preposterous newcomers like the Italian un-e dead brokers (who indulge in colorful expletives like ~damn! ~, ~bastard!~ ~mamma mia!~) or the Chinese kung-fu expert zombies (who, however, between a ~banzai~ and a ~sayonara~ must have rather studied Japanese). Each world has its own set of themed creatures along with a number of ubiquitous evergreens, such as orcs in space armor and tank-devils with missile launchers for arms that look like they're fresh out of DooM. ...the title catches up with and surpasses its predecessor by a significant margin... Double the gun, double the fun! If the gameplay is confirmed as always - a headless massacre perpetrated with abandon and enjoyment - this does not mean that we are not offered some occasional out-of-the-box excursions. For years, the banner of self-styled innovative FPS has been the introduction of vehicles and Serious Sam, which cannot be outdone, offers us an excellent review of eccentric means of transport. Indeed, some such as the velociraptor, the flying saucer or the lethal ~hamster ball~, make a single appearance in the whole adventure, or are used too sporadically to be significant in an overall assessment, while others such as the hoover from combat are employed more often and are even indispensable to beating the game. Therefore, one gets the vague impression that once inserted into the game they have not been able to find a way to integrate them properly with the gameplay beyond short episodes for their own sake, but they still constitute an original and all in all fun addition to the complex of comic and absurd that is Serious Sam. By the way: play it in Serious mode or you will miss the best! Despite some flaws in the implementation (sound effects not always up to par, fluctuating animations and a physics engine that is little more than an attempt), Serious Sam 2 earns an excellent judgment, not only for not having disregarded expectations, but also for having proved to be a solid and abundant title in content, beyond the manic-obsessive fixation of the Croteam boys for classic shooters. In this respect the title catches up with and surpasses its predecessor by a significant margin and in a time when there is no great abundance of new FPS to come out, Serious Sam's second adventure is something that an enthusiast shouldn't miss out on. try. The single-player campaign will give you many satisfactions, especially at the higher difficulty levels, where completing the more crowded levels will give you the impression of being real titans who tread the earth. However, the best way to enjoy the game is the same as in the first chapter, a further concession to the nostalgics of the genre. Two words: cooperative multiplayer! Pros Beautiful graphics Playable and fun Atmosphere rambling and crazy Cons So-so sound effects Original voice acting could be improved Not very long-lived in single player Cross-platform Coming out simultaneously on PC and Xbox, Serious Sam 2 falls perfectly within the capabilities of the Microsoft console, paying, compared to the PC counterpart, substantially only in terms of texture definition and resolution. Considering then that the graphic goodness of the game is largely attributable to the unmistakable style and colors adopted by Croteam, rather than being the exclusive result of squeezing our video cards, we can consider the two versions virtually identical. Nevertheless, should you be in doubt, we still recommend the PC version: the immediacy of playing it with mouse and keyboard is simply not comparable with the pad, and in a title of this genre (an action game that is exclusively concerned with action) it is a key feature hardlyexpendable. In particular, if the music is absolutely ideal and themed, the sound effects are definitely not up to the goodness of the graphics. The noises of the weapons are generally convincing, but many of the ambient sounds appear a bit artisanal, from Sam's footsteps on the different surfaces (at times it seems to walk on french fries) to the effect of the fire, which is very reminiscent of frying oil in the pan. Likewise, it is immediately noticeable how the dubbing (the original one, the game is localized in Italian only in the menus) was not done by professionals, and if at first the very strong accent of the interpreters (presumably Croteam employees, at least judging by the final film of the game) can be fun in the mouth of the little aliens source of our tribulations, after a while you will understand why the subtitles and the reason why they are not deactivable... Other trinkets of death and destruction are completely insane and original ideas that you won't find anywhere else: one example is the hand cannon... Finally the animations. In a title so rich in content, some small shortcomings from this point of view are understandable, but one gets the impression that at this juncture we have limited ourselves to the bare minimum. Enemies basically only have two, which is generally not a problem, since they do nothing else but move and shoot, but one cannot fail to notice the almost total absence of animations in ~idle state~, i.e. the simple loop breathing, small movements of the back and torso, normally associated with a character ~still~ in one spot doing essentially nothing. It is a useful detail to make the characters seem ~alive~ even when they are not doing anything specific, it has been used since the days of Unreal Tournament and by now it is hardly noticed ... unless it is missing. The monsters of Serious Sam 2 are almost always active, attracted by our position or created out of nothing nearby when the battle has already begun, but it is not unusual to see some of them ~deactivated~, either because they are stuck in a corner or because they are present in an area since the beginning of the level and not yet ~awakened~ by our passage in a certain area. In these cases they turn out to be real statues of wax, motionless and inanimate. Then the same phenomenon is almost a norm in the case of NPCs, the funny defenseless aliens that we meet during our travels. Some have specific tasks, such as running, fleeing, holding our heads, saying goodbye. Others remain standing staring at nothing with an empty expression, in the most absolute static. [C] Those blue hominids are one of the four peaceful races that we will meet on the different planets. The Kleers are instead among the best villains of the first Serious Sam. And also among the most; copied: you played Painkiller right? As always, even to save the world, the most important thing is to do it. important is; have a good plan. [/C] Time to get Serious! At the time of its release in 2001, Serious Sam made quite a stir on the net by proposing itself as a ~genuine~ FPS that inherited the legacy of the progenitors of the genre in terms of frenzy, immediacy of gameplay and above all the extent of the carnage. Seasoning it all with a semi-demented setting full of nonsense and a protagonist who was a clear caricature of the good old Duke Nukem. It was something clearly against the trend compared to the fashion of the moment, which after Half-Life and Operation Flashpoint, for some time now only offered serious shooters (but not serious! Laugh, it's a joke!), with a demanding plot and perhaps with a sprawling control system. In Serious Sam on the contrary, there was only us and the bad guys and in a certain sense this was what aroused the interest of the public and publishers, at least as much as the technological level reached by such a small and hitherto unknown developer. like croteam. In short, Serious Sam became a sort of custom phenomenon, the demonstration that the idea of the independent ~garage~ software house could still work, create products aligned with the market and offer them to publishers with success. In this case at least, it worked and after the first chapter, an expansion and a conversion on Xbox, we are preparing to test the work done on the continuation of the adventures of Sam Stone (which for the uninitiated, is the real protagonist's name).", "date": "2005-10-19", "grade": null}
