To give anyone the possibility of understanding, with a more open image, one could define oneself as a Greek deity: powerful, invincible, immortal, but at the same time curious and full of the same human weaknesses. And if you are interested in the more committed religious aspects, you will not be indifferent to the protagonist's questions, as apparently naive as they are profound. The premise and the epilogue, in fact, manage to capture the player's imagination, trying to establish a deep relationship between you and his arrogant search to understand how his power has manifested itself. The construction of the dialogue that takes place between him and the environment is never secondary, because when you reach the epilogue you will have a surprise that could overturn many of the certainties accumulated during the gameplay. The narrator is quite skilled in rattling off these internal dialogues - only in English, but with Italian subtitles - closely recalling the style of the Destiny Spectre. A puzzle game made by god or a god who finds himself in a puzzle game? Have an eye To be a god, or self-styled one, we will move like ordinary human beings, walking in an environment recreated entirely with the excellent Unreal Engine 4. The choice of engine and the polygonal modeling of the schemes prove to be truly perfect for recreating environments that recall Roman and Hellenic culture up close. You cross large green spaces, enclosed in sunny gardens full of saturated and summery colors, adorned with finely chiseled colonnades, fountains and draperies that draw a well-kept Mediterranean environment. The interiors are no different: the marble reflects the surrounding environment and the walls are partly enriched by paintings from various eras, as if we were in a mausoleum that recalls different periods, but almost as big as a city. In all of this we will be under the careful and constant observation of a Big Brother who doesn't have the wickedness of Portal's GLaDOS, but is only the disturbing means to be able to overcome most of the game's puzzles. It has its own specific role, but it's too tied to the ending to be able to talk about it freely, without fear of spoilers; it can be said that in our character's delusion of omnipotence he will often talk about it, just as it is understandable that only thanks to him we will be able to overcome most of the obstacles. Sound mysterious? Indeed it is and it is one of the most interesting elements of the entire Pneuma: Breath of Life operation. Playstation 4 trophies Overall, the title consists of 12 trophies. The first eight silver ones are related to the story - six for the chapters, one for the prologue and one for ending the story - the other four gold ones are for some side quests, however easily available. With the power of thought Let's give an overview of the enigmas of this journey, so as to make it clearer what situations you will come across when you make your purchase. Perhaps for the first time, we have noticed a title that in the Oculus Rift version, or with any other virtual reality viewer, could enjoy an effective improvement in the experience. Think of having to stare at an ~eye~ that observes you - of course you can also do this with the pad - so as to allow the opening of a door, but as soon as you turn your ~head~, with the eyeball going out of the field visual, the door closes in front of you. So you repeat the action and move sideways, feeling a little silly but ultimately relieved that you've figured out how to participate in the next set of challenges, which will repeat in a similar fashion throughout the gameplay experience. Pneuma: Breath of Life seems to all intents and purposes a tech demo for viewers: often you will have to look in front of you, go down the stairs, lower your gaze and start again, to obtain the effect of making the protagonist cross a bridge or interact with the surrounding environment. The absurd thing is that in some cases you will also find yourself involuntarily doing it with your head, to help the protagonist move his surroundings with his thoughts: bridges, roads and stairs must be moved in this bizarre way, even if in the end you will get carried away and all in all it will be fun. Observing the environment means trying to read the situation of the moment, understand the games of depth, understand where the illusion is fallacious to exploit that single gear or different point of view, so that a lever moves chains and pulleys and makes us continue along the path. Painting and sculpturea are not only useless embellishments, but have their place in some passages, too few actually, resulting in interesting and Macchiavellian games. The duration has its weight, of course, and you can complete the entire adventure in a time between just under an hour and two hours, at the most, as long as you don't get stuck in some agonizing mechanical device. This is a rather significant figure considering the price of twenty euros with which the title is offered. The short duration would suggest that at least the experience isn't boring, but that's exactly what happens after about twenty minutes. The initial propellant of an inviting script loses a lot of its polish during the work, arriving at the final rush with a good idea which, however, is meager and not very thorough, too little to be a fully functional expedient. In terms of stability and bugs of various kinds, one can hardly complain about anything even if there is a certain interpenetration of some objects, which seem to merge into each other. We also encountered some sporadic slowdowns, due to frame rate drops that show an optimization that is not yet perfect, at least in the version we tested, but it is certain that they absolutely do not undermine the enjoyment of the title.", "date": "2015-07-07", "grade": "6.5"}
