{"name": "La vendetta di P.T.?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/163499-layers-of-fear-layers-of-fear.html", "text": "Last September we had the opportunity to try the Early Access version of Layers of Fear and express our first impressions immediately. As we already pointed out at that time, the project started by the guys from Bloober Team had excellent potential, to the point of having attracted the attention and acclaim of the Steam community. The young Polish studio has never made a secret of having been inspired, in a consistent way, by the acclaimed Playable Teaser proposed by Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro before the cancellation of Silent Hills. As Rafal Basaj, founder and leader of Bloober, has pointed out on several occasions, the positive impressions shown by users and the frenzy of word of mouth that took place on the network in the hours following the publication of PT, made him realize that there was a certain interest in regards a horror experience with unconventional profiles, detached from the usual survival mechanics and focused on claustrophobic sensations, strong mental implications and a very careful use of spaces and shots. Layers of Fear is in fact a first-person adventure, in which the player experiences the madness of a cursed artist live. Experiencing this man's drama also means getting in touch with his most brutal obsessions and touching a past with sad but at the same time disturbing profiles. Being an experimental product, Bloober had the need to receive feedback from the public and to understand a little more clearly what could work and what instead would have required a change of course. As a result, the game was offered in Early Access on Steam throughout the latter part of 2015 and is now ready to make its debut on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, starting February 16th. So let's try to definitively summarize the emotions that this work has left us, bearing in mind that some components worked properly but the deepening of some details would have given greater completeness to the whole. Terror and a deep sense of unease, these are the two main characteristic features of Layers of Fear Don't look back The definitive build of Layers of Fear has structural differences compared to the composition of the first Early Access version that we were able to get our hands on. Instead of just trying the first part of the adventure in its entirety, Bloober has in fact preferred to extrapolate some significant sequences of the complete game, in order to summarize the content and offer a slightly more precise idea of what would have been available to work completed. In doing so, many of those narrative references, mainly of a textual nature, which could have provided too many advances to the players, had also been eliminated. During the rehearsal we had intuition that the artist's torment concerned his wife, who was severely crippled following a fire that broke out inside the house. In reality, from the documents that can be found and read within the scenario, a rather evident and equally disturbing hypothesis emerges on what happened following the tragedy, and we begin to understand that the protagonist's problems arise from culpable lack of be careful, they grow in the form of assorted paranoias and finally flow into genuine horror. In some moments these details are revealed in a low voice, supported by the dangerous buzzes that inhabit the sick mind of the artist. But the silence and muffled atmosphere are only one side of the coin. Soon the distortion of the images, the sound impetus, the verbal ferocity towards memories that in the torn mind of the protagonist are a wound gushing with pain and supported by sinister perversions make their way. Layers of Fear takes place entirely within a single house, which however presents itself in ever new shapes and colors and distorted by the twisted lucubrations of its owner, as if you were trapped in a hallucination. Techniques already used in PT, such as for example the alternation between lights and sounds, the constant opening of doors that lead to rooms with an ever-changing appearance and the enormously claustrophobic atmosphere, have been enriched by Bloober with a personal touch, assuming reference the painting. The oppressive atmosphere reigns supreme, interspersed with effective sound and editing techniques. In many moments, one senses that something significant is about to happen but, despite everything, it happens to jump on the chair and feel a constant level of unease, especially if you decide to play wearing good headphones with positional audio. However we must also recognize that muchthe most significant and effective segments had already been proposed in the compressed formula of Early Access and the other parts, placed as an interlude between these moments, have not always managed to maintain the levels of intensity that we had prefigured. Having already tried the game, the feeling is that some of these phases have been placed as filler and glue, in order to make the experience a little longer, without however representing a considerable added value in the global experience economy. Basically we would have expected even more engaging and alienating moments, which on the contrary appear in a reduced form only towards the final part of the game. Lots of tension, few puzzles While on the one hand the tension that reigns in Layers of Fear is palpable with each new door that is crossed, our definitive test also confirmed another doubt that we had already raised in our previous article, namely the interactive limits. The actions that the player is able to perform inside rooms and corridors are really reduced to a minimum. You walk, opening one door after another, you read documents to try to reconstruct the logical thread of the story and you constantly return to the room where the unfinished work dominates, in order to add the next piece. Ultimately the sole purpose is to guess what are the reasons that led the protagonist to completely lose contact with reality and to show him his own home so distorted, terrifying and labyrinthine. Beyond these factors there is very little else, it is above all a visual and sensory experience, where music and images play a dominant role and can influence even the least impressionable players. From a certain point of view, a little more effort could undoubtedly have been spent on the presence of the puzzles, which on the contrary is only sketched. In the test there was only one and it was structured in a very basic way, so we gave ourselves the benefit of the doubt. In reality, even the subsequent attempts are confirmed on the same line, mostly involving the collection of objects to unlock the passages to the following rooms, or the simple search for combinations of numbers to activate locks and secret mechanisms. In summary, the real puzzles are very few and are not at all designed to embarrass the user. All in all, it would have made sense to make these segments a little more articulated - also in the light of a rather reduced longevity of the whole - both on a purely organizational level and from an emotional and psychological point of view. Nothing to complain about the sound sector, on closer inspection, one of the most successful sides of the production. The dry sounds, moans and distortions represented by the artist's inner madness are masterfully interspersed with moments in which the music grows, with initially melancholy and suddenly sibylline melodies, capable of instilling a deep sense of unease in the listener.", "date": "2016-02-14", "grade": "7.5"}
