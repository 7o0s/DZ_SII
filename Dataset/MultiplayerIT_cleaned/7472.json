{"name": "Il meglio del meglio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125641-chivalry-deadliest-warrior-il-meglio-del-meglio.html", "text": "Chivalry: Medieval Warfare has carved out a prominent place in the panorama of multiplayer titles and, in the context of medieval titles, has clearly surpassed the valid and technically excellent War of the Roses. A goal achieved thanks to the dynamism of fights that are characterized by robust gameplay and considerable violence. An effective recipe which, despite some aesthetic and infrastructural shortcomings, has allowed the title to remain among the 100 most played on Steam for a year. And this was also possible thanks to the efforts of the Torn Banner Studios guys who have churned out endless updates. A remarkable support that also includes Deadliest Warrior, a rather rich DLC focused on the clash between the most famous types of fighters in history. An idea, that of comparing the great fighters of the past, taken directly from the television show Deadliest Warrior, from which the DLC also takes its name, and which provides, precisely, the comparison between the weapons and the styles of most famous warriors in history. And it was precisely the viewers of the Spike TV show that indirectly determined the choice of the six fighters included, or re-read, in this DLC. Torn Banner Studios has in fact chosen the fighters most admired by the Deadliest Warrior audience and these have turned out to be the heroic Spartans, the treacherous ninjas, the shady pirates, the impassive samurai, the chaotic Vikings and the classic knights, absolute symbols of combat at the white weapon. And to make newcomers feel at home, the developers have created a map for each type of warrior, each characterized both in terms of aesthetics and gameplay dynamics. The Japanese palace includes, for example, roofs in quantity and traps that contrast with the more linear dynamics of the Spartan map, whose peculiarity is a bottomless pit. A detail evidently inspired by the film 300, which will undoubtedly see many fighters fall into the temptation of humiliating their opponent with a good kick and getting excited for having projected him into darkness. The most fearsome warriors in history face each other in the full-bodied DLC of Chivalry: Medieval Warfare To the death Deadliest Warrior includes a tutorial dedicated to the novelties that allows us to familiarize ourselves with the new weapons, all differentiated according to the type of warrior who carries them, and which allows us to evaluate the fighting styles of the characters in detail. This happens thanks to the fanciful implementation of multicolored trails that indicate the effectiveness of a shot through the various phases that compose it. A decidedly useful tool capable of giving the title a pinch of the scientific spirit of the TV broadcast which is undoubtedly sacrificed by a gameplay that is only partially simulative. This, on the other hand, is the same as the base game and is not among the most complex and realistic around with a single parry, effective regardless of the direction from which the opponent's blow arrives, and a limited range of attacks. But these are functional choices and the decision to base the fight on timing does not preclude the importance of movements which are essential to avoid lunges, shield blows and slashing. Deadliest Warrior adds numerous well-differentiated weapons, such as the short sword and javelin, which markedly characterize the gameplay of each of the new fighters. And this obviously enriches the gameplay which also enjoys a whole new set of elements to be unlocked by going up in rank with each of the warriors. To all this we must then add two new game modes that allow you to face a single opponent in a duel or to divide the players of a game, which can host up to 64, into different teams, a maximum of six, with everything that derives in terms of strategic complexity. Furthermore, if we consider that each map has a smaller variant to adapt to the number of players, and if we add the new statistics differentiated by type of warrior, the result is a decidedly interesting downloadable content with one major flaw to spoil a otherwise great picture. The new maps, in fact, do not shine for quality, especially in terms of design, with fluctuating textures, hitboxes still to be refined and squared architectures that are more reminiscent of the Chivarly born as a mod of Half Life 2 (Age of Chivalry), while remaining evident the 'use of a much more advanced engine, rather than Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. A real shame given the wealth of content and given the not exactly small price for a DLC.", "date": "2013-11-19", "grade": null}
