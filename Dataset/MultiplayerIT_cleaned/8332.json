How do you tell a story that pretty much everyone already knows the end of? Beyond its strengths and weaknesses, Final Fantasy VII occupies a very special place in the hearts of many gamers: for many it was the first Final Fantasy when the saga became mainstream in Italy too, for others it marked the indelible transition from the old to the new generation of video gaming technology. In this sense it was revolutionary, making spectacular situations that up until Final Fantasy VI on the SNES were produced by a handful of colored pixels and a lot of imagination. Seven iterations and fifteen years later, Final Fantasy VII is still the most famous and played Final Fantasy ever: there have been spin-offs, prequels, even a cinematic sequel; now only the long-awaited remake is missing, even if everything is silent at Square Enix. Fear not the new recruits and those who have never had the opportunity to play this milestone: if you belong to this category and you don't know what we are talking about, this review is made especially for you. We played the recently launched review of the PC incarnation. It all starts here Space. Immense, infinite, a black cloth dotted with the light of a myriad of stars. A few seconds of darkness, then the serene face of a girl appears. She's in an alley, leaning over something that glows softly. Aeris, this is her name, gets up and almost seems to gather in prayer. Then he exits the alley, onto a street lit by shop signs and car headlights. People pass by it and the camera moves further and further away, passing through buildings and jets of steam, until it shows from above the whole city, Midgar, which seems to come out of a steampunk tale, straddling high technology and the most miserable dilapidation. The camera then pans out and she starts running towards a train crossing the city, headed who knows where. The train stops and three passengers get off, immediately knocking out the guards on the platform. A fourth passenger descends from the roof of the vehicle with an elegant somersault: he is our protagonist, we could call him whatever we want but his name is actually Cloud Strife. It is the historic beginning of Final Fantasy VII, of course, and today it arouses strange sensations, when fifteen years ago it drew an astonished expression on the face of the player, already in love with that world and its inhabitants. To relive it today, the story of the week Final Fantasy is a great minestrone, it must be admitted. There's a bit of everything and sometimes it's hard to follow it, between extraterrestrials, magic, technology and all-Japanese clichs. A motley crew of heroes-accident-assembles to face a threat of monumental proportions and discover terrible secrets, traveling the length and breadth of the world, until the cataclysmic final confrontation. But Final Fantasy VII has the merit of having given life to a credible universe, full of unforgettable characters: the wise Red XIII, the surly Barret, the sensual Tifa, the dark Vincent. And Aeris, sweet Aeris. It also has one of the greatest villains ever, the same Sephiroth who appears in the name of at least 30% of the users of every forum on the web, but above all to have dug, for the first time in the history of the genre, into the psyche of the protagonist, basically a sociopath who only towards the end realizes who he really is, just in time to save goat and cabbage. Final Fantasy VII is above all a story about the search for one's identity, but also an allegory of the eternal struggle between good and evil. Botched, sometimes contradictory to the point of having generated prequels and sequels to explain it better, the plot remains one of the most compelling and complex in the history of the media. And if you please. 15 years ago As for the gameplay, expecting something revolutionary is obviously out of place, especially considering that Final Fantasy VII was, in fact, an inspiration for many subsequent jRPGs. Basically there is not much different even from the jRPGs that preceded it, especially from the six previous Final Fantasy. You control Cloud (or someone for him, depending on how the story is developing) and explore various ~rooms~ which, when connected, form the area of the turn: a city, a cavernous complex, a building and so on. Each setting is quite vast, fortunately the loads of each new area are really lightning-fast and the experience benefits a lot compared to previous versions. In the prepared areas we will have to deal with the usual random fights, the frequency of which is all in all acceptable: at that point, after a short loading, we will find our party made up of a maximum of three characters deployed on the battlefieldto in front of a variable number of enemies. The turn-based battle system of Final Fantasy VII is based on the Active Time Battle model that Square had already used in previous episodes: when a character performs an action, the corresponding bar is discharged and begins to fill up again, in practice displaying a recharge time which can be altered, positively or negatively, through certain magic. In this regard, it is also worth explaining the Materia system that characterizes this episode of the franchise: the equipment of the characters has bezels in which it is possible to insert these colored spheres, precisely called Materia. Each being will give the character who carries it bonuses to stats and additional abilities, active or passive, from traditional elemental magic to the summoning of the infamous ~Summon~ such as Ifrit, Shiva and company. The Materia gains experience points like any character and, once the limit is reached, it duplicates itself, placing an identical but basic level Materia in the inventory. Basically, it is important to micro-manage the Materia, associating it with the characters to define their role and abilities: basically, each character is identical to the others, even if some are better suited for magic or physical attack, but by applying the Materia you can customize them at will, developing tailor-made strategies for each area and combat. From this point of view, Final Fantasy VII does not disappoint: the huge game world, which can be fully explored thanks to the means of transport that become gradually available, offers challenges for all tastes. This is probably the Final Fantasy with more side activities and mini-games in the entire series: fans will surely remember the Chocobo races at the Golden Saucer, the snowboarding competition and many other extras and secrets, including special mega-bosses, which reward always with weapons, unique Materia and other goodies. 15 years later It is useless to go around it: as much as it may be tender in the eyes of the heart of the older ones, Final Fantasy VII is today a technically old game and the facelift operated by Square Enix has not improved the situation, on the contrary it has even accentuated the now advanced age of the title . It being understood that it is possible to play by disabling all filters and tricks to restore the original display, the funny super-deformed models of the various characters still remain composed of an embarrassing number of polygons: this type of choice is certainly part of the charm of the game, but who is used to the virtuosity of the new generation will certainly be banned by the essential style and extremely flat textures. On the other hand, the graphic improvements made by this conversion affect the 3D models, now much more defined and clean. Sideways, they highlight the poor resolution of the pre-rendered backgrounds, a cluster of pixels and colors that once left us speechless in detail and definition but which now disfigures in a worrying way on our cutting-edge screens like a real eyesore. The situation drastically improves in combat, when however the characters take on realistic proportions: the battlefields are polygonal like our party and its enemies, so the whole image is incredibly clean and defined, especially when using the most powerful spells or attacks. spectacular, such as the Limit Breaks. Even the computer graphics cutscenes remain in low resolution, with an effect in some cases even a little too vintage, exacerbated by the splendid soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu in a questionable midi format: some songs however remain unforgettable to say the least, the epic First and foremost One Winged Angel. It is worth concluding by mentioning three additional features of this 2012 edition: first, cloud saves; then, the Character Booster option, which allows you to maximize the money and vital values of the characters, suitable for those who do not want to waste too much time; finally, the ability to unlock thirty-six specific Achievements.", "date": "2012-09-10", "grade": "8.0"}
