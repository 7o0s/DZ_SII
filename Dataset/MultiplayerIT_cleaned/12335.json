{"name": "Pang", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pang.html", "text": "Released for the first time in 1989, Pang was able to conquer the audience of arcades right away and then immediately passed on to the home consoles of the time, churning out a substantial series of sequels and remakes even in recent times. The game sees a character face, within static stages, a series of bouncing ~balls~ whose touch is lethal, dividing them into smaller parts with the help of a grappling hook gun or other weapons that are possible to collect. The stage ends when even the smallest fragments are eliminated, and we move on to the next setting with a gradual increase in difficulty (higher number of balls, presence of obstacles and platforms, etc. etc.). The arrival on mobile phones is only the confirmation of a trend that seeks as many similarities as possible between modern terminals and the technical situation of gaming systems of fifteen, twenty years ago. Trend that manifests itself in the need for extremely simple and immediate games, also and above all as regards the control system, which still constitutes the Achilles heel of current wireless gaming. The numbers and features of this new version of Pang are flattering: fifty stages (as in the original game), two game modes (one normal and a sort of ~survival~ with the aim of making as many points as possible), a large number of weapons available and the ability to pause or turn off the sound at any time. In practice, Pang on mobile immediately reveals that it has two major limitations: the control system and the size of some graphic elements. As anyone who has ever played the game will know, to destroy the bouncing balls you need to wait for them to arrive and then shoot the grappling hook by calculating its speed, because releasing it too soon would prove useless (once it reaches the top of the screen, in fact, the grappling hook ~standard~ disappears). To perform this procedure repeatedly and in rapid succession, especially in the more advanced levels, requires fast and precise controls, which cell phones generally do not have. And it is especially necessary to see the smaller balls well, which are objectively difficult to identify on the phone screen. To overcome these drawbacks, one can only practice and reach compromises, which however never lead to a very enjoyable gaming experience. The technical realization of Pang is in line with the other products developed by Capcom, therefore the protagonist is equipped with an animation reduced to the bone while other elements on the screen appear more accurate. The images that make up the backdrop, and which vary from level to level, never reach a certain quality standard. As for the sound, it consists only of a musical commentary that fails to involve and which we will soon find ourselves turning off, given that the melodies often touch annoying high frequencies. In general, however, the technical realization of the product is functional to its playability and its structure. However, the developers had to find a way to make the smaller balls more visible.
