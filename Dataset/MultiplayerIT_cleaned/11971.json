{"name": "Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter-2-recensione_a.html", "text": "Despite the title, in fact, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 is conceptually different from its older brothers on PS3 and Xbox360. High Voltage has in fact taken some elements from the home versions (GRAW and GRAW2), reassembling them in a new game adapted to the PSP. The result is therefore a less complex title than the originals, an adventure-shooter playable in the first or third person that does not offer much strategic (the basic element is missing, the team of men to lead as mentioned above). Proof of this is that the adventure also evolves in a more or less linear way in just over 5 actual hours of play. Luckily the title offers at least different situations and ways to eliminate enemies, thus giving the user a certain variety of actions to perform. For example, our Mitchell will be engaged in vehicle escort operations in addition to roundups, and can use a drone to send it against terrorists and fill them with bombs from above, or call naval artillery to his rescue and bomb certain areas. Or still resort to its enviable fleet of weapons ranging from the SCAR assault rifle to the OICW ~super rifle~. Which on balance is what you will use more than the other trinkets. In fact, the enemies do not have a very developed AI, on the contrary, to be honest in certain situations it seems similar to that of any old Commodore 64 title, and therefore taking them out often will not require too much effort. An example? When you fire a volley at them, instead of taking cover and then trying to get around you or organize a counter-offensive, they'll just crouch in place, quietly waiting for you to reach them to finish them off. Maybe they will be so kind as to be found literally turned towards the wall with their backs to you Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 is available for Xbox360, PS3, PSP and PC. The version tested in this article is the PSP version. Furthermore, confirming that the game was made in a more ~arcade~ way compared to the home counterparts, we point out Mitchell's exaggerated ability to kill anyone with a couple of shots, even from a distance and not very precise, as well as an almost endless number of bullets and explosives. So as you can see, globally, excluding drones or various bombings, you won't really need to change your super-rifle, if not for the simple sake of trying new weapons. Not to mention that our hero is hard to die and regenerates in seconds from the injuries suffered. Which considerably simplifies the tasks of the video gamer, even in defiance of the controls which, although partly redesigned for the Sony laptop, in some phases prove to be a little difficult. The Pg moves with the analog stick on the console, while the four buttons are entrusted with the vertical and horizontal management of the view. Everything else goes to the remaining keys, and this is where the aforementioned difficulty falls. Ubisoft has created a hybrid product, ideally similar to any shooter, but with the controls borrowed from a strategic one. And given the small number of keys and levers on the PSP, which clashes with the many commands that can be given to the Pg in this kind of title, the programmers have been forced to invent strange key combos to give him orders, generating, as said, some problems in the most agitated phases. Luckily, at least the graphics aren't bad. The main character, the enemies and the surrounding areas are well done and characterized, with a whole series of elements that make the context in which you find yourself believable. Overall, Mitchell's animations and sound effects are fair, even if there is no background music. In general from this point of view we can say that we are faced with a good production. Finally, the multiplayer, in wi-fi, is good: up to 4 players in the combat arenas, 2 players in Cooperative Campaign mode. Comment The idea of proposing a certain type of game on a portable console, such as FPS-strategic, is not looked upon favorably by many enthusiasts and insiders. After all, they argue, laptops are born mainly to offer, Nintendo teaches, immediate and quick fun, without excessive frills, given their nature as non-homemade platforms. Ubisoft evidently took into account some of this line of thought of some, and thus decided to make GRAW2 easier. In doing so, however, he has created a hybrid product, ideally similar to any shooter, but with the commands borrowed from a strategic one. Which gives us a strange product, not up to the original. The game itself is not bad, all things considered, and can be played with easeapart from a few flaws, but it is precisely the basic concept that does not convince. Therefore, while not rejecting it, we mainly recommend it only to lovers of ~hit and run~ adventures. Pros: Well made graphics. Well done multiplayer. Great variety of weapons. Cons: Shallow. No Co-Op in singles. Low longevity. Tom Clancy is certainly, at this moment, the most prolific writer in the world in terms of literary publications (novels) as well as the major source of inspiration for video game developers and film screenwriters. Probably in this sense the only one to stand up to the inventor of Jack Ryan is a certain Stephen King. In the videogame field in particular, Tom Clancy and his stories have inspired dozens of strategic or action titles that have seen the light on practically every possible and imaginable platform, even portable ones, often earning vast acclaim among the public of enthusiasts of the genre. So after Splinter Cell Essentials and Rainbow Six Vegas, Ubisoft offers us this Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, the first of the series to see the light on PSP. Year 2014, Scott Mitchell, the leader of the Ghost team was sent on a mission south of the Panama border to fight terrorists implicated in high-tech weaponry trafficking with rebel forces who have provoked a terrifying civil war in Mexico and now threaten also the States. The player's task will obviously be to put an end to all this, discovering who sells weapons to the insurgents, but this time without being able to count on anyone's help. Our Mitchell, in fact, in this adventure, at least in the single player, will find himself alone to fight the hordes of enemies through 12 exclusive missions and 6 maps.", "date": "2007-10-02", "grade": null}
