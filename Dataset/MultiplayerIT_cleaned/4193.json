{"name": "LEGO Gli Incredibili", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lego-gli-incredibili-recensione-201531.html", "text": "Sequels to Pixar-branded films rarely reach the heights of the originals and sometimes completely disappoint all expectations - just think of Cars 2 and Finding Dory - so it is normal that many feared the worst for Incredibles 2, a film that continues the history of the unforgettable feature film of 2004 only in 2018: it seemed like a forced experiment, a risk that it would have been better not to run. The screenwriter and director Brad Bird, on the other hand, seems to have surprised everyone, making a film absolutely worthy of the previous one. This is what the Americans say, at least, because US cinemas have been showing The Incredibles 2 for about ten days already, while we Italians will have to wait for September. In this sense, therefore, LEGO The Incredibles represents a gigantic, monumental spoiler, given that the obligatory campaign begins right from the second film and follows the cinematic script step by step. In the following lines we have been very careful not to anticipate anything about the story, don't worry, and in the video review you find at the bottom we have recorded only a few sequences of the very first levels of the game. Readers be warned... The game: the usual bricks Disney Pixar movies and LEGO games developed by TT Games have one thing in common: they appeal to every age group differently. Kids love them: they're colourful, fun and carefree, but they require a little effort in the most delicate moments, for example when some character dies or you have to fight a boss at the end of a level. For adults who have had certain experiences, Pixar films touch different chords and speak in another language. At the same time, LEGO video games represent a delicate pastime, they are thought-challenging titles that focus on the longevity of the collecting component and on the opportunity to play together with someone else. For this reason, Game Over does not exist in LEGO video games, and each level of the story can be replayed at a later time using characters other than those previously imposed: some specific skills unlock new passages and even more collectibles in a continuous cycle of discoveries. It is a patented formula on which TT Games has been building - it must be said - for years and which over time has absorbed the trends and trends of the market, integrating the Quick Time Events and the open world dynamics of fully explorable cities. In the case of LEGO The Incredibles 2, in fact, the player can wander around New Urbem, a kind of New York that unfortunately pales in comparison to the one proposed in the various LEGO Marvel Super Heroes released in recent years. It's the first thing that catches your eye if you know LEGO video games. New Urbem is a fictitious location that appears only marginally in the Incredibles films, so the hub is not very detailed, there are fewer activities and objectives to complete, but above all the puzzles are much less and TT Games has preferred to ~hide~ the collectibles on rooftops or underwater, where players can easily get there using the powers of certain heroes or by obtaining the appropriate vehicles or aircraft. The crimes represent the pulp of the contents in the New Urbem open world: they are secondary missions made up of a multitude of micro-objectives which, once completed, unlock new areas of the map or some minifigures inspired by the various Pixar films such as Coco, Toy Story and so on saying. It is curious, however, that users are often forced to abandon the ongoing story missions to return to the city to explore it freely. The game essentially traps us in the campaign from the very first minutes of the tutorial level, preventing us from skipping the cutscenes and looping the various stages inspired by the key sequences of the film at a rapid pace: this means, in fact, that playing The Incredibles 2 without having first seen the eponymous feature film means ruining every twist. It is clear that, as usual, TT Games has partially changed the script and dialogues to make way for the typical gags of LEGO games, gags which, however, after so many years, are starting to be really too similar and uninspired. Once the story of The Incredibles 2 is completed, we then move on to the first film, also divided into various levels, but the bizarre chronological choice ends up affecting the narrative and the evolution of the characters and their powers, moreover a pillar thematic in both stories. Playstation 4 trophies There are 52 trophies in total to unlock: the platinum trophy is achieved only after earning the two gold, nine silver and forty bronze trophies. As per tradition in LEGO games, these trophies are unlocked abbroom easily: just complete each objective and collect all the collectibles, an activity that requires more patience than effort. The characters and their powers The Incredibles franchise has precisely two films, released fourteen years apart from each other, and in this period of time Disney and Pixar have not exactly focused on the world of the Parr family: The Incredibles 2 invents numerous supporting actors and enemies with which to give breathing space to the story, but they are still few compared to the hundreds of heroes and villains that roam the Marvel and DC universes. It goes without saying, then, that the roster of collectible characters in LEGO Incredibles 2 is massively sacrificed compared to those in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes or LEGO Batman. This is probably why TT Games compensated with the introduction of the characters that appeared in the other Pixar films: it was an obvious but rather unfortunate choice, also because most of the minifigures in question appeared little similar to us or in any case rather generic compared to the original counterparts. On the gameplay front, however, we must admit that some new powers, such as Violetta's force fields, have a very interesting role in solving the various environmental puzzles that represent the main obstacle in the various stages. While it is true that many powers and abilities are quite derivative - just think of those of Elastigirl, practically identical to those of Mister Fantastic in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes - it is also fair to point out that the British developer has found some truly ingenious and original ways to combine them when you have to face a riddle or a puzzle. The solutions are always phone calls, attention: a series of visual indicators explicitly suggests the characters to use and in what order, taking the younger players by the hand who could easily get confused. Despite this, the level design seemed much more inspired than usual, thanks also to a more than discreet technical realization that offers spectacular scenarios and settings such as running trains, highway chases and flying planes. Less successful, however, is the frequent use of small and repetitive Quick Time Events which usually result in the repeated pressing of the same key. These are defects that LEGO video games have been dragging on for years now, such as the woody and imprecise combat system that has characterized the franchise since the very first iterations and which really deserves a good overhaul. In LEGO The Incredibles, in particular, it seemed to us that he even took a few steps backwards, despite the inclusion of super attacks that can be used after having chained a certain number of shots: unfortunately you always have the feeling of beating the air and you don't feels the slightest impact neither when attacking nor when taking back, so it often happens that you don't even realize that you are losing all hearts until our hero explodes into a pile of bricks, only to reappear after a few seconds for the joy of big and small.", "date": "2018-06-25", "grade": "7.0"}
