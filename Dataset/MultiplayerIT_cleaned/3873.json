{"name": "Miscreated - La recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/miscreated-recensione.html", "text": "If you are passionate about survival it is likely that you have heard of Miscreated, the eternal promise of the genre capable of selling, to date, the beauty of half a million copies. We were interested in it in unsuspected times, when DayZ was exploring territories in which other titles would later have a resounding success. We return to deal with it years later because the Early Access phase is finally over and, although the game is still in Beta, we are faced with a product sold as complete. But will it be like this? Alone in the Orca island From the home screen you can only choose the gender of the avatar: a little, we would have expected at least to be able to change skin color, hairstyle and other basic aspects that similar titles allow you to customize. This done we are catapulted to a random point, equipped only with a paper map and a torch. The goal, as always in these cases, is only one: not to die. We need to keep under control the level of health, that of hunger, thirst, body temperature and radiation. The game is in fact set in a post-apocalyptic island populated mainly by mutants and wild animals, naturally endowed with very unsavory instincts. There is no tutorial: if in other titles it is an absence that we would not have even mentioned, the convoluted key assignment in Miscreated would have made it appreciable. With the I key, commonly used for the inventory, you choose which position to adopt, while to access the character screen you need to press the letter G in the standard settings. From here you can set the equipment and enter the screen crafting. The graphical interface, conceptually similar to that of other survival games, requires a bit of practice and didn't seem particularly user friendly to us: sometimes certain elements are not selectable, others still unable to perform the desired action. The creation tab presents eight macro-categories divided in turn into thematic areas; wandering around the world you can find projects that make it even richer, such as new recipes for drinks or medicines. Hardcore loot The lack of intuitiveness of Miscreated does not stop at the keyboard mapping (fortunately editable). The map, for example, cannot be displayed in full screen, but must be read by moving the first person view (which is the one that will be used most often, although a camera is also available behind the protagonist) and looking down, as if you were to look at an object that you hold in your hand. Resource gathering is imprecise because there are no visual effects highlighting hotspots. If we approach a refrigerator to check its contents, the door will not open; if we rummage in a desk, the outline will not be highlighted; if we tear the fabric from a cushion this will not undergo any change in shape or color. It goes without saying that we end up furiously pressing the action button near every possible hiding place, with the hope that a notice (in English, the localization in Italian is not currently provided) signals to us that we have filled the backpack with something Interesting. The problem is that there are very few interesting things: it can be necessary to wander for minutes to find the simple twigs needed to make an axe. The scarcity of loot is one of the most frequent complaints in the forums (particularly active) and it must be recognized that scouring an entire apartment building just to find some bad apples and a Pepsi may not be rewarding for all users. On the other hand, it is a coherent choice with the hardcore cut that permeates the entire production. Miscreated uses CryEngine 3 There is little to say about the setting: the planet earth is back from a nuclear war and the human race has been reduced to surviving on Orca Island, an islet inhabited by no more than 50 players (this is the maximum number of users that Entrada servers can host concurrently). This is an aspect in which Miscreated does not disappoint: not so much for the variety of locations, whose good assortment is consistent with the morphology of the territory, as for the particle effects that the Crysis engine manages to guarantee. The light that filters through the leaves of a tree, the rain that rages with the gusts of wind, the gentle twilight transition between day and night are all noteworthy images that make exploration pleasant. The population is much less brilliant, both in terms of creativity in design (you mostly encounter armless mutants and giant insects), sia in terms of construction, with animations bordering on acceptable for a 2018 title. The driving sections didn't seem finished with the right care and also the variety of enemies is really too low (we counted two types of mutants, a cerberus , exploding spiders and giant grasshoppers, in about a four-hour game). Desolation is the right term to describe the landscape. Whether you are strolling through the streets of a town, through the ruins of a hospital, on the runway of an airport, among the dormitories of a barracks, the leitmotiv does not change: we will always and only find abandoned cars (some of which are still function, with the right finishing touches), wrecks of airplanes, filthy beds, destroyed sinks. Here and there the noise of some humanoid reminds us that we are not the only explorers in the area and, if we are lucky, it may even happen to meet other people in the flesh. In our matches, with amazement, we found a lot of collaboration, the result of the awareness that it would be of little use to beat each other up, but it is not certain that they are all armed with good intentions. PvP is in fact a very dangerous weapon: you risk losing everything built in dozens of hours due to a player you didn't notice and who maybe found a rifle a few minutes ago. It takes very little to switch to the creator: a headshot may be enough, although aiming from a distance is not so easy. So let's forget about a ~frantic~ action a la PUBG, also because there are very few weapons and even less ammunition, so the trigger must be pressed extremely sparingly. Nor, at the moment, is it possible to avoid the clash between human beings, because there are no servers dedicated only to PvE. Better to die Death is a real drama because everything that has been accomplished up to that moment is lost to be resurrected, completely naked, in a random point on the map. Here comes the bad news, because the current position of the player is not highlighted on the latter: therefore, to recover what was lost, in the hope that no one is around and has taken advantage of it, you have to orient yourself with the billboards (or experience) . This unholy option, the unsuccessful daughter of Entrada's elitist policy, is particularly harmful in the case of cooperation. In order to create a clan it is necessary to be face to face with a friend and, even in doing so, upon reaching the server it is not said that one is born in the vicinity of companions. There is a rudimentary GPS (Survivotron) which indicates the coordinates and which simplifies life a bit, but it is really too little. Dying is very easy: from excessive hunger, from radioactive storms, from a jump made from a few centimeters high... Unfortunately, the game is not free from bugs of various kinds which, although they do not make the experience impractical game, they sometimes risk compromising it. One possibility offered is that of building one's own home, a safe haven in which to keep one's possessions, but the base building did not convince us at all, above all due to the limited inventory, already compromised by the fact that one carries always with a good dose of water, food and medicines.", "date": "2019-01-06", "grade": "6.0"}
