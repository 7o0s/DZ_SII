While the genre enjoyed global success, thanks to Street Fighter 2 and its many clones, SEGA thought it well to try the road of three dimensions, to try something different and press the accelerator on strategy and realism instead of special moves both spectacular and implausible. The hardware of the Model 1 platform guaranteed cutting-edge polygonal graphics for the time, especially as regards the fluidity of the animations, and the developers thought of making the controls simple but with great depth at the same time: despite having only three buttons (punch, kick and parry), in fact, the game allowed the execution of numerous combos and special maneuvers by mixing the pressure of the keys and the joystick. The success of Virtua Fighter paved the way for many other producers, guaranteeing the genre an evolution that has continued until today, giving us real gameplay jewels. It is no coincidence that the first 3D fighting game in history is also the first to enjoy a conversion for mobile phones, after all current Java-compatible devices are now quite used to three-dimensional applications. The work that the Southend Interactive team has done for Glu therefore has a double meaning: on the one hand it pays homage to a classic SEGA, which in many ways revolutionized fighting games; on the other, it serves as a test to understand if there are the conditions for such an evolution also in the mobile sector. From the start screen we can access the options (the ~standard~ ones relating to sound and vibration, but also the ~advanced~ ones to adjust the number of rounds, the level of difficulty and the settings for lowering the characters, which can be ~fixed~ or not) and the four game modes available: arcade, survival, practice and tutorial. The last two, of course, are used to familiarize yourself with the control system and with the ~philosophy~ at the base of Virtua Fighter, while the arcade and survival modes represent the substance of this conversion: in the first case we will have to choose a character and then face all the others in sequence, until we are confronted with the powerful Dural; in the second case, it will be a survival race that will see us face an infinite number of opponents with only one energy bar available. The control system has been organized in such a way as to be able to move our alter ego with the joystick, while the 5 key is assigned to the block and the 7 and 9 keys respectively to the punch and kick. The game action is anything but fast, and this allows us to maneuver the character relatively calmly, also because on certain mobile phones it would be impossible to produce rapid combinations. An exceptional job has been done to reproduce the gameplay of Virtua Fighter in minute detail, but it is clear that the technical limitations of current Java-compatible devices made a perfect conversion impossible: in this case it is speed that is lacking, and the impression is that the graphics engine has not been optimized or that not enough ~cuts~ have been made to make everything more agile and faster. The animations are practically all there, the stages are the classic mix between a bitmap background and a polygonal ~carpet~, but the characters pay a heavy price in terms of detail, above all due to the small number of colors used and the lack of lighting effects to mark their shapes. Needless to comment on the sound, which once again plays a marginal role, with anonymous music and no effects.
