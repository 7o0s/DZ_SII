{"name": "Winning Eleven 7", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/winning-eleven-7.html", "text": "Winning Eleven Mania Making a complete history of all the Winning Eleven releases is almost impossible and useless, instead it is important to know how Konami arranges the cadence of its releases. In fact, three versions of its football simulation appear every year, the first in the spring-summer period, which bears the new numbering in the title (as in the case of Winning Eleven 7) and is noted for the major innovations, followed in October by a version dedicated to the Japanese championship and called J-League, ending with a revised and corrected version that usually takes the wording Final Evolution, where there are updated squads and refinements made to the gameplay. In short, fans of the football simulation made in Konami just can't complain! The use of Japanese characters has always been a major obstacle to fully understanding all the options and innovations introduced in each episode of the series, and this seventh chapter is no exception. Only the main menu is in fact translated into the Anglo-Saxon language, a peculiarity that at least allows you to easily understand what you need to select to play, for example, a quick game, a tournament or the master league, the fulcrum mode of the game but also more penalized by the kanji present inside of the game. Glimpsing through the various menus, however, some innovations are immediately noticed, first of all the addition of a new section called Winning Eleven shop, in which thanks to the points acquired after a victory in a competition or following the completion of a challenge in the training section , we will be able to unlock new options, secret teams and players, sound effects and so on. The master league sees the presence of a greater number of club teams, which increase the number of groups and extra competitions present, not to mention a more complete management of statistics, transfers and the transfer market. The training section has also undergone a big boost in the modes present and in the options available, thus becoming a good school for novice players, but also for veterans of the series. We close the description of the new features in the options with the edit mode, which in this version is impressive for its completeness and for the choices available; just to give an example, it will now be possible to modify every single feature of the players' faces, with consequent greater possibilities for customizing your player roster. Kabira Mania Many of you may have wondered who is that madman who underlines every action of the players on the field in Winning Eleven with screams and exultation. Well, his name is John Kabira, commentator of the game since the first chapter of the series, and has now become an inseparable component of the series as regards the sound sector. There are not a few fan clubs created (obviously in Japan, but also in Italy there are many people who have erected him into a real myth) for this true ~character~, and phrases like ~Shutooo! and Marker! have now entered the imagination of all Winning Eleven players. Do you want to know the face of Kabira? We have recovered an image for you! However, all the improvements listed a few lines above are crumbled once they take to the field, where Winning Eleven 7 once again shows its immense class and the now more unique than rare ability to give fun to players who hold the pad in hand, without particular sensations of deja vu. The faces of the players have reached, especially as regards the most charismatic and famous ones, incredible heights of resemblance to their real counterparts, and in close-up shots (for example after scoring a goal or touching the net following an offensive action ) will be immediately recognizable thanks to their somatic traits. The use also in this version of the Renderware graphics engine by Konami Tyo returns well-made stadiums from a polygonal point of view, but a still insufficient realization of the public, which, although animated, is reduced to mere textures spread on two-dimensional pixels. A decidedly different sensation is given by the players on the pitch, who move in a fluid and harmonious way and manage to imitate their alter egos in all respects. Konami has in fact carried out an action of further refinement regardingthe movements of the players and their repertoire of animations, all at a frame rate firmly anchored on 60 frames per second, without any slowdown even in more crowded situations. The difference between the more technically gifted players and the others will be visible for example during dribbling and in stops, or still in front of goal in conjunction with shots, lobs or headers. Even the physics of the ball has benefited from some refinement, always aimed at giving extreme realism and never achieved by any football simulation. All this translates into a greater variety of play and a better balance of the players on the pitch, even when the opponents are controlled by the computer. The player will therefore be able to create reasoned and varied actions like never before and it will not infrequently happen to score a goal already seen on television, thanks to the movements of the most famous goalkeepers and players. It is also a pleasure to see the introduction of new features which may have been desirable for many editions but which have only now been introduced: in fact, we are talking about the rule of advantage, handballs and the possibility of viewing the replay at any time of the match. The only inconsistencies are perhaps with the shots (especially from outside the area) which in the preparation phase appear a little too slow, and therefore have the possibility of being successful only if you have large spaces available in front of you; in any case, with a little practice, this defect can be greatly smoothed out. Comment It was a very difficult task, but once again Konami has succeeded in improving an already high-caliber title from practically all points of view. Winning Eleven 7 is THE football simulation par excellence and offers more variety than its predecessor, more balance on the pitch and even more realism. Multiplayer games offer, waiting for a real online mode, a unique and even more satisfying gaming experience. Konami has in fact been careful to evolve and refine every aspect of its simulation, from the game mechanics to the options offered to the player. Perhaps only the release of the title is placed in an unhappy period, since in the middle of the transfer market and consequently with formations not updated with the latest transfers. What should we expect for the next releases? Perhaps greater care for the squads and for the stadiums, we already have everything else available. Pros: Even more refined game mechanics Numerous game options Realism and pure fun Cons: Squads not updated with the latest transfers Starting with an adequate introductory hat for a title of this caliber is not always easy, especially if we are talking about Winning Eleven, the football simulation par excellence that is offered by Konami every year in three different versions, ready to feed all football fans digital and not. From this seventh chapter we must therefore expect a lot, and if the much coveted online mode has not been implemented even in this seventh chapter, we can say that Konami Tyo has once again hit the mark, giving us a virtually perfect football simulation.", "date": "2003-08-19", "grade": null}
