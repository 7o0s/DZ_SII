Those in their thirties will already remember, starting from the end of the 80s, the hours spent in the company of Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf, Zany Golf and many others, with which the gamers of the time tried to repeat the feats of the protagonist of the cartoon Tutti in campo con Lotti. In the course of its gaming history, the golf discipline has lent itself to interpretations of various kinds, from those intended to reproduce reality as in the case of EA Sports' PGA Tour, or a little more light-hearted such as the Japanese production Everybody's Golf. As we recalled in our last test of the game we are dealing with in this review, the series developed by Clap Hanz has its roots back to 1997, thus celebrating twenty years of life when it arrives on PlayStation 4. In addition to some thunderstorms, the end of August in fact gave us the arrival of Everybody's Golf exclusively on the Sony platform: let's go and see what the Yokohama team has in store for us. Spaghetti! Among the innovations introduced by the seventh chapter of the main trend of Everybody's Golf we find the character editor, usable at the start of the game to model what will be your avatar within the game. A rather powerful tool, with which it is possible to generate a character that resembles us in reality, or vice versa, to give free rein to one's imagination to create a being with an enormous head and a tiny body, equipped with big ball eyes, various accessories and so on. Street. In case you don't want to waste time, there are still a number of predefined templates, as well as the possibility of copying the look of some of the characters you meet along the way. The shop in the game does the rest, giving the player the opportunity to change his look at any time by taking advantage of the objects obtained as a reward for his sporting feats, or those purchased with the use of the currency present in the game, which is also collected as he progresses in Everybody's Golf. Once you've defined the appearance of your bat-wielding alter ego, it's time to get to know the base camp, the place from which to start all the activities envisaged by this title on PlayStation 4. A brief introduction prompts the player to start one of the many tournaments that he will find himself playing, thus immediately taking him onto the course to touch the central experience of Everybody's Golf. Faced with the latter, those who already know the series will already know what to expect, given the confirmation of the famous three clicks: one to start the shot, one to define its power level and a final one to establish the precision of the swing . To start getting some satisfaction on the green, there's nothing else to know, even if you soon realize that Everybody's Golf brings with it a series of elements that go beyond the simple arcade game. If the wind is now an inevitable factor to take into account in order not to see the ball go badly, Clap Hanz has done an excellent job of giving this game an appreciable additional depth over time, realizing for example that the choice of club it can be crucial inside a hole or that giving the right spin to the ball can be the difference between a birdie and a par. An undoubtedly right approach, which allows everyone to start playing immediately, but which requires a little more experience to execute complex shots such as a perfect exit from a bunker or a putt from distance. Like in an RPG The setting given by the developers to Everybody's Golf closely resembles that of role-playing games, from more than one point of view. Tackling offline tournaments allows the player to level up, accumulating experience points with which to face some opponents in one-on-one challenges, obtaining particular bonuses in case of success. This is the way to unlock all five courses in the game, and this is the aspect in which Everybody's Golf could be improved, especially in the early hours. In fact, we agree with the decision to make the game accessible even to novices, but if the challenge level becomes too low even for the latter, the loss of interest risks being around the corner. Even by setting the most difficult game mode, for large stretches you find yourself first by posting without too much effort, within a grinding system that forces the player to repeat the already known holes over and over again before being able to move on to those following. It's a real shame, perch the less patient could soon get bored in the face of such an experience, depriving themselves of the possibility of appreciating what Everybody's Golf can offer at the highest levels. At the same time, those who intend to unlock all the elements must necessarily have holy patience to overcome the most boring stages. Speaking of role-playing games, the character's ability with the various clubs grows with the use made of them: the player therefore has the choice of specializing with a single stick to get the best out of it, or rotate the choice of woods and irons in order to count on a good skill in their use. In addition to power, the other skills are control, backspin and backhand. The first allows you to cover ever longer distances, the second to make precise shots, the third to control the bounce of the ball and the last to obtain a greater probability of making a successful chip-in. Playstation 4 trophies Everybody's Golf presents a total of thirty-one Trophies: one of the platinum type, the usual, accompanied by five gold, ten silver and fifteen bronze. Most of them can be unlocked by progressing through the game's modes and classes, but completing the entire list requires you to hone your class in the art of golf. Dedicating yourself to the collateral activities introduced by Clap Hanz in this edition is the extra effort required to platinum Everybody's Golf. Do what we please Everybody's Golf tries to offer some alternative to the grind of offline tournaments, succeeding on and off. The main option is represented by online play, accessible from the same hub from which the matches against the artificial intelligence are started. Once landed on the Internet, Everybody's Golf allows us to run here and there between the holes of the game, looking for hidden objects or to take a dip in the streams found in the courses. You can also fish and drive karts, provided you have unlocked the relevant action by defeating the appropriate opponent in single mode. The alternative activities also concern the hub itself, in which, for example, a bizarre professor subjects us to a series of quizzes of increasing difficulty, which can also be tackled to obtain rewards related to the look of your player or a new caddy. Elements of this type can serve to distract a little between one hole and another, and little more: studying some additional challenges for karts, for example, could have given the entire game more scope. Remaining in the online game, the type of game called Turf War remains appreciable, in which a red and a blue team challenge each other to try to conquer the largest number of holes among those present within the field. There is also the usual series of competitions, in which to get lost in hours and additional hours of play together with other players able to offer a higher level of challenge than the (low) one guaranteed by the CPU. As far as the technical sector is concerned, the general glance is certainly positive, but going into detail some perplexities emerge. The models of some characters give the impression of being anchored to the previous videogame generation, as well as some textures related to the grass of the field. Support for PlayStation 4 Pro allows you to activate HDR on televisions that support it and 4K resolution, as well as bringing the number of frames per second to 60. However, the latter setting seemed a bit of a dancer in the open world phases. From a stylistic point of view, we feel like eliminating the doubts we had previously: Everybody's Golf continues to have its own identity, even if the powerful editor puts some elements related to aesthetics in the hands of the players that were previously predefined by the developers.", "date": "2017-08-31", "grade": "7.8"}
