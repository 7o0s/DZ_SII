If initially it was fashionable to speak of Martians or of waters and vegetation that covered the surface of the relative planet, after the Vikings missions of the 70s which showed the desert aridity of the territory and its typical red color with thousands of images, they decidedly more cyberpunk, dark and dystopian tales took shape. The French development team Spiders, which evidently has a particular affection for this setting, has also decided to place The Technomancer in this context, which is to be considered a true sequel to Mars: War Logs, a few years old sci-fi RPG does for PC and older generation consoles. The CEO of Spider, Jehanne Rousseau, has declared that his new action role-playing game is decidedly larger than its predecessor in terms of duration, territories to explore and budget spent; we have played it thoroughly and we feel we can say that, if it probably didn't reach the levels of products such as the Mass Effect series, The Technomancer has taken important steps forward by providing a varied and fun product that will offer you many hours of gameplay and different epilogues depending on your choices. Set two hundred years after the colonization of Mars, during the ~Water War~, you will take on the role of Zachariah, born and raised in the slums of Ophir who, after discovering the gift of manipulation and control of electricity, begins his traveled by Technomancer (those who have the gift) and joins the army of the Abundance corporation (one of the most powerful on the red planet). In this universe, the air of Mars is breathable but the inhabitants live within the ~shadow line~ which protects them from the extremely dangerous radiations of the sun: not everyone has had this luck and the effects of the rays of our star have caused of transfiguring mutations both on animals and on men. Among them, the malformations caused by radiation have created the subclass of mutants that other humans have well thought of relegating to the role of slaves, ghettoizing them and forcing them to forced labour; it didn't go better for the animals who have taken on the most varied shapes and sizes and whose danger you will notice from the early stages of the game. The Technomancer has a classic structure with a main quest and lots of sidequests; there will be many choices that you will be led to make and each of them will influence, in addition to the plot itself, the behavior of the characters towards you. Are you ready to make a difference in the fate of humanity on the red planet? Introducing The Technomancer, the new Spiders sci-fi RPG in which you will influence the fate of the planet Technomancer, a matter of style We begin by customizing Zachariah's physical appearance, nothing special to tell the truth, the canonical changes in the color of the skin, hair and eyes without too many options; different speech instead as regards the specialization of the character in the three trees present in the game. The first is that of the talents in which you can choose three six of them and each of these has three levels. To give some examples, charisma will increase success in dialogues and provide damage and health bonuses to teammates, science allows you to increase team regeneration and heal teammates in combat as well as giving a bonus on dialogues regarding medicines and poisons , fabrication is the last of the six talents that helps in dialogues when something to be built is at stake, allowing you to recycle components from objects without using one of the many workbenches scattered around the map and to use blueprints for modifications of highest level. Exploration increases the amount of items and serum (the game's currency) you take from downed enemies and containers scattered throughout the game; with traps/burglary, on the other hand, you can virtually open any locked container or door and produce explosive traps that are very useful in combat; finally, with stealth you will enhance attacks from behind and decrease the possibility of being heard in stealth mode. The second tree is that of attributes where you will have one point available every three levels of Zachariah to spend in one of the four main branches: agility will be useful for the combat style of the Rogue, strength for the Warrior, resistance for Guardian and power for the Technomancer. In the last tree, the one of the skills that concerns more specifically the fighting styles, you will assign a point for each level done; here you will have access to special attacks other than the basic ones and bonus come increased damage or critical strike chance. The first part of the game serves as a hidden tutorial in the main storyline: it is here that, by testing them on the field, you can opt for the Guardian, a resistant tank with weapon in hand and shield, the Fighter, who uses a two-handed staff focusing more on attacks area, or the Rogue, who specializes in stealth, back attacks, traps, poisons, dodging and armed with a dagger (or similar) in one hand and a pistol in the other. Each fighting style has a particular ~stance~ which can be changed in real time during the action, giving the possibility of tactically varying the fight. While your weapon will be permanently shrouded in electricity (you can also choose not to electrify it), the Technomancer's powers can be enhanced by spending points on its tree or left to act as a ~seasoning~: the tree will give you access to powers such as bows electricity or energy barriers but not for free, as Technomancy uses a special fluid that needs a recharge time. We can confirm that the three fighting styles make the way to deal with the game's many clashes profoundly different and you will be encouraged to learn each of them. As mentioned, the story will unfold through a quest system in which it will often happen that you decide the fate of the protagonist characters of the same, and your being more cruel or more magnanimous will influence your charisma and any distrust or satisfaction of the components of your team: similarly to what was seen in Mass Effect, you will have a team of non-player characters at your disposal whose members will be an integral part of the plot and you can assign them commands both in real time, with convenient key combinations to recall them, and through a menu fast which also activates a pause and which will sometimes prove to be very valuable during the frenzy of the fights. To the combination of fast keys we can also assign other actions such as healing, special attacks that can be unlocked as the levels progress, the use of the trap or the regeneration of the fluid useful for the use of the Technomancer powers. The difficulty of the fights is balanced quite well even if, already at a normal level, you will have to sweat a lot to get out alive from some situations in which you will face more than one opponent at the same time: the clashes against the human or animal bosses that populate the lands will be particularly tactical Martians and can often poison or control electricity just like you, or in the specific case of animals, be gigantic as well. To your aid there will be the particular system of ~combat dynamics~ in which the action slows down slightly in the salient moments giving you a breather (it is fractions of a second but it will be fundamental). You can also focus on a target, on which a crosshair will appear, selecting or deselecting it with L3: around it you will move and concentrate your attacks but this will prove useful especially when the enemy is only one, given that in clashes with multiple enemies you will end up automatically turning your back on one of them who, since all the characters (including you) have a bonus in hitting from behind, can also take more than half your health bar away. If you die, you will need to redo everything starting from the automatic saving or from the possible manual saving if you have used this option (which, moreover, makes things quite easy since it is almost always possible to save). There are a total of four difficulties ranging from Easy, where you enjoy the game so the fights don't get frustrating, to Extreme, where not only will enemies hear even if you step on dog shit but you'll also need to become proficient master parrying with guardian style or you won't stand a chance with even the most unarmed of beggars. Recycle, build and equip A fundamental part of the game is the equipment that differs from class to class and which can be found, bought in the many markets present or built using one of the many workbenches scattered throughout the game locations. You can choose to sell the objects or to recycle them to obtain pieces such as metal, leather or electrical debris that will have different qualities and will affect any modification to the built object. On the workbench you can also craft medicines to regenerate health, fluid or traps; a further use of the table is that of modifying the equipment and in fact, almost always, both the weapons and the armor have slots where it is possible to insert modifications to the damage done, to the absorbed damage or to the resistance to destabilization.ne (which is the possibility of falling or being stunned). The equipment is specific to each class and you will not be able to use, for example, a pistol in ~stance~ as a Warrior or Guardian. Likewise, tougher and heavier gear has mandatory strength requirements that, for example, if you embark on the Rogue career, you won't have it. Technomancer pieces have very high fluid regeneration which will allow you to make electrical attacks more often, but you need to have spent power points to be able to wear them; the Technomancer, the Rogue and their gear have much lower resistance to destabilization than the Guardian but the latter will never do a backflip to dodge an enemy's gunshot or charge, preferring to parry a blow with his shield. In a cyberpunk-style world like that of The Technomancer one would think of solving everything with firearms, but the ploy used by the Spider boys is that of heating the weapon with a consequent reload time which does not allow continuous shooting. Although you will soon realize that the Rogue's shooting ability is still strong, many armors will be effective against gunfire making them sometimes completely useless. The equipment does not only concern Zachariah, as already mentioned, in fact also the members of the team will be dressed to perfection and will level up with you fighting: be careful not to leave their equipment behind, otherwise you will find yourself alone after a few seconds from the start of the fight ! It will be possible to create a team by covering all the roles, since among the various characters you will meet during the game you will always have one who uses the style of guardian, one of villain and one of warrior (we are talking about fighting style). Interaction with the team is also important for solving some quests, when you need to have a role available that Zachariah cannot fill. For example, one of your allies will be a mechanic from whom you can get help when you need to fix something, another will be skilled at lockpicking and can open containers if you have chosen to ignore this aspect. That's not all: in a very similar way to Mass Effect, the interaction with teammates and any romantic relationships with them can be explored in various ways, or by talking to them after some quests or by bringing a specific character with you when you are going to perform a task in a location that has to do with their past. The possibility of equipping the team exactly as you do with the protagonist, the relationships with the other characters and the possibility of using them in a different way to solve problems are a good strength of The Technomancer. Playstation 4 trophies The Technomancer's trophies are mainly based on the progression of the story and the eventual deployment for one of the main corporations of Mars but, not only that, there are also those obtained for defeating bosses or for the continuous use of traps or a fighting style. Finally, there are trophies dedicated to killing a certain number of creatures or completing the game on various difficulty levels. Sunsets and sunrises in the deserts of Mars A feature of the game is the presence of the day-night cycle with which you will have to deal both when you have to wait some time for the completion of a mission and when you have to meet a character at a certain time of day: you can also sleep (every main location has your own bedroom) and get bonus experience when you are rested. Starting from the day / night cycle, let's talk about the graphic sector of the game since this aspect will give you the possibility to observe sunsets and changes of lights if you are outside, perhaps in the Valles Marineris, precisely in the right hours of the Martian SOL. The atmospheres are dark and the red/orange tones of Mars prevail in almost all environments. The game engine, which makes it run at 1080p at 30 frames (the CEO specified that he did not want the team to focus on 60 frames per second to improve other aspects of the game) is nothing exceptional and the feeling we have , comparing The Technomancer to other types of high-budget productions such as Mass Effect 3, is to find ourselves in front of a game graphically a little behind. However, the scenarios, the cities arranged on different levels with details in motion, such as air filtering machines or immense sails that protect from the sunlight, give a very immersive feeling of immersion.
