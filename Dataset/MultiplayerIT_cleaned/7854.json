Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. Born in the early 80s at the behest of Hasbro, which distributed a line of transformable robots made by Takara in the West and thought it best to build an entire franchise around them, entrusting Marvel with the creation of stories that later became a famous cartoon and a less famous (but at times truly enjoyable) comic, the Transformers have returned to great relevance in recent years thanks to the filmic reinterpretation signed by Michael Bay. However, the toys remain in the hearts of longtime fans, from the very first models with magnetic man (legacy of the various characters' Diaclonian origins) to the spectacular ~merge groups~, and epic scenes from the animated series such as the one in which the enormous Devastator literally holds in hand an Optimus Prime (~Commander~) without an arm. There has been a comic book revival for the use and consumption of nostalgics, based precisely on the ~first generation~ of transformable robots, and Transformers Legends is the very son of this philosophy, particularly respectful towards the original design of Ratchet (~Doc~) rather than by Wheeljack (~Lightning~) or Soundwave (~Memor~). What we are dealing with is a free-to-play collectible card game, therefore downloadable for free from the App Store or Google Play, characterized by the presence of truly fantastic artwork, which alone is worth the ticket price (free, we repeat). The structure of the product is very simple and focuses equally on quality and quantity. Our ~deck~, in fact, consists of nine cards each representing an Autobot or a Decepticon, depending on the faction we have selected. The various characters have variable attack and defense characteristics, to be strengthened not only through the collection of experience points and therefore the usual grinding, but also by using additional cards that we have received thanks to the ~space bridge~ or reconnaissance, which we can merge together to achieve a sometimes substantial upgrade of our robot. Much more than what you see The ~management~ mechanics of Transformers Legends are extremely rich and all the more enjoyable the more we are passionate about the classic series and its characters. As already mentioned, the artwork created for the game is splendid and some of them boast a ~3D-like~ effect, with parts of the drawing that move on multiple levels of depth when we move the device, simulating a depth that doesn't actually exist. The procedures for obtaining a more powerful deck (which said so may seem equivocal) are varied and consist not only of the ~fusion~ described above, where we generally choose to sacrifice the less powerful characters or in any case with lower growth prospects to improve the skills of the ~leaders~, but also in similar operations concerning weapons, or the so-called ~trans-scan~, which amplifies the power of the character if we have both the card that portrays him in vehicle mode and the card with in which he appears in humanoid form. The freemium dynamics are rather permissive and allow us to try our hand several times a day with missions or direct confrontations with other users (naturally in asynchronous mode), to open various bridges to obtain extra cards and therefore to continue aiming at the progressive enhancement of the ~ pink~, which can be further optimized based on the position of the cards on the table. The variety of situations is also promoted by special community events that you can participate in and which include, for example, confrontation with a certain group of Transformers. What Transformers Legends lacks is unfortunately a ~resolution~ phase that is up to the managerial one, in the sense that one could be inspired by the many Japanese card games to obtain a strategic combat system of great value, rather than throwing everything on automatisms and on the mere numerical comparison.", "date": "2013-05-04", "grade": "7.9"}
