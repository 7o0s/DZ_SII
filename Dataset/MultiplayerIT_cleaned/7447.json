And this despite some inevitable flaws that now seem to characterize the production in every edition. The public has evidently decided to reward the choice of the Canadian company to continue its journey along that road which should lead to an increasingly realistic simulation. Even at the cost of sacrificing for this reason, on the altar of verisimilitude and control, a part of the pace of the race, in favor of a more reasoned and less frenetic gameplay. The goal of Electronic Arts now appears clear: to renew its creature from year to year without losing sight of the good things previously built, using precisely the positive aspects achieved up to then as a basis for subsequent works. And this is the concept that inspired the developers for the generational passage of the series on the new consoles. FIFA 14 for the next gen is an enhanced version of the current one, a sort of 2.0 edition Playstation 4 trophies FIFA 14 offers 42 trophies, of which twenty-four bronze, fifteen silver, two gold and one platinum. To get them you need to be able to win certain challenges in the different modes present in the game, such as being able to perform complex feints, protect the ball by holding the defender at arm's length, observe and find a footballer with a combination of three attributes on the net of the global market in Career mode or win the most important competitions in which you participate both online and offline. Ball in the center FIFA 14 lands on PlayStation 4 with the same content available on the ~minor~ platforms, except for a handful of modes that have been eliminated from production, probably because they are considered uninteresting. Among these, the Tournament stands out incredibly, which we believe is important above all because it has always offered the possibility of creating personalized championships or cups to be played with friends. In any case, the most famous are still present, those that for several years have been considered by fans to be the fulcrum of the gaming experience. So let's talk about the Career mode, enriched by a system of scouts to be sent around the world in search of talent, of the Ultimate Team, that is to say the game session that allows you to create your own ideal team based on purchases and exchanges of players on an auction system, and an online Seasons mode expanded in content. To avoid repeating ourselves and therefore dwell too much on topics already covered, for any further information on the subject, we invite you to read our review of the current generation version of the product, available at this address. Here we prefer to focus more on what are the new features introduced in the ~enhanced~ edition, which can largely be perceived only once you have taken the field. Immediately after starting a game, users find the usual feeling with the gameplay of the series, given that from a structural and command point of view the title is not very different, in principle, from the counterpart available for the current generation of consoles. It therefore takes a few games to be able to appreciate the sensitive changes made to playability, primarily those deriving from the technical specifications of the Ignite Engine, the engine used for the new platforms, and the real beating heart of the project. Thanks to its power, the developers were able to refine the gameplay a little, in particular by working on the movements of each player and on their artificial intelligence, renaming the two most important characteristics expressed in this sense with the names of Supreme Technique and Advanced Instincts. The first is a technology that offers different opportunities in the way a virtual athlete moves, receives and controls the ball, effectively opening up more options, especially during attack phases. Current versions of FIFA use a limited stock of core animations to represent a huge range of different actions, but in the next-generation version, there are no compromises, and there is a certain variety in every single gesture. The players, especially the more technically gifted ones, are thus able to tame the ball better and to protect it easily from the possible return of an opponent. This greater variety in control can also be found in the management of the contrasts between the players, who now provide for a greater number of variations to recover the ball or to taknock out an opponent, even by simply positioning himself in front of him without stretching his hands or arms, preventing him from reaching the ball with his body. In this way even the smallest contender, taking the position, can have his say. Similarly, thanks to the Advanced Instincts function, electronic players are able to quickly analyze the action in progress and try to predict possible developments, in order to act accordingly. In practice, every footballer thinks and acts, or should do so, in relation to what he perceives at the moment, deciding for himself whether to anticipate a movement to blow the ball away from the opponent or to avoid a particularly tough tackle, perhaps jumping in the run to escape a slip. This feature can actually also be glimpsed in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, but it works differently and is based on an assumption made by the artificial intelligence, rather than on a real awareness of the position and direction of all the players in the field. To be honest, it must be said that in practice things are a bit different on PlayStation 4 as well, in the sense that this feature has not always seemed as evident to us as we expected, and indeed in certain circumstances we had the distinct feeling that the athletes acted as always moved more by traditional behavioral routines rather than a sudden flash of genius. Data transfer Anyone who bought their PlayStation 4 with a copy of FIFA 14, but previously played the Electronic Arts title on PlayStation 3, can transfer much of their previously acquired data from one platform to another, so they don't have to start all over again. from the beginning. We talk about progress in the game, so the roster of the Ultimate Team, the rank achieved in the EA SPORTS Football Club, the Trophies and items unlocked, and so on. Differences of generations With this in mind, headers have also been revised, which no longer record those problems reported by many users on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 relating to a certain ease in scoring (or conceding) a goal after a well-made cross towards the center of the penalty area. Among other things, now you can also jump in four or five at the same time, and you have greater control over the trajectory and the force to be applied to the conclusion, with all the consequences of the case from a tactical point of view for those who attack or for those who have to defend . On the other hand, the general artificial intelligence, the one that manages schemes and team play, didn't seem different to us from the one adopted by EA in the ~minor~ versions of FIFA 14, with the various teams performing well according to the progress of the game. match, but who occasionally commit too many naiveties in the coverage phase or in some offensive insertion, both at group and individual level. And the momentum? We cannot say with certainty that it has completely disappeared, also because, despite the official denials by EA, it has always been there and has always annoyed crowds of fans in many editions of FIFA. We had the feeling, in a couple of circumstances, that it was somehow present in the form of a sort of ~slackness~ recorded by the athletes of our team during the finale of a couple of decisive races. But it didn't seem to be as invasive as in previous editions. Put simply, we haven't noticed teams like Sassuolo suddenly becoming as powerful and technical as Bayern Munich and Barcelona merged into one entity. However, the element that more than any other differentiates FIFA 14 for PlayStation 4 from that for the current generation consoles is the technical sector. As we had already had the opportunity to underline on the occasion of previous tests, the visual impact between the two versions is different, and the trait of the next gen edition is more defined and clean. Although there is obviously no real clear cut in aesthetic terms, once you get used to the 1080p resolution, you can't help but be dazzled by the perfection of the details, colors and lighting system of the video game, which are enhanced by the computing power of the new machine. This has allowed the developers to also increase the number of cameras in the stadiums, in order to offer more camera angles to a director who can therefore greatly vary the shots, making the story of the sporting event even closer to what millions of fans experience when they follow their favorite team on TV. It also made it possible to enhance those aspects that fans like so much, such as the expressiveness of the players' faces when they are replaced, whichthey inflect the emotional state of the athlete in relation to the progress of the match and his own character nature, or the reaction of the fans in the stands. The latter are reproduced in 3D and even if they do not differ in the variety of models, placed next to each other they form a nice overall picture, especially in the way they move according to the action going on on the pitch . For their part, the players have an excellent polygonal structure, are physically well proportioned and animated in a masterful way, thanks on the one hand to a further increase in their set of movements, on the other to a frame rate anchored to sixty frames per second. Finally, to make everything much more realistic and captivating to look at, there is also a more refined reproduction of the fabric of the game shirts, details such as the grass with lots of tufts that fly into the air when you kick or the rain that stagnates on the field, and much more. No significant change, however, as regards the sound component. The commentary is entrusted to the duo formed by Fabio Caressa and Beppe Bergomi, and therefore has the usual strengths and weaknesses of the other versions: much more dynamic and complete in terms of rhythm and words than the one present in FIFA 13, again it only has a handful of sentences introductory, longer and specific ones in relation to the match, on the capacity or characteristics of the facilities and on the history of the most titled clubs, but we are still light years away from the English one in terms of content. On the other hand, the atmosphere that reigns around the event is excellent, before, during and after the match, thanks to the presence of many personalized chants for each team, with a reactive cheering that intelligently accompanies the various phases of the match. There are the classic whistles against the referee or opponents after an uncalled foul or a hard tackle against the home favorites, the cheers of encouragement and the different songs that vary according to the moment of the match and the importance of a goal.", "date": "2013-11-28", "grade": "8.8"}
