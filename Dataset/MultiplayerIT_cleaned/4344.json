In short, it is useless to go around it: if you are looking for a game in which to slice up endless hordes of enemies, collect precious objects, upgrade your character and enjoy more than decent graphics, the only solution is to turn towards the Blizzard title. On PC the situation is not very different even if in the past years, especially in the period from the publication of Diablo II to today, many more than valid titles have appeared on digital stores, such as Torchlight and its sequel, for example, but above all like Titan Quest, a game produced by THQ and for many the only and true anti Diablo in history. In fact, the title developed by Ironlore really had all the credentials to remain in the Olympus of the genre, and the hundreds of hours we spent on it at the time of its release can only confirm the undisputed quality of the production. Today, almost twelve years old, the reborn THQ Nordic tries to cash in, proposing a remastered on Playstation 4 and Xbox One put back on track for the occasion, in the hope of catching some nostalgic people and showing the new generations what it was capable of. We then threw ourselves again to slaughter monsters in ancient Greece to emerge as heroes, but the gaze of Medusa left us petrified on the spot. The dear price of nostalgia Let's start from the first crucial point: the price. A few years ago, the Titan Quest Anniversary Edition was launched on Steam, a complete revision of the title that improved some old historical problems and was even given as a gift to all owners of the original game. It included the Immortal Throne expansion, fixed a few bugs here and there, and freshened up a 10 year old game anyway. In short, an operation to be rewarded, which showed a certain gratitude towards the fans on the part of the newborn label. Things change quickly and this year, not only does the price rise to thirty euros, but to try to make cash there is also a collector's edition containing a mini-reproduction of a Spartan helmet and an artbook at the modest cost of around 120 dollars. All right, you say, you can think of opening your wallet to finance a title that you are particularly fond of, but the production effort was so minimal as to completely leave out the latest Ragnarok expansion, thus finding yourself in the hands of done, an incomplete version of Titan Quest. The absurdity of the thing goes even further, given that in the PC edition, the expansion is instead included with an even discounted price of around 10 euros. Decision-making follies aside, therefore, buying this Titan Quest Remastered would represent more of an act of faith towards the brand, and although the market is poor in hack'n'slash, throwing yourself headlong into this purchase is not exactly the best choice. But ideologies aside? Bringing a hack'n'slash to consoles is not an easy task, let's face it. The controls must be adapted to the simple pad, the menu and interface must be completely revised and, more generally, the whole way of playing and managing the inventory must be cleaned up, often too tied to the single movement of the mouse. THQ Nordic therefore opts to follow the simpler path, creating retractable radial menus both for what concerns the launch of skills, always clearly visible in the lower part of the screen, and for what concerns the management of the menus, from the selection of the inventory when opening the map. However, the UI is well understandable and there are no major criticisms to be made towards the work done. The skills are launched easily and it is not complex to be able to chain different ones in series, simply by practicing a little with the rotation of the new ring. What remains inconvenient however is the management of the equipment of one's character, forced as we will be to move individually from one object to another wasting time unnecessarily. It is then impossible to move the objects in the backpack where we want, with a button to rearrange everything automatically which often does not work properly, stupidly reducing the already little space available to store the loot. The biggest problem, however, concerns the new management of movement controls and target targeting. Titan Quest, as a good self-respecting hack'n'slash, does not skimp on excited moments and furious enemies who hurl all their hatred at you, but the slowness in selecting the target and the lack of fluidity in the movements make the whole title extremely woody and tough to play. It often happens that you find yourself literally paralyzed ifwithout being able to do anything while trying to frame the desired monster among the thick opposing ranks, inevitably ending up taking too many blows without being able to do anything. A not insignificant problem if we consider that Titan Quest has always been a rather difficult game and where the difficulty curve tends to always remain very high, also due to a slow progression in growth - both in terms of level and in mere power - of the our character. We should have in our hands a game that flows smoothly without a moment's pause and instead this remaster fits and tangles itself, coming to offer an experience that is anything but exhilarating mitigated only by the online co-op mode up to six players. Playstation 4 trophies It's not too difficult to take home platinum on Titan Quest Remastered. To get it, simply play the entire campaign by completing all the secondary and main missions and then do two more runs in the additional difficulties, simply remembering to chop everything you meet on the way. Vent your anger towards the gods! Insufficient homework Then all those technical devices are missing to make a remaster valid and worthy. Although almost twelve years have passed since the launch and, inevitably, the design of some creatures and armor is ~old~, the style is still quite appreciable and the game overall manages to defend itself well. You certainly don't have to expect monsters with superfine polygonal modeling or excessively sophisticated animations, but for a game with all these years behind it, it must be said that it could have ended much worse. However, what has not been fixed in the slightest and which, on the contrary, is aggravated by the new management of the camera is the pathfinding of the enemies who often lose sight of the target, get stuck in the elements of the scenario or remain dazed helpless to be thrown at the most devastating spells. We defeated bosses simply by holding down a key without them responding just because we were out of their cone of vision, and we saw minions and creatures get stuck behind fences without figuring out how to get around them. To aggravate everything there are very heavy occasional slowdowns, senseless given the game engine so old and long loading that weaken an already not particularly exciting experience.", "date": "2018-03-16", "grade": "5.0"}
