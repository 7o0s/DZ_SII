Yet it has been able to conquer in a very short time an enviable group of enthusiasts, as well as a community of modders among the most active in videogame history. What made it and still makes it a special title? Basically it is just a fantasy world, however quite small in size, which reproduces 5 or more factions clearly inspired by as many medieval nations, in the midst of which the player is free to trade, rob, or seek glory by allying himself with a any of them in an act of vassalage. The truth is that the character was so anonymous and the world so vast that it could give a truly infinite amount of activities and situations: from villages occupied by bandits to personal quarrels between lords, plots to start wars, personal rivalries, friendships, exchanges of slaves and food, a virtually infinite pool of objects and an RPG-style character growth system. There was also the possibility of enlisting men and making them grow like the protagonist, complete with unique non-player characters to equip to your liking. Indeed, the strength of Mount & Blade has always been its incredible replayability and variety of situations. Modding what a passion For some, Mount & Blade: Warband represents more than a game, a basic platform on which to develop their own video game. In fact, the official forum is overflowing with changes for the game, ranging from additions of small details (however capable of radically changing the gaming experience) up to real total conversions that rewrite the setting from scratch, adding historical units, even taking it to another era (there are entire series of mods on the Napoleonic era, a stupendous total conversion dedicated to the far west and various ones on the European Middle Ages and Renaissance) or in a fantastic world (from D&D to Star Wars). Like its predecessor, Warband also ensures full support for modders and already now, a week after its release, you can find mini-mods to expand the possibilities offered by the basic product. It should also be noted that some ~historical~ or highly anticipated mods for the base game are already being converted to be made playable in Warband. King Charles returned from war Mount & Blade: Warband does not pretend to radically change its predecessor, nor to overturn it in the basics: indeed, the actual improvements or changes are almost non-existent. It will certainly not be a new Islamic-style faction (which in any case was missing in the original) or the possibility of marrying a lady that will change things, nor much less the greater attention to personal and political relationships with the various lords: in fact, they are all features that are already found in some mods. Again, the player starts out as a measly tier-one ~swordsman,~ whose only concession is a family banner if he's chosen to be descended from a fallen noble. A few crude weapons, battered armor and, hopefully, a limping horse complete our hero's inventory. The first steps are not easy at all: even a gang of 5 petty thieves can be ~fatal~ (the quotation marks are there because in Mount & Blade it is not possible to die physically, but only to be captured, lose consciousness, become impoverished and so on) . Moving on to the nearby village could be an idea: 3-4 peasants may want to follow us and become the first nucleus of troops, and even small bands of outlaws aren't a problem. After a while the village will get to know us, and here is the first escort mission to bring the harvest to the capital; there, perhaps, the burgomaster will have some other task. From the bounty hunter to the mercenary the step is short and in the meantime the army grows and, with it, also the abilities of our character (taken verbatim from the file of a Dungeons & Dragons style RPG for the record): finally we can afford a sword more decent! Hence the world: princesses to marry, kingdoms to found, to destroy, tournaments to win, rulers to support or defeat, friends, enemies, commoners to protect, fiefdoms to administer, riots to appease and so on and so forth : history is at our mercy, and it will be up to us to decide whether to remain anonymous, live it or write it. If longing for glory, thirst for honor, quenches the war on the victor The first thing that catches the eye in Mount & Blade: Warband is the graphics, which have been enriched by a series of textures of incredibly higher quality than the original, as well as very pleasant reflection effects of thesunlight on armor and refraction of objects/people in bodies of water. If it is true that in a video game the visual aspect represents, for those who really understand it, little more than a tinsel, the commitment made by the developers to revive the weakest point of their original product is equally admirable, without however going to modify the basic engine and thus create a series of disadvantages for players accustomed to a product that offers a lot in terms of playability while requiring very little in terms of hardware. The result is very close to that of a pleasant artisan work, as genuine in its simplicity as it is satisfying when tested in the field. A second aspect for which Warband is worth its expense are the fights: Mount & Blade had already made itself known for the simplicity and realism of the system, which worked on the movement of the mouse to decide which side to direct the attacks on (move right slash from right, up sword raised and so on) and on various bonuses/maluses in the use of shooting weapons (stationary, on horseback, in movement) which can be improved by increasing the level in RPG style. The combat is now enriched by a dimension: in fact, in addition to the direction in Warband you must also give the ~bow~ of the blow by simulating the movement of the hand with the mouse, making the clashes much more complex and real. If, for example, you are charged by a knight, you will have to move the mouse upwards and at the same time give a long bow to strike with a straight sword, if instead the target is an infantryman, here is the hand lower and the movement be shorter, on pain of seeing the blade sparkle above the enemy's head without doing him any damage. Marvelous. Knights who ignore fear in battle: multiplayer battles The most awaited feature of Warband, however, remains the multiplayer. Missing in the first episode, this time it has been implemented in a rather satisfactory way, presenting some modes and most importantly, stable servers capable of hosting up to 64 players at the same time, divided into archers, foot soldiers and knights (in turn with subclasses such as knight light and heavy, archer instead of crossbowman, swordsman rather than spearman) and engaged in pitched battles in the open field, in the conquest of castles and villages, or in furious free-for-all melees. Furthermore, if the goodness of a product is measured by the number of players, Warband has already passed all the exams: servers full day and night await adventurers from all over the world. Waiting for the already announced mod that will make the single game map playable in multiplayer (unfortunately it is something that is basically missing) the Warband multiplayer proves to be immediate, fun and well done, superior to several much more noble and fundamental destination productions for lovers of medieval duels.", "date": "2010-04-08", "grade": "8.5"}
