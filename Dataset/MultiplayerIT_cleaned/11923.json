{"name": "The Nightmare Before Christmas", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-nightmare-before-christmas.html", "text": "While counting on a single cinematic episode, The Nightmare Before Christmas with its plastic characters, filmed with the stop motion technique, has managed to conquer a place in the collective imagination. And, most importantly, to give life to a series of licensed products that have also ranged in the field of video games for some years now. Now the adventures of Jack Skellington also come to mobile thanks to the work of the Happy Fun Team on behalf of Disney Studios Mobile. Unlike the transpositions made for consoles, often focused on action, in this portable environment Tim Burton's feature film becomes nothing less than a puzzle game. The structure of the game is simple but does not disdain a certain depth. At the beginning we are given the possibility of selecting a game level belonging to the various locations, a level that we can only access if we have reached it in a previous game. Once in action, we have to control Jack on a ~blocky~ map, typical of puzzle games, and solve puzzles from time to time to allow him to first collect a certain number of presents and then the sack intended to contain them. At first the operation is extremely simple: just move the obstacles (pumpkins, for example) in the right way to guarantee the passage towards the gifts and finally towards the sack. As you progress through the levels, however, things get much more difficult: enemies of various types begin to appear, each of which must be faced in a certain way, as well as lethal traps that can capture Jack even from a distance. Eventually the obstacles, enemies and traps all become part of the game mechanism, and you have to find the right way to proceed with the collection of objects. When you realize that it is no longer possible to complete the stage, you can give up by pressing the asterisk key and possibly try again. The technical realization of this mobile reduction of The Nightmare Before Christmas is nothing more than functional to the action. In fact we are dealing with an old-concept mobile game, therefore with sprites equipped with the minimum indispensable animations, small in size, which move on maps designed only on the basis of the use we will make of them, without artistic or technical ambitions. The sound is basically composed of background music, nice and non-repetitive but an end in itself. As for the control system, we can move Jack using the joystick and shoot a bone with the FIRE button (or 5 on the numeric pad). The commands respond quickly to inputs, even if you have to think carefully about the movements to be made when speed is needed, given the ~blocky~ connotation of the map and, consequently, of the movements.
