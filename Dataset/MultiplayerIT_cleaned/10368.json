The series, made up of two official episodes and started with a bang on PlayStation 2, had in fact a sort of interlude represented by Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, a Game Boy Advance cartridge released in 2005. The events took place between Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II and it was later discovered that they were fundamental pieces of an increasingly complex narrative mosaic. The all in all simple plot of the first episode became in Kingdom Hearts II and in its prequel Chain of Memories really intricate and full of facets and enigmatic moments. While users await the announcement of a third chapter, Square Enix is delighting in offering spin-offs that act as a prequel to the entire story and Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days is just one of them. Life as a Nobody A feature that makes Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days extremely fascinating but also damn frustrating is its deep connection to the other episodes of the saga: some terms and references will remain completely obscure to the casual player who will find the plot truly incomprehensible. Those who know the series will probably be happy to know that this prequel finally sheds light on the mysterious Organization XIII, its purposes and the identity of its members. At the end of the game many questions are answered while new questions arise for which we will have to wait, fortunately however the role of Roxas, ~nobody~ of the protagonist of the series Sora and main character in this spin-off, is clarified. In fact, the plot revolves around his entry into Organization XIII and his friendship with the arrogant Axel: another enigmatic figure soon joins them, the fourteenth member of the Organization, Xion. What is most striking, however, is the characterization of the various members of Organization XIII, who abandon the mere role of extra villains in the previous games to show off even more intriguing personalities here, especially in the moments in which we will collaborate with them: the narrative development of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days is in fact staggered into dozens of missions, optional or mandatory, which we will have to select from the base of Organization XIII, a sort of main ~hub~, and conclude in the various Disney worlds that will be the backdrop to our adventures. Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days is the first episode of the series to offer a multiplayer mode: in fact, each completed mission can be re-faced together with up to three local players, each in possession of a Nintendo DS and relative cartridge. Each player can then select one of the members of Organization XIII and the challenges can be played in teams or one against all. The 3D engine slows down too much, the mechanics are extremely simple and the online is completely absent, but it is still a mode that adds a few hours of play to an already rather long-lived product. Fantasy without much fantasy Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Nightmare Before Christmas, Alice in Wonderland... Unfortunately, the Disney worlds we will explore are always the same ones that have already been seen, reviewed and reviewed in the other episodes of the series. Logically, developers Square Enix should be praised for how they managed to shrink the settings already seen on PlayStation 2 into a DS cartridge, yet there is an unpleasant feeling of dejavu. Even from the sound point of view, a real recycling has been carried out: the music is exactly the same as Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II, only qualitatively reduced to the Nintendo DS speakers. And here our criticisms end. If we exclude significant drops in frame rate in the most chaotic situations or during multiplayer sessions, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days undoubtedly remains one of the most sophisticated products available for Nintendo DS. From smooth animations to polygonal modeling, through the colorful locations to the variety of special effects, there is little to complain about and this portable edition is truly amazing. The cutscenes that narrate the salient moments of the story are fully dubbed in excellent English and even if the CG interludes are not quite perfectly compressed they are still very welcome. Perhaps a little sorry for the compromises, such as the need to break up the settings into various small ~rooms~ or the lack of variety of locations in which numerous missions take place. However, repetitiveness is reduced by an excellent gameplay which, as per tradition, remains predominantly action-oriented: the real-time battles are once again made up of stunts and combosnations of attacks and spells, even if there are some problems in using the latter, a bit cumbersome and slow in response. On the other hand, the possibility of customizing our style of play through a sort of panel in which to insert skills, spells and objects in the form of icons is decidedly remarkable: it is a bit like managing an inventory but the limit of usable ~slots~ requires planning shrewd, fundamental in undertaking the most difficult missions, in fact there are numerous extras that increase the longevity of the game even beyond the conclusion of the main-quest.", "date": "2009-11-23", "grade": "8.3"}
