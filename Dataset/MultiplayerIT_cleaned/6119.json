Running into a crowd of undead can in fact easily lead to game over, and at that point you have to deal with one of the peculiarities of the Ubisoft product: permanent death. Or perhaps it would be appropriate to say ~semi-permanent~, given that after the departure of our character we will lose all the improvements and objects contained in the survival backpack, but the latter will at least be possible to recover them in the next attempt, in the role of a new survived, going to the place of the crime and killing our predecessor, who in the meantime transformed into a zombie in turn. It is something that Zombi manages to do very well, we said, despite the fact that three years have now passed since the original publication on Wii U, with a view to an exclusive sanctioned by that iron pact between the French house and Nintendo which however did not fail to crumble like snow in the sun as the first sales figures arrive, when it became clear that there was no commercial space for titles like this on the Mario and Zelda console. However, Ubisoft Montpellier's work had to be preserved, even if it were for the very valid ideas put on the table; and so, as soon as it was possible from a contractual point of view, the publisher entrusted Straight Right with the task of carrying out a conversion of the game for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Zombies still manages to deliver a charming and solid survival experience, despite its shortcomings Back to London The setting of Zombies is undoubtedly one of the strengths of the game. In fact, we find ourselves in a gloomier and darker London than usual, set on fire by a mysterious virus that has transformed almost all the inhabitants into living dead hungry for flesh. The protagonist of the adventure is an anonymous survivor who is lured into the subway tunnels by the voice of a person who somehow controls the speakers and cameras of the city, Prepper, and who seems to know a lot about the infection and what needs to be done to stem it. Or at least this will be our hope with each new attempt given that, as mentioned, the character we control can die relatively easily and is replaced from time to time by another subject, whose connotations are generated randomly. It goes without saying that the gameplay of Zombies distances itself from similar productions, primarily Dead Island and Dying Light, focusing on looting and survival rather than combat, also rendered in this new edition in a less than brilliant way: although they are two new weapons have been added for hand-to-hand combat, the shovel and the spiked bat (which therefore complement the cricket bat), the mechanics that regulate the attacks are basic and repetitive, leaving a lot of room for uncertainty and very little for satisfaction to smash the head of a living dead who wants to taste us. Firearms, which are also present within the scenario, are to be used sparingly due to the shortage of ammunition, but they do not constitute the powerfully effective tool one might imagine. The experience therefore remains bound to a cautious and reasoned approach, which rightly emphasizes in particular the inevitable jumps from the chair and the most agitated situations, very well placed in the perspective of a campaign that can last about fifteen hours, depending on the number of dead and the attempts we make. However, the progression is rather linear, with missions in which we will be asked to recover certain objects or activate devices, using a series of ~shortcuts~ to reach places of interest more quickly. Xbox One goals There are twenty unlockable achievements in Zombies, for a total of 1000 Gamerpoints, so these are quite generous prizes. Many of them are obtained simply by performing certain actions for the first time or by accessing specific places, but there is no shortage of objectives based on the number of kills and on completing the campaign, both in standard and Survival modes. Discover the differences When Ubisoft announced the release of Zombies, there was great curiosity about how the developers would change the interface to make up for the lack of the GamePad. The Wii U version of the game in fact boasted an intelligent and imaginative use of the controller with integrated touch screen, which served as a transceiver for Prepper's indications, as an environmental analysis device (really pointing it at the screen to mark specific points of interest or carry out hacking doors and cameras), as a tool for implementationaction of some small minigames and for quick inventory management. That kind of immediacy has been irretrievably lost on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but in the end the alternatives put in place are functional and do not create particular balancing problems: the minigames take place simply by quickly pressing the controller buttons or rotating slowly the analog sticks (see the lock pick), while the viewer functionality is activated by pressing the left back button. To suffer the most is the inventory, now of the traditional type and certainly less agile to consult and modify. Remaining on the practical elements, a new function has been added to the flashlight, which by holding down the right analog stick on its axis can project a more intense light and therefore make our life easier when we are in particularly dark areas, at the price obviously of a greater consumption of the batteries; while multiplayer in all its forms has been eliminated, therefore both the local one (in any case a side element and little more) and the asynchronous one, and it is a pity because finding one's friends transformed into zombies around London represented a nice idea. On the technical sector front, however, the excellent dubbing in Italian remains (with an Ivo De Palma irreproachable as usual) and a well-conceived sound design for the purposes of atmosphere and tension, although it is often difficult to understand how many zombies have to deal with (attacks from behind are the order of the day). What disappoints is the graphics, which have been substantially improved in terms of textures (you no longer come across illegible writing or giant pixels, as happened on the Wii U), the frame rate (now more stable, although within limits of 30 frames per second) and the lighting system, but it started from a not exactly exciting base, which already highlighted problems in 2012 in terms of polygonal modeling, environmental interactivity and the presence of numerous interpenetrations and glitches. The fact that these latter aspects are still part of the experience today undoubtedly represents a note of serious demerit for those who have taken care of the conversion.", "date": "2015-08-19", "grade": "7.3"}
