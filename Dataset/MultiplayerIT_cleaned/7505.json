Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Although the international critics are taking it very lightly, Knack is likely to prove to be a solid and fun action game for PlayStation 4, similar in some ways to the latest Crash of the Titans, with some interesting ideas that intertwine with the peculiar abilities of the protagonist . He, Knack, is in fact a being created by a scientist using the power of ancient relics, and is capable of recalling others if necessary to increase its size until it becomes enormous, thus adapting to the situations that can arise when fighting to free the world from the orc invasion. To promote the release of the game, which will be part of the launch line-up of the new console, Sony has seen fit to publish a free companion app entitled Knack's Quest on the App Store (and soon on Google Play, in all probability) looks like a traditional match-3 style puzzle game in which we have to move elements on a board to put together and eliminate those of the same type. In the background there is just Knack and our goal is to feed his powers, collecting the components necessary to allow the transformation at three levels (medium, large, huge) and paying attention to the bar located at the bottom of the screen , which tends to decrease as the seconds pass when we hesitate to match the pieces. The interesting thing is that by completing the single player campaign, made up of six chapters each divided into three stages and based on what we will see on PlayStation 4, you not only unlock an infinite mode but also a series of extra objects obtainable on consoles, also if for the moment it is not clear through which procedure (a QR code?). Knack's Quest is a simple and fun match-3 style puzzle game, but a bit too limited Impossible feat? We approach Knack's Quest rather warily, and the reason is obvious: the match-3 puzzle game genre is incredibly inflated and on the App Store there are dozens, if not hundreds, of products similar to this one, some of great success. The first impact with the graphics is not the best, given that the rendering of the board and the various elements does not stand out for the style used, however it takes a few minutes to understand the elements of interest that SCE Japan Studio wanted to include in this companion app . The thematic organization of the levels, with materials such as wood, metal and others contributing differently to the piece count for the completion of each stage of the transformation (shown on screen using the same polygonal models as the PlayStation 4 game), they are all elements that combine to diversify the action compared to the many products of the same genre, together with the vital energy bar and the indicators for the execution of special moves. The latter are filled by eliminating solar stones and can take on two different forms: a first stage in which we can emit a lightning that destroys materials placed in adjacent boxes; a second stage where you can clear all items of the same type on the board. The touch controls are reactive and the pace is fast, only that the challenge begins to make itself felt only towards the end of the campaign and at that point it is too late to focus on the duration: Knack's Quest is finished quickly, then leaving only the ~infinite mode~ the task of continuing to entertain us. We hope that the developers will release more levels over time, but for the moment the picture is that of a nice and competent puzzle game, but too short to worry the competition.", "date": "2013-11-09", "grade": "6.0"}
