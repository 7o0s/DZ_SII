We drank together, played songs, spent evenings looking at beautiful landscapes and faced a thousand difficulties. Sea of Thieves brought us together like few other games, made us live a real pirate life and immersed us in a world that made us fall in love from the first minute. Rare is back, and after years of absence in video game development, it gives us a title to play in the company of our closest friends. After introducing you to the basic mechanics and talking about our first few hours on the final version, we have finally accumulated enough game time to give a verdict on the new pirate experience exclusively for Microsoft platforms. We are facing one of the most ambitious titles ever, but with a very big problem that often unites experiences of this type: the contents. Leaving aside this last point, which we will discuss in the dedicated paragraph, it is time to analyze in detail what is causing so much talk among enthusiasts and onlookers. Towards Hostile Seas Upon first launch, we are greeted by a nice introductory video that briefly illustrates the game universe, anticipating what awaits us. The three main factions are then mentioned. It starts with the gold hunters, which offer the classic experience in which the player, armed with a shovel and real treasure maps, will have to venture to specific islands to solve riddles and unearth chests. We then move on to the order of souls, a faction particularly suited to the more combative player, which offers challenges in which we will face undead captains and hordes of skeletons that gradually get stronger as we level up. It finally ends with the alliance of the merchant, a faction that proposes to work as couriers, collecting animals and precious resources around the various islands. Unlike the other factions, the latter is the only one not tied to a particular island, we will be free to explore and go where our instinct takes us with the hope of finding the requests of our quest and then deliver them within a specific date in a specific outpost. At the end of the introductory movie, the ultimate goal of any Sea of Thieves player is mentioned: to become a pirate legend, a probable end-game dynamic that should unlock once you reach level 50 in all three of the aforementioned factions. The total absence of any type of narration was justified by the Rare team with the extreme desire to let the players themselves tell their own story. Every adventure we've played has actually been different. Every game in the company of a different crew has always left us something new. There is therefore no doubt the main focus on cooperation between players, finding a crew of friends and embarking into the unknown is the best way ever to enjoy the title. Solitary players are not abandoned who will be able to choose a sloop that is much easier to steer given its small size. The navigation experience is in fact totally simulative, a galleon can be managed by 3 to 4 players and each crew member will have to perform a different function throughout the journey in order to be able to maneuver the ship correctly. Keeping constant communication between all your crew is therefore essential: the helmsman has no visibility on the sea, making it necessary for a crew member to constantly check the global map and communicate the appropriate course corrections together with any obstacles. As if that weren't enough the wind will change constantly making it necessary to angle the sails and, finally, the anchor is very heavy to lift and at least 2 or 3 crew members will be needed to pull it in good time. The sloop, as already mentioned, is designed to be steered solo, with the global map easily accessible, a very light anchor and sails that don't get in the way of the helmsman. However, it is most effective with a small crew of two players, making the small ship a vessel to be reckoned with due to its excellent maneuvering capabilities. The only thing to keep in mind is its firepower, which is nothing compared to the much more powerful galleon. Xbox One goals Sea of Thieves challenges us with 60 objectives for a total of 1000G. Some are simple and unlockable by doing the most trivial game actions, others are linked to particular easter eggs or will require you to interact with enemy crews. The rarest, celebrate the achievement of the most difficult goals within the game.The Routine and the Contents Beginning to touch on a sensitive topic, that of contents, we reconnect with what was previously said in our test, confirming the decision to define them as only sufficiently varied. Playing we will immerse ourselves in a real routine: we choose the journey we want to take, we get new objectives, we set sail, we find the destination on the global map, we complete the mission and we return to the outpost to collect the rewards. Each coin earned will yield experience for a given faction and every 5 levels the duration and difficulty of each journey will gradually increase. There are some exclusive rewards and specific items that can only be acquired by leveling up, but the fact remains that between the start of the game and level 50, not much else changes. The various missions will still lead us to dig holes, capture animals or fight skeletons which, although the development team has tried to build different variants with alternative dynamics, inevitably give the feeling of always fighting the same thing in the same way . To vary the gaming experience we find only the other players, the kraken and the skeleton forts. The latter are real global events, signaled by the appearance of a skull-shaped cloud with illuminated eyes. The signal is visible to all players on the server regardless of their position, this will call them to meet at a specific point on the map and collide in order to be able to complete the event. Having reached a fort for the first time, the players will be greeted by cannon shots fired by the skeletons who defend it and, if we manage to survive this first attack, we will not easily be granted a minute of peace since the other ships they will certainly want to share its treasures. With enough waves of skeletons destroyed, in all their variations, the fort captain will appear and, if defeated, will drop a key to open the reward room. If it takes at least an hour undisturbed to be able to complete a fort, loading all the treasures on the ship will make the players lose a good handful of minutes, thus forcing us to evaluate the risks and possibly escape with the most precious treasures. Moving on instead to talk about the kraken, the monster is also a random event, which traps the unfortunate boats between its tentacles forcing the crews to fight for their lives. During this event the kraken will capture players or wrap parts of the ship. To be able to escape alive, it will be enough to be armed to the teeth and persevere with cannonballs and lead until he lets us go. With a little disappointment, we learn that the notorious creature is not linked to any element of the game and does not guarantee any reward, thus confirming itself as a random obstacle to our journey. Closing the discussion on the contents, it seems necessary to underline how absurdly long and tedious is the path to get to the finish line of ~Legend of the Pirates~, so much so that the quantity of hours required, not being justified in any way, will surely make the most players. All gold earned can be spent on cosmetic items only, which include weapons, clothes, various equipment and customization of your ship. Many elements are unlocked only at higher levels, a likely choice to allow distinction in terms of gaming experience. The excellent catalog of cosmetic decorations, however, is marked by frighteningly high prices and several hours of grinding will be required to obtain a simple sail for your ship. And this is precisely the current gaming experience offered by Sea of Thieves, an incessant grinding to be able to achieve our goals. In a situation like this, where we get into a constant routine throughout the game, it's extremely difficult for us to think that if the new content doesn't arrive in time, the population won't start to drop drastically. As we continue to spend our time navigating the seas of Rare's title, we realize that there is so much room for improvement and we are extremely curious to find out what kind of game we will find ourselves in our hands in about a year. A starting point On balance and passing over the problems related to grinding, we have in our hands one of the best titles to play in the company of our friends. The concept so dear to Rare of ~pirates who create stories~ is in effect a dynamic that we have had the pleasure of experiencing firsthand. Every ship we have set foot on has given us qualsomething special, every adventure or difficulty was always faced with a different approach and every end of the evening left us with a smile. Sea of Thieves reminds us that, in reality, progression is not everything and sometimes that pinch of fantasy or complicity is enough to be able to give hours of genuine fun. There isn't a scenario that isn't beautiful to look at (the technical component is of the highest level regardless of the chosen platform) and we add a colorful artistic style and a particularly refined sound to everything. With this solid foundation, the development team now has a serious responsibility to continue evolving its sandbox, and we can only hope that this is done while avoiding downtime as much as possible. A stagnant situation with no new elements or reasons to return and the total absence of a road map with future updates provides little incentive to venture. The very first months of life will therefore be crucial to keep the user active and try not to lose the interest of many players. To be honest, given how little it has changed over the years, the fact that it is sold at full price may not be a point in its favor. It is worth emphasizing once again the possibility of a 14-day free trial thanks to the Xbox Game Pass program which is supported on both consoles and PC. A possible monthly subscription for 10 is however an excellent choice to evaluate the future purchase in case you are not completely sure if the experience offered can actually align with our tastes. In closing, beyond the launch situation, giving Sea of Thieves a chance literally costs nothing and setting sail in its seas for the first time is an experience you must try.", "date": "2018-03-27", "grade": "7.6"}
