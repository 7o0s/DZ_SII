{"name": "Tekken: Dark Resurrection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tekken-dark-resurrection-3.html", "text": "Total control The game, for those who have had the opportunity to try Tekken 5 or the previous chapters of the series, brings practically nothing new in terms of mechanics; veterans will therefore immediately find the feeling with the characters, here all unlocked from the start. Dark Resurrection is in fact actually Tekken 5.2, therefore an evolution / correction of the previous one with new wrestlers, some modified moves and a better balance of the whole. A product therefore that is based on rock-solid and extremely refined gameplay, but which unfortunately finds a limit in the poor precision of the PSP directional cross especially as regards the execution of the diagonals, essential for being able to complete the combos more complex. This is a defect with a specific weight that varies according to the player and his willingness to deepen his mastery with the advanced moves, but which in any case represents a real limit. As always, however, the amount of extras available is excellent, starting with the multiplayer mode which unfortunately does not allow you to organize online challenges, the latter factor which would have made TDR a real killer-app. In fact, to fight with a human opponent, one must be satisfied with the ad-hoc connection; nevertheless, the programmers have managed to introduce a variant called ~ghost~ which can still represent a credible alternative to online multiplayer. In practice, the ghost is a character created on the basis of the player's actions and fighting style, which is then recorded and inserted as if to create a sort of personalized artificial intelligence. The ghosts can then be placed on the network at the disposal of other players, and obviously in the same way it is possible to download those of other users to test their skills against something more stimulating than the CPU. Obviously, the possibility of customizing the look of one's fighters by purchasing accessories and clothes from the shop has not been excluded. In addition to the various classic modes such as arcade, story and practice modes, there are also variations and minigames such as Tekken Bowling, Gold Rush and the Dojo Mode. We beat the PSP The ancient diatribe regarding the technical potential of the PSP, which has already been addressed several times, finds with TDR a further confirmation in favor of the incredible capabilities of the console. The Namco production can in fact be placed in direct comparison with the aforementioned edition for Ps2, finally coming out with its head held high, to say the least. The glance is excellent, and the characters maintain a complexity in the polygonal models and - above all - an absolutely excellent fidelity of the animations. A careful eye will be able to identify some slightly simplified structures, a handful of fewer polygons and textures in some cases not particularly defined; however, it is a much more than satisfactory adaptation, and which as usual finds a further positive element in the screen of the Sony laptop. Fluidity is absolutely guaranteed during fights, thus offering an almost intact experience; some slowdown occurs instead in the opening and closing sequences of the matches, however always well within the limits of the acceptable. Overall therefore, as far as the graphics are concerned, TDR is in all probability the best game available for the PSP, as well as an authentic example of the value of the handheld. And all this without running into one of the ~historic~ defects of the Sony console, or the much hated uploads; the pauses between one meeting and another are in fact really reduced to a handful of seconds, which do not weigh at all and indeed flow away almost without us noticing it. The sound is also very good, full of a large number of musical tracks and well-crafted effects. Comment Tekken: Dark Resurrection, analyzed solely as a PSP game, is an excellent product in practically every respect. Technically superb, it rests on a well-tested and perfected mechanism that undoubtedly makes it the best exponent of the series. Observing the situation in the round, however, it should be kept in mind that a PSP owner who also has a Ps2 at home, a situation that is far from remote, can get Tekken 5 for less than half the price, which differs from Dark Resurrection in a few respects and which can count on a superior graphics system and a controller that is certainly better than the barely sufficient directional pad of the Sony laptop. The purchase is therefore unreservedly recommended to lovers of the series and to those who necessarily want to play Tekken with the freedom offered by a portable console; others make their own assessments carefully. Pro Technically great Best Tekken available Gralongevity and a good dose of extras Cons Different in a few respects from Tekken 5 D-pad unsuitable Lack of online multiplayer Tekken 5 for Ps2, released a few months ago also in Europe, easily managed to establish itself as the undisputed peak of the popular Namco series, as well as one of the best 3D fighting games in history. Strengthened by these encouraging premises, the Japanese softco has therefore decided to bring this fifth chapter, revised and corrected, also to the PSP, to finally give the world of portable consoles an exponent of the genre worthy of the name. The result of this effort has taken the name of Tekken: Dark Resurrection, a game destined to enter the select club of the best products available for the Sony laptop.", "date": "2006-10-06", "grade": null}
