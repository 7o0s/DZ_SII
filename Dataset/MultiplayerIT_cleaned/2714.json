{"name": "Myst", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/myst-recensione-realta-virtuale.html", "text": "Myst's review for Oculus Quest brings us back to a video game milestone, a title that belongs to an era in which graphics were limited but for this very reason it enhanced the spectacle offered by titles designed to get around hardware limits by exploiting pre-calculated graphics and 360-degree interactive images. Thus freedom of movement was limited, in any case secondary in a title all about puzzles and atmosphere, in exchange for the audiovisual show, among the reasons for the continued success of the Cyan title. However, we have already seen the transition to real-time 3D with RealMyst and today we are facing another transformation, with virtual reality allowing you to experience Myst as a protagonist by interacting with the puzzles firsthand, bringing to fruition the vision of the developers who wanted to catapult us into a parallel world. Myst is reborn under the sign of virtual reality The new incarnation of Myst does not focus on detail or on the refresh of the graphics but on the possibility of interacting directly with the puzzles and on exploring, looking for clues, the nineteenth-century science fiction island that serves as the perfect setting for the title Cyan. But before talking about the game, it is good to anticipate that at the moment the Oculus Quest version of Myst suffers from a rather important limitation. The problem concerns the importance in the puzzles of taking notes that highlight a remarkable ingenuity for a title that is played with a visor on the head. In fact, there is no way to write notes without having to take off the Oculus and if it is not a problem at the desk, it is with a viewer on the head that must be removed to transcribe notes and numbers, avoiding immersion in the island of Myst. Fortunately it seems that the developers are working to implement a virtual notebook within the game, but in the absence of official confirmations and dates for the update we have to take into account a not insignificant naivety for a VR title. In any case, there are ways to reduce the discomfort. There are those who have attached the notebook to their belt, and peek through the slit around the nose, and there are those who take advantage of the screenshot function of the Quest viewers, in some cases useful as for the fundamental enigma of the library. But among the possibilities there is also that of waiting for the promised update, hoping that it will arrive, in order not to compromise a cult experience that still works fairly well, despite the years that have passed. To the bone, the Oculus Quest version of Myst is completely faithful to the original title, a complex puzzle made up of a large number of puzzles scattered around an island full of clues to find and interpret to unravel a complex family story. Initially the experience is unsettling, but once you find the first piece of paper things become more and more understandable, albeit rarely simple also due to a typical setting of period adventures. In fact, it is not always easy to understand when our actions have actually had an effect, unless we explore the same environments several times each time we perform an action. Backtracking, however, is part of the overall balance of an old-fashioned experience that relies on certain mechanics to maintain high challenge and longevity. On the other hand, the world in three dimensions reveals to us how much that island that once seemed huge to us is actually quite small. Hence the paradox of a title that improves from an exploration point of view but is somehow reduced in three dimensions. The island, however, is transformed through the ages, steps that lead us towards an ending which, as is immediately clear, is destined to change based on the choice we make. Something that those who have already played Myst and have a good memory know well. But there is a mode with random puzzles that actually changes some dynamics and is reserved for the most expert of the game who remember all too well all the time spent trying, trying again and looking for information in a period in which the web was still limited both by number of information and accessibility. Technical considerations In any case, the experience, decidedly fluid on the Oculus Quest 2, is the one we know and offers an avalanche of mechanisms to activate, feed, rotate and curse after long attempts. In all of this, virtual reality allows us to interact directly with knobs, handles, buttons, books and other objects, some of which, among other things, are completely irrelevant for the purposes of the tests we have to support. But it is a matter of little stuff which among other things does not help to make a world devoid of effects and poor in details less bare. The glance over the distance isn't bad, but virtual reality allows you to get closerthe nose to the objects highlighting faded textures, non-existent grass and an overall detail lower than that of RealMyst, undoubtedly within the reach of the hardware of both Quest viewers. Among other things Myst is written and spoken exclusively in English, which in the face of a title all clues and narration makes a discreet knowledge of the British idiom almost necessary. The dubbing, however, is good, like the sound sector made up of credible samplings and disturbing ambient music. The recordings left by characters in computer graphics that replace the old flesh-and-blood actors of the 1993 Myst are far from exciting, but are somehow more consistent with the graphics of the game and are made more digestible thanks to the suggestions of virtual reality. In any case, if vintage language and breath are not a problem, the experience works thanks to the splendid puzzles that fit into a difficult even if potentially frustrating experience if approached without method. By arming yourself with patience, and accepting compromises such as the impossibility of taking notes unless you peek through the viewer, what emerges is instead the satisfaction of solving a great mystery that still retains all its original charm. Indeed, it is even better thanks to virtual reality which increases a delicious feeling of bewilderment, the fulcrum of a transposition that is undoubtedly spot on despite ingenuity and problems. The main flaws, which can be circumvented with a little attention but still cloying, concern the collisions of imperfect hands, an irritating thing when instead of pressing a key, another is pressed, sending a puzzle to hell, and movement via teleportation, rather badly thought out . By choosing this type of movement we are in fact forced to go through pre-established paths, as opposed to free movement which, however, causes a bit of annoyance going up and down the numerous stairs. Woe also, if you suffer from motion sickness, to take advantage of running which dramatically increases the alienating sensation. But there is no shortage of options to calibrate the experience as well as the possibility of switching on the fly from walking in real time to teleportation mode without having to access the menu.", "date": "2021-01-11", "grade": "S.V."}
