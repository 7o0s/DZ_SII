{"name": "Secondo attacco", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/130871-call-of-duty-ghosts-devastation-secondo-attacco.html", "text": "The script is the usual one for the new Call of Duty: Ghosts DLC, with the bombastic name Devastation. Four maps for the multiplayer sector, a new setting and new aliens for the popular cooperative mode Extinction, a dual-use weapon and even the beloved Predator to play in battle. In short, nothing new under the sun, just as the price of 14.99 is certainly not new. So let's try to understand if an outlay that is not exactly painless also corresponds to interesting contents of a certain thickness. But let's go in order and start our examination of the package from what we liked the least, or half of the new multiplayer maps. The Devastion DLC for Call of Duty: Ghosts is certainly not an unforgettable pack Ruins and alien hunters Behemoth is set on what appears to be a huge mining platform, ideally divided into three parts, with an obligatory ~hot zone~ in the middle, thanks to which sniping, ambushes and close combat can coexist peacefully, even if the narrow spaces and corridors they dominate. This is a decidedly standard map, rather ~average~ in its construction and which does not give any added value to the typical playability of the series. We also didn't like the prize for completing the field order very much, since you fly aboard a helicopter that placidly flies over the structure armed with a very powerful minigun with rotating barrels. Chopper Gunner, in practice: definitely ~overpowered~ for the layout of the map. Unearthed is not a ~wrong~ map but, being a full-fledged remake of the old Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Dome, it's not really something to tear your clothes off. A not huge map, good for all types of players, with a nice raised spot (and not only) for snipers and underground bunkers, ~interactive~ objects and a field order that summons aliens from outer space. It has the defect of not being particularly exciting, but it certainly works, even if it doesn't particularly shine in anything. Collision and Ruins are undoubtedly the two best maps in Devastation. Ruins takes us in the middle of the ruins in the jungle, and where there is the jungle, there must be the Predator, field order permitting of course. Our favorite alien hunter keeps all his iconic weapons and abilities including, such as heat vision, invisibility, cannon and of course the nuclear bomb. If you are looking for a lot of caciarone fun you are welcome, if you are looking for a painstaking balance then the Predator is not for you. Not bad, because it's still a lot of fun to use it. And the map? The best of the package, well designed on several levels - not flat, therefore - and also rather articulated and ~complicated~, therefore perfect for objective game modes. Without obviously forgetting the volcano which with its lava and its fireballs is capable of turning the tables on the table. Collision instead takes us aboard a container ship that ran aground on a bridge. A beautiful map, with a twisty design full of crates and containers breaking lines of fire on the bridge and of course also here on multiple levels, inside and out. Without a doubt then the visually more exuberant map, very large, full of secondary passages, defilations and more generally the richest one in terms of design and screen structures. It goes without saying that so much variety benefits the way in which to approach it, provided of course that you know it inside out. Ultimately, the multiplayer component of the DLC didn't fully convince us, which we certainly can't say for Mayday, the new Extinction setting, which once again proves to be the best part of the package. We are still aboard a ship, in addition to the usual aliens this time we will have to face a gigantic Kraken as the final boss. We start from the bottom, destroying nests from bridge to bridge, while with the drill we can also open doors behind which bonuses and weapon projects are hidden. Several new enemies block our way, and like good aliens acid will be their main weapon. The Ripper is the latest addition to the DLC, a dual purpose weapon; just change the barrel with a button and from a compact machine gun it becomes an assault rifle, therefore perfect at medium and long ranges. It goes without saying that it is a weapon made especially for all those who want to feel too powerful on the battlefield, even at the cost of not being able to insert all the usual range of optics. This time we don't feel like recommending the Devastation pack. Quality fluctuates across the multiplayer maps - or rather, only a couple go beyond the mere dumb homework - while Extinction's new Mayday chapterwe really liked it, but on its own, die-hard fans aside, it doesn't have the strength to justify the usual not-so-popular price.", "date": "2014-04-18", "grade": null}
