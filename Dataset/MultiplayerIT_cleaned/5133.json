{"name": "Piccola grande Lara", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/177511-lara-croft-go-piccola-grande-lara.html", "text": "Around Square Enix Montreal they must be quite proud of the GO series born and developed over the last two years on the mobile market, so much so that they consider it a shame to see it confined to a territory - albeit extremely vast - such as that of gaming on smartphones and Tablet. Animated by this spirit, the Canadian development team therefore began in order in February of this year, making the progenitor Hitman GO the protagonist of a Definitive Edition that is undoubtedly appreciable but not very balanced in the relationship between price and content. Now this conversion project continues with the award-winning Lara Croft GO, certainly the most successful exponent of the series who finds herself with the arduous task of satisfying the expectations of the demanding palates of PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita users: so let's find out if Square Enix has adopted the same questionable approach of the previous work or if this new version of the title really has the proverbial extra gear. Lara Croft GO remains a great puzzle game but with a price that is difficult to justify Tomb Puzzler Released in August last year on iOS, Android and Widows Phone, Lara Croft GO managed to establish itself as one of the best mobile titles of the year by showcasing an absolute level design, as we were able to underline in our review of the version for iPhones. The game in this transposition has obviously remained the same, but with some differences that should be emphasized, starting with a control system that on PlayStation 4 abandons its original touch nature to rely on the controller. The transition, it must be said, was not entirely painless, and although Lara Croft GO is played more than discreetly through the Dual Shock 4, some aspects make the tactile commands a little regret. The protagonist archaeologist moves from one node to another using the left stick, while the right one is used to move a viewfinder on the screen necessary to identify the vases containing the precious stones that make up the collectibles of the adventure. A solution that obviously appears a bit cumbersome, as well as the need to hold down a key and act on the left stick to move or throw objects. For a less successful feature there is an exclusive one destined to please the owners of both Sony entertainment devices, since the application supports cross-buy and cross-save, allowing the user to buy the game on PlayStation 4 and also play it on PlayStation Vita or vice versa. As for Hitman GO, on the other hand, the decision of the developers not to place limits on the use of suggestions to complete the levels raises some concerns, an aspect potentially capable of greatly eroding the longevity of the adventure. Playstation 4 trophies Lara Croft GO presents a rather limited list of trophies, but of a decidedly valuable value: we are talking about 18 units of which only three are bronze, five silver, nine gold and one platinum. A nice loot for the most passionate collectors, even more so considering that getting them all doesn't require much effort, given that a good number is unlocked with natural progression in the game and the rest require you to collect collectibles or perform specific actions. Mirror of my desires In terms of content, this version of Lara Croft GO includes all the stages present in the original mobile version, including the extra chapter The Cave of Fire which was distributed later via update. It is a truly rich package intended to provide the proverbial bread for the teeth of puzzle enthusiasts, considering how the various levels are technically short but very dense, requiring a considerable logical effort to be solved especially in the more advanced stages. In this sense, the protagonist schemes of Lo Specchio degli Spiriti deserve a separate mention, the new campaign created ad hoc for this porting by the KO_OP team: an adventure in which Lara is sucked into an alternative dimension by a mysterious relic, and which condenses inside all the most interesting elements of the other chapters with the addition of a couple of particularly elaborate new features. The first is represented by beams of light that activate certain mechanisms (whether these doors, traps or mobile platforms) whenever they are interrupted by the passage of an external body, whether it is that of Lara, an enemy or even an inanimate object . The second instead sees the entry into the field of a double of the protagonist who moves in a way that mirrors her on the paths adjacent to the main floor but with a different conformation: an aspect that addsadds a further nuance of difficulty to an already very demanding set of levels which is in fact the flagship of this new version. It's just a pity that the price to pay to enjoy all this (and a couple of frankly negligible new costumes) appears exaggerated again: repeating the vice of Hitman GO: Definitive Edition, Square Enix has decided to apply a price tag that is almost doubled compared to the 'original mobile release, a decision that finds no justification in the very valid new campaign even in the face of a conversion work that certainly cannot be defined mammoth. Technically indistinguishable from its counterpart for smartphones and tablets, Lara Croft GO in this incarnation for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita is anything but spectacular, even staining itself with a few shots here and there that denote a rather approximate code cleaning. In short, not really a hair-tearing port, and considering the fact that at the time of writing on Google Play the application is available for download for 0.99, such a commercial choice cannot fail to have a certain weight on our final evaluation.", "date": "2016-12-12", "grade": "7.5"}
