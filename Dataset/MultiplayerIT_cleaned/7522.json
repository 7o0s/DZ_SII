Equipped with a barely mentioned plot, the game takes us to the planet Graia (yes, the same as Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine) to face a campaign divided into three chapters, in turn composed of various levels, in which our objective will simply be to eliminate all the creatures of Chaos who will try to stop our inquisitive fury. So what was it like to don the heavy armor of a Space Marine again and fight for the glory of the Emperor in a world of giant pixels and faux-true 3D? We reveal it to you in the Warhammer 40.00: Boltgun review. Gameplay: Like DOOM, but longer Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, a firefight with the Boltgun If you are a gamer of the old guard and have lived through the era of the first first person shooters, it will take you just a few moments to get the hang of the gameplay of Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, which as mentioned is a passionate tribute to the great classics such; in the first place DOOM, with a series of quotes that are impossible to ignore. Obviously in this case the 3D is real, you move and shoot along three dimensions and this is reflected in the game mechanics, which from this point of view does not differ a lot from what we've seen in recent years. However, don't expect a very fast run & gun approach, since we will have to submit to the relatively tight tolerances of the eight weapons that we will be able to unlock during the campaign, and which are added to the chain sword with which our character is already equipped. The arsenal obviously includes a light and powerful Boltgun (with the possibility of equipping different ammunition), but also a devastating shotgun, a heavy machine gun that does not require reloads, an energy cannon with area damage, an assault, a grenade launcher, a gravity cannon and a plasma rifle, as well as three different throwing grenades that can make the difference against the toughest enemies.The latter obviously draw on the vast bestiary of the Warhammer 40,000 universe and boast attack characteristics and movement, which we will be able to memorize so that we can implement the necessary actions to avoid their blows and respond in kind, whether they are monsters, cultists, Chaos Space Marines or big, bad and powerful bosses. In combination with the different guns and a shrewd management of the ammunition, this element guarantees a good variety to the action. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, the chainsword produces a riot of blood-red pixels Another important aspect is the level design, which offers increasingly large and complex environments, sometimes even labyrinthine, in which we will have to try to orient ourselves without being able to access a map and relying solely on the suggestions (not always very clear) of the Servoskull who it was assigned to us for our mission. Furthermore, it must be said that in structural terms Boltgun differs from DOOM in terms of duration, which is almost triple and reaches ten hours depending on the approach. Of course, it is also true that the Auroch Digital title does not in any way seek to go beyond its assumptions: the authors wanted to make a tribute to the shooters of the early 90s and this they did, taking up mechanics and structures that more experienced users know well but without trying to introduce any novelty with respect to that formula, which appears necessarily pleasant but dated. Technical realization: a paradise of pixels Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, flying creatures to shoot down... on the fly If in terms of gameplay Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun tries to mimic the classic experiences, it does it all the more on a technical level, offering us deliberately pixelated graphics, which precisely incorporates the fake-3D raster solutions that characterized the various Wolfenstein 3D and DOOM. Well, the result is brilliant: a sort of polygonal pixel art with some goodies that catch the eye, such as the objects that ~rotate~ together with the view, behaving precisely like sprites, as well as obviously the ~slowed down~ animations of the various deaths. nitpicking, we can say that it would have been nice to see a slightly more eventful introductory sequence and perhaps some interlude scenes that could further enhance the style chosen for this production.And. However, factoring in the very affordable price tag and rock-solid soundtrack - as well as great scalability on PC, where the game runs smoothly at 4K and 60fps with very few options - there really isn't much to complain about.", "date": "2023-05-27", "grade": "7.5"}
