{"name": "Formula One 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/formula-one-2003_a.html", "text": "New year, same game Formula One 2003, developed by the former Psygnosys, which became Studio Liverpool a few years ago, is the umpteenth version of a game that made its debut on the now obsolete PlayStation at least 7 years ago and which immediately found success, thanks above all to a formula winner who managed to perfectly mix arcade elements and simulation ambitions. Since then, time has passed inexorably and new versions of Formula One have followed one another which, while maintaining the same winning characteristics of the original, have not been able to renew themselves as they should have, offering themselves from year to year as good titles, but certainly not in able to become a reference for the genre. 8 months after the marketing of the previous chapter, Formula One 2003 arrives in stores, and it is inevitable to wonder if such a limited development period was sufficient to give birth to a completely new video game. The answer can only be no, and from the early stages of the game the kinship bond with Formula One 2002 is evident, with respect to which this ~new~ version presents a very slight graphic update, data updated to the current season and marginal changes to the gameplay. Nonetheless, Formula One 2003 has more than one arrow in its bow, although they are vintage arrows, and can offer a lot to those approaching the Sony title for the first time. New rules to defeat Schumacher As I have already clarified previously, Formula One 2003 takes advantage of the official license in the best possible way, proposing all the teams, drivers and races updated for this year. The approach to the race and its development is as usual immediate and arcade at the right point, being in any case present an exhaustive menu that allows both to choose the level of difficulty (beginner, semi-professional, professional), and to modify the individual characteristics of the race and the regulation, activate/deactivate flags, damage to the single-seaters, wear of the brakes, abs, etc Before going on the track, it may prove necessary to change the format of the images from 4/3 to 16/9 using the appropriate function, and choose the type of control to use. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that in addition to the traditional Dualshock 2 controller, force feedback and the most common steering wheels available in stores are supported, and in particular Logitech Driving Force, GT Force and Speedster, for which you can choose to your liking the best setting. The modes present are the most classic that can be found around, arcade race, race weekend, race against time and season. The multiplayer section is also inevitable, able to accommodate two human users eager to challenge each other in one of the 16 circuits of the formula one world championship. The biggest novelty introduced in this 2003 Formula One is that of the new rules which came into force from the beginning of the season and which provide for a different organization of the practice sessions, both free and official, and the impossibility of making changes to the engine , tires and set-up of the single-seaters before the actual race, once Saturday's qualifying has concluded. The order on the starting grid is decided through two practice sessions, held on Friday and Saturday, each of which allows each driver to complete a single lap on a clear track. Immediacy or realism? As far as gameplay is concerned, little has changed compared to its predecessor. The control system remains very precise, immediate, but undoubtedly grants limited emotions to those who would prefer to try their hand at a more difficult and, therefore, more realistic drive. Nonetheless, reaching one of the three steps of the podium does not prove to be an easy undertaking, above all due to a well-calibrated artificial intelligence in 3 different levels, which leads the opposing drivers to battle us at every corner of the circuit, to attack us at every slightest hesitation and to close the way for us to overtake. The good level of challenge offered by the CPU undoubtedly makes the game experience compelling, thanks also to the frenzy and spectacularity of the races, made uncertain right up to the last corner by the pitfalls offered by possible contacts with the other single-seaters, with consequent damage to the frame and engine. However, there are other not entirely convincing aspects, such as the unrealistic physics of the vehicles, which are minimally affected by the centrifugal force in the curves and which can afford to pass over the curbs while maintaining perfect stability. Adamich and Peroni indirect from the paddocks From a technical point of view, Formula One 2003 retains all the strengths and weaknesses of its predecessor. The graphics engine is confirmed to be very solid, being able to guarantee fluidity constantly anchored at 50 frames per second (absent 60hz option) in every game situation. The level of detail of the circuits is undoubtedly appreciable, even if we would have expected a better rendering of the landscape and surrounding elements, often confused or in any case characterized by reduced quality textures. The single-seater models were made with a good number of polygons and, while not representing the state of the art, they reproduce the real counterparts quite faithfully. Despite the additional time elapsed since the last edition, some outdated flaws remain on PlayStation 2, such as aliasing, albeit not too annoying, and a cleaning of the image that can certainly be improved. A brief note relating to the display of the damage could not be missing which, sorry to say, would also be well done, if it were not necessary to crash into a wall at high speed to verify its ~goodness~. The real formula one has instead taught us that even the smallest contacts between the single-seaters can instead produce very evident damage. The sound has the same highs and lows present almost everywhere throughout the product. All in all, the sound effects were discreet, even if something more could be expected from the roars of the engines, realistic at low revs, but absolutely not able to recreate the explosiveness and grit of the 10 cylinders, when the revs begin to rise . The technical comment, on the other hand, appears subdued, even if the presence of the winning pairing Andrea de Adamich/Claudia Peroni is appreciable, but they limit themselves to expressing trivial considerations at the end of each match. Last corner... Formula One 2003 is, on balance, a good title and would deserve a much higher score if it had turned out to be nothing more or less than a simple update compared to the 2002 edition. The update of the data relating to the current season and the other marginal additions do not in any way justify the outlay required to purchase the game, unless you are at your first experience with Studio Liverpool racing. In this case, Formula One 2003 could also satisfy your motoring desires, guaranteeing healthy and frenetic fun, combined with a simplicity and immediacy that some might even appreciate. However, if you are looking for something that can offer you a more truthful and probably more complete experience, my advice is to direct your attention to the surprising Grand Prix Challenge, Atari's Formula One simulation, perhaps little celebrated, but which most likely represents the best exponent of the genre on PlayStation 2 and beyond Pros: Fun and immediate Data updated to the current season Very robust graphic engine Cons: Little or nothing has changed Unrealistic driving Some graphic defects Sony is back on track Just as the Formula One world championship is getting ready to get underway, Sony Computer Entertainment takes to the track with the 2003 edition of the by now inevitable Formula One, thanks to its supremacy as the only motoring simulation on the market to exploit the licenses and data current season. In fact, the announcement of an exclusive contract with Formula One Administration dates back to the month of June, lasting 4 years, which will allow Sony to exploit not only the official licenses, but also substantial support from the teams, all for recreate a gaming experience that is as realistic and complete as possible, at least on paper.", "date": "2003-08-08", "grade": null}
