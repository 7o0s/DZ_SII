{"name": "GTI Racing - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gti-racing-recensione.html", "text": "Volkswagen in its history of almost a century has created cars capable of entering the collective imagination of people for more than one reason Poles on 4 wheels Techland, the team of Polish programmers authors of the title, for GTI Racing have ~recycled~ but also optimized the graphics engine of their previous work, Xpand Rally. Those who know the game know well that you can expect excellent graphic detail, full of particle effects, reflections in real time, variable weather, damage to the cars (although they are rather standard and not very precise), wide tracks and with a very distant horizon: if we were in the console world, we would be faced with a title halfway between the old and new generation ... All this, however, has a cost in terms of frame rate and to keep the fps at 60 (or slightly less) we will have to lower the resolution and details even if we will have a PC with much higher requirements than those recommended (2.5 GHz processor, 512 MB of ram and 128 video memory). A pity to compromise but there will be no other way if we do not want to fall into annoying lowering of the frame rate. Then the replay is really to be appreciated: finally another game, in addition to Gran Turismo, presents a few ~artistic~ filters with which to make the reproduction of our performances more ~glamorous~ which we can also convert into AVI movies to review with any Media Player and that we will be able to share on the Internet (a bit like the short films of that masterpiece called The Movies). Complete rejection unfortunately instead for the soundtrack, an element that lovers of racing games know well to have a significant importance: the soundtrack is composed of a few, very few anonymous and repetitive techno-like tracks that do not give any pleasure to our auditory channels that seek in the accompaniment an extra charge of aggression to go on the road. full rejection unfortunately instead for the soundtrack, an element that lovers of racing games know very well to have a significant importance Do You Remember Need for Speed? Having gutted the technical component, let's turn our attention to the more strictly playful part. If Xpand moved on the equidistant midline between simulation and arcade, Techland for GTI Racing has given a very precise turn towards the coordinates of a series that many have already drawn inspiration from: Need for Speed Underground. It won't take too many games to understand that GTI Racing has almost traced the structure and gameplay of the Electronic Arts masterpiece. We will thus find ourselves faced with a blatantly arcade interaction, very far from any simulation ambitions that will surely make those players happy who want to go at high speed without thinking about too many setups or long and complicated tutorials. The similarity with NFSU is also reiterated in the career mode: in addition to the typical races to be won (unfortunately there will never be more than three opponents controlled by just enough artificial intelligence, never really able to get us into trouble if not for our faults and mistakes ), we will have to compete in drift competitions and other variations on the theme such as Last Man Standing, Time Trial, Drift Competition and Drag Racing in order to unlock all the available car fleet. A whole section dedicated to tuning could not be missing, both in the aesthetic part and in the components of the car capable of improving performance on the road. Also in this case we could speak of cloning compared to Need for Speed Underground if it weren't for the implementation of a setup of the car in terms of suspensions, brakes, handling and other parameters of the kind which, however, have very little impact on our performance . the similarity to NFSU is also repeated in the career mode To close our overview on the characteristics of GTI Racing, in addition to signaling the release of the title at the price of  29.90, we should note the presence of 60 tracks which in reality, however, are based on only 6 backgrounds then multiplied through some variations of a level design that does not go beyond a stunted sufficiency. A multiplayer component for up to 4 players (ie the maximum number of cars present even in solo racing) via LAN or the Internet with the possibility of organizing mini-tournaments is also inevitable. Finally, there is also a track editor which does not prove to be transcendental but which still turns out to be an extra element not to be disdained at all. Final comment Have you finished the last episode of Need For Speed Underground but still want 100% Arcade racing? In this case, GTI Racing, a single-brand title dedicated to Volkswagen, could be right up your alley. The production of Techland in fact takes more what inspiration from the Electronic Arts series so much so that we are not far from an authentic ~cloning~ operation (arcade gameplay, tuning, career) but GTI is a bit lacking in terms of appeal (beyond the size of the house's cars Teutonic) and personality, as well as being monstrously poor in musical accompaniment. However, the good technical realization (but to have an unquestioned fluidity, you will have to come to terms with the graphic parameters), the excellent replay and the presence of a multiplayer component and the track editor make it a decent product. especially for lovers of ~pure~ arcade racing games, for Golf and Beetle fanatics and for those who place particular emphasis on the price factor given that GTI is marketed from its first release at 29.90. Pros All the tradition and prestige of Volkswagen Reduced price Excellent replay and high graphic quality... Cons ...but to have constant fluidity you will need to work on the settings Excessive similarity to Need For Speed Severely insufficient musical accompaniment Cars for the masses After Ford, another prestigious car manufacturer enters the world of video games with a ~mono-brand~ title. Volkswagen, literally the people's car, in its history of almost a century has created cars capable of selling millions of units but above all has managed to enter the collective imagination of people for more than one reason: from the cinematographic feats of the ~Beetle tutto matto, to the symbiosis with the pacifist movement of the 60s and 70s of his minibus, passing through the myth of the Golf to the Concept Cars that make high-speed lovers dream. All these models could not be missing from GTI Racing (there are actually 15 different Golf models) which also offers the new and super-technological Beetle as well as many other cars from the present and from the past which together offer a truly pleasant fleet (made up of a total of about thirty different models), despite the fact that they are only from the German car manufacturer.", "date": "2006-04-19", "grade": null}
