{"name": "Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars - The Director's Cut", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/broken-sword-il-segreto-dei-templari-the-directors-cut-recensione.html", "text": "History of video games without a doubt, but also history in the strict sense: between a quip and a joke, in fact, one of the characteristics of Broken Sword is precisely that of respecting the delicate matter it deals with, without renouncing the obvious and fundamental digressions in fantasy and legend. But let's go in order: it was the year 1996 when Charles Cecil and his Revolution Software, which already had things like Beneath a Steel Sky and Lure of the Temptress behind them, published by Virgin Interactive for PC and PlayStation, a Absolutely traditional Graphic Adventure but made and written in a workmanlike manner, which demonstrated, while the ~death~ of the genre loomed on the horizon, that in fact a videogame genre never dies of old age but only because, at a certain point, games made properly are starting to be missing. Laugh, Clown! Nintendo aficionados already had the opportunity, in 2002, to approach the first episode of the saga (which, incidentally, unfortunately gradually got worse until the fourth, negligible title) with a theoretically excellent porting for GBA, often however remembered for a sensational bug that prevented you from continuing in the game after doing a certain thing, forcing thousands of players to reset and start over. Then, as in '96, the players were transported by weight into the atmosphere thanks to a beautiful animated sequence, the work of Don Bluth's Studios, in which we saw the American tourist George Stobbart, young, blond and handsome, sitting in total tranquility a table in a Paris bar and observe the daily life of the French capital: a buxom waitress smiling winking, an elderly and elegant customer entering the room, and a street artist dressed as a clown dedicated to entertaining tourists, following him and leaving shortly after. However, the idyll was abruptly interrupted by the explosion of the bar in which the elderly gentleman died, evidently the victim of an attack. From then on, the dazed George was involved in a story of intrigues, conspiracies and raving lunatics that would also lead him to meet Nico Collard, an attractive and penniless Parisian photojournalist, his future adventure companion, and, who knows... This is also the basis of the Director's Cut that Cecil undertook to bring to Wii and DS, this time published by Ubisoft; However, a Director's Cut, rightly so, always includes novelties, and so we immediately discover that the game no longer begins as told, but with a cut scene that sees the beautiful Nico as the protagonist, and which lets us experience an important background: the murder of the media tycoon and prominent conservative (ahem...) politician Pierre Carchon! The most striking addition is in fact the presence of sequences played in the role of Nico, whose weight is around 15/20% of the total adventure and which make The Secret of the Templars homogeneous compared to the sequels. The new sequences are very well integrated into the game from a playful point of view, they too seem to come from '96, just as the ~engine~ puzzles created specifically for Wii and DS are perfectly integrated and do not betray Revolution's original choice of creating almost always logical puzzles and in any case never frustrating, an even more decisive choice thanks to the presence of a ~Hint System~ which provides various levels of help, from a simple clue to the complete resolution of the puzzle, which however costs money in terms of time and success the final. Old & New On the other hand, the innovations on a technical and stylistic level are less integrated. The new locations, sequences and character portraits introduced for this edition are designed by Dave Gibbons, perhaps best known for his comic work (his drawings for Watchmen) but who had already worked with the Revolution for Beneath a Steel Sky: it is noted the stylistic detachment with the previous material of which, however, undoubtedly recreates the liveliness, color and richness of detail, which at the time placed BS at the pinnacle of 2D production. This is no longer the case today, and certain ~crudeness~ is perceived by denouncing an effort aimed more at conforming the new to the old than vice versa: this also explains the lack of 16:9 display, while there is support for 480p. This ~savings innovation~ affects the sound even more: all the old dialogues are reproduced in a very poor compression compared to the original, which stands out even more when we discover, with a very unpleasant detachment, that the new speech is rather crystalline. Artistically the matter is reversed: the same original actors reprise their roles here and, at least in the English original, they are just as fantastic then as they are now. In Italian however, apart from the two protagonists (more emphatic than their English counterpartsbut still very good), the dubbing is often weak and out of role, with that typical acting of someone who dubs a video game without knowing anything about the context in which that sentence will then be pronounced in the game itself. We therefore recommend the original language, which fully brings out the biting irony with which BS, despite the dramatic themes, is pervaded, and which makes it one of the best written works in the entire history of video games. The adventure is quite long, we are about 15 hours dwelling on the puzzles only the bare essentials, and a large part of it consists in listening to even very long dialogue sequences, but, by virtue of the excellent writing and acting (at least in the original), they will be very, very pleasant hours, unraveling a compelling and interesting plot. Final mention to the control system, which works exactly as expected for a Graphic Adventure on Wii with the cursor moved by pointing, and which above all works very well also thanks to the vibration that is felt as soon as a sensitive area is found: a further confirmation, after the games of Telltale Games, of how much the platform lends itself at least to the revival of the legends of the genre. Maybe after ISDT LucasArts and Activision-Sierra will finally come out of their nefarious immobility... But whether it's the main course or just an appetizer, Broken Sword remains very appetizing! The Nintendo DS version We could liquidate the question only by saying that it is exactly the same game: same novelties, same puzzles, same strengths and weaknesses, and we wouldn't be very far from reality. However, we would not even be completely sincere, as there are at least two differences of a certain importance. The first is the total lack of any vocal sampling, given the limited space of the cartridge compared to the DVD: it is a sadly bearable lack, especially considering the sometimes extraordinary performance of the English-speaking actors (see the Spanish section of the adventure...) ; the other instead concerns the control system, which highlights the sensitive parts when you pass near them with the stylus. On the one hand it's a little more uncomfortable, having to constantly keep the stylus on the screen, on the other it makes the adventure easier and even more enjoyable by almost completely eliminating the already very little ~pixel hunting~ present. While not denying the charm that such a cornerstone can have if played in the intimacy of a mattress and duvet, the Wii version remains slightly preferable; but if you only have a DS you can easily go for it!
