You put yourself in the shoes of warriors, wizards or thieves with the fundamental objective of growing your character through exploration and combat, whether using paper and dice, or video games. On consoles and PCs there is a ten-year tradition with regard to RPGs, a genre that has been able to carve out a substantial slice of the market and which still today enjoys enviable successes on all platforms. Generally these are titles equipped with a turn-based combat system, perhaps with the ancient burden represented by random encounters, but in the case of Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Arts the developers have opted for real-time action. The life of the adventurer The introduction of the game shows us a kingdom that is constantly threatened by the invasion of monsters. A powerful wizard goes to the ruler to offer him a solution to the problem: with the help of only two warriors, he will reach the gap from which the creatures emerge and seal it with a spell. In the role of one of the two characters that make up the escort (created at startup, with the possibility of choosing gender, race and type), we will ensure that the expedition is successful. Peace will only last for some time, however: working for a sort of agency, in fact, we will discover that monsters have begun to invade our dimension again... This is the plot of Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Arts, the last episode of Hudson Soft's action RPG series, developed for portable consoles only. After the introductory events, our character will find himself inside the kingdom, turning to the ~guild of heroes~ to earn a living as well as the various ~shops~ to buy items, weapons and protections. The game structure is immediately quite linear: you have to accept the missions in sequence and complete them to earn money, then buy the best equipment to prepare for the natural increase in difficulty. There are missions that must necessarily be tackled alone, others that lend themselves better to group action: in this case we will have the opportunity to form a team together with other warriors, to be selected from a shortlist that grows as we go forward. Sometimes history will designate a companion, especially in those expeditions that serve a bit as a tutorial to find out how many and what actions we can perform to defend ourselves from enemies. After completing a certain number of missions, we will be entrusted with special missions, to accept which we will have to go to the castle and talk to the king. It is in these situations that the plot continues to be told, albeit with a decidedly bland pace and without particular twists. The game structure is immediately rather linear. Arms and baggage If while exploring the city our character has to limit himself to interacting with others (to start short dialogues, accept missions or make purchases), once outside the gates of the kingdom he can access a large number of possibilities. The control system sees the X button for a simple attack (repeatedly pressing it starts a combo), the Square for activating a magic attack and the Circle and Triangle buttons assigned to the quick use of potions to restore health or magical energy. It is possible to use the d-pad to modify almost every function, as well as to give orders to our possible companions: we can make them simply follow us or take care of the recovery of objects, push them to attack monsters or generators, or set them free to behave as they see fit. The back keys, in this sense, have a control function: the left one allows us, among other things, to ask our companions to use their magical energy for different purposes; the right one activates a sort of ~scope~ that we can place on a friendly character to use potions on him, or on an enemy to perform a ranged attack. The most powerful offensive maneuver, however, is the ~grand slam~ and consists in the engagement of an enemy with this ~sight~ by two or more members of our group, with the shot that must be activated by pressing the X button at the moment appropriate. Equipping a sword or a bow can substantially change our approach to combat, even if ranged weapons are rarely accurate. The monsters grow and get stronger (and bigger!) as you complete the quests, and within the dungeons you often come across a seriesof ~generators~, or portals that produce enemies continuously, until they are destroyed. In the same locations, as per tradition, it is possible to find money, objects and anything else needed to fill our inventory... The blacksmith friend In the game, the blacksmith shop is probably the most important one. We will be able not only to sell weapons and objects that we do not need, but also and above all to buy swords, spears, bows and various types of protection, in this case parts of armor to be applied to the torso, legs, arms and head. Clearly, each weapon increases our offensive power and each armor or shield increases our ability to withstand enemy attacks. It is therefore a pity that the fights always take place in a simplistic and confusing way: making them more complex would have added an enormous thickness to the experience. Technical realization The graphics engine used for the game guarantees great fluidity in every occasion, even in the presence of numerous monsters on the screen, and there are some really nice special effects, especially those generated by the use of the ~grand slam~ technique. The polygonal models of the characters boast a good level of detail, even if unfortunately the animation quality is not very high and there are no touches of class that could make the difference (for example, the use of different armor is not graphically represented). The variety of monsters that face each other is not very high and the design, in general, is not the best. This is especially noticeable for the locations, very uninspired, often similar to each other and reduced in number. As far as the sound is concerned, the situation is very similar: on the one hand we have the usual anonymous music, which repeated endlessly force us to at least lower the volume, on the other a series of mediocre effects. There is no shadow of speech, while all screen texts are translated into Italian. The character must be controlled via the analog stick, with a precise and immediate response to commands. The organization of the controls seems difficult at first, but with a minimum of experience you get used to the function of the d-pad (which regulates, in real time, the assignment of actions to most of the buttons). The graphics engine used for the game ensures great fluidity at all times. Comment Hudson Soft's goal was to relaunch one of its historic series, while simultaneously offering PSP owners an action alternative to an already not very large RPG park. Between saying and doing there is the sea, as they say, and unfortunately the idea has been realized badly in practice: beyond a technical realization that could be defined as average, balanced between ups and downs, Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Arts fails where it matters most, which is in playability and immersion. Despite the numerous actions available, in fact, the combat system proves too simplistic right from the start, with a ~brawl~ approach that tends to be repetitive and tired after a few fights. There is a good number of missions, but you end up exploring the same locations dozens of times and in all of this the plot is hidden, with a development of events that is far too slow and fragmented. A product intended for those who want an action RPG at all costs, ultimately, but with the awareness that it is certainly not the best exponent of the genre. Pros: Precise and well-organized control system A large number of purchasable weapons, armor and items Real-time combat... Cons: ...but too simple and repetitive Technically far from exciting Linear and repetitive", "date": "2008-06-30", "grade": null}
