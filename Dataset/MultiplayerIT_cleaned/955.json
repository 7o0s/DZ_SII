{"name": "Mr. Driller: Drill Spirits", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mr-driller-drill-spirits.html", "text": "Touch Screen, can I have it? You shouldn't give too much importance to the technical sector when it comes to a puzzle-game, generally a solid and compelling mechanic is enough to make a handful of pixels a masterpiece, but there are cases in which the eye must become more critical, considering even the exceptions. Well, this is an exception. The Nintendo DS has been out for less than a month, certainly the potential of its revolutionary features (double screen and touch-screen in primis) cannot be fully expressed, but it would be sacrosanct for software houses to offer launch titles that exploit them, even in part, to demonstrate what the new handheld can do. The porting of Super Mario 64 is a more than famous example, as is Meteos, just to mention a puzzle-game. In Drill Spirits the capabilities of the DS are enormously neglected, sometimes they are even detrimental to the use of the product itself. It is always played in the same way, like the Mr. Drillers that we have already seen on Game Boy, Dreamcast, PlayStation: we guide the funny little hero through a series of vertical screens, destroying the obstacles that separate us from our destination with the drill. and sometimes exploiting them to our advantage; blocks of the same color that come together vanish, and what was above them, lacks support, collapses forcing us to move quickly to avoid danger or trigger new destructive combinations that result in a higher score. The essence of Mr. Driller is this, the variables introduced in the game levels by Namco are multiple and, although a bit repetitive, they manage to glue the player to the small screen, between giant creatures that chase us from above and structures of increasingly complex stages. This is where the double screen comes into play, through which it is possible to analyze the situation above or below us in order to plan our actions, a winning idea on paper, but which is poorly expressed in a product so frenetic that it rarely allows us the luxury of looking at both screens or at least the one where our excavator is not. On the other hand, Namco proves that it hasn't managed to make even the touch-screen its own, and controlling our alter-ego with the stylus is practically impossible: the response to inputs is insecure, slow and imprecise, forcing the user to use the d-pad to move more easily between the colored blocks that block the way. Fortunately Drill Spirits offers the player so many game modes that after a while it doesn't matter which console you play with, in particular, Pressure Driller and Mission Driller are the most fun and challenging modes, while the two-player mode disappoints, extremely simplistic and for which not even a single cartridge is enough. Technically speaking As we said, when a game of this kind, a puzzle-game, has solid, amusing and original mechanics, the technical realization takes a decidedly second place, forgiving even the most meager of realizations, especially if purposely devised (those who have called Vib Ribbon?). However this cannot happen with Drill Spirits: it is clear that Namco has recycled the design of the previous episodes, adding little or nothing to an already spartan graphic sector of its own. We therefore find ourselves in front of a funny and colorful two-dimensional graphic, extremely simple: there are no spectacular effects of any kind, we don't look for visual amazement, aesthetically Drill Spirits does its duty without stumbling into slowdowns of any kind (which would have killed the very essence of the gameplay). Certainly better animations would have been welcome for the small sprites, which move a lot on the screen and, unfortunately, awkwardly, literally jerking from one point to another. The same could be said for the audio: both the remixes of the musical tracks of some episodes of the series, and the brand new accompaniments, are ~nice~ and nothing more, they don't annoy but they don't let themselves be remembered either. As a puzzle-game Drill Spirits is a discreet title that will appeal to fans of the series (especially for the very nice Mission and Pressure modes) and fans of the genre, but it certainly does not emerge from the still limited Nintendo DS toy library, especially considering the general mediocrity of its characteristics. Certainly also in Drill Spirits the touch-screen and the dual-screen are exploited, but in such a limited and approximate way that one can only turn up one's nose thinking about how instead the two main peculiarities of the DS are used even only for the mini- Super Mario 64 DS game. To save Drill Spirits from the abyss of mediocrity to which it leadsnna also a less than discreet technical realization is therefore the variety of game modes, a gameplay that is still fresh and enthralling and the sympathy of the design, however a bit little for those looking for a new product that can make sense of the DS and its exceptional possibilities. Pros: Simple and fun gameplay Numerous game modes and options Cons: Technically mediocre DS capabilities are underutilized and underused Two player mode is disappointing Do you know how many years have passed since the release of the legendary Tetris? No? We tell you: 17 years. In fact, the progenitor of almost all modern puzzle-games dates back to 1988, which accompanied the release of the first, historic Game Boy and fueled the imagination of programmers, who have always recycled the basic ideas of the simple but exciting video game ever since. , trying to enrich them with original gimmicks, in an attempt to match the fame of one of the most important video games ever. For years we have seen puzzle-games of all kinds, based on the original Tetris concept but full of variations and originality, and certainly among the best exponents of the genre we can include Mr. Driller which, somewhat surprisingly, Namco re-proposes on Nintendo DS as a launch title. Unfortunately, however, Drills Spirits will hardly be remembered among the best titles of the new portable console from Nintendo.", "date": "2005-04-22", "grade": null}
