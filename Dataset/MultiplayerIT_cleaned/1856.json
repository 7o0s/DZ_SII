{"name": "Pink Panther", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pink-panther.html", "text": "[***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] SHOCKING PINK! In theory the game should be based on a plot, but since the few (and somewhat questionably made) animated cutscenes don't show much, and the instruction booklet doesn't help either, I'll summarize it in two-lines-two: a The Pink Panther's mysterious uncle has bequeathed her a huge treasure, but no one knows where it is... It will therefore be essential to run left and right in an attempt to recover it, with the ever-present Inspector Clouseau on his tail, who for the occasion he will take on the role of the bad guy on duty. To be honest, the ultimate goal would be to save a princess, but I follow the instructions: it's certainly not a good start to know that not even the programmers themselves have a clear idea of the plot of the game... In reality, no one, playing Pinkadelic Pursuit really feels this purpose, and each level takes up the settings of a particular episode of the cartoon without however giving a logical coherence to the whole: therefore the plot can be better summarized with a ~jump until you reach the end of the stage~: only in some of these we will find variations, such as the medieval tournament mini-game or the flying section, which still remain uninteresting levels. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] EVENING PINK, GOOD GAME HOPE We are not there, we are not there, and from every point of view: graphically speaking we are at very low levels, both for the characterization of the enemies, few and badly animated, and for the backdrops, which often look like ~copy and paste~ of bitmaps not well assembled together. The Pink Panther sprite is only partially saved, drawn quite well even if very limited in the animations: fun to see her running on a unicycle if we leave her inactive for a few seconds, but it remains only a waste of memory, useful for improving other weak points of the graphics. On the other hand, examining the audio, the SuperEmpire game alternates between catchy tunes, which soon become repetitive, with absolutely irritating motifs, and the almost total lack of sound effects (even the most trivial, like a leap of the Panther for example) gives a strong sense of incompleteness to the whole sound commentary. Even the gameplay certainly does not shine for originality, despite having on paper some interesting variables with respect to the classic platform scheme, absolutely not exploited. Indeed, the Pink Panther has an arsenal of demented cartoonish weapons to defend himself: bowling balls, a giant hammer, a flamethrower and even a pink paint sprayer... In reality, the only weapon we will almost always use will be the flamethrower, making all the others quite useless, taking away variety from the resolution of the levels. The stages are then tremendously flat and equal to each other, so much so that in more than one case you will find yourself completing them without even realizing it, and the overall slowness of the whole game risks tiring every player quickly. Wanting to give a pinch of innovation, the programmers have thought of setting some levels underwater, only that everything is reduced to a hopping from platform to platform here too, with slowed down movements. And even the few sub-games, such as a medieval duel on horseback or a flying section avoiding lightning and hills, do not contribute to raising the title's lack of innovation. Finally, for longevity, only one fact is enough, truly alarming: I managed to put this dozen levels behind me, finishing it, in an hour and a half... And I also wonder what is the point of choosing the difficulty level among three different ones, since there are no apparent complications in the game. In short, to summarize: mediocre to see and hear, with a poor feeling and a disarming ease alternating with moments of frustration, when it comes to starting an entire level over again: you draw the conclusions , counting on the fact that platformers are certainly not lacking on this console. Pros: Main character fun and decently animated... ...and that's it Cons: Too easy in many occasions, too frustrating in others Very questionable overall technical realization Some interesting ideas, but absolutely not exploited The GBA has shown that it is particularly suitable for two-dimensional graphics, and it is no coincidence that platformers abound on this console. So here comes a new game, which brings as testimonial the very funny Pink Panther, by SuperEmpire and Wanadoo; will he be able to convince users of the Nintendo laptop? Oppure is it the umpteenth empty exploitation of an image that is sure to appeal?", "date": "2002-12-24", "grade": null}
