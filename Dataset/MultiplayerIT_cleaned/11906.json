On our TV screen we don't see rich teams and poor teams, capable drivers and less capable drivers. No, we can choose anyone and maybe make them win the championship, because the vehicles are all equally fast and the only skills we have to count on are our own. It doesn't matter if you put yourself in Valentino Rossi's shoes on a Yamaha or Shinya Nakano on a non-factory Honda bike, it's our skill that determines the outcome of each race. And even if we root for the worst driver in the universe, we can give him a few moments of glory virtual. Test ride Developed by the Italian Milestone on behalf of Capcom, MotoGP 07 offers us all the characteristics of licensed products: we can play a quick race or a time trial, try our hand at the 2007 MotoGP championship, try to overcome a series of challenges or play with a friend in multiplayer mode. Each of these possibilities has its own why, especially the section dedicated to challenges, which can really improve our approach to driving. However, it is clear that most of the substance of the game lies in the championship mode: once a driver has been selected from those available (i.e. all those present in the last season), we will have to face all the races in their various phases (free practice, qualification, race) and fight for every single point we're going to earn for the final classification. Indeed, once we have assimilated the control system and interpreted the philosophy of the game, we will be able to modify its parameters to customize the experience according to our tastes and the desired level of challenge. This can also translate into arriving at the end of the race happy with a sixth place in the standings, because maybe we earned that position tooth and nail. Custom motorcycle The most significant feature of MotoGP 07 does not lie in its form, but in its substance. The fact of being able to adapt the game to your needs is not limited to the number of laps to be carried out or the number of opponents on the track, nor to a mere modification of the level of difficulty. The driving model can be adjusted in three ways (arcade, simulation, advanced) and the differences are obvious: driving in an arcade style allows us to set the curves aware that the bike will not start sideways if we insist too much on the accelerator, and only major collisions will result in a crash. This does not mean that we will be able to launch into every hairpin bend with a knife between our teeth and at maximum speed, far from it: however unrealistic, the setting is certainly less ~arcade~ than some other racing games. The simulation style is much more severe, both in terms of road holding (with the bike suddenly losing grip when we put the tires to the test) and collisions, practically at a realistic level. Finally, the advanced style even sees the presence of the separate brake (front and rear), the strictly manual gearbox and a high probability of falling into the various risky situations. Modifying the difficulty level has a further regulatory effect, completing the picture of a complete customization: you can choose simple driving against strong opponents, or you can make everything very realistic but file down the skills of the other drivers. Whatever your ideas about racing games, MotoGP 07 can accommodate them. Technical realization In the past Milestone has managed to achieve extraordinary technical results on PlayStation 2, and now it is once again producing a very well made product, even if not at the Super-Bikes Riding Challenge levels. The creation of the bikes is perfect and the game does not skimp on precious touches (such as the rider who turns when we press the button to look behind us), not neglecting the animation of the centaurs, but the detail could have been higher and the frame rate , while stable, slightly exceeds twenty frames per second. The sound sector does its duty in a dignified way: the roar of the engines is realistic and the effects in general are good, even if not unforgettable. As far as the control system is concerned, we have the classic accelerator assigned to the X button and the brake to the Quadrato (with R2, possibly, the rear brake is activated), while the left analog stick is assigned to the movement of the bike and the right one is It can use to have an alternate acceleration and brake system. Comment As soon as you hit the track with MotoGP 07, you realize how solid and well-programmed the game is. Whatever degree of realism is selected, infacts, you always have the impression of having full control of the bike, and so the chases turn into something exceptional. Shaping the difficulty so much as to obtain a certain level of challenge makes each race exciting, and in that case the difference is made through the bike settings (tyre compound, gear ratios, cornering speed factor, etc.), which they can also save several seconds on the lap if you are careful to adjust them based on the characteristics of each track. MotoGP 07 has so much substance that the technical aspect, although well done, takes a back seat. When a racing game manages to be so addictive in all its phases, what more could you want? Pros: Adaptable driving system Solid and thick Technically well done Cons: Not very fluid graphics The realistic approach is ruthless The right angle If you also and above all appreciate the spectacular aspect of motorcycle racing, you will be happy to know that MotoGP 07 includes an option that allows you to pause the game and rotate the view using the analog stick to appreciate the scene (perhaps a flight of the motorcycle, or overtaking at the limit) from different angles. It is a feature in itself, of course, but it denotes the commitment of the developers to offer a product as complete as possible.", "date": "2007-10-23", "grade": null}
