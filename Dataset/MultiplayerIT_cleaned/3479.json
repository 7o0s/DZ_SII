The aubergine man hadn't been seen on iOS systems since December 2015, the release period of that Rayman Adventures which tried to embrace the prevailing free to play formula, succeeding in a more than dignified way: this time, however, things go differently, because the Apple Arcade policy provides only and exclusively experiences without microtransactions and the like, and therefore Rayman Mini presents itself as an old-fashioned platform from many points of view, with all the positive and negative aspects that this entails. Gameplay that wins doesn't change Developed by Ubisoft Montpellier in collaboration with Pastagames, Rayman Mini immediately stands as a product that doesn't get lost in chatter and goes straight to the point, so much so that it doesn't even contemplate a real plot: we only know that the protagonists (beyond in Rayman you can select the old acquaintances Barbara and Globox) have been reduced to microscopic dimensions and have to face a journey of many vicissitudes to return to their original forms, which is little more than a pretext to justify the 48 levels divided into six different settings that make up the offer of the title. Even the gameplay does not need great presentations, considering that it is more or less what has already been seen not only in Rayman Adventures but also in the previous Rayman Jungle Run and Rayman Fiesta Run: the character therefore runs automatically from left to right of the screen, and the user must act on the touchscreen to make it jump, glide, hit opponents or crash to the ground, with the aim of reaching the stage goal unscathed by collecting as many Lums as possible. Moreover, these perform a never so accessory function in the game economy, given that getting 100 in a level simply allows you to receive a token to spend in exchange for a new costume for the desired character: a purely aesthetic function that perhaps lightens the structure of Rayman Mini, unable to offer great stimuli to those who want to aim for the perfect score in each pattern. However, it is all part of an evident design choice aimed at proposing an even more streamlined and immediate play experience than its predecessors, for a platform that can be easily consumed even for short sessions in spare time: extremely concise levels contribute to this purpose , which can be completed in less than a minute and which have a decidedly low average challenge coefficient. In short, don't expect to ruin your fingertips with Rayman Mini, to the point that you don't feel the real need to use an external controller, even if it is fully supported by the software. The Ubisoft product therefore lets itself be played with pleasure but struggles to involve like the best releases of the aubergine man, also thanks to a level design that does not shine under any particular aspect: one rarely encounters a truly memorable stage, the solutions adopted all know already seen and moreover some interactions with enemies or objects are unclear and end up being discovered by chance or by dint of attempts. On the other hand, it is impossible to be disappointed by the graphic component of the title, strong in that marvelous two-dimensional style inaugurated by Rayman Origins and which reappears here more defined and detailed than ever: the scenarios are rich and colourful, the animations of the protagonists are worthy of a cartoon and the everything moves at a remarkable speed that never gives any sign of letting up. Wanting to nitpick it can be said that the settings do not exude variety and that the sound accompaniment does not remain very impressed, but Rayman Mini remains a technically excellent product.", "date": "2019-09-24", "grade": "7.5"}
