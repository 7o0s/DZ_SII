From a narrative point of view, yes, there is no doubt: the events of the game take place a few months after those of Marvel's Spider-Man and tell of how Miles Morales is trying to become the hero he would like to be, under the protective wing of his mentor Peter Parker. In terms of content, however, the story is quite different: the first chapter of the series could boast a much more substantial and multifaceted campaign, all the more thanks to the inclusion of the three DLCs in the Remastered version, and in comparison the adventure of the new Spider-Man is almost like an expansion, with its seven hours and a little more to get to the end credits and a much lower amount of secondary missions. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the protagonist kicks a criminal In any case, we are talking about a highly enjoyable experience, which can count on various novelties on the gameplay front and on an engaging story, at times even moving, as well as on a further matured artistic sector: elements that make Miles Morales a must for anyone who has appreciated Marvel's Spider-Man. Then comes the question you're all asking yourself: how is the conversion of the game made by Nixxes for the Windows platform and how does it compare to the work done for the first chapter? Put on your costume, load the web shooters and while you're at it, put on a hat and scarf too, it's cold outside: here's our review of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales for PC. Story: The Ultimate Spider-Man? Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, a furious confrontation with the main villain of the game, Tinkerer Born in the pages of the Ultimate Fallout miniseries after the death of Earth-1610's Peter Parker, that of the Ultimate Universe created by Brian Michael Bendis, Warren Ellis and Mark Millar in 2000, Miles Morales boasts a substantially different origin story in the Insomniac games Games, perfectly integrated into the gaming universe we talked about in the Marvel's Spider-Man review. Having come into possession of the same powers as Spider-Man at the end of the first game of the series, Miles tells his friend Peter what happened to him and the latter reveals the truth to him, giving him a costume and agreeing to ~train~ him to become like he is a guardian of New York and in particular of Harlem, the neighborhood where the boy lives with his mother after the tragic death of his father. The path that the young protagonist finds himself following in the Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales campaign is therefore the one that will lead to becoming a hero, but above all to emancipate himself and acquire his own identity also in the eyes of the inhabitants of the city. who have always seen him as a shoulder of the ~real~ Spider-Man as well as a discreet troublemaker: a concept that is reaffirmed in the first sequences of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. very few digressions, but he manages to characterize the central characters of the story very well and can count on a direction that once again proves to be impeccable, strong in highly spectacular sequences, which in some cases pay clear homage to the cinematic Spider-Man. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the official costume of the character in the ~I'm cold~ version Miles is a normal boy, who is immediately likable, and it must be said that the authors were very good at seasoning his story with details capable of adding human depth to the protagonist. It's true: some narrative solutions appear to be phone calls and lack real twists, just as the number of villains is substantially reduced compared to the aforementioned Marvel's Spider-Man. in masking the limits of a traditional open world structure, also and above all thanks to the idea of making the secondary activities mostly optional with which we will be able to try our hand between one main assignment and another, given that they do not shine for variety or complexity . Gameplay: Like Spider-Man, but better Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the spectacular finisher with extra cat Miles is endowed with the same powers as Spider-Man, but also with something more: during the initial sequences of the campaign he discovers that he has the ability to emit devastating bioelectric discharges (skills that the developers have ingeniously exploited also to set up nice environmental puzzles here and there), as well as being able to blend in by becoming literally invisible, albeit for a quantity of tlimited time. Applied to a freeflow combat system optimized in its mechanics, with fewer empty shots and a greater ability to maintain the balance of the exchange rhythm, these innovations manage to effectively refresh the gameplay of the clashes, giving life to truly frenetic battles and fun, in which to strategically dose the special moves to focus them on the most dangerous and tough opponents. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales character punches a Roxxon soldier Also from this point of view, the sequel is confirmed to be less rich: the various criminal gangs of New York have been basically replaced by three categories of enemies, in this case the street criminals, the mercenaries in the pay of Roxxon and the members of the Underground, albeit among among their ranks we find a more than discreet variety in terms of types, equipment and skills. Elements that always make stealth eliminations from raised points very fun, a legacy of the Batman: Arkham series that curiously Gotham Knights (here the review) has not taken up again. Unfortunately, on the boss fight front there is little to do: the ~minute~ structure ~ of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales has also reduced these specific fights, including in the campaign only three villains (two and a half, indeed) with whom we will find ourselves fighting. On the other hand, the developers have further improved the web swinging and, in general, our ability to move within Manhattan, greatly reducing the situations in which the character resorts to vertical wall running, really ugly, and adding speed to travel thanks to a new mid-air launch. DualSense on PC Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales can be played on PC using a DualSense controller and finding all the features of the PS5 version in terms of haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, provided you connect the device with the cable instead of via Bluetooth. Compared to using an Xbox controller, the experience with the official Sony pad is obviously more interesting and multifaceted. Technical realization and PC version Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the scheme with requirements and recommended presets Although it is not possible to appreciate a clear technical detachment from Marvel's Spider-Man, also considering that Miles Morales reuses many elements, from a graphic point of view this new experience is improved and enriched. Merit of an artistic direction capable of enhancing the change of season very well and of giving greater character to certain neighborhoods, Harlem in particular: the sequence in which Miles walks down the street with his friend Ganke, between Christmas lights and stalls, is truly suggestive. The protagonist boasts a completely new set of animations compared to Peter's movements, and this is quite evident when swinging from one building to another or performing silent eliminations: it seems that Miles is always in the balance, a clumsy and uncoordinated boy who, however, is ~saved~ by the abilities that have been given to him, and which among other things give him superhuman reflexes and readiness. The Italian dubbing is also excellent this time and helps to make the experience more engaging, along with the excellent soundtrack. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the settings we used with an RTX 3070 to get 60 fps at 1440p So we come to the PC version, the subject of this review. You will recall that in the case of Marvel's Spider-Man there was a sensational situation, with a patch of particular technical relevance that was distributed only several hours after the expiry of the embargo on reviews, rendering the latter basically obsolete (those that they went into detail without remaining vague, at least) and going to revolutionize in particular the management of ray tracing, transforming it into an even more elitist feature, if you pass the term. What has changed with Miles Morales? As expected, very little. The graphic adjustments are the same as in the previous episode and unfortunately, this time too, a percentage scaler for the resolution is missing, as well as an internal benchmark that allows you to check performance. The impact of upscaling technologies is confirmed to be very limited, with DLSS, FSR, XeSS and IGTI which improve performance only slightly although in theory the effective resolution drops significantly. We also find the option for dynamic resolution with fps target, which however works aggressively and greatly decreases the general quality. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the character admires the landscape at the beginning of the campaign Ray tracing weighs a lot, we saido: if you avoid activating it, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is able to run on an RTX 3070 at real 4K with 50 fps average, without upscaling technologies and with all settings at maximum. It goes without saying that you just need to retouch something to get enough overhead to stay glued to 60 frames in all situations, even the most chaotic and busy. Again, it's a shame you can't do this with a simple percentage scaler, like the one we covered in our review of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. a vertical drop in performance, down to 10 fps. The game also tends to implement the changes in a progressive and not instantaneous way, which creates many difficulties when trying to find the best compromise between detail and fluidity. However, in our case we managed to get a relatively stable 60 frames by dropping down to 1440p and using the Max preset (which would be ~high~) for both general adjustments and ray tracing, but also keeping DLSS turned on ~quality ~.", "date": "2022-11-18", "grade": "8.2"}
