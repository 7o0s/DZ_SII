{"name": "Worms Blast", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worms-blast_a.html", "text": "A radical change. Thanks to the change of publisher, with Infogrames which has been replaced by Ubi Soft, Martyn Brown and colleagues have decided to give new life to the Worms series with something original. Inspired by one of the ~legends~ of video game history, Puzzle Bobble, but also by something more recent and successful, or Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, this Worms Blast came out. A game which, due to its structure, is very suitable for console conversion; and it is precisely for this reason that, in the coming months, it will also be released on PlayStation 2 and GameCube. And immediately, right from the main menu, you notice the changes made by the developers. The thing that immediately catches the eye is the graphics, made in 3D (we'll talk about the actual game later), with a very cartoonish style. There are mainly three game modes: Campaign, Missions and VS; the first, oriented to the single player game, will challenge you with a series of small puzzles, for which you will have to use all your gray matter, ~solving~ them within the time limit, which varies according to the difficulty. In Missions mode your goal will be to finish the levels in the shortest time possible, in order to get the highest score and thus reach the head of the score table; five sub-modes are then available for what concerns this ~type~ of game. For better or worse, the aim of this mode, in each of its five incarnations, is to hit and, in some cases, avoid a series of moving targets scattered across the screen. The last mode, called VS, is more oriented towards multiplayer; you can challenge the CPU, or your friend / opponent in a challenge to the last boat. Also in this case, there are eight different sub-modes, to make everything more varied. Playability above all With the choice of the character to use among the 6 initially available (there are some hidden ones, which can be unlocked by progressing in the game), and after a short loading, you can immediately start playing. For those who are unable to immediately enter the game mechanisms, before starting, they have the possibility to follow a short tutorial, which allows them to become familiar with the control system, which is however very easy to learn, since the keys used (or the buttons of the pad, you do) are very few. The game mechanics are also very simple: with the character you have chosen, on a small boat, you will have to hit a series of blocks of different colors (at least in most game modes), with one of the weapons at your disposal, until everything on the screen is not deleted or, in any case, what is required of you by the level you are facing. With some weapons, you will only be able to hit blocks with the same color as the weapon, while with all the others (the arsenal you will have is quite varied and includes different types of firearms, as well as slightly stranger things such as sea monsters and piranhas) you will have fewer restrictions. Playability above all Even if it doesn't seem like it initially, given that the game is the most arcade-like it can be conceived, the choice of character is very important, given that its characteristics will affect, and not a little, how you will have to behave while playing. A fair number of power-ups is also available, as is tradition, which can be conquered during the game and which will have more or less pleasant effects on your games. As you have surely guessed from my words, one of the salient features of Worms Blast is playability. On the other hand, the aim of the game is to have fun, both by playing alone and against an opponent, artificial or human, and a certain level of playability is the least that can be expected. The controls are kept to a minimum and, fortunately, the game picks up from the first playthrough. And once you start playing, most likely, you will find it hard to tear yourself away. This turning point in the series will most likely not be very welcome to the many fans who have played it since 1995, but it will certainly allow Team 17 to obtain a greater number of ~proselytes~. A couple of technical considerations and conclusions From a purely technical point of view, the introduction of this fake 3D has allowed the English team to improve and make the general look of the game more modern. I'm talking about fake 3D because all the pCharacters and elements as you play are made with a technique that is very reminiscent of cell shading, while only the menus are in ~true~ 3D. Support for graphics acceleration has been introduced and effects such as Transform & Lighting, typical of the latest generation video cards, are supported. The hardware requests are then quite contained, since the minimum required is an obsolete Pentium II 266 with 64 Mb of Ram and a hundred Mb on Hard Disk, while at least a 500 - 600 Mhz processor supported by any graphics accelerator is recommended. From the sound point of view, not much to say, because apart from the standard music that accompanies your games and the nice audio effects typical of the series, there's nothing else. All in all, Worms Blast is an interesting and fun game. Maybe fans of the series won't love it madly, but once you start it, you will hardly be able to tear yourself away. A title that is certainly not the best from a technical point of view, but which makes playability its trump card and which, therefore, will be appreciated by those who want to have fun without too many thoughts. Small final note: there are two editions of Worms Blast. One contains only the game; the other one has a small but welcome bonus, namely Worms Pinball, a ~worm~ themed pinball machine, created for PlayStation a few years ago and converted to PC for the occasion. A bit of history Born way back in 1995, the Worms series represented one of the most successful franchises of recent years on our beloved PCs. Although some games of the ~saga~ have appeared on other platforms (the first Worms was also released on the Amiga, while both Armageddon and World Party saw the light on consoles such as the PlayStation and Dreamcast), the main one for the developers of Team 17 ( for the uninitiated, it is the software house that created legendary titles such as Superfrog, Project-X, Body Blows and Alien Breed for the Amiga) has always been made up of personal computers. In these first four titles of the series, the developers have been faithful to the saying ~The team that wins, you don't change~ and, while making some small improvements and additions each time (such as, for example, the one consisting of the possibility of playing online ), the game has pretty much always remained the same. To be honest, as happens when games of the same series are too similar, you start to get bored, because you would like to see something new. A part of the ~worm~ aficionados would have been satisfied with a few improvements, perhaps the addition of some weapon or character; another faction would have liked to see the game concept unchanged, but with completely 3D graphics; someone else, however, asked for a radical break with the past.", "date": "2002-04-16", "grade": null}
