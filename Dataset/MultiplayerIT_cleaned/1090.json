{"name": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-5.html", "text": "The Ghosts are ready for anything The story is actually very linear at the beginning of the game even if as the missions go by it will become more intricate, intertwining with the plot of the Xbox version of the Ubisoft title, set four years earlier. In the PlayStation 2 version we will guide the team of ghosts beyond enemy lines in North Korea following the sinking of an ultra-technological ship by actually unidentified enemies. The suspicions will prove to be right and, after a few missions, the ghosts will be employed in a real war to defend South Korea from the invasion of the northerners. Political fiction? Maybe, but North Korea certainly doesn't like the Americans and Tom Clancy in particular. The single game is articulated through a tutorial, necessary to approach the game and to learn the new commands introduced, and 14 levels in turn interspersed with movies that seem to be taken from a television documentary so accurate are they, with interviews with the men of the team and insights into the mission to be tackled that make the plot ever clearer and increase the player's emotional involvement in the Ubisoft title. The missions turn out to be varied and well done, even if unfortunately short and sometimes frustrating, also due to the impossibility of saving during the course of the same. In addition to the canonical scheme ~move the team from one point to another and destroy everything in your path~ there are intriguing and different situations, such as tracking down and defending a downed helicopter and its pilot, taking control of a prison camp to free a North Korean general, or attack a dam and then repel the enemy assault. We can certainly say that the developers of Red Storm Entertainment have racked their brains to try to make the levels of their game always different, in this regard it is fair to remember that the Lone Wolf mode has been introduced which we will discuss later. The first change that immediately catches the eye is the different view that is set by default by the game: a third person with a camera over the player's shoulder that frames the entire body of the player himself as well as obviously everything around him. This change is not merely aesthetic but rather was desired by the developers, and this is noticeable during the campaign, to make the player's action much more effective, guaranteeing him the possibility of carefully examining the area around the soldier himself in order to understand in a fraction of a second the origin of any dangers and therefore also of possible shelters. We can only confirm how much good this view offers which, moreover, passes into first person every time we use the zoom of the rifle, as if to satisfy the most fundamentalist players regarding the game view. It is however possible by choosing in the options menu to always play with the traditional fps shot, except in the Lone Wolf mode. This possibility is an absolute novelty for Ghost Recon and allows you to use a team member to carry out some high-risk missions. It will be armed with the new M29 rifle equipped with a video camera that allows the player, sheltered behind any obstacle, to aim at enemies simply by protruding the weapon, without taking excessive risks and thus resulting in a very precise instrument, capable of carrying out devastating attacks thanks also to the built-in grenade launcher. Run baby run In Ghost Recon 2 the player will command a single group of men, instead of the canonical two teams, but his work will be concentrated above all on his soldier, while the other fellow soldiers will be able to issue orders by simply pressing the triangle button. By pointing to a point in front of the team and pressing the relevant key, you will see the soldiers move forward to the objective, selecting a fixed fire position, such as a machine gun, after pressing triangle you will see the soldier take possession of it and start using it against the enemies. By prolonging the pressure of the same key, you can choose between 4 selectable commands by simply indicating what interests us with the d-pad: forward, stop, suppress and throw grenades. Furthermore, if you are equipped with a USB headset with microphone, in addition to hearing the comments of your teammates directly in the headphones, you can give orders simply by pronouncing them into the microphone itself. Few commands but very useful and able to make it simple and effective to lead our team. Rightly at this point of our article we cannot avoid addressing the analysis of the A.I. of the game, given how fundamental the reactions of our team are but also qubattles of our enemies to make the war simulator believable. Unfortunately, the enemies are always ~born~ in the same points, and therefore in the event of premature death it is easy to overcome the obstacle by remembering the positions of the opponents. Their reactions are often slowed down and not very plausible, it happens too frequently that by killing one of the soldiers on guard duty the others will not seek cover but rather will remain motionless, an easy target of our fire. As for the team, the matter is a little different, and fortunately the ~boys~ move in a quite realistic way, protecting each other and filling the enemy with lead without exposing themselves excessively to danger. Sometimes, however, they are prey to sudden attacks of unconsciousness and we have happened to see the ~ghosts~ make absolutely illogical movements, such as standing in front of the player's line of fire. In offline mode the graphic component is not excellent but at least it manages to earn enough, it certainly does not stand up, even in part, to the comparison with what was seen in the Xbox version. The textures are discreetly defined and even the polygonal models, while not making a miracle cry, are detailed and functional for the purpose. The setting of the various levels is reconstructed well even if there is aliasing and the structures are reduced to the essentials. Good interaction with the seabed itself which manages to offer protection to our ghosts on many occasions. Online or offline? The real juice of the Ubisoft game, at least for Xbox users is certainly the online mode, so this option could not be missing in the PlayStation 2 counterpart, which uses the network adapter and the Ubi.com server dedicated to online gaming. There are only three modes: Last Man, Assault and Supremacy. In the first option we will simply have to survive, like the most classic of team death matches, in Assault instead we will participate in an attack on a position but obviously in turn it will also happen to defend the objective. Supremacy, on the other hand, is the more tactical mode, a kind of conquest mode in which we will have to capture numerous communication posts. There are 10 maps, large but all too regular, and the visual impact is something impressive, but unfortunately in the negative. The downgrade suffered by the graphic cosmetics, already certainly not exciting in itself, is something crazy that ruins the atmosphere and forces the players to a continuous confrontation with very bad and grainy textures, absolutely meager polygonal models not to mention a framerate that dancer is an understatement. Unfortunately, it is not possible to create and manage your own clan, a very evident lack especially if we think that Ghost Recon is mainly a war game between different teams. Ultimately, the online service offered by Ubi.com seemed very subdued to us, especially when compared to the other hosted games, and we often encountered disconnections and a very annoying lag. From Ghost Recon 2 we expected more, especially after seeing the Xbox version, and we were disappointed by the lack of care given to this title. The single player mode, although not excellent and which leaves out the tactic a little by winking at more action-oriented productions such as Call of duty, is still pleasant for every enthusiast. The online part is instead to be forgotten, hoping for a sudden intervention by Ubisoft regarding the management of the server and its methods. A missed opportunity. Pros Varied and engaging missions The Lone Wolf mode Online play Cons poorly done A.I. sometimes deficient. Technically only fair After being born on a Personal Computer, the Ghost Recon saga landed in the console universe and, although the first episode that appeared made many turn up their noses, it was able to captivate the many PlayStation 2 users. Following a new compelling storyline, woven masterfully by Tom Clancy, the sequel to that first chapter arrives on our consoles: will we return to the tactics so loved by players on PC? Or will there be a more arcade twist? Follow us in our review to know all the details.", "date": "2004-12-14", "grade": null}
