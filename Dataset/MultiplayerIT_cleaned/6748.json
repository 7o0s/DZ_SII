{"name": "LEGO Batman 3: Gotham e Oltre", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/140677-lego-batman-3-gotham-e-oltre-eroi-in-posa-plastica.html", "text": "Anyone who reads superhero comics knows that there are different characters and narrative contexts, urban realities that contrast with cosmic events. Batman is best known for his nature as a night vigilante, capable of confronting villains who are insane and dangerous, sure, but who move within the limits of human nature. Yet, at the same time, the Dark Knight is part of the most famous group of DC heroes, the Justice League, and with companions such as Superman, Martian Manhunter and Green Lantern he often shares larger-scale adventures, perhaps taking place on other worlds and may involve entities endowed with nearly infinite powers. This is exactly the incipit of LEGO Batman 3: Gotham and Beyond, the new episode of the TT Games series, which starts from a plan hatched by the Joker and Lex Luthor to conquer the world but quickly turns into something else, when the fearsome Brainiac comes into possession of the Rings of Power with the intention of exploiting their immense capabilities to miniaturize our planet and add it to his collection. The story is told in the best possible way by the authors of the game, who from the second episode can also count on the dialogues to come up with gags that are always able to make us smile, between more or less explicit quotes from some DC storylines and the now inevitable nostalgic vein of the Batman films directed by Tim Burton, those of Superman with Christopher Reeves and the Wonder Woman television series. How many times is the bat symbol pitted against the full moon? Among the many visual references and the splendid music of Danny Elfman and John Williams, this Warner Bros. production winks at adult gamers more than you would expect, while remaining anchored in a practically challenge-free approach, which in theory should meet the needs of the very young. LEGO Batman 3: Gotham and Beyond does not bring with it the expected evolution, but it entertains and involves resobat The lack of the open world does not mean that in LEGO Batman 3: Gotham and Beyond there are no original ideas or variations on the theme, such as the ~circular~ shooter sections clearly inspired by Resogun that you have to deal with from time to time. While not boasting the complexity of the Housemarque shooter, these sequences represent a fun parenthesis between one level and another in the campaign. The failed evolution Let's say right away that the step forward that fans of the series expected, after the experiments with the open world of LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, has not been made. The developers have rather chosen a conservative path, returning to the ~watertight compartments~ and the hub to access the missions (organised, in this case, in a somewhat confusing way). During the five or six hours necessary to complete the campaign, we are faced with a traditional structure, therefore, with a large number of environmental puzzles (some of which are fairly complex and multifaceted) to be solved by resorting to the specific skills of each character or buying new ones to compose that set of eight powers that characterizes most of the protagonists. The classic alternative costumes of Batman and Robin return, from the infrared to the space suit, from the magnetic to the electric suit, but the experience numbers are literally multiplied from a certain point of the adventure onwards, when good and bad are forced to team up and work together to stop Brainiac's threat. The extraordinary richness of the cast, never so large and varied, therefore fills the lack of substantial innovations, making a ~return to origins~ sweet and very pleasant, which should instead have irrevocably made us turn up our noses. The gags that derive from the unusual alliance, however, are priceless and keep the barrack going: the excellent dubbing in Italian, in its debut, contributes substantially to the enjoyment of the experience, with Marco Balzarotti (Batman), Davide Garbolino ( Robin) and Riccardo Peroni (Joker) in great form, together with a cast of equally inspired colleagues capable of giving a capital performance. Performance that is however ruined by the mixing, given that during the phases played (fortunately not in the cutscenes, perfect from this point of view) the dialogues are too low in volume compared to the sounds and music. Let's hope that an update will fix the flaw, because it would really be a shame to waste such a good job in this way. Xbox One goals There are forty Achievements in LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, and to get them all you need to explore the locations far and wide in search of the manyhidden objects. Of course, there is no shortage of simpler and more linear achievements, those that are unlocked by completing individual levels or completing trivial tasks such as creating the first custom character. All the powers in the world As mentioned above, the lack of that evolution for which the foundations had been laid in the second episode of the series does not represent, in the end, a very serious defect for a title that manages to recycle itself and to focus on numbers for add variety and fun to the gameplay, seasoned with an irresistible narrative, full of touches of class. What about the fight with Brainiac in the middle of Piazza dei Miracoli and, in general, the ~European tour~ that breaks into the final parts of the game, and which looks like a commercial for the LEGO Architecture line? There are invisible walls here and there and the lack of freedom weighs heavily compared to the aforementioned LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, but it must be said that within these limits the developers have moved at their best, trying to insert all the ideas and you find them that came to mind. The Xbox 360 version, on which the review is based, sadly suffers from quite noticeable drops in frame-rate when the on-screen situation gets chaotic - issues that we doubt apply to the next-gen editions of the game. However, where the large number of characters, the dubbing and the gags succeed in making people forget the open world they longed for, the same cannot be said of other historical defects of the franchise, in particular the combat system, the artificial intelligence and everything that goes with it. If game over does not exist in LEGO Batman, it is also because the developers have not yet been able to create a combat system worthy of the name, with precise collision detection, a reliable targeting system and good impact performance. When the inevitable henchmen of this or that villain arrive on the screen, chaos reigns and you often end up hitting your teammates, in a context where ~slippery~ reigns supreme, especially if you put yourself at the controls of a fast and elusive character like Flash. In these situations, the focus is on the bigger heroes (the original form of Martian Manhunter, rather than the ~extended~ versions of Cyborg and Lex Luthor) simply to end the clash more quickly and prevent such shaky design choices from ruining the flavor of an experience which, despite its limitations and lack of originality, amuses and excites.", "date": "2014-11-18", "grade": "7.8"}
