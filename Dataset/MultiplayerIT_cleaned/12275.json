This time, however, Marvelous Interactive has decided to explore still uncultivated land, setting this new chapter of the saga, conceived and developed to best fit on the small Sony laptop, in a futuristic world where agriculture is now in crisis and the harvest festival threatens not to be held. Our young protagonist will save the fate of the rural tradition, wearing the clothes we are now used to under which, however, an unusual presence is hidden. With an inevitable parallel with Collodi's famous fairy tale, Pinocchio, we find ourselves in fact managing a robot created by a nice old man who can't help but remember the dear, naive Mastro Geppetto. The robot, in fact, with the obvious appearance of a boy, will acquire a series of attributes that will be raised in a similar way to the experience points of classic RPGs, even if automatically as days and levels pass, which will bring him ever closer to the longed-for humanity. And who knows that one morning, waking up, instead of finding new seedlings and fruits from our trees, we don't discover that we have become a real boy! Or at least as close as it is possible to get. But from time to time: to begin with, our father-creator, Dr. Hopes (look over there, hope always has a hand in it), will send us to the old ruins, where we will take up residence and begin our work of reclamation and cultivation. Why, you ask? Well, the answer lies in the loss of human beings' ability to cultivate the land and tend farms without the aid of electronic and robotic means, without modern technology, in short. And in this world now dissociated from forgotten traditional realities, a paradox will mark the passage of time: a robot that will recover its humanity by demonstrating that it can cultivate the land as a man would. Ruins to bring back to life The first phase of the game, once the initial introductory sequences that we will be able to enjoy once inserted our UMD inside the PSP, will accompany us in a sort of tutorial, through which we will be able to understand the controls and the structure of the game. Very simple structure, as characteristic of the series, which will see us carry out the usual tasks against an unusual background, but maintaining the characterizing substance of the life of Harvest Moon. In the ruins we will have a room to rest, a television through which to follow cooking lessons, weather forecasts and any other sort of useful indication for a good farmer/breeder which we want to become and, of course, the kitchen itself, through which to prepare dishes that, while not serving to feed a robot, will have the purpose of better understanding the emotions of a coveted humanity. And they will help grow our experience points, by the way. From there we will access the upper floor, a real cultivation terrace, where as usual we will have to clean the land of stones, weeds and wood to make it cultivable and therefore prepare the land to receive the seeds which, once watered and cared for, will produce flowers and vegetables. The products that we will obtain from the land can then be sold at the market of the neighboring town, where we will also be able to buy tools, seeds and all sorts of objects that can be useful for us to increase the level of our experience as a farmer. Caverns to explore The first hours of the game will be spent learning the basic dynamics, which will see us understand which seeds to plant for each season, how to take care of our plants and, last but not least, they will see us accumulate that base of money that will be indispensable for throwing the foundations of the future career as a breeder, which will have to go through the purchase of adequate structures in which to shelter our animals and then move on to the purchase of the animals themselves, the food with which to feed them and the tools with which to look after them. To support the traditional activities that the series presents to us, however, we will have a series of unpublished elements. The territory on which the game takes place is an island, which we will be able to explore in virtually every corner. Wandering around the area we will come across a series of small caves, scattered throughout the island, which at the beginning of the game will be sealed by a mysterious power. Later, thanks to the purchase of advanced tools, these mysterious crevices will become accessible thus sending us to the discovery of minerals and precious stones as well as various other mysteries. All this does nothing but increase an already proven playability of the title, motivating the player to take it up again with pleasure and carry it forward through further hours of play. These elements, side by sideto the characteristics given by the insertion of the parameters to increase of our character, represent a sure added value that make the title probably one of the most successful reinterpretations of a brand that certainly needed to be a little ~rejuvenated~. Unfortunately, however, it remains to be said that the implementation could have taken place in a slightly more detailed way, for example by leaving the player with the possibility of managing the growth of attribute points which cannot be assigned manually but increase automatically gradually that we proceed in experience. However, they remain extremely welcome and certainly allow for really good replay value. Comment A Futuristic Harvest Moon fits right in as one of the most successful episodes of the series, thanks also to an extremely pleasant graphic impact on the Sony laptop and to a nice and rich stylistic choice, with a futuristic character, which renew the brand. Technically the game is extremely usable, thanks to a simple and immediate command system, good loading times and an optimization of game times that allow us not to encounter dead times or frantic and frustrating races through the course of the day. The classic elements of the series have been enriched by RPG elements and a rich and well-structured background story. There are some uncertainties in the passage of the levels that can sometimes cause tired periods, as well as some implementations, such as the humanity growth system, could be made more manageable directly by the user. Despite these minor defects, it is certainly a must have for all fans of the series, and a great way for new users to get to know him. Pros Perfectly implemented classic and new elements Experience progression system Original story and settings Pleasant and friendly graphics Cons Experience points that cannot be managed by the user The game mechanics can be tiring Oh, my Goddess of the harvest... The Harvest Moon series has dominated, in recent years, among all those who like to undertake simulations of bucolic farm life. In fact, the series, which owes its name to the harvest moon, has its roots in an idyllic and fairy-tale world made up of fields to tend, animals to look after and simple social relationships to ripen, just like the fruits of the trees that we will plant in the our land. Elements, those just listed, which in real life have a weight and consistency that are anything but simple and idyllic but which, in the context created by Marvelous Interactive, are stripped of any load of effort and pain to present themselves to us in their best guise , the romantic one that only the frenetic life of the city man may wish to embrace. In this romantic vision we have been accustomed to rejoice in the fruits of our work, to dry the absolutely virtual sweat of our forehead after having spent the day breaking stones, cutting wood, plowing and watering the young seedlings, to finally dedicate ourselves to the courtship of our future bride, throw a ball at our dog and delight us with the spirits of the harvest and the relative, inevitable, Goddess of the same. The saga has unfolded over the years without ever losing this main characteristic and even with a series of variations on the theme, such as for example the ~for girls~ one of dubious significance, marking a fixed appointment with our farm, our field, the our world under the sky of good harvests.", "date": "2007-05-16", "grade": null}
