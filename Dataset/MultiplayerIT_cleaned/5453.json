The phenomenon does not only concern the large software houses with their multi-successful brands, but also small companies, ready to exploit the situation to give new vigor to their most popular products. This is the case of Deadlight, an atypical and interesting survival horror developed by the Spanish team Tequila Works, released in 2012 on Xbox 360 among the Summer of Arcade games. The title comes back to life, it is appropriate to say given the issues it addresses, four years later on the new consoles (and PC) thanks to Deadlight: Director's Cut, an edition which, however, we say it immediately, does not offer anything particularly sensational compared to the original, apart from an improved graphics, a new secondary mode and an extra difficulty level called Nightmare with an alternative ending. But let's proceed in order. Tequila Works takes us back to a Seattle devastated by a zombie epidemic also on PlayStation 4 The living and the dead The setting of Deadlight: Director's Cut is typical of dozens of successful films, TV series and novels with a post-apocalyptic and undead theme, from Romero's Zombies to The Walking Dead and Brooks' World War Z. We are in 1986 and for unknown causes, a mysterious and lethal epidemic spreads rapidly from Europe all over the world, reaching North America and Canada, from where the protagonist, a ranger named Randall Wayne, his wife Shannon and daughter Lydia. However, the latter are lost and the man ends up joining a group of survivors heading to Seattle, where a radio message claims to be the last safe stronghold of mankind, to try to survive and find his family members. The story of Deadlight: Director's Cut actually also has more ~dramatic~ moments, and is told through a series of interlude scenes animated in two dimensions or static like in a comic book, which are also the only way to see the protagonist otherwise almost always framed from the side and against the light, and through a series of written notes. It is therefore essential to explore each area properly to discover hidden ravines or secret rooms where you can retrieve information that adds to Randall's notes collected in his diary, which contains events and annotations useful for contextualizing what happened. As for the gameplay, that of Deadlight: Director's Cut is quite basic and all the chapters of the story are exactly the same as those of the previous edition: it is an atypical survival horror, at least as we understand it nowadays, whose mechanics , and not only those to tell the truth, bring to mind masterpieces of the past such as Flashback. The setting is completely two-dimensional and our hero is almost always armed with an ax and a couple of firearms with very little ammunition, to be used only in extreme cases. Most of the time, in fact, it is advisable to flee from the hordes of zombies, here called Shadows, who infest the levels rather than shoot at them, just as it is essential to think about solving environmental puzzles to overcome certain rooms. When it is not possible to do without them, of course, you have to go into violent action, shooting enemies in the head or decapitating them on the ground with an axe, while being careful not to get them too close to bite distance, given that the few points Randall's available lives are lost rather quickly. You can also play smart and take advantage of everything the setting has to offer. In this sense, the living dead can be attracted to a favorable point for eliminating them, such as for example an electrified puddle or an area above which huge crates hang to drop on them to crush them, attracting their attention with noises and whistles. However, you must always pay close attention to your stamina, an essential element for making the character perform any action, from moving an element of the scenario to taking a shot to escape enemies, and so on, perhaps to avoid finding him out of breath and energy in the most agitated situations. Playstation 4 trophies There are 33 Trophies made available by Deadlight: Director's Cut. These are divided into 14 Bronze, 13 Silver, 5 Gold and 1 Platinum and some can be obtained by progressing through the main adventure, completing it for example in Nightmare mode or recovering a certain type andnumber of objects, others in that Survival, surviving more than 13 minutes and 43 seconds, and so on. The world after man Like the original on Xbox 360 Deadlight: Director's Cut is not a difficult game to complete, at least on the difficulty level other than Nightmare, also because the checkpoints are almost always reborn at the place of death at full energy and without penalties of any kind. However, the level of challenge is not bad, and since the mechanics work quite well it is almost impossible not to get dragged into this desperate world full of pathos, perhaps relentlessly like in the old adventurous platformers of the past while trying to perform some jumps of precision to the last pixel. Therefore, to find a flaw in the production we need to talk about longevity: Wayne's desperate race as he runs through woods and cities devastated by an unstoppable horde of zombies lasts no more than five hours, and the introduction of an unprecedented mode called Survival is of little use . The latter, in fact, is none other than a sort of ~horde~ where you have to resist as much as possible to ever more numerous waves of undead, knocking them down and moving from room to room inside a hospital. All by exploiting both conventional weapons such as a machine gun, Molotov cocktails and a sniper rifle, and what the surrounding environment offers to create defenses or to eliminate threats. The time taken to survive the assaults is then counted and recorded in a special ranking. In short, a mode in our opinion that adds nothing effective to the gaming experience or to its duration, if not minimally, and which ends up getting boring after a while. Moving on to the technological part, one of the most successful aspects of Deadlight was certainly the graphic style adopted by the developers, which made the most of the management of the lights to recreate disturbing and sinister settings. From this point of view, a better enhancement of the lighting system of the play areas, combined with the higher 1080p resolution guaranteed by PlayStation 4, in this Director's Cut version restore to the view of the observer more defined scenarios, truly atmospheric and well detailed despite the two-dimensional structure, with dreamlike lights and effective chiaroscuro effects, structures that fall apart, believable liquids and good animations. The cleanliness of the image is remarkable, as are the particles and the volumetric effects of smoke and fog, mainly responsible for the technical leap forward in the production, considering the low importance of the polygonal models of the protagonist and supporting actors. In short, it is difficult to remain indifferent to what appears on the screen, just as it is difficult to remain insensitive to the sound effects and music, which are really spot on and suited to the context, like the dubbing with English voices (the title is completely subtitled in Italian).", "date": "2016-06-21", "grade": "8.0"}
