{"name": "Feel The Magic XY/XX (Project Rub)", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/feel-the-magic-xyxx-project-rub.html", "text": "I feel a strength inside that I don't even know how Feel The Magic XY/XX (Project Rub in Europe) bases its bizarre gameplay on this equally bizarre hint of storyline: in the role of a young bearded man, the player must face a whole series of mini-games whose completion leads to an ever greater interest of the coveted female prey towards him. Vaguely similar to Wario Ware in terms of concept, the Sega title actually differs from the Nintendo jewel both in the more story-driven nature of the gaming experience, and in the quantity and characteristics of the mini-games of which it is composed. Where in Wario Ware, in fact, the gameplay rested on a large number of micro-stages lasting a handful of seconds in which quick reflexes were the masters, in Feel The Magic XY/XX the matter is different: the various levels of the game require at least a couple of minutes to be completed through the progressive steps of difficulty required, and above all they must be tackled by exploiting the peculiar characteristics of the Nintendo DS touch screen. Armed with a stylus, the user is called to interact with the lower screen of the console in order to successfully pass the various tests, all extremely original and conceptually of a truly remarkable insanity. It therefore happens that we have to repel the attacks of a herd of angry bulls by tapping on them with the nib, or to direct our hero with a firm hand as he crosses the narrow walkways aboard a unicycle, or even to help him in coloring some graffiti. And these are just examples of the variety that characterizes the Sega title, made up of 30 of these bizarre mini-games, not always exciting in terms of quality but in any case never banal or repetitive. So much so that in some stages the user is even asked to blow on the touch screen (in order to blow out candles or to inflate the sails of a boat and so on) or to use the microphone of the console, producing verses and shouts which we would advise against performing in public. A world of silhouettes As mentioned, the goal in Feel The Magic XY/XX is to conquer the girl of your dreams by surprising her with the stunts object of the various mini-games: for this reason, at regular intervals, the user is given the opportunity to approach the damsel in question to engage in activities aimed at making her more and more in love with her. These special internships require the filling of the love indicator through the satisfaction of some needs of the girl: it is therefore necessary to clean her lovingly from mud stains, or gently shake her hand while at the same time removing annoying bees from her, or even help her to unbutton the wet dress... all of this of course always making a particular use of the nib, tapping or rubbing as the case may be. There are also some ~fights~ with unlikely bosses, always in the name of the most absolute insanity. As fun and bizarre as it is, Feel The Magic XY/XX has a major limitation, represented by longevity and replay value: completing all the mini-games in Story Mode takes very little time, and after doing so you can't find great incentives to face at will the same in the appropriate Memories mode. In short, the internships of the Sega title fascinate at the first session, but immediately tend to lose their charm, victims of a simplicity that in Wario Ware was excellently compensated for by a syncopated rhythm, which does not happen here. All in all, however, Feel The Magic XY/XX is an intelligent and interesting title, also thanks to its particular, very pleasant, cosmetics: a few colors (white, black, blue and orange in particular) and characters made up exclusively of silhouettes make the product Sega as stylish as it is functional and pleasant. Finally, in terms of sound, there is a tendency towards minimalism both in the music and in the effects which certainly goes hand in hand with the graphic style of the game, but which in the long run can be boring. Comment One of the launch titles available for the Nintendo DS, Feel The Magic XY/XX is everything and the opposite of everything you can expect from a launch title. If on the one hand, therefore, the Sega title fulfills its duty perfectly by making the most of the technical characteristics of the new console, on the other it presents a decidedly unconventional graphic style and game structure and for this reason perhaps not attractive to anyone. As funny and insane as it is short-lived and sometimes irritating, Feel The Magic XY/XX is an atypical product, which however could be a good purchase both considering the shortage of software currently availablecurrently for DS, and by virtue of its full exploitation of the innovative features of the Nintendo handheld. Pros: Original and fun Attractive graphic style Clever use of the touch screen Cons: Minimal longevity Some underwhelming minigames Relatively poor replay value Imagine finding yourself on the street, on a day like any other. At one point, in the crowd, you spot a beautiful girl: you fall in love with her immediately, and you decide that she must be yours at any cost. What to do? Forget trivial pretexts or clumsy attempts at an approach; from today, to conquer the woman of your dreams, you need to perform daring stunts with the help of a group of stuntmen wearing bunny hats", "date": "2004-12-16", "grade": null}
