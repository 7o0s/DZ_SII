Now where the cryOf our famous ancestors, and the great empireOf that Rome and the arms and the roarWhat went over the earth and the ocean?...Forgive us if we start talking about a game starting from Leopardi, but from somewhere it was necessary to leave. For the uninitiated Imperivm RTC: The Punic Wars is an apparently very classic real-time strategy game. Right from the start there is a justified sense of deja vu given that the game uses the non-exciting graphics engine of Celtic Kings: Rage of War (of which it is the sequel). As the subtitle clearly suggests, the historical nucleus around which the game develops are the well-known wars between Rome and Carthage, which led the Eternal City to dominate the Mediterranean. These will be the background to the two campaigns that can be tackled: in one we will be on the side of the Romans, in the other we will have to play the role of the Carthaginians. Each of the campaigns is made up of 5 missions for a total of 10. Don't be frightened by these apparently very low numbers: Imperivm is structured in such a way as to make each mission last more than a few hours and, especially the final maps, it will be a long time before to be able to complete them. Once the campaigns are finished, however, you will be able to face numerous single maps or take part in exciting multiplayer games. If even this weren't enough to make you understand how high the longevity of this game is, then know that you can indulge yourself with the included editor to create your own maps and customized campaigns. The clang of weapons From the first game sessions it is clear how Imperivm manages to be strategically deep. The first approach was that of almost all strategic games: understanding the control system, understanding the most useful troops available and starting the attack after carefully evaluating if there were enough men to rout the enemy (of the system of finding resources will be discussed in the next paragraph). The result was disastrous. If you expect to be able to handle this title as you did with all the other RTS then you are very wrong: here almost every action must be carefully thought out and it will not be only the number of troops that determine the outcome of a battle. So forget to roll simply on a mammoth army with which to crush the opponents (also because it is not a very simple operation). It is amazing to see how the A.I. of the game you seem to ~think~ about our moves: with accumulations of troops in various places to subsequently launch simultaneous attacks, with moving objectives in progress and with real strategic retreats aimed at discovering some locations that will subsequently and inexorably be attacked by other armies  in short, underestimating the adversary would be a terrible mistake. Moreover, the troops to be used to attack the opposing army without suffering too large losses should also be considered. Every wrong move is paid for in terms of heavy risks for the stability of our possessions: the rival populations are ruthless and ruthlessly rage on our mistakes. The clang of weapons Real Time Conquest But let's get to the resource retrieval system which is boasted as the real hallmark of the title. The RTC (Real Time Conquest) is something very simple to explain: on each map there are a certain number of resources (villages, forts, ports, cities, etc.) that we will literally have to conquer in order to exploit their benefits. No, it will not be possible to build practically anything from 0 except new troops in case we come into possession of a city capable of producing them. Each resource will be precious and will have to be taken with weapons... the problem, however, will not be appropriating them; the problem will be to defend what has been won. The already described AI that moves our enemies will always attack the least defended resources in order to destabilize our trade and the growth of our power. Organizing an effective defense will then be not only necessary but essential. It is here that Imperivm shows all its class, showing itself as a true strategy title that does not allow simple rushes: before getting hold of some key objectives, you risk having to make many attempts, arriving to understand that enemies cannot be destroyed in one only once but they must be exhausted continuously, systematically but thoughtfully and, to be honest, also slowly. Moreover, it is not easy to understand how to invest resourcesand given that, at least initially, making a mistake in the production of a certain type of troop (which perhaps will prove to be unsuitable to face the opposing armies) could mean immediate defeat. Real Time Conquest Comment Imperivm is not only convincing: it is a real surprise. It will be that it is a complex title (even if the excessive difficulty can be considered a defect by some), it will be that the slightly retro graphics don't bother you... it will be that we had a lot of fun playing this title over the several days . Sure, for the masterpiece crown we lack a little more innovation and the ambition to overcome the limits reached by other titles of the genre, but summing up we are faced with an excellent title that gets half a point more even by virtue of the price and packaging.&nbsp; Pros: Addictive You will spend hours on it Very good enemy artificial intelligence Cons: Difficult for novices Graphically dated Few missions in the campaigns The Strange Case of the FX Interactive Lab Perhaps it would be appropriate to talk about the game immediately and leave out the details that I am about to ~tell you~. The truth is that, on the other hand, a few words about FX Interactive really need to be spent. In the package there is a very detailed color manual and, rare case, useful for starting to play: it is well translated and designed for the inexperienced user ... give it one browse immediately disposes very well. Let's not talk about the quality of the paper. But it doesn't end there. In the same package there is a color strategic map which illustrates the various missions of the two campaigns present in the game, which are as many central historical moments of the Punic Wars... obviously the paper on which it is printed is of excellent quality (a glossy cardboard that immediately found its place on the walls of the bedroom). And it doesn't end there. Just to overdo it, in the package there is also a small handbook, always in color and always printed on excellent quality paper, which illustrates and explains the concept of Real Time Conquest (the RTC in the title) and which summarizes the various phases in which this develops. Given all this goodness, some recent packagings have come to mind in which I have found little detailed black and white manuals and that's it. On the contrary: it's already been a long time since there is a manual in some games. But going forward there is still something to say. As soon as I started the game I was able to appreciate the excellent localization in Italian (both written and spoken) with voices dubbed by real professionals (the dubbing house is Jingle Bells). At this point, some localizations came to my mind, even recent ones, which pale in front of this The beauty is that these titles are sold for around 50 Imperivm is sold for 19.90 (also in Multiplayer Shopping).", "date": "2004-04-04", "grade": null}
