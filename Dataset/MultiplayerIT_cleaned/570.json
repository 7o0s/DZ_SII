{"name": "Catopia: Rush", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/catopia-rush-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Catopia: Rush catapults us into a bizarre fantasy world where heroic warrior cats face the forces of evil using magic or wielding the sword. A potentially explosive mix, as the developers of Supercolony are well aware, who have characterized their game in a very clear way. In fact, we are talking about an action RPG in the style of a twin stick shooter with a campaign currently made up of six scenarios (to which more will be added others), each divided into various stages in which we will have to face enemies of various kinds, increasingly stronger and more numerous, as well as huge bosses to be hit with our spells (and with the attacks of the support units) while avoiding suffering excessive damage. Gameplay Catopia: Rush, the Phoenix Flames are our character's special attack. Using a strictly portrait mode view, the gameplay of Catopia: Rush will see us move from one stage to another, from one arena to another, with the aim of eliminating more numerous or more dangerous opponents each time. The mechanics are extremely simple: using a repositionable virtual stick we will be able to move our character, who will automatically attack the closest target when we stop. more resistant enemies or destroy the small hordes before they touch us, and which must be ~dragged~ on the screen in the direction in which we want to launch it: a maneuver with a great strategic weight, which can make the difference between victory and defeat in the more advanced levels. Catopia: Rush, a fire-based combat sequence. The only big problem of Catopia: Rush unfortunately lies precisely in the controls, which cannot be adjusted (except through an option to ~mirror~ them horizontally) and turn out to be not precise and responsive enough right from the start to allow us to avoid all the bullets that will rain down on us in the most agitated phases of the campaign. Furthermore, as they are set up, the controls tend to cover the view excessively and therefore constitute an obstacle. These are important limits, certainly solvable through updates but for the moment concretely present in the experience, which is considerably weighed down. Structure Catopia: Rush, one of the campaign boss fights. Net of the drawbacks just described, Catopia: Rush boasts a good number of contents and a solid progression system, albeit of a traditional nature. With the coins and objects obtained by completing the various missions we will be able to upgrade our character, level him up, improve his skills and of course unlock new support units.The latter are nothing more than extra characters, cats too, who go to support our actions by attacking enemies in various ways, from distance or melee, and restoring the energy of the party. Given the importance of these supporting actors, they can only be recruited with hard currency or by paying with real money, perhaps considering the idea of buying the Super Pass. Technical realization From the point of view of the graphics there is little to discuss: the developers of Catopia: Rush have fielded a really nice design for the cats who are the protagonists of the adventure, divided into well-differentiated types, with very nice features and a tendency to make you smile. The aesthetics of the monsters that we will face are less brilliant, while the bosses are still quite varied and interesting. Too bad more than anything for the sound sector, which does not hit the target by accompanying the action with themes that in our opinion are not very appropriate.", "date": "2021-06-09", "grade": "7.4"}
