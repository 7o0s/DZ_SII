City Interactive's first-person shooter has several very interesting features on its side. First of all, the setting: World War II, and moreover little-beaten battlefields like occupied Poland, but also Norway, France and Germany. The gameplay is not the usual Call of Duty ~binary~, but a mixture of very large maps, often linked to each other, in which the great freedom of movement makes us choose between a ~caciarone~ and stealth approach. And finally there is the graphics engine, the CryENGINE 3, of which we all know its versatility and above all its detail and power. A mix therefore decidedly interesting, but the final result is unfortunately disheartening. Enemy Front betrays its promises: it's a Caporetto across the board artificial deficiency The story is entirely functional to get us around Europe. We are Robert Hawkins, an American journalist who from a simple hack will become a partisan, protagonist of operations behind the Nazi lines together with the Resistance. Little more than an excuse, therefore: one more reason to skip the terrible explanations between one level and another, then plagued by a compression of the videos that takes us back several years, in a riot of artifacts and mega blocks. But pad in hand, how does Enemy Front's ~open~ gameplay work? Normally we will have two types of levels: small maps, designed in any case to give us more possibilities for action, and real large settings with primary and (optional) secondary objectives that open slowly, which amplify what was written just above in occasion of the first type of levels. Stealth is often required in sections where the game imposes this path on us, but we can always ~tag~ enemies with binoculars and divert them by throwing a stone. In this sense, the work of City Interactive is good; there's always a way to flank a target, to get close and sneak up on your opponents, and above all there are always strategically placed explosive barrels to massacre Nazis. Too bad, however, that everything is canceled in the face of a series of serious problems involving all sectors of the game. The artificial intelligence is as acute (in a fraudulent way, however...) as scripted in a pedestrian way. Thanks to a graphic detail that cannot be lowered, we will often be prey to infallible snipers with a bionic eye who target us from very far away, indistinguishable when ~tone on tone~ on the seabed. In the same way, several times we have been victims of sudden spawns behind us in places where, strictly speaking, there should have been no one. The hardest game in the world then? In no way. Except for reasons of blindness, we can often run desperately towards the next goal, skipping entire portions of the scenario at the foot, or even worse, take advantage of the macroscopic weaknesses of artificial intelligence. We are stuck in a dugout and for obvious reasons do not see who is shooting at us? Just wait for the Nazis to compete to position themselves diligently in single file in our visual cone to kill them one by one, perhaps with a sniper rifle, with mechanics taken from the ~family~ ones of Sniper Ghost Warrior. And as if that weren't enough we witnessed undeterred opponents, one after the other, taking up positions in the same ~non-cover~, for yet another pigeon shooting. So much for the superior race! To these stupid behaviors are also added races to areas where there is no one and various amenities. It's a real shame that there are such problems because the airy level design, and potentially richer gameplay than that of the Activision canon, could have made Enemy Front a very enjoyable and decidedly interesting title, especially in a period like this in which the releases for the consoles of the past generation are now reduced to a flicker. Playstation 3 trophies Enemy Front rewards the player with 46 trophies, both in the campaign and in multiplayer. They are obtained by completing all the missions, but also by doing particular actions, also taking advantage of the game's stealth approach and all the various types of weapons available. Nothing particularly difficult, however. I do not see anything... Unfortunately, however, the problems do not end here, and the picture is undoubtedly disheartening: over and over again we had to reload the save (with the relative sequence of curses for very distant checkpoints) due to bugs that blocked us, preventing us from moving, or for enemies killed but remaining in vita on the map, making it impossible to access the next section. In short, a disaster. Visually, the PlayStation 3 version is characterized by very few highs and a long list of lows that take us back to the early years of the console, in which the CryENGINE, save for some bloom effects, is frankly unrecognizable. We have already written about the low detail so as to make everything an often indefinite hodgepodge from afar, but to this we must add a dancer frame rate, poor textures and a blur effect that opacifies everything even more. Not forgetting the copious aliasing, numerous graphical glitches with textures that appear and disappear, lighting in closed environments that often ~turns on~ late and giant bitmaps that often peep out in the backgrounds. Even the audio then puts its own into it, with the explosions of the weapons that sometimes don't ~play~ when pressing R2. In short, it is a pity here too because the levels are rich in terms of setting, especially the urban ones, but they collapse miserably in the face of a very realistically hastily closed technical realization, for some truly unpresentable today on PlayStation 3.", "date": "2014-06-24", "grade": "3.0"}
