Diamond Digger Saga, available in the traditional freemium format, therefore downloadable for free from the App Store and Google Play, is no exception, while trying to offer a slightly different interpretation. In the one hundred and ninety stages that currently make up the single player campaign, and which will invariably increase with the next updates, our goal is in fact to score a certain number of points, free nymphs or toys from their stone prisons or simply pass a course of water through the subsoil, going to destroy the obstacles through the expedient of the diamonds of the same color that are stationed above them, until a path is built towards the point where the water must flow out. A structure that includes different sections for each single stage, to be completed using a limited number of moves, but which, if necessary, can be increased through the use of gold bars, the precious currency of the game. Our progress is highlighted on the usual map in stages, in which it is also possible to view the results of all friends on Facebook who use the same application (also available in browser format on the social network) and piss them off to ask for an extra life or unlocking a new area. Speaking of lives, the system to which Diamond Digger Saga refers is the usual, fairly balanced and without excessive limitations: if we win we will be able to continue the game indefinitely, but our five lives will be consumed with each game over and we will have to wait thirty minutes for each of them to be restored. Diamond Digger Saga is a pleasant and long-lasting match-3 puzzle game, but too similar to many others Rough diamond The gameplay of Diamond Digger Saga works in a very simple way, since you just need to touch the groupings formed by three or more diamonds to eliminate them and cause the corresponding stones to crumble, thus leading to the descent of other elements from above. Once the obstacles have been destroyed, the flow of water follows the force of gravity to reach the bottom of the screen, within the path we have created, until it reaches the outlet to the next area. However, there are aspects that from the early stages are a bit controversial. Firstly, the levels in which the initial composition of the blocks is essential for success, given the few moves available, harbingers of a luck factor that does not go well with the freemium connotation of the game. Of course, there are some ~special moves~ that we can use to achieve the most complicated objectives, or the free ~smart bomb~ that loads every certain number of eliminations and which allows you to explode all the diamonds of a certain color, but the sensation is that even irreproachable conduct is not enough to guarantee victory in every situation. However, it is above all the sensation of ~already seen~ that penalizes the experience: match-3 is used in a slightly different way than usual, let's say indirectly with respect to what we see on the screen, as if there were two superimposed layers, but this is not enough to prevent a fan of King titles from quickly getting bored due to the lack of real novelty. The keys to collect, the harder blocks to gradually crumble and the frozen ones boost the variety of the action, but in such a saturated market, with such fierce opponents (and often made by the same team), this is not enough to stand out . Let's also add an average technical realization, with poorly guessed music, unable to stay in the head, and here is the picture of a pleasant but far from unmissable puzzle game.", "date": "2014-10-25", "grade": "6.7"}
