{"name": "Two Worlds - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/two-worlds-recensione-2.html", "text": "Yet another unsung hero Most of the RPGs released so far all have a big logical deficiency: in this Two Worlds we will play the role of a rude bounty hunter, who arrived in the Antaloor moors not to save the world, but only to bring out his sister (very pretty) who just happened to get involved in something big. As a side dish, the southern part of the continent has been invaded by warmongering Orcs, who for the first time have been brought together under the leadership of a charismatic but unknown Messiah: you, like it or not, will find yourself not only having to bring home the fur , yours and that of your little sister, but while you're at it you will also save the world from the new, repetitive and imminent catastrophe. However, the plot conceived by the creatives of Reality Pump, although it may seem like the usual heated minestrone, is actually unraveled in the best way, without ever falling into absurd twists and turns, but carefully pondering every single narrative element: it will never seem of fulfilling the classic ~go to A, do missions, get the reward~ system, but you will quickly be captivated by the vast world available. We do not hide from you that, at the beginning, we started off a bit biased: the similarity with Gothic 3 is absolutely evident, even just for the appearance of our alter ego, and for the omnipresent presence of the Orcs. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find that Two Words manages to distance itself from its competitors, showing its own refined personality and there is no risk of spoiling anything by stating that one world was not enough for developers, but that there are even two arrangement, hence the title of the game. A graphic of ups and downs The most painful aspect of the entire game, unfortunately, is also one of the most evident: the graphics. Despite having promised marvels in the preview phase, in fact Two Worlds presents a decidedly fluctuating engine, simultaneously offering glimpses and breathtaking views, with a particularly realistic rendering of the water, mixed with low-resolution textures and decidedly visual effects poor quality, which necessarily reduce our evaluation. If we can somehow overlook the poverty of some textures and the decidedly unstable framerate (from 20 to 60 fps depending on the situation), even the most inexperienced user cannot fail to notice that some of the animations are decidedly approximate. A graphic of ups and downs It may seem a contradiction, since the animations themselves were taken using the motion capture technique, but the final result leaves something to be desired to say the least: the character moves with a style that is not exactly nice to see, and the same can be said of the opponents; if we add to this that the animations for each action, especially in combat, are counted on one hand, it is easy to understand how the whole atmosphere is irreparably compromised; the sensation is that of excessively noticing the detachment from a single animation to another, a particularly unpleasant effect when repetitive sequences such as running or fighting are performed. However, despite being light years away from the amazing graphics of Oblivion, the aesthetic aspect will quickly fade into the background: after a few hours of play you will be used to these shortcomings, and you will be inexorably captured by the adventure packed by the creatives of Reality Pump and its background. Note, however, that Two Worlds uses HDR extensively to simulate the phenomenon of glare (as well as on many of the surfaces in the game); however, although this setting can be customized from the options menu, it is not advisable to change the default setting: you risk finding yourself in front of blinding torches, capable of producing a decidedly excessive glow. Duels and battles In Two Worlds some of the arrows shot reach the target, as happens for combat: it is useless to hide it, you will spend a good part of the time exploring the map and mauling your enemies, either with the mace or with the magical arts: this will happen with a such a frequency that you will almost seem to be in front of a Diablo-style Hack n' Slash rather than a role-playing game in the pure sense of the term. The map, just mentioned, has been poorly implemented as it does not have a progressive zoom but only 3 selectable levels by pressing the right analog button. One view is very close, one medium and the other of the entire world of Two Worlds. Furthermore, this is an element that must be kept constantly on hand throughout the game, and the difficulty of understanding each time where we are andexactly, or the search for the right direction. A pity, since this problem would have been solved simply by giving the player the possibility to manage the ~camera~ of the map in a free way. however, despite being light years away from the amazing graphics of Oblivion, the aesthetic aspect will quickly fade into the background Duels and battles The combat system, which disappointed so much in Gothic 3, in the Reality Pump title is very well structured: to the eye of the superficial player it might seem that it is enough to furiously press the attack button to get the better of any fight, following the 'the faster I click, the more damage I do' axiom. Initially, we too fell for it, completely ignoring the strategies offered by the developers: if instead you have the patience to learn the most hidden secrets of combat, you discover that the character is not only able to automatically block opponents' blows (in percentage to the skill, of course), but also to resort to dirty tricks such as throwing sand in the eyes to gain a few useful seconds, or burning the opponent's face with a torch. Duels and battles The good thought of the developers was the introduction of a macro system that can be activated by pressing the analog cross which shows all the actions that can be performed by the character, which automatically changes according to the different needs: by pulling out the sword all the special attacks will be made available learned, while putting it away you will be able to choose from other possibilities, such as moving silently or placing traps, greatly simplifying the choice of which actions to perform. So it goes without saying that, having a little more patience, the fights will become much more engaging, adding a small touch of strategy that will allow you to get the better of even much stronger enemies (the dodge backwards is very useful), obviously without ever fall into the absurd (a farmer, armed only with his fists, will never kill an armored knight), which instead happened in the competitor produced by Piranha Bytes. Riding a hill at sunset is priceless. If the combat turns out to be much deeper than one might imagine, the same can be said of the general level of the gameplay: perhaps taken from an excess of zeal, the programmers of Pump Reality have pushed on the level of difficulty of the game, especially at lower; a striking example is represented by the first bandits armed with bows and arrows who with a single shot will be able to send us to game over, with no possibility of defending ourselves. Unlike what happened in the other RPGs, if the life bar is reduced to zero you are not forced to reload the last save, but the game will bring you back to the nearest Altar of Rebirth (high-sounding name to indicate a respawn point) where the The alter ego will be reborn with full energy and as if nothing had happened, without suffering any penalty. It is clearly a ploy used by the developers to make the game less frustrating, especially in a ~console~ key. However, we don't feel like penalizing this choice excessively: if at the beginning you find yourself cursing the game too often, as soon as the character acquires a few levels, he begins to gain the upper hand, bringing just as much satisfaction that will reward all the times that a bald and harmless wolf cub had brought us to game over. Compared to the first PC version, the mounted combat system has been refined and improved. If on the computer, before the 1.5 patch, our trusty equine fluttered everywhere and got stuck between stones and camp tents, in the 360 version the behavior is decidedly more realistic and less problematic. Riding a hill at sunset is priceless. The programmers, incredible to say, have also thought of implementing the horses not only to facilitate movement, but also to use them as an attack ~platform~, launching deadly blows against the enemies. On paper it is, without a doubt, something that was missing in all previous RPGs, but unfortunately it was made in a little depth, in addition to being very difficult to hit something while running, it will be very difficult to tame the steed and make it move effectively among enemies in battle. Once on the saddle, the horse is not commanded directly but orders are given to it which it executes accordingly. A realistic control system, but less functional for use in duels. Our advice therefore remains to use the quadruped only to move on flat stretches or for long distances. Sby dropping the horse to a certain point, it will remain there until the return. As well as all the inventory items that we will abandon on the ground. A decidedly permissive Rpg It must be said that Two Worlds represents one of those titles that no editor would like to review: the continuous ups and downs, typical of the Reality Pump title, make it extremely difficult to formulate an objective evaluation; if free roaming is undermined by a few too many bugs in moving around, one can only be favorably impressed by the developers' choice to introduce different factions into the game, which will force you to think about which side to side with (two or more) and many of the quests that confront each other will lead to repercussions, both favorable and negative, for one rather than the other. The concept, while not new, is undoubtedly very well integrated with the gameplay. A greater reputation will bring considerable benefits, which will grow with the increase of the same; initially we will talk about simple discounts on items for sale, but progressing will also lead to unlocking new customized weapons and armor, as well as obtaining the support of guild members. The choice not to limit the expenditure of experience points is also particularly apt. During the game you will encounter sanctuaries that allow, upon payment, to modify the PE spent on certain attributes, making them available again to enhance other skills with a choice that differs considerably from the classic RPG conception, but which allows greater malleability of the character. The other absolutely positive aspect is represented by the variety of quests and the freedom of choice that the developers have left; in addition to having to deal with investigative and exploratory missions, which differ from the usual ~go and kill the target~, many of these can be solved with different approaches, all equally valid, and ended by choosing which faction to prefer. It may happen that a quest, assigned by a member of a guild, requires you to deliver a package of vital importance to a subject; you are free to choose whether to deliver it, fulfilling the assignment, or sell it to the competing faction, perhaps obtaining a discreet monetary gain, but a considerable loss of respect with the original employer. Two Worlds Multiplayer Continuing with the ups and downs, here comes another negative point: multiplayer. Essentially, by accessing Xbox Live, you can choose two modes: a cooperative one, where you will face a series of quests with other players, but still tying free roaming to small well-defined areas, and one called Arena, for those who instead want to face other players in a terrifying version of Capture The Flag or Team Deathmatch. The ideas, like all those in the title, are potentially excellent, but are poorly implemented. In addition to suffering from significant problems of a technical nature, such as a particularly pronounced lag, the idea of tackling quests based on teamwork with other people in the flesh could be gratifying, if it weren't for the fact that unfortunately the same ones recur in reality problems of the single player campaign, i.e. excessive movements of the enemies, accentuated by the lag due to the connection, which make it particularly difficult to be able to hit an opponent, both with weapons and with spells. The character classes are eight in the multiplayer mode and the hero you create cannot be used in any other way except in the cooperative or in the arena. Carrying out a single player adventure is definitely challenging, carrying out two is twice as much. With the next patch, coming soon, the developer promises to fix lag and framerate issues, a top priority according to their statements. Goals 360 Two Worlds, like any Xbox 360 game, can unlock up to 1000 points. There are no particularly difficult objectives to obtain: the first 150 points will come very naturally with the first hours of the game, simply by leveling up, creating spells, traps or potions, or with basic actions such as riding for the first time. Defeating the final enemy ~gives away~ almost a quarter of the prize pool, while the rest will be obtained as you level up, up to the maximum which is 50. However, it takes a lot of dedication to bring home all the loot. Comment In the end, the guys at Reality Pump managed to churn out an excellent game, dispelling any doubts that arose during the preview phase. Two Worlds presents continuous ups and downs, but fortunately the positive aspects clearly outweigh the negative ones: an aesthetic aspect", "date": "2007-09-06", "grade": null}
