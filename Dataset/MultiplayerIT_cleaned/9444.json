{"name": "Blockbuster in caduta libera", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/85714-the-blocks-cometh-blockbuster-in-caduta-libera.html", "text": "Developed by the Halfbot team, The Blocks Cometh is yet another application for iPhone and iPod Touch that steals the idea from other games, which in turn have stolen the idea from some unknown title hidden in the depths of some Flash game portal . Assuming that, after all, the origin of an idea is not as interesting as the way in which it is implemented, the title in question was born as a webgame inspired by the excellent The Incident, a simple and fun arcade in which the aim of the player is to push himself higher and higher by climbing objects that fall over his head, obviously avoiding being crushed. Although the substance remains more or less identical to the original, the iPhone version of The Blocks Cometh tries to offer an experience with more bite thanks to some improvements, unlockable extras and nice crossovers. Jumping mess Although the basic mechanics are the same as that seen in The Incident, the fact that the objects are square and rectangular blocks represents an obvious difference also in terms of gameplay. In fact, in Big Bucket Software's game, the free-falling junk had irregular shapes and could be freely moved, giving the player a margin of permissiveness in their movements. From this point of view, The Blocks Cometh is very reminiscent of one of the mini-games seen in Tetris Party: once a block has fallen it is no longer possible to move it, while the player is forced to think about each jump and movement to avoid following a path complicated or, even worse, to get stuck under blocks. The possibility of carrying out attacks to destroy obstacles enriches each game with a good strategic component. Eliminating excess blocks soon becomes a priority, although scrolling up the level forces the player not to get too carried away and still leave behind some blocks to jump on. Thus we end up building real steps, and the ascent becomes much more difficult than in other similar games. Unfortunately it must be said that the only mode present is rather incapable of keeping you glued for too long: a single scenario that is always identical, a single level of difficulty and almost no attempt to add a little spice to the game are elements that risk leading to boredom in record time, although the unlockable achievements and secret characters still represent an almost discreet incentive. By completing various tasks, such as reaching a certain height, destroying a certain number of blocks or scoring records without attacking, it is possible to unlock and use four additional characters, each of which with particular characteristics: some jump higher , those who double jump and those who attack from a distance, while those who have played League of Evil will recognize a couple of nice and perfectly fitting cameos. Perfect especially because, needless to do it on purpose, the two titles are very similar in style and graphics: The Blocks Cometh features extremely simple sprites and backdrops but with a pleasant retro taste, consistently accompanied by excellent chiptune music by the duo of Irish guys behind the HyperDuck label. However, if we exclude the obvious lack of variety, the legs of The Blocks Cometh are sawn off by a decidedly uncomfortable control system, which forces the player to hold the device in an upright position and to fight with the on-screen keys that are all too small . The result, especially at the beginning, leads to a series of defeats and completely involuntary Game Over, and it wouldn't be bad if the developers gave the possibility to move the keys freely on the screen. The only alternative is to choose the accelerometer as a control system, moving left or right by swinging the device, but given the sometimes millimeter precision required by jumps, this is certainly not the most suitable solution.
