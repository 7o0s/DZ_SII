{"name": "Diamond Twister", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/diamond-twister.html", "text": "Bejeweled has proved to be one of the most important puzzle games of recent years, giving life to a real genre of its own; its game mechanics has in fact been adopted and really exploited by a lot of similar products, proving to be especially popular within the videogames market for mobile phones. In confirmation of this statement we can in fact include, as the last exponent of this long list, also the here present Diamond Twister of the always prolific Gameloft. And in a sort of return to the original, after fruits, animals, objects of various kinds and so on and so forth, we return to talking about jewellery; yes because the useless plot that binds the various levels sees the player visit various characters scattered around the world, in order to steal precious stones of great value from them. All this through various stages within which the main objective is to reach a pre-established sum, obviously through the alignment of 3 or more gems of the same type. But evidently for the programmers it was all too simple, and in fact they have well thought of adding a time limit, however rather narrow, within which it is necessary to complete the mission, otherwise the sad game over will appear. Obviously there is no shortage of bonuses and real special stones, with which to multiply the score, eliminate an entire line or even wipe out all the jewels of the same type from the screen. The result of this amalgam is a product that is truly devoid of originality, but which, precisely because it rests on a tested mechanic to say the least, proves capable of stimulating and pushing you to play one game after another. Too bad that the component of fate, or simply the initial arrangement of the gems, can often prove to be an all too important factor; it may happen that you are unable to pass a level, only to pass it without problems on the second attempt precisely because the moves were more fortunate. However, in Diamond Twister applause should undoubtedly be given to Gameloft for having slipped as many as 8 different game modes, which go alongside that of the story mode, thus guaranteeing a good overall variety to the product. However, there is a lack of a backbone, a common thread or in any case a more articulated structure of the missions; as it is, Diamond Twister appears as a product with little depth, ideal for a game on the fly in free moments but unable to leave a mark. Similar speech for the technical, functional and pleasant component both in graphics and in sound but nothing more. PRO Proven game mechanics Good variety in the modes present Basically fun AGAINST Really nothing new under the sun Recycling of gameplay already seen A valid backbone is missing", "date": "2008-01-22", "grade": "S.V."}
