When the first information about a chapter in the Prince of Persia series for Wii began to leak, many hoped for a completely new game built around the capabilities of the wiimote. The disappointment was therefore understandable once it was discovered that Rival Sword, this is its name, was nothing more than a direct porting of The Two Thrones; for this reason we prefer to refer you to our review for the description of the plot and characters, thus limiting ourselves to taking into consideration the innovations offered by this edition, which concern exclusively around the control system. In reality Ubisoft has preferred not to overdo it with regard to the implementation of movement detection, leaving most of the moves to remain linked to the use of simple keys, as well as originally. From this point of view, the control of the prince therefore occurs naturally for anyone who is a little familiar with the ~classic~ pads, and the location of the buttons between the nunchuck and the wiimote is good enough to allow everything to go smoothly without particular problems. Only for actions related to keys 1 and 2, such as for changing view, it is necessary to move the controller grip in the hand; a little annoying, sure, but nothing particularly dramatic. Instead, where the programmers have decided to change something is in the combat system, which requires the movement of both hands to give life to the various combos available. Unfortunately, as often happens with Wii conversions, the result is not such as to make this solution preferable to the one offered by the original versions for other consoles; you never have the sensation of having total control of the situation, and unless you decide to commit yourself with attention and dedication, most of the time you find yourself making random movements which in any case allow you to obtain the desired results, i.e. the elimination of enemies. Furthermore, for the management of the camera, given the absence of the second analog stick, it was decided to offer the double possibility of rotating it by tilting the wiimote (awkward and imprecise) or using the directional cross on it (a little less awkward and imprecise ). Coupled with handling the Dark Prince's whip and little else, that's all the Wii's unique control system has to offer in Rival Swords. Very little Everything else is absolutely unchanged from what we saw on GC, Ps2 and Xbox; and by everything we also mean the technical component, since graphically Ubisoft did not want to add anything more to justify the transition to undoubtedly superior hardware, even if perhaps not by much. So here are excellent animations, beautiful and evocative settings, pleasant light effects, but really subdued textures and prone to kneading if you look closely. Both 480p and 16:9 are supported, but the result honestly doesn't change much. On the other hand, the sound is excellent, both for the perfectly themed music and capable of contributing to the atmosphere, and for the effects and the Italian dubbing. With these premises, Rival Sword overall is therefore a game whose meaning is frankly difficult to understand. If it had at least been sold at a budget price, we could have recommended its purchase to Wii owners looking for a high quality game, albeit certainly not suitable for exploiting the console's features. But on the contrary, the product in question is sold for around 60 euros in shops; that is to say that for much less than half you can take home the Gamecube version, taking advantage of the backwards compatibility of the console, or those for Ps2 and Xbox if they still make a fine show of themselves in your living room, obtaining an absolutely identical in both form and content, indeed even better as regards the control system. Comment Changing the subtitle is not enough. Ubisoft should have put a little more effort into making this Rival Swords for Wii, adding at least some extra content or improving the graphics component compared to Prince of Persia: the two Thrones released for Ps2, Xbox and GC a year and a half ago. And instead the games are absolutely identical, with the only exception of the use of the wiimote in fights which in any case does not change the reality of things at all. The full price with which it is sold in stores also closes the circle of a conversion that makes no sense to exist from any point of view. And mind you, we're talking about the conversion, not the game which, on the contrary, is one of the best Ubisoft productions of recent years; but if you haven't played it yet, look for one insteadused copy for ~old-gen~ consoles... your wallet will thank you. Pros Game is undoubtedly great High value sound component Cons Nonsense conversion Identical in everything to The Two Thrones Marginal wiimote usage When in late 2003 Ubisoft launched Prince of Persia: the sands of time on the market, many were fascinated by the ability of the programmers to be able to maintain the charm of a great classic in the history of video games, but at the same time creating from scratch a modern game mechanics, successful, sometimes innovative and certainly very satisfying and fun. The success of this new brand, however, prompted the transalpine software house to perhaps push the foot on the accelerator a little too much for the creation of the sequel, Warrior Spirit, which struggled to add something to the original formula. Fortunately the series then brilliantly recovered with the third episode, The Two Thrones; a year and a half later, the same game changed its subtitle to make its debut on the Nintendo Wii.", "date": "2007-04-25", "grade": null}
