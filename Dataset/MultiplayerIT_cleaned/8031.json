{"name": "Di arene e pestaggi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/113836-croixleur-di-arene-e-pestaggi.html", "text": "Croixleur is a Japanese indie game that came out of nowhere. Imported to the West by Nyu Media, it immediately catches the eye for its very classic but very well done visual style. It is interesting for several aspects, the first of which is the really low price (just over four euros). It tells the story of Lucrezia Visconti, a girl versed in magical arts and melee combat, who must win a kind of competition, the Adjuvant Trial, to give her faction the right to defend the queen. His opponent is the blonde Francesca Storaro (we are not inventing names), who wants to do the same for her faction. The plot is all here. The game, or rather the Story Mode, is the competition. The player has to play Lucrezia and face a series of arenas to get to the top of a magical tower, where there is a powerful boss to defeat. All this must be done within fifteen minutes, otherwise Francesca will win. Each arena contains a variable number of enemies, who will do anything to live up to their common name, i.e. they will try to consume all of Lucrezia's energy. Among the various beasts that we will have to face there are thugs armed with clubs, wizards capable of casting spells from a distance, one-eyed bats that swoop down and... that's it. Their strength is determined by the color of the dress they wear (or skin). The further you go in the game, the tougher the enemies become and the more their attacks hurt. There is no shortage of bosses, large creatures that require multiple hits to knock down. For example, you will have to face big trolls, or giant magical silver and gold armor. Sympathy gameplay The strong point of Croixleur is the combat system. Lucrezia, who can wield a sword or a mace, has various offensive techniques at her disposal to deal with dangers. Aside from basic attacks and jumps, he can perform magic attacks, different depending on the weapon used, he can dash to avoid enemy shots, or he can use a very powerful rotating technique that recharges by collecting the coins dropped by dead monsters. There is also a combo system, which allows you to kill faster. As we said, the magical attacks depend on the weapon held by the girl. At the beginning you will start with a single sword capable of firing spheres of energy, but as you play you will unlock other weapons (for a total of ten) which will guarantee greater prowess in ground and air combat. The arenas are all the same: ideally being the floors of a tower, they are completely uncluttered circular spaces that vary only in the colors of the textures. What differentiates them is the number of enemies. Cleared a floor, you have to enter a portal to reach the next level. In some cases it will be possible to choose between two different portals, on which the level of the challenge to be faced will be written. The higher the level, the more enemies there will be (or they will be more powerful). In general the matches are very fast, also because you will understand that if the time limit to overcome everyone the plans and getting to take down the final boss takes fifteen minutes, the individual fights can only last a handful of seconds. Even with the other game modes the situation does not change: in Score Attack you have to fight for three minutes accumulating as many points as possible, while in Endless Mode you have to survive as long as possible by increasing your score by killing enemies. In both modes, the more time passes, the more powerful the enemies that appear in the arena are. Technically Croixleur is a very poor title. If it is true that the model of the protagonist is well done, the enemies and the scenarios are bare and offer nothing amazing. Sure, maybe it's for the best, because otherwise the action would have risked becoming really chaotic, especially given the special effects of the attacks and magic, exaggerated as the Japanese like. In short, from a technical point of view we are faced with a simple title, which is not raised on the sound side, where the music turns out to be mere manner accompaniments. Oh well, these aspects will certainly not determine the judgment of a title that costs so little.", "date": "2013-01-30", "grade": "7.0"}
