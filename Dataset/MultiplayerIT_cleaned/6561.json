Thanks to the corpulent Hurk we can play five single player missions, three of which are focused precisely on Hurk himself, thanks to which we can obtain his iconic weapon, the Impaler, or a portable whale harpoon launcher, which seems to have been made to kill bears, rhinos and helicopters, but mostly Pagan Min's armored soldiers. Hurk Deluxe Pack is a nice single player DLC, full-bodied and with a decidedly affordable price White week Hurk's missions, like the other two downloadable ones, the bloody ruby and the Yak farm, represent a full-bodied single player extra, and very interestingly, they have nothing to envy to the ~standard~ ones of the campaign, and indeed, for variety , difficulty and inventiveness are in some ways better. They all last about thirty to forty minutes, and make us fight both in the forests at the foot of the Himalayas and much higher up, between snow-capped peaks, frozen lakes, temples, caves, mines and fortified structures. Really very different and spot on settings, which enhance both the more chaotic and the more stealth approach of Far Cry 4. The elephant escape with Hurk is perfectly exemplary of the ~lighter~ side of life in Kyrat, where instead of piloting a devastating and indestructible tank we simply load and trunk everything that moves until the final siege, almost without firing a shot. On the contrary, when it comes to finding the statue of a golden monkey in the high mountains, the mechanics become ~more serious~, we are engaged in caves where we find a couple of circular areas in which soldiers armed with flamethrowers must necessarily be taken from behind to kill them, thus playing cat and mouse, sneaking (exactly, yes!) behind their backs. We also really liked the bloody ruby, if possible even longer and tougher, in which the conquest of a sort of small fort involves having to clean up a mine, with the challenge rate becoming more and more difficult, with enemies well positioned, and more generally a level design made to enhance the great variety of approaches that Far Cry 4 offers us. Hurk's last mission, which is obtained by completing a good number of main missions including those of Yogi and Regi, rewards us with the Impaler and sees us stop an imperial convoy aboard the helicopter, which is not exactly simple if not you have the relative takedown. And then, as in Speed, you have to drive a truck flat, slowing down too much means game over paying attention to explosive barrels, hairpin bends, runaway elephants and soldiers armed with flamethrowers. This is a small variation on the theme, undoubtedly very entertaining, even if a few too many curses can escape behind the wheel of the truck. Yak Farm is also well thought out. With the usual stratagem of the merchant-portal we are again transported to the high mountains, in the middle of the glaciers near the lake of Utpala. Our task? Stop a convoy heading towards a rebel base and save Hurk of course. Huge white expanses made for the most ruthless snipers, snowmobile chases worthy of the best James Bond, up to the obvious final battle. An undoubtedly very entertaining mission, structured on three environments / situations that work and which give even more variety to the whole. Ultimately, we really liked this full-bodied expansion (included in the Season Pass). Fun, distinctly cooperative, caciarona but also stealth, if you like. For ~only~  7.49 we take home five well-made missions, which engage us in different adventures than usual, then making us explore unpublished parts of Kyrat. Without forgetting the extra of a nice load of ~exotic~ weapons in the shop, with the Impaler harpoon as the undisputed protagonist among the new tools of the trade. In short, a highly recommended DLC, perhaps to be played - subject to the mission unlock requirements - not too far in the adventure, in order to also appreciate a slightly higher level of difficulty than the standard missions.", "date": "2015-02-18", "grade": null}
