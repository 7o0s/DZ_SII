We've already talked about its first incarnation for Nintendo 3DS and then porting it to PC via Steam, and in both cases we've definitely promoted it, telling you how a little-publicized title has met with extraordinary success with critics and audiences. Those speeches are no longer valid because SteamWorld Dig in the meantime has become famous, so much so that it has earned a port for the older sister of Nintendo 3DS, for Sony's new flagship console and for its portable counterpart. We replayed it with great pleasure, after a few months, and our opinion hasn't changed. The unmissable SteamWorld Dig also arrives on Wii U, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita Pickaxes up In terms of content, SteamWorld Dig has hardly changed at all compared to the Nintendo 3DS and PC versions, and this means that the first few minutes of the game could make a bad impression on you: the adventure of Rusty, a cowboy robot in a post-apocalyptic future where the human race seems to have become extinct, it begins slowly, very slowly, and it is not clear where it is going with this. Our uncle has disappeared into the bowels of poor Tumbletown and it is up to us to find him and to unearth the treasures contained underground. The first part of our mission is resolved in the first five minutes of the game, when we discover that our uncle has passed away (can we say for a robot?) and it's up to us to continue exploring that dark and gloomy world, procedurally generated and therefore different in each game. At the beginning SteamWorld Dig forces us to dig by repeatedly hitting the blocks of rock with our poor pickaxe in search of some precious mineral to exchange for a fistful of dollars. And you have to be careful, because you risk being trapped, with no way out, among very dangerous little monsters that we could even risk releasing as we pick our way between one mineral deposit and another; as if that weren't enough, Rusty as well as being delicate also depends on the light of his lantern, which wears out quickly and ends up plunging us into a darkness in which it is impossible to understand what surrounds us, thus forcing us to return to the city to empty the pockets and recharge the light. We were saying that in the initial stages SteamWorld Dig is a repetition of these raids in the underground in search of treasures, then the first power-up is discovered and we begin to understand where the guys from Image & Form want to take us... Playstation 4 trophies Image & Form has not added many trophies: only fourteen, divided into twelve bronze, one silver and one gold. To unlock them, you must not only complete the game, but also discover each hidden area, eliminate some enemies in special ways and earn a lot of money. The craziest underground in the world In the end, SteamWorld Dig turns out to be a ~metroidvania~ type action in which you progress gradually, unlocking new areas thanks to the possibilities offered by each new power-up. The first, for example, is a run that allows you to overcome unsafe paths and make longer leaps. The second, however, is a super vertical jump: it consumes the water indicator, refillable in the basins scattered throughout the subsoil, and allows you to reach previously inaccessible points or to destroy the most fragile blocks head-on. From area to area, from cave to cave, Rusty gets new upgrades that allow him to go deeper and deeper and face new enemies and solve complex puzzles that will test his cunning and ability to manage resources such as light , water and vital energy. On the surface, treasures exchanged for dollars make you not only richer but also more powerful: each additional level unlocks a new upgrade or gadget in the town shop, and for example you can fortify the simple pickaxe to make it stronger, decreasing the amount of shots needed to destroy rocks; or you can enlarge Rusty's pockets, allowing him to load more precious minerals at once. The shop offers various power-ups and consumables that can be purchased and which therefore guarantee us a certain freedom in managing our Rusty and our game times. From this point of view, Image & Form has done an impeccable job and those tedious initial minutes soon give way to an engaging adventure that unfortunately does not last long. If the transition to more powerful hardware hasn't helped SteamWorld Dig from the point of view of content and longevity, the same cannot be said for graphics: mind you, even in this caseso nothing new, apart from the same slightly improved graphical effects of the PC version, but SteamWorld Dig now runs at a constant sixty frames per second and if on the TV screen it is already a beautiful sight, with its well-animated sprites and captivating style, the game gives its best on PlayStation Vita thanks to the OLED screen that returns a brilliant and even more cartoony color rendering. Not to mention that the title is perfect for games of a few minutes, making it portable, as already happened with the Nintendo 3DS version, much more recommended. Steamworld Dig and the Wii U Game Pad We want to point out the excellent thought of Image & Form regarding the implementation of the characteristic Game Pad of Wii U. There are no differences in terms of gameplay, but when playing connected to the TV the image is reproduced on the screen completely devoid of interface elements, bound to the controller screen. In this way it is possible to enjoy a completely unobstructed view of Rusty and the environment that surrounds him, lowering his gaze to the pad only to check the various indicators or change equipment by touching the touch screen. Then just press Select and voil, the Game Pad plays Steamworld Dig exactly as if it were playing on a Nintendo 3DS or PlayStation Vita.", "date": "2014-09-16", "grade": "8.8"}
