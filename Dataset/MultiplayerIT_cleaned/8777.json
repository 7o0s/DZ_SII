Like John Belushi in Blues Brothers, his aim is to gather the members of a band of talented musicians, traversing an entire country with the police perpetually on his tail. Perhaps for a fortuitous coincidence, among other things, Jazz: Trump's Journey takes up a whole series of elements from Blues Brothers for the Amiga: both are 2D platformers in which to jump from one staircase to another, collect collectible objects scattered throughout the level and avoid to be caught by the cops, but the game of EggBall presents itself as a clear homage to the lovers of Louis Armstrong and New Orleans, a visual and sonic triumph of the early years of jazz. I have seen the light! Unlike what a deceptive trailer might suggest, the plot of Jazz: Trump's Journey is told in a very trivial way, and the same atmosphere cannot keep up with an over-the-top audiovisual style. Yet the player's first challenge will be precisely that of being able to interpret the dialogues between the various characters, since the work done in the localization phase is embarrassing to say the least, whether you decide to play in English or in Italian. We are not talking about typos, but about ungrammatical sentences, often incomprehensible to say the least and sometimes even left in French, a job that was presumably delegated to a second-class automatic translator or to whoever in the team fished for the shortest straw. Once you have put your soul in peace and skipped all the dialogues, the player finds himself in front of a platform that is not without defects but underneath it is quite enjoyable, thanks above all to a mechanic that has been cleared for some time but which gives the game a welcome depth. In fact, at any moment it is possible to stop time simply by playing the trumpet, an ability which, as it is easy to guess, proves to be the only lockpick useful for overcoming intricate puzzles and particular platform sessions: thus a policeman can be blocked while he is on a switch, stop a platform so you can jump onto it, or even block crates while they're in mid-air. This is made more complicated by the fact that several objects will be immune to the horn's power, and soon some cops will start wearing earplugs. Too bad for an unfortunate balance of game difficulty, which remains at quite low levels for most of the adventure, offering a significant challenge, and in some moments even frustrating, only in the final stages. The repeated fight with a stubborn boss helps to break up the action from time to time, but banal, predictable and always the same patterns do nothing but make these sporadic moments among the worst successful of the product. Yet we continue with pleasure, if only to continue listening to the very pleasant jazz songs that accompany each level, where the EggBall graphics deserve a handshake for the perfectly fitting cartoon drawing style, a sort of color version of Steamboat Willie and other animated productions of the 1920s. Unfortunately, in addition to the inexcusable localization, marring what otherwise could be an above average platformer is a poorly conceived and poorly implemented control system. Instead of resorting to the D-pad or a virtual stick, the developers have opted for a solution with two arrow keys (left and right), an apparently apt choice when moving horizontally, but which discovers all its problems when you have to go up or down the many stairs that dot all the scenarios; in this case two further keys appear on the side of the screen, requiring the player to move the thumb which is especially uncomfortable on the large iPad screen. Despite an excellent response in walljumps, to this is added a feeling in the movements and jumps far from perfect, which all too often translates into involuntary mistakes and accidental deaths. At least the game is quite generous in terms of checkpoints, distributing them abundantly before and after the most intricate moments, while the instant respawn with each death avoids further moments of frustrating waiting.
