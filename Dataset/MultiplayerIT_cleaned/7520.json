Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. ~You don't change the team that wins~, they say, but when you have to make the sequel to a successful mobile game it is clear that you are going to put your hand on some of the elements that had characterized the original product, producing differences that can be both positive and negative from the point of view of experience. Here, such a brainy speech was never more apt, given that Real Steel: World Robot Boxing was born from the ashes of a rather popular title on the App Store and Google Play, Real Steel in fact, and tries in its own way to introduce new features which, however, do not they always prove to be effective. The universe is what we have come to know thanks to the film of the same name with Hugh Jackman, set in a future where robot fights are all the rage and have become the reference television show. So let's take on the role of a ~coach~ who must take a large tin warrior under his protective wing and bring him to success, all through a series of increasingly difficult tournaments and resorting to an enhancement system that on the one hand it allows you to spend the credits earned with each victory, on the other hand it is the ~limit~ that any user of freemium games knows well. In addition to the traditional expedient of limited energy, which puts a stop to our eagerness to fight and recharges itself with the passing of the minutes, Real Steel: World Robot Boxing also proves to be quite demanding in terms of upgrades, which makes it necessary to ~grind ~ quite a while before you can get through certain encounters and continue your career. Real Steel: World Robot Boxing comes as a ~more of the same~ from the first episode of the series Digital punches In addition to making the freemium format weigh more, this new Real Steel tie-in unfortunately abandons some features present in the first episode, in this case the possibility of building a robot from scratch, replacing them with a greater variety as regards the available modes. In fact, it is possible to try your hand at the championship, the time attack, single performances and training sessions, the latter sometimes necessary to carry out the ~grinding~ we mentioned earlier, scrape together some extra credits and buy the necessary upgrades to remain competitive. The gameplay has remained almost unchanged, it is a fairly tactical fighting game due to the massive damage inflicted by each successful hit, which prompts us to pay close attention and always keep a finger on the parry button, unfortunately separate and not in Street Fighter style, that is combined with the opposite direction of the virtual d-pad with respect to the opponent's position. It is possible to launch fast or slow attacks, which change according to the direction in which we move, offering a great variety of maneuvers and animations, as well as releasing a powerful super move that charges up as we land hits. The sensation of impact is unfortunately poor, and unfortunately this makes the difference between a ~nice~ beat'em up and one that is really capable of involving, but it must also be said that on mobile devices so far very few developers have managed to do much better . Certainly the excellent technical sector helps, the twenty-four robots that make up the roster have a convincing design and the ~fatalities~ appear quite spectacular, with heads and limbs flying everywhere.", "date": "2013-11-02", "grade": "7.3"}
