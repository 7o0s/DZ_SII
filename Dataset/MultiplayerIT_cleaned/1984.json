{"name": "Hitman 2  Silent Assasin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hitman-2-silent-assasin.html", "text": "Options In the main screen you will find the following items: start, upload, options and acknowledgments. In the ~options~ screen you will find the following items: graphic options (allow you to manage subtitles and activate or deactivate blood), audio options (allow you to manage the volume of music, speech and sound effects) and finally configure commands (allows the configuration of the buttons, the activation or not of the vibration, the sensitivity of movement, i.e. the speed with which Hitman will move according to our commands and the voice ~switch visual up and down~. The laptop Hitman works a lot with his inseparable laptop. Through this laptop we will receive the objectives of each mission, a satellite map of the place, information on the target and any surveillance photos or videos accessible only before the mission. There will also be a list of completed missions with the possibility of redoing them. In the next menu (equipment menu), we could equip ourselves with many types of weapons and objects: we go from knives (different types) to fiber cable for close combat or to kill without making a sound, to semi-automatic or drum pistols (remember to take also the silencer), to machine guns, to rifles (very bulky, not concealable, but effective), to shotguns (if we like to destroy without strategy) to the legendary sniper rifles (lethal!!!); then there is the very useful binoculars, the map and any night vision goggles. Just be careful to choose the type of equipment well based on the mission and of course the Hitman's transport possibilities (for example, you can't carry more than one rifle at a time). In the game We finally arrive, after the usual movies (made really well and above all that bring the player into the part and into the atmosphere), to the actual game screen. The first part summarizes the situation a bit and becomes a small tutorial. First of all, we will be able to switch from the first person view to the third person view (both well made and comfortable) by simply pressing the white button. On the screen we can see: Hitman's state of health (it depends on where they hit us: one blow to the head is enough, many are needed to the arm), the danger indicator (very useful for knowing the proximity of any risks or if the our disguise does not work properly), the weapon currently in use (if we hold it in hand; if it is placed in the cover nothing appears), the remaining bullets for that weapon (if it is firearms), the compass. Pressing the ~start~ key pauses the game and the following items appear: save, load, cancel saves, options, restart mission, exit and continue game. A small flaw concerns the map that we can view during the game: you have to activate it using the ~back~ button. However, the map is detailed and with different points of view, legend, reference points, it's just a bit slow to get there and less immediate. Another defect that does not affect the game, but which is present concerns the blood (it is not well created and by killing an enemy the red stain of blood is spread, but in an unreal way and above all you cannot see the injured part of the body as in Soldier of Fortune, for example; the bullet holes on the other hand, in the walls, are well made and remain for a long time). In the game The interaction with the surrounding landscape is remarkable and to be able to open a door, talk to someone, take an object... we just need to get close and the possible actions that we can perform will appear. We will also be able to collect the weapons or objects of the opponents we kill or immobilize. The ~fire~ part is also very detailed and therefore our accuracy and rate of fire will be due to the weapon we use, our position (standing or kneeling, moving or stationary), if they are shooting at us or if we can take aim quietly. For example, it is useful to be able to shoot at chandeliers and lamps to stay in the dark in a room during a shooting (especially if we have infrared glasses, the option of stealing the clothes of one of our victims remains fundamental (not always anyway) in order to be able to infiltrate more easily and be able to hide the corpse. We will not always have the mission of killing a certain character, but sometimes we will have to do exactly the opposite and that is to protect another person. Two other well-crafted aspects are the plot (really well organized and intriguing) and the settings in various parts of the planet, from Sicily (from wherepart), to India, Japan, Russia etc. The localization is impeccable: manual, subtitles and speech all in Italian, a pleasure for hearing. Concluding Truly a worthy second chapter of a game well done in its first version of a year ago now. The graphics don't make you cry out to be a miracle, but it's still well done and absolutely doesn't make you turn up your nose (it just seems to be alone in the world, in the sense that there are people who do not belong to the enemy/friends sphere, in short, few). The storyline and objectives of the game are very addictive and really engage the player a lot. However, the beauty of this title is given by the possibility of decision that is left to the user: everyone chooses their own strategy (enter stealthily, kill and leave or make a massacre) and how to get to the goal given that the ways can be multiple. So longevity is prolonged precisely by the possibility of repeating the same mission perhaps with a different approach. In each mission however, there are also submissions to complete which thus extends the fun and difficulty. PROS Possibility to choose your own strategy (cautious or Rambo-style) Different ways to achieve the same goal The plot and the sound (in Italian, moreover) CONS The graphics are not excellent (but not bad either: somewhere in between) You cannot save the games on memory unit The low presence of ~civilian~ personnel (if it can be considered a defect^-^) Materials Image Gallery Preview 7 movies Introduction It was November 25, 2000 when a certain ~Hitman - Code name 47~ arrived on the shelves of Italian video game stores. A real surprise, a truly original game, with excellent graphics for the time and with a great playability made superior thanks to the possibility of interaction with the surrounding environment and above all with the possibility of deciding which strategy to use to complete the scheme in complete autonomy. The game raised, it must be remembered, numerous criticisms regarding the subject matter and the age-old question of the probable responsibilities that video games and films have on the actions and character of the boys. Two years after its appearance in the gaming world, the second chapter ~Hitman 2 - Silent Assasin~ appears thanks to Io-Interactive, Eidos and Leader. Even this second chapter is not free from criticisms regarding the immoral theme it offers to the player (the killer's profession is not among the most respectable ones :), but as always, the important thing is to remember that it is only a game and then the plot, without revealing anything, is ~on the road to repentance~. Despite this, it is not recommended for children under the age of 18. We insert our beautiful DVD into the Xbox, the opening credits appear and the introductory video starts: very well created and above all it puts the viewer in the right atmosphere. In short, two people are wondering who could have caused the massacre they are seeing in a surveillance video and one of them mentions ~47~. The other is perplexed, he thought he was dead, but apparently he is alive and well. Once the movie is over, the general screen appears and the game's soundtrack starts immediately: wonderful. Created by Jesper Kyd, with the participation of the Budapest symphonic choir and orchestra, it is very suitable for the genre of play, a ~heavy~ music, enveloping and gritty at the same time.", "date": "2002-10-10", "grade": null}
