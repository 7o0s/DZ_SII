A surprising and unexpected debut, that of the franchise created by Toshihiro Nagoshi, which anticipates by some time the release on Steam of Yakuza Kiwami, a remake of the first chapter, and which could pave the way for subsequent episodes, including the recent Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, which closes the narrative arc of Kazuma Kiryu. However, there are at least two other reasons to be really happy: the first is that we are dealing with a prequel set in the late 1980s, in a Japan different from the one we know today, in many ways a representation of the future that materialized between arcades, neon lights and spectacular attractions, characterized by an extraordinary atmosphere for any nostalgic; the second is that the conversion developed by SEGA is phenomenal and allows you to play up to 4K and 60 frames per second stable on not necessarily very expensive configurations, enjoying a high-level visual impact. In short, for only 19.99 euros, you can take home a ticket to Tokyo and Osaka aboard a DeLorean. Plot It's 1988 and in the fictional Kamurocho neighborhood of Tokyo, young Kazuma Kiryu is teaching a lesson to a man who has evidently challenged the wrong person. The rising star of the Dojima clan collects the debt that the unfortunate victim owed to a loan shark and goes off to drink with his childhood friend Akira ~Nishiki~ Nishikiyama, even indulging in a karaoke song. A few hours later, however, the light-hearted amusement of the two is replaced by bewilderment, when the news breaks that a body has been found right in their area, and it is the man that Kazuma beat up. Who is trying to frame him? And what is the value of the alley where the crime took place? We will find out in the seventeen chapters that make up the Yakuza 0 campaign: a deep and complex story, which in addition to the origins of the traditional protagonist also narrates a parallel plot set in Osaka, in the Sotenbori area, putting us in the shoes of Majima Goro for the first time . After serving a terrible sentence for insubordination, the young Yakuza finds himself running a famous cabaret, the Grand, until one day he is ordered to kill a man to get rid of his debts. Will he be able to do it? The one written by Masayoshi Yokoyama is a multifaceted, full-bodied, compelling plot, full of non-trivial twists that will literally keep you glued to the game until the completion of the campaign, which will require at least thirty hours if you decide to neglect many side missions. Side quests and extra activities The offer of Yakuza 0 includes various optional quests that bring into play often crazy characters and situations, in which perhaps we need to memorize information to provide the right answers when we are asked to do so, but also to fight when the punches are the only option to set things right. We will therefore have to deal with directors looking for help on the set of an advertisement, girls who want to be seen with a boyfriend to reassure their parents, people who end up in the hands of unscrupulous sects, students who make some money by selling their underwear and more: stories that reveal an interesting and concrete cross-section of Japanese culture, and which, once completed, provide us with experience points to be exchanged at the temple, in exchange for an improvement in the character's basic skills. To the secondary missions we must also add the numerous collateral activities, another characterizing trait of the series: going around Kamurocho and Sotenbori we will be able to access some arcades and try our hand at some great classics (Out Run, Super Hang-On, Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone , in this case), use the UFO Catchers, visit video clubs to watch some itchy clips, try the karaoke minigame, take a few swings at the Battling Club, play pool or darts, or even compete with the toy cars of the Pocket Circuit, use telephone chats to try to conquer some strangers or attend women's wrestling matches by betting on the possible winner. Going forward, two further activities will also be unlocked: Kazuma will be able to take over commercial properties and manage their staff in order to relaunch them and earn from their collections, while Goro will be able to control his personal cabaret club, hiring the best girls to entertain guests and making sure that orders are always timely and substantialOh yeah. Gameplay There is no doubt that the strength of the Yakuza series lies in the quality of its stories and the excellent way they are told, thanks to a direction attentive to the smallest details, with perfect timing and a great awareness of how to involve the player , so that he feels absolutely determined to defeat the enemy on duty, who may have just committed some terrible atrocities. The numerous cutscenes, mostly dialogued in Japanese (with English subtitles), form the glue with respect to actually very simple gameplay sequences, which almost always ask you to move from point A to point B and to fight anyone who gets in the way. on our way. Indeed, in the streets of Kamurocho and Sotenbori we will find drunkards, hooligans and criminals of various kinds who will challenge us as soon as they see us, giving rise to spectacular fights that in Yakuza 0 we will be able to face by selecting our style from three different options, to be unlocked in during the first hours of the campaign. In the case of Kazuma Kiryu we will be able to alternate two interesting variants to the classic position: one very fast, based on well-timed bursts of blows and very rapid dodges, the other bestial, careless and tending to automatically use any object to inflict damage on the enemy. In the case of Goro Majima, however, in addition to the default style we will be able to take out a baseball bat and perform spectacular combinations of blows or mix martial arts and breakdance in a captivating and effective solution. By eliminating the opponents we will earn money to spend not only on the purchase of healing meals and drinks at the various convenience stores, but also to enhance each single fighting style, thus obtaining a larger health bar, greater effectiveness of shots and numerous extra moves to perform during the fights. In our debt collection operation, let's call it that, we will only have to be careful of one thing: Mr. Shakedown. It is a thug who wanders around the city and who will not fail to challenge us if we get too close, knocking us down in just two moves and stealing all the cash in our possession: a blow to pride, and more. The PC version of Yakuza 0 expresses a concept very clearly, ~real Yakuza use a gamepad~, and in fact it is a must to play with a controller to be able to get the most out of the experience. The layout of the controls is very similar to what was seen on PlayStation 4, with X and Y to deliver fast and powerful blows that can be combined in various ways, B to grab the opponent and throw him, A to dodge, the back buttons to parry and lock onto a target and d-pad directions to activate fighting styles. As we fight, our character will increase his fury bar which, once full, will allow him to perform contextual specials to the scenario, using his bare hands or objects of any kind to inflict serious damage on the enemy on duty. A solid and multifaceted system, which emphasizes the impacts in an excellent way and enhances each sequence to make it as spectacular as possible. Technical realization As written in the opening, the developers SEGA have done an excellent job in bringing Yakuza 0 from PlayStation 4 to PC. Although it is an originally cross-gen title, which therefore in some ways remains anchored to an outdated structure (see the fact of having to wait a few moments to access the shops, something made dynamic and transparent in Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, or the manual saves at the telephone booths, which however in this version do not require waiting), the visual sector of the game appears extraordinarily rich and inspired, especially when exploring the scenarios in the evening, with the lights of the signs and the numerous passers-by creating a great atmosphere . The assets also hold up well, with very few exceptions during the long campaign, which highlights the obsessive attention that the authors have paid to every detail, especially during the cutscenes. The touch of class is represented by a blur effect that is automatically applied to the closest objects in the view, mimicking the focus of a lens, but it is surprising to discover that it is not a gimmick to mask huge pixels: if we move the camera to frame directly a poster or simple bricks, these will appear perfectly sharp. A concrete hint about the excellent optimization comes from our test setup, where Yakuza 0 runs at a rocky 2160p and 60 frames per second with all effects maxed out and, very importantly, an option to unlock the frame rate in general and duringand the predetermined sequences, which are therefore not simple films. Disabling vertical sync, however, with the same values you switch to 120-140 fps, so if you have a less powerful video card than a 1080 Ti you just need to make a simple proportion to understand more or less what kind of performance you can aim for. The only option capable of affecting performance is of course the SSAA antialiasing, but playing on a 4K screen there's really no reason to want to activate it, while on the contrary there is a parameter to scale the resolution in percentage respect to to the actual output. The other adjustments concern the quality of FXAA antialiasing, texture filtering, shadows and geometry, the ability to show frames per second and the aforementioned unlocking of frames for cutscenes. In short, a sufficient amount of settings to scale the experience effectively even on less performing configurations.", "date": "2018-07-26", "grade": "8.8"}
