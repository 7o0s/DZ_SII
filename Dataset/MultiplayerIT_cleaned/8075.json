{"name": " arrivata lestate", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/112574-bientot-lete-e-arrivata-lestate.html", "text": "The Belgian Tale of Tales have become famous for their deeply unconventional approach to the videogame medium. Their intent has never been to amuse or entertain, but to propose original visions, often even difficult to digest, through playful forms often reduced to the bone and sometimes not very understandable if the right time is not dedicated to the ancient art of interpretation. After three years of silence and several projects started and not completed, Bientt l't has finally been published, intended to rekindle the usual, sterile controversy about what is or is not a video game. Normally those who try to affirm a univocal concept of videogame start from prejudicial elements rooted in a traditionalist and conservative vision of the videogame medium, which demands a complete closure with respect to any interaction with different ludic dynamics. The discussion we are making, apparently unrelated to what should be the aims of a review, is instead essential to understand how the only possibility of appreciating and loving titles such as Bientt l't has as its starting point the admission that the medium video game is by its nature plastic, that is, capable of admitting the most disparate forms. The effort we can and must make as a critique in similar situations is not to judge by making the usual ideal average between ~graphics, sounds, longevity, gameplay, price~, but to provide a reading, however partial and, perhaps, wrong, which gives access to the gameplay, trying to make it clear whether the playful proposal, however present, is for us or not. In short, to make you understand the game we have to challenge its complexity, which does not reside in the interface or other typical video game elements, but in its expressive vocation. Bientt l't's blog Tale of Tales have collected many of the visual and other sources used as inspiration to compose the different elements of their game in one blog. It is an interesting gallery that we invite you to look at, also because it can help in the interpretation of Bientt l't. On the beach Bientt l't begins with choosing the gender of your avatar. Man or woman? Then the game. There is no story, there are no goals to achieve or enemies to eliminate. There is a long beach and there are waves carrying seemingly unrelated sentences. The aim is to stroll, watching the hours go by in the changing light and listening to the sound of the sea and the delicate accompanying music. There is a metaphysical atmosphere, created with very few elements. The only other objects present in the scenario are benches, placed on the limits of the practicable space, and a building, to be crossed to start a second phase. We therefore find ourselves inside a kind of caf or tea room, seated at a table in the shape of a chessboard. You have to wait for another player to enter to start a conversation. The interlocutor, chosen randomly, will always have an avatar of the opposite sex to ours. Having taken a position, one can only try to communicate according to the rules imposed, that is by moving the chess pieces, collected by looking at some visions on the beach, on the squares linked to the sentences. There are no other usable interfaces and you are not free to say what you want. The conversation seems to immediately become a game with no winners. There isn't a strategy to use against each other, except that of understanding how much words themselves are part of a technology that automatically puts the person in front of you in competition, making him or her a de facto adversary. The idea that arises in the player's head is to look for the right answer, but the revelation is to understand that there is no right answer and that any choice, however inappropriate, has the same value as the others. It is only by allowing oneself to be carried away by the illusion of having a conversation full of meaning that one tries to compose something that actually has at least the appearance of meaning. However, every sentence pronounced, every gesture made in front of the chessboard is condemned to be lost; to return to that sea of foam that awaits us outside. Once the selectable phrases have run out, you can only close your eyes to choose a piece of music to play in the background, smoke a cigarette or drink some wine. If you want you can move the chess pieces, but you soon realize that without words to tie them to, they are useless objects, the melancholy veterans of a battle that never took place. Eventually you leave the room. Or he expects the other to leave. The first few times you decide to go back to the beach with annoyance. The illusion is of being ablefind something that hasn't revealed itself yet; the reading key that will allow us to violate the secrets hidden who knows where and who knows why. Doubts pile up. Why do you find a new vision every time you leave the beach club? Why hoard chess? Why is it that when you get to the edge of the game world you are faced with a mirror that reflects you in the opposite sex? Does it make sense to ask these questions? The conclusion must be as ruthless as possible: Bientt l't assumes a meaning or otherwise only on condition that it is allowed to speak. There are no easy metaphors to cling to to please yourself, but a whole series of suggestions and atmospheres built to convey non-trivial feelings. And it is in this profoundly reflective being that the work of Tale of Tales offers itself as dangerously different. More fatal and The Graveyard than The Path, Bientt l't aims to be a reflection on dialogue and relationships between people, an aesthetic machine that tries to build a deep empathy towards strangers with whom no relationship can be developed beyond simulation , almost as if it were the opposite of a traditional social network where 'friends' become a superficial accumulation of power and relationships are limited to a superficial sociality of no weight. After all, even in these containers where the communication of the noisy banal takes on an excessively important role, it is always the unspoken quiet that hides the most terrible truths.", "date": "2012-12-31", "grade": "S.V."}
