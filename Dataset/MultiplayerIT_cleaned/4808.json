{"name": "Nex Machina", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/185184-nex-machina-nex-machina-breve-ma-intenso.html", "text": "We admit it: the announcement of Nex Machina during the last PlayStation Experience had left us quite indifferent: by now accustomed to more thick productions by Housemarque, see the excellent Alienation, we did not find ourselves in a twin stick shooter with an distinctly arcade, in which it was only the gameplay that played the leading role, in a continuous challenge with oneself and the high score. After completing the game and exploring its side modes we can say that we were half right: on the one hand, the latest project of the Finnish team (made in collaboration with the father of Robotron and Smash TV, Eugene Jarvis) certainly does not boast the substance or facets of their previous works, on the other hand its emphasis on frenetic and spectacular action grabs you from the first moment and never lets go. Eater of worlds Nex Machina is set in a world dominated by machines, where humans have been exterminated or enslaved. The anonymous protagonist of the game is a soldier who, armed with a powerful pulse rifle, decides to go through six different scenarios with the aim of eliminating all the robots and rescuing the people held captive. The control system is typical of twin stick shooters, with the left analog stick used to move the character and the right one to open fire and determine the trajectory of shots. The back buttons are used in a similar way to what was seen in Dead Nation and Alienation: the left one allows you to take a shot that makes you momentarily invulnerable and therefore allows you to escape from dangerous situations; the right one activates any secondary fire, to be collected within the levels. By destroying certain boxes it is in fact possible to enhance our equipment in various ways: the shot is multiplied in the available attempts (each regulated by a short recharge time) and even becomes ~explosive~, damaging the enemies involved; the rifle gains range and range of fire; an energy shield protects us from a successful hit, effectively doubling our life expectancy; the secondary weapon allows you to activate a devastating force field for hostile units close to the character, use a lightsaber from very close range, a missile launcher, a loaded shot, a bomb that is launched and explodes on command or a very powerful laser beam. Photosensitivity test In Nex Machina selecting the type of secondary attack becomes essential in order to successfully reach the final phase of the campaign and complete it. During our tests we literally hated the sword, a powerful tool but one that forces us to get too close to the enemies to be able to hit them, thus proving to be useless against the six bosses at the end of the area (all well characterized, varied from a design point of view and equipped with non-trivial attack patterns), and madly loved the laser, which slows down our movements but offers a constant and powerful beam, which quickly reduces the energy of robotic opponents. For the rest, the mechanics fielded by Housemarque with this title are in many ways reminiscent of those of Super Stardust, in some cases assuming the typical connotations of bullet hell, when enemy fire literally fills the screen and avoiding being hit turns into a desperate undertaking. The immediate and engaging nature of the gameplay literally ~traps~, leading to face in sequence all the short stages that make up each of the six worlds (which can also be tackled individually in the appropriate mode), learning to memorize the pitfalls and the organization of hostile units , as well as the possible presence of hidden survivors that you have to find by shooting like madmen at all the elements that make up the scenario, experimenting with the capabilities of the voxel-based graphics engine to ~disassemble~ its structures with incredible naturalness and keep the sixty frames constant per second. Played on PlayStation 4 Pro, Nex Machina is a real riot of lights and effects, sometimes bordering on annoying (be careful if you suffer from some form of photosensitivity), which overwhelms you with very fast shots when you switch from one map to another and is accompanied by an extremely apt and engaging techno soundtrack. Playstation 4 trophies The thirty-nine Nex Machina Trophies are obtained by completing the individual worlds and the entire campaign with the four difficulty levels present, but to unlock different achievements you have to go deeper: use certain weapons against bosses, complete five levels without moving or even a level without shooting, getall power-ups and save all the surviving humans. Not something for everyone, in short. The excellence of execution The aspect of the experience linked to the discovery of the secrets and the finding of all the survivors, obviously designed for the ~completitionists~, ultimately arises as the salvation of Nex Machina from the point of view of duration. Completing the game's campaign is in fact an operation that takes very little time and which does not present an excessive degree of challenge for those who have been chewing twin stick shooters for years, at least at the intermediate difficulty level. The situation is different if you try to reach the end at the advanced or maximum level, given that the enemies become more cunning and dangerous, but above all the number of ~continues~ at your disposal significantly decreases. This element is well framed with a view to balancing the gameplay: when you are hit, you lose a life and also the last power-up, which however remains on the map, ready to be collected during a return which corresponds to the reset of the stage. +5 It is therefore possible to pursue growth in terms of skill and memorization of the stages, as well as devote oneself to the Arena mode, with a set of missions characterized by various modifiers, in which to compete for the high score and to obtain the tokens necessary to unlock the subsequent phases . While waiting for DLCs that can enrich a structure that at the moment is a bit too essential, as indeed happened with Resogun, it must be emphasized that unfortunately the cooperative multiplayer is only available locally and not online: a feature that we hope will be added with the next updates.", "date": "2017-06-23", "grade": "8.5"}
