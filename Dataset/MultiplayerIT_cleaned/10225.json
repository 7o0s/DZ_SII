In recent weeks, the community of developers, mostly independent, who have chosen to distribute their titles on Nintendo's online services, have begun to make their disappointment about the support more palpable and strong. or rather to the lack of the same, on the part of the Mother House. Beyond the specific cases, there is no doubt that the Kyoto house has placed WiiWare and DSiWare on the margins of its offer, relegating them to the role of ~extra service~ on which it is not too worthwhile to invest in promotion and advertising. Precisely for this reason, however, it is difficult to find channels that satisfactorily inform about the most deserving releases, just as it is difficult for developers to be able to find some light to show off in front of the public. In the midst of the chaos of titles for DSiWare, one of the most valuable hidden gems is this Starship Patrol. Star defense The game in question, to start off on the right foot, was made by Q-Games; for those who don't know who we're talking about, it is enough to know that he is one of the most original and talented developers of recent years, to whom we owe - among other things - the excellent PixelJunk series on PSN. Starship Patrol is a title in the tower defense genre, therefore a genre already familiar to Q-Games thanks to the beautiful PixelJunk Monsters. In this case, however, the setting is totally different, since the theme is that of ~star wars~; the goal is to use the funds available to place various types of turrets within pre-set slots, thanks to which to defeat the various waves of enemies that one after the other will try to attack the player's space base. The elimination of the various little monsters generates the dispersion of a series of small spheres, or rather the game currency, to be collected with a touch of the stylus; being able to raise money to spend on upgrading your defense line is a key aspect, as is the intelligent use of the various units available. These are made up of both basic elements such as machine guns, lasers and rockets, and advanced systems which however require, in addition to a greater economic outlay, also the use of some of the precious crystals which are more rarely given during missions at the end of each wave. From time to time, enemies also release upgrade systems, to be dragged onto one of their turrets in order to improve the functions of firepower, speed or range. It is therefore a question, as is fundamental in tower defense games, of knowing how to find the right balance between the possibilities available, organizing the ideal mix with intelligence and foresight. Although Q-Games has created an accessible and immediately understandable product even by those who are not very familiar with the genre in question, this does not mean that Starship Patrol is incapable of guaranteeing a good level of challenge. On the contrary, the programmers have opted to offer two keys for completing the various missions; if it is sufficient to reach the end of them to continue to the next one, on the contrary it is essential to eliminate all enemies and not have used the SOS cards to earn the perfect score. And precisely the SOS cards represent a further element of interest, offering the possibility of having additional help during the most critical game phases perhaps with an instant repair kit to fill up the energy of the space base, or by calling a support mercenary. or creating an explosion capable of eliminating all enemies. Starship Patrol is therefore a product of great quality, capable of expressing it throughout the thirty levels available, as well as through the absolutely minimalist graphic style, devoted largely to black and white, devoid of unnecessary pomp but not so functional for this to appear poor.", "date": "2010-01-28", "grade": "8.7"}
