With this new Leap Day, Nitrome tries to catch the proverbial two birds with one stone, simultaneously beating both the aforementioned roads: the result is a particular title to play but above all innovative for the management of its contents. So let's take a closer look at what it is... With Leap Day there is a new level every day, but completing it is not a feat for everyone... Oh my days! The intriguing premise of Leap Day is that every day a new level is made available to tackle, suitably marked on the calendar included in the application which certifies whether or not the user has been able to complete their daily challenge. An outcome that is not at all obvious, considering how Nitrome has gone down decidedly heavy with the difficulty rate of this new title of his. Sadistically hidden behind a lively graphic style that would suggest everything except such a diabolical game, Leap Day is a platformer with basic mechanics but damn hard to tame: the protagonist is a funny little yellow man who moves independently on a two-dimensional plane, changing direction only when he bumps into a wall or an obstacle, and he can only be forced to jump by tapping the screen, with the only variant of double jumping by tapping the touch screen a second time. The objective of each daily stage is based on these very simple foundations, which in an equally banal way requires the player ~only~ to reach the finish line at the top of a climb made up of lanes, platforms and dangers of various kinds. The quotation marks are a must as Leap Day does not take long to show itself for what it really is, that is a title capable of putting even the most experienced users to the test. Merit of a brutal design, made up of jumps to be performed to the millimeter, strategically positioned obstacles to cause the greatest possible damage and enemies that attack suddenly: all aggravated by the fact that it is not possible to control the inertia of the protagonist and that a minimum contact to knock him out and restart it from the last unlocked checkpoint. The question of control points is another factor skilfully calculated by the Nitrome developers, given that they are placed at regular intervals along the vertical path, but require the viewing of an advertisement or the disbursement of a certain quantity of fruit to be unlocked: these are scattered throughout the levels, but never in sufficient numbers to guarantee access to all checkpoints and especially if kept, they allow you to have a bonus on the final score if you reach the finish line. The user is therefore constantly forced to make a risk / benefit assessment, choosing whether to spend precious fruits for extra security or whether to save them for a more substantial final bonus, however, risking finding himself having to start again from very low in the event of death. An eventuality that - we can guarantee it - really happens very often in Leap Day, making it a decidedly unsuitable mobile game for those with little patience. Also because the Nitrome product goes down hard on another factor that often and willingly drives mobile users crazy, that is the interference of advertisements, which are very frequent here and often even particularly invasive: paying 3.99 eliminates altogether, but you also get unlimited access to the checkpoints, thus nullifying the challenge component which in fact represents the most successful aspect of the title.", "date": "2016-05-21", "grade": "7.9"}
