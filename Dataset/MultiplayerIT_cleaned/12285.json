In fact, after the disappearance of Acclaim, the project was put on hold waiting for a new publisher, until an agreement was reached with XS Games. Today we have the possibility to buy the game and to do it at an extremely competitive price... Attack! Once we've started, we'll find ourselves facing nineteen stages crammed with enemies, divided into eighteen different types and characterized by a modus operandi as well as peculiar skills, so much so that the game gives us the opportunity to view each opponent's card and it produces in advice and attack strategies. You can attack from close range or from a distance, using melee weapons as well as a variety of machine guns, flamethrowers and rocket launchers that you can purchase between levels. And here a small parenthesis is necessary: our performances in each stage will be analyzed and will translate into a score, which it will then be possible to ~spend~ to improve the character from every point of view and to buy new weapons. Strengthening our alter ego will prove to be absolutely necessary, because the difficulty of the game gradually increases but in the second half the challenge gets really tough, with very few energy bonuses and increasingly cunning and dangerous enemies. A different game than usual The control system adopted by the developers of The Red Star is extremely immediate and intuitive, with the main buttons of the Dual Shock 2 used to operate the manual attack or the firearm, the energy shield (with resistance limited to a couple of hit) or the special attack (which can be launched after filling a special bar), while the back buttons are used to lock onto a target or to rotate the character in various directions while it remains stationary. Finally, the directional cross is used to select the firearm from those available. Each selectable warrior has a series of attack maneuvers, with which you need to become familiar especially when the opponents are numerous and you need to get rid of them quickly. It is certainly not in the fights that the game stands out from the others, but in the way they come to life, within scenarios that are viewed differently (once from the side, once from above, etc.) and which often and they gladly zoom-out, transforming themselves into the scene of truly exciting shoot'em-up stages. To underline this aspect, The Red Star even includes a stage set up just like a shoot-and-run, in which we take control of a fighter plane and must destroy everything that moves on the screen by scrolling horizontally. Unpublished and particular is also the presence of many, many bosses: a real reference to the masterpieces of the 16-bit era. Technical features It's really a shame that The Red Star has taken so long to release. On a technical level, in fact, the game is flawless and still cuts a fine figure today, so in 2004 it could really aspire to a predominant position in the action game genre. The graphics engine is very solid and moves all the polygons with above-average fluidity, making extensive use of special effects and showing no hesitation. Although the level of detail in general is not very high, we are faced with a truly surprising result for what is the American school. The sound sector defends itself very well, with engaging and atmospheric music together with effects that are not spectacular but which certainly represent the action in a convincing way. The Red Star is also equipped with a cooperative multiplayer mode for two players, which actually enriches the experience and smoothes the edges of the (rare) episodes of frustration due to a rather rigid ~continue~ system, which forces you to start over every stage all over again if game over occurs. Icing on the cake: you can view the game in progressive mode. Comment The Red Star is a little gem and it would have been even more so in 2004, the year it was supposed to be released. Seeing it on the shelves only today perhaps takes away its prestige, but from the point of view of gamers it is a real boon: in what is the final period in the history of PlayStation 2, where software houses have begun to invest most of their resources in the new generation console market, it is still possible to purchase an excellent product at an extremely competitive price. In this sense, The Red Star is a title that anyone who loves video games should not miss out onare, an original and addictive action game, which will give you emotions and give the right tribute to an era that can never be forgotten. Pros: Original and engaging setting Technically excellent and long-lived Offered at an exceptional price Cons: Sometimes frustrating Based on a moderately successful American comic, The Red Star is an action game that mixes the distinctive elements of scrolling fighting games and shoot-and-run games in an unprecedented way. We find ourselves in an alternative Soviet Union, ruled by armies and by magic, devastated by the struggle between a tyrant governor and a group of rebels that we will take control of. The starting screen offers us the selection of our character from the three available: Makita, Kyuzo and Maya. The first has surprising speed and easily manages to take opponents by surprise, but her blows are not very powerful; the second is a real war machine, very strong both in melee and from distance, but anything but agile; the third, unlockable only after completing the game, has qualities balanced between power and speed.", "date": "2007-05-14", "grade": null}
