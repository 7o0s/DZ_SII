Published exclusively on Google Stadia in 2020, the game has also landed on PC, PS4, Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One these days, to the delight of those who couldn't wait to try their hand at the tantalizing game again experience developed by the Texan studio, which has more than one element in common with the blockbuster that responds to the name of Fortnite. Orcs Must Die! 3, a rather heated fight sequence. We know what you're thinking, but Epic Games' battle royale made its debut in 2017, five years after Orcs Must Die! 2. In short, it's really true: good ideas can be extraordinarily successful, provided you present them in the right way and have a bit of luck. when it became a competitive free-to-play, setting aside the original cooperative formula. Gameplay Orcs Must Die! 3, there are distinctly chaotic moments throughout the campaign. We were talking about staying in the tradition: the gameplay of Orcs Must Die! 3 introduces some novelties within the campaign, the War Scenarios, i.e. missions set in the past and characterized by an emphasis on both the powers at our disposal and the enemy units that will pour onto the map, in the order of thousands. Beyond this, however, the mechanics are those that fans of the series already know well and that fans of Fortnite will immediately find extremely familiar: a horde-style third-person shooter, with a strategic phase that takes place before each wave and in which we will be able to spend the points earned to buy and place increasingly effective and weird traps. Orcs Must Die! 3, the novelty of acid traps. The game shows us from time to time the paths that the orcs will follow to try to enter our breach, and it is therefore along those paths that we will have to install spikes, walls that shoot arrows, anti-gravity mechanisms, barricades also useful for channeling the ~traffic~ , surfaces that slow down the movement, deadly spring mechanisms, but also platforms that project the orcs into the air, archers of various types, different positions and enormous catapults. Once we have placed all the pitfalls we deem appropriate, or when we have exhausted the points to buy them, we will be able to start the wave and manage the matter directly. Unlike traditional tower defense, in which you basically stand still and wait, perhaps adding some additional device in the running, in Orcs Must Die! 3 our character will in fact be free to move and use his weapons to eliminate the advancing orcs.< Orcs Must Die! 3, the catapult is essential for thinning out the orc hordes in War Scenarios. The formula adopted by Robot Entertainment, as mentioned, does not distort what was seen in the second chapter of 2012, but it is still quite fun and above all challenging: you will often have to repeat a mission after seeing the way in which the orcs move or which special units are sent into the field at a certain point, upsetting what seemed like a perfect plan.Obviously the upgrades that become available between one level and another are fundamental, based on the skulls earned up to that moment, which allow you to improve the effectiveness of our character's weapons (initially we will be able to choose between two different wizards, but more fighters will be added along the way) and traps. Structure Orcs Must Die! 3, the characters have really useful magical powers. The effective concept behind Orcs Must Die! 3 applies to the eighteen levels that make up the main campaign, playable alone or in online co-op, for a duration of approximately nine hours; but also to the Drastic Measures expansion, which the development team has seen fit to integrate into this new edition of the game and which, with its five missions, undoubtedly enriches the package. The contents of this new chapter do not end here, in any case: you can try your hand, for example, with the tricky Remix mode, in which you have to complete five scenarios relying on a single breach counter, or with the endless mode Without End, in which you fight to the death trying to toughking as much as possible. Finally there are the Weekly Challenges, which are renewed cyclically. Technical realization Orcs Must Die! 3, there are also large and robust units among the enemy ranks. The comical and captivating graphics of Orcs Must Die! 3 is another aspect that unites the title of Robot Entertainment and the aforementioned Fortnite, so much so that the doubt that some designers have switched to Epic Games over the years arises immediately, turning almost into a certainty when you notice the placement of the traps on the ground. Unfortunately, most of the levels are set inside fortresses that all seem a bit the same, united by often generic assets that contribute to fueling a general feeling of repetitiveness, perhaps the greatest limitation of this production. However, the animations of the characters are well done and the types of orcs that we will have to face are quite numerous. The plot certainly arises as a secondary aspect of the game and you will find yourself following it only casually, also due to pleasant but somewhat dated interlude sequences, although the discreet Italian dubbing will certainly help you not to lose the thread of the stories of the wizards protagonists of the adventure, which takes place twenty years after the events of Orcs Must Die! 2.On PC everything moves great, at 4K and 60 fps with the presets on Ultra, and the relative simplicity of the graphics could not be otherwise considered, which puts aside the more sophisticated effects in favor of performance and focuses strongly on numbers, managing literally thousands of orcs simultaneously on the map. We found the controls perfect, both with mouse and keyboard and with the controller.", "date": "2021-08-03", "grade": "7.8"}
