It's also a common girl name that you've probably heard before if you're into Japanese manga or animation. This is Santa. No, you guessed it, he's the real Santa Claus. Since we saw it we have come to believe it again The Sakura series by Winged Clouds (which is not a Japanese studio) has little to do with the cherry blossom poetry. Of course, there is something that blossoms in every chapter, but they are not flowers. In truth, bowls are the only element that binds all the episodes. No, we are not talking about those that old people throw in senior centers trying to get as close as possible to the snitch, but about those attached to the bodies of female human beings. We're not kidding: the various Sakuras have no connection to each other, other than the presence of girls with huge boobs who inevitably end up in sexy poses. The Japanese would call it ecchi content, but we are not so refined and when we see a girl who accidentally pours a whitish liquid into her neckline, with splashes that end up all over her body, we know very well that from any cultural point of view frame the scene, he is always addressing people with a heavy hand. After all, Winged Cloud has never made a secret of simply wanting to propose drawings of beautiful scantily clad girls, to make the young followers of the sacred school of wet five fingers happy. Sakura Santa is no different. Indeed, seen from the general point of view of the entire series, this Christmas-themed visual novel, published not surprisingly on December 22, is among the lightest proposed by the developer, even in the clothes. It is not for nothing that it was presented as a product for fans, also linked to the eroge turning point of the studio, which in the meantime has begun to be published by MangaGamer, therefore without any claim to depth. We've reviewed Sakura Santa, the most Christmasy game of the year: find out what it's like... in every sense Christmas epic Sakura Santa tells the story of Koiji, a lonely boy who struggles to make friends. It's almost Christmas and the parents have decided to go on a trip of their own, while the brother doesn't consider it in any way. Even his friends have gone into hiding. In short, who would ever want to have a guy who is disgusted by practically anyone, even by imaginary friends? Any excuse is good to bare your buttocks, despite the winter cold Three pluses, of course. But let's go in order. Without getting discouraged, Koiji decides to go for a walk in the city to look at the windows and breathe in the festive atmosphere of the period. Then he goes to the nearby temple and makes an offering to ask the spirits not to have to spend Christmas alone. The spirits, who must have a particular eye for him (and not only), listen to him and a particularly low-necked fox spirit arrives to his rescue with whom he immediately makes friends and who is delighted to show him her boobs (the plot is this What are you going to do with it?). But that's not all, because back in the city the boy first comes across an old friend of his from school days, undressed as a bunny girl to promote a club, then in a version of Santa Claus evidently born from the imagination of someone in withdrawal from sex. We won't tell you the rest of the story, even if in the end there would be little to say. Just know that Koiji will be called upon to make decisive choices for the fate of his penis, that is, he will have to decide which of the three girls to spend Christmas with... maybe with all three? But yes, we abound. All this translates into a swirl of boobs and buttocks that not even the most daring of cinepanettoni have ever seen. In fact, the girls do everything to find themselves in situations where they can show their gifts, with the texts that gladly underline the state of arrapatio perennis of poor Koiji. In short, as a solitary and introverted boy he suddenly found his life invaded by living flesh. Ecchi inside Hey, I'm your old school friend. Now I deal with vegetables It will seem paradoxical to you but Sakura Santa achieves its purpose perfectly, much more than the previous Sakuras. No, there are no texts of exceptional quality to read or subplots that deserve to be explored (all the contents sell out in a few hours), but at least there is a greater underlying sincerity that does not lead to misunderstandings. Sakura Santa is aimed at lovers of Japanese erotic drawing, those who maybe skip the texts and go on in the visual novel just to unlock the contents of the extras gallery. It is also difficult mCompare a similar title with other much more profound visual novels, such as Clannad and The Fruit of Grisaia, or with other less known ones such as Eden* and Ame no Marginal -Rain Marginal- (just to name a few), given the different ambitions . The reason is easy to understand: apart from money, Sakura Santa does not expect anything and in this it is even appreciable. Of course, having clarified the point, in our opinion, it must also be made explicit that we are dealing with a work that overall adds nothing to the genre and that therefore, if you do not belong to the ranks of avid fans of Winged Clouds and its style , you can safely avoid, even at Christmas.", "date": "2015-12-24", "grade": "5.0"}
