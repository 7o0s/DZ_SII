Inspired by Miyazaki's group and by the souls formula, in fact, this talented Japanese team has reversed its fortunes with the excellent Niohs who, although not at the level of their muses, have managed to stand out for their remarkable combat system and for a rather original mix of elements. The character of these developers was seen precisely in the value of the gameplay of those titles: a mix of mechanics capable of offering a myriad of different approaches which, despite the imbalances, demonstrated how the talents were all still there, just waiting for the right opportunity to shine. As mentioned at the beginning, however, the success of a certain type of game can lead to eternally following a tortuous path, where in the absence of the necessary ability to innovate and experiment, there is the risk of getting stuck badly with no way out. Already the two Niohs were perhaps too similar to themselves, despite the excellent general quality, and the lukewarm reception of Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin (once again built around the same design foundations) showed some cracks in the Team Ninja's design plan. However, the Japanese company did not give up and, once again seeing the potential in what had been done so far, decided to try a new job of this type. His name? Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty; capable of immediately capturing the attention of fans despite the many structural similarities to Nioh. The Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty review tells us that it is not a hasty clone: it is a braver video game than expected, which takes the foundations laid by its predecessors and revises them in the best way, so as to completely renew both the combat system of those titles that many other characteristics of them. Today, after playing it for dozens of hours and also delving deeply into its endgame, we are ready to tell you if these innovations have been able to raise it above the other recent works of Team Ninja. Fiction: The Invisible Hero of the Three Realms in Three Kingdoms China, you will meet a myriad of well-known historical figures. This is Lu Bu, and he's not nice at all. Trust me The Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty campaign begins in China during the Yellow Turban Rebellion, the historical event that basically kicked off the Three Kingdoms period. Here you don't play the role of one of dozens of legendary warriors that many have ~learned~ to know by dint of bread and Dynasty Warriors, but that of an unknown warrior, saved from certain death by a mysterious blindfolded boy during a turban attack to his village. From there, of course, an unstoppable chain of events kicks off that will toss you between one battle and another, in the company of the most famous historical figures of that era. Let's start with the obvious: we are not dealing with a particularly brilliant narrative. The main antagonist is a Taoist villain so stereotypical as to be almost caricatured, whose ultimate goal is the usual quest for immortality, all obviously through an evil elixir with the power to transform men into bloodthirsty monsters. The writers of Team Ninja do not seem to have put who knows what effort into writing valuable dialogues, and there has not even been an attempt to re-propose a version of the events at least close to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (which already spectacularized the historical events that really happened ); no, here we try to force the protagonist into some of the central moments of that period, and his presence is justified with a long list of discrete forcings. The evident desire to paint most of the most popular characters of that period in a positive light certainly does not help the general quality of the plot. a mixture of main and secondary missions, at the end of which one sometimes comes into possession of powerful spirit beasts which can then be used in combat. In short, even here the story is little more than a pretext to justify epic clashes and constant battles, just a pity that we are a few steps behind the still interesting reworking of feudal Japan seen in the ~sister series~. A little bad; this is a game whose fulcrum is and remains the gameplay, and Team Ninja has predictably hit the mark on that.Gameplay: be like water. Or fire. Or everything else Your alter ego in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a warrior without equal. It's up to you to decide how to make him fight If in the macroscopic aspects Fallen Dynasty is so comparable to Nioh as to seem almost set in the same universe, things change significantly when you go deeper and start analyzing its mechanics. The game focuses on a completely renewed combat system calculated to keep the level of challenge high, despite a general simplification of the systems. In practice, everything has been bet on the rapid approach: whereas the previous exponents of the genre are generally slower and allow you to change the rhythm of the fights based on your favorite maneuvers (in Nioh, for example, there were various ~stances~, with specific weapons in able to exploit the passage from one to the other to enormously speed up the action), here the gear engaged is always the fifth and the central mechanic is the simple dodge, which if used at the moment of an enemy attack activates a rapid deflection capable to nullify the damage. Unlike many games where dodging has to rely on reduced windows of invulnerability, however, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty literally invalidates any source of damage if you dodge with the right timing, and the system is forgiving enough to make dodging always the same best tool to stem the offensive of enemies. Attention, the combat system is clearly more forgiving than what we saw in the first beta, given that now the dodges start instantly and require much more human reflexes to be used properly; however, this does not mean that Wo Long is a game with a difficulty calibrated downwards: the enemies you meet are aggressive, they do considerable damage and the most brutal among them have flurries of blows from which it is not easy to defend themselves. The maneuver itself is then calculated with much more finesse than one might believe, since it cannot be used in bursts (if you press it quickly twice, it activates a jump move with limited invulnerability, which puts you in serious danger against some opponents), and that its usefulness is closely related to a resource called spirit, to always keep an eye on so as not to succumb. The game's sorceries don't do a great deal of damage, but their effects are often extraordinarily useful. Don't overlook them in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty At first glance, the bar dedicated to the spirit may seem almost identical to the stamina of other games, but its functioning is actually closer to the Ki of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice: some moves, such as a deflection or quick attacks, can charge it until it is sent positive, while most of the most useful actions - sorcery and martial arts (which we will talk about later), heavy attacks, or simple empty dodges - consume it. If you are hit when it reaches its limit, your character enters a state of fatigue that does not allow him to move for a few moments, from which he can only come out if he is injured again or if enough time passes. Enemies have the exact same gauge, and repeatedly hitting them or dodging their attacks can also stun them, leaving them vulnerable to devastating final blows. However, this is not the only reason why a large part of your offensive revolves around the recovery of this indicator, given that without spirit you can only limit yourself to dodging and basic attacks; moreover, the bosses tend to be discreet sponges that require a myriad of attacks to be knocked out, so the final blows greatly facilitate their elimination. It is also due to this weight in the overall system that the mechanics are more complex than one might think: the entire progression of the game, based on five different elements, is closely related precisely to the recovery of the spirit and its methods of use, and practically every opponent has special moves (easily recognizable by a strong red light before the attack) which, if dodged properly, largely regenerate it, sucking up as much from the enemy. What's more, deflecting normal attacks decreases the ~total bar~ of the enemy spirit, and the more you learn its patterns and defend yourself perfectly, the faster you can dominate confrontations by performing brutal executions. But let's go back to the elements, because, having mentioned them, we believe it is appropriate to detail their contribution to the regeneration of this fundamental bar, and how this affects the development of one's alter ego and his fighting style. Basically Wo Long has no classic statshe from RPG and at each level the experience points earned are used to raise an element between water, wood, fire, earth and metal; each choice raises the character's life points by the same amount, and has a normally unique effect on spirit consumption. To give some examples, fire regenerates it faster with normal attacks and consumes less when using martial arts, earth leads to greater regeneration with perfect dodges, metal makes sorceries cost less, and so on. Many therefore could decide to develop their warrior based on how much use they make of this or that other maneuver, or even just on their skills (masters of dodging will love the increased regeneration of a land specialization, for example); the truth, however, is that the majority of players will choose the elements based on two other factors: the scaling of the damage of the weapons and the power of the spells. More Gameplay and Balancing: Forest of Flying Slaps There is certainly no shortage of magic in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. However, the more powerful ones will be closed to you until the end of the campaign. Don't forget to get them back Starting with sorceries, there are various reasons why they are central to this selection to say the least: they are powers that can be obtained gradually as you level up (all of them are obtained without difficulty, with some particularly powerful spells locked after completing a specific advanced mission), and their use in combat is undoubtedly among the main distinctive elements of any ~build~ devised by the players. Using the more advanced ones requires a certain amount of investment in the specific element of use, and their effects are diversified to say the least, in addition to applying very useful specific statuses. Between power-ups and de-powers, simple ranged projectiles, ground traps, and a long series of other goodies (some elements, such as water, even have movement powers or temporary invisibility) it becomes very easy to adapt them to your needs in battle, to the weapons used, or even just to the next boss to be eliminated. The weapons, on the other hand, have undergone a significant simplification process: their number has increased, but the Nioh skill branches with a myriad of maneuvers available to the player have disappeared, and now each blade (or mace) is limited to having fixed quick combos and a specific charged attack, as well as martial arts that can be activated with the spirit. Beware, the movesets are still very unique, and taking into account the speed and range of each tool remains fundamental; one cannot expect to swing a huge ax or halberd as quickly and confidently as a pair of assassin's blades or a light sword. Other than that, their damage scales similar to souls again and could lead many to specialize in certain elements for personal preference in combo animations. Dodge is the most important maneuver in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. Learn and master it and nothing can stop you Although what has been described may seem like an excessive reduction of the offensive options, we fully approve the choice of Team Ninja, since, where the previous titles were much more linked to the personalization of the protagonist and his devastating potential in the advanced levels, Wo Long clearly wants to distance himself from this idea, offering a much more balanced gameplay, linked to reflexes and defensive mechanics. Excessively complicating things would have led to serious imbalances (which in fact are present in Nioh and Stranger of Paradise) and distorted everything. Furthermore, with the martial arts already mentioned, another factor that cannot be underestimated is inserted into the equation, considering that these active maneuvers are in some cases so useful that they can completely replace the spells if the character is built around their use. But we'll talk about equipment and how it can be used to support your playstyle shortly. Now it's time to stay on the balancing issue, and to delve into what is perhaps the most ingenious gimmick of the entire game: morale. To make Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty a more markedly action experience with a more stable level of difficulty than the previous works of the house, Team Ninja has focused on a design solution designed to be a sort of ~container band~ of the system, namely morale. In practice, in every map of the game the player starts with this value at zero, and if he doesn't raise it not only cannot he freely use sorceries (the use of which is also limited by the morale obtained and not only by the level of the elements), but is likely to take themes", "date": "2023-03-02", "grade": "8.5"}
