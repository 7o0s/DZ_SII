On the contrary, it is a design studio founded in London with a 10-year career behind it, and capable of expanding by adding two branches in New York and Malm to the English headquarters. Ustwo's main activity is therefore fundamentally that of providing digital services and creative content to important international partners (Sony, Nokia, H&M, Google), while the creation of video games is to all intents and purposes a secondary commitment. However, from which more than interesting projects were born, such as the puzzle game Blip Blup and above all the endless runner Whale Trail, with the latter which - after the freemium breakthrough - has occupied the upper floors of the App Store rankings for a long time . After a long period of silence, the team has decided to return to the scene with a new game, entitled Monument Valley; and it can be said with absolute certainty that it was worth the wait... If you have an iPhone or iPad, do yourself a favor and buy Monument Valley now The impossible is real Monument Valley is one of those titles that reconcile with mobile gaming. Among hundreds of clones, of games all the same that fill the rankings and the pockets of developers with in-app purchases, there are in fact works like this, driven by original ideas and extraordinary artistic flashes. In this specific case, the English team was evidently and openly inspired by the works of Maurits Cornelis Escher, a sublime Dutch artist famous for his impossible constructions, created by playing on optical illusions and the deceptions of perspective. Escher himself was probably influenced by the objects conceived by mathematicians Lionel and Roger Penrose, such as the infinite staircase and the impossible triangle. If you have no idea what we are talking about, a quick Google search will be enough to immediately bring to mind famous and fascinating works. Monument Valley starts from these creations to base its gameplay. The story, absolutely minimal like the rest of the game, talks about the journey of Princess Ida through various monuments inhabited by the people of the Crows, which in fact constitute the levels to be faced. The aim is basically to find the way to reach the exit; a journey that apparently appears to be non-existent, but which can in fact be discovered by acting with the fingers on some interactive elements, exploiting the magic of perspective and the manipulation of objects. It is therefore essentially a puzzle game that is anything but complex in terms of mechanics, but nonetheless very intriguing and engaging, balanced and extraordinarily evocative. In this sense, the level design always manages to convince, maintaining a constantly high level, evidently the result of months of careful work and meticulous labor limae. The extraordinary artistic key is also an essential element within the economy of Monument Valley: pastel colors, dry and essential lines, structures suspended in the void accompany the player on a sort of dreamlike journey in which questions have no answers, where the absurd is more real and tangible than reality itself. The quality of Ustwo's artists and designers is simply crystal clear, and the awareness of this comes through the possibility of taking photos of one's journey, to then be shared on Facebook and Twitter. The sound component is also spot on, with a barely mentioned accompaniment but nevertheless absolutely present and protagonist of the overall atmosphere of the game. It should be emphasized that Ustwo's fatigue does not require particular efforts to be addressed: with the exception perhaps only of the last level, the rest of the adventure flows away without ever putting the user in the slightest difficulty. This is certainly not a defect, but rather a clarification: Monument Valley is fundamentally and above all a journey, flowing smoothly, without frustration, as rewarding to see as it is to play. Those who need a minimum amount of challenge to be able to have fun, however, know that this is not the place to satisfy their needs. The only real weak point of the package is therefore ultimately the extreme brevity of the adventure, which requires a total of an hour or so to complete the 10 levels present: the possibilities offered by the App Store obviously leave the door open for any future updates capable of remedying the problem, and in this sense the excellent response from the public that the game seems to have obtained despite the ~non-standard~ price of  3.59 can help in this sense, cas confirmed by the same team via Twitter. In the current state of things, however, Monument Valley is therefore an adventure as beautiful as it is fleeting.", "date": "2014-04-10", "grade": "9.0"}
