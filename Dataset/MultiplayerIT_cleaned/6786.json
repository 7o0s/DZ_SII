Well, let's start from the end: what does the Storm Warning Edition have more than the original edition? In addition to graphics remastered at 1080p and a frame rate which in this case does not suffer from noticeable drops in the most agitated situations, EKO Software's title arrives on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (as well as on PC, with an all-encompassing pack) with all included the DLC released so far, so as to guarantee an even more substantial experience. In fact, the downloadable contents see the introduction of a fourth character, Nina (which joins the already present Abby, Jack and Kenji), as well as some extra objects and two new modes: ~One chance to escape~ and ~Barricades~ . The first represents a distinctly hardcore interpretation of a game that in itself offers a challenge that is anything but trivial, providing us with a single life to survive the nightmare of an island that is only apparently deserted, in reality populated by hordes of living dead who can't wait to taste our flesh. The second is also characterized by a hardcore survival-style approach, as we are asked to protect two of our friends for as long as possible (one of whom is dying and forced onto a stretcher) from the zombie attack. The assault takes place at night, so we will have the opportunity to explore the scenario during the day to collect resources useful for building barricades (precisely) and defense devices, so as to bear the weight of the invasion and end up beating the undead who manage to overcome unscathed the walls that we will have erected to protect the area. The two new modes also support cooperative multiplayer, both locally and online, alongside those that those who have tried How to Survive already know well, namely the ~Story Mode~ and the ~Challenge Mode~, respectively a multifaceted campaign, with specific missions and an accompanying storyline, and a group of eight rather difficult challenges, each set in a different location. During our tests they encountered many difficulties in accessing the online sector, but we suppose that this is perhaps due to the novelty of the title and therefore to the lack of a large number of users willing to explore the cooperative mechanics rather than focusing primarily on the single game player. The Storm Warning Edition confirms the strengths and weaknesses of the original version of How to Survive Playstation 4 trophies The twelve Trophies contained in How to Survive: Storm Warning Edition are quite simple to obtain, as it is enough to visit all the locations in the game, the main and secondary missions. It is more complicated to complete the campaign on the higher difficulty levels, given that zombies are no joke... Dead and oxen of your countries If you've already read one of our How to Survive reviews (here the Xbox 360 version, here the Wii U version), you already know what we're talking about. The survival game developed by EKO Software catapults us onto an island with few survivors and many zombies, grappling with our character's primary needs (hunger, thirst, tiredness), to be satisfied cyclically, and the hope of staying alive in order to flee to a safe place, if it exists. During the exploratory phases we will be able to collect a large number of objects, blunt weapons and other, more complex ones, to be built using a crafting system that is immediate in its functioning but fairly deep. Moreover, paying attention to the phases of the day, given that at night fearsome predators will emerge from everywhere and the only way we will have to take them by surprise is to point the light beam of an electric torch in their face ... as long as we have of a charged battery. All by completing missions that will be assigned to us from time to time by the characters we will be dealing with, and which mostly consist of identifying certain things or reaching places that are on the starting island or on others that belong to the same archipelago: a knob could allow us to repair an old boat and remove the disturbance, just as responding to a distress call could plunge us into an even worse nightmare than the one we are experiencing. This type of structure, not particularly varied, appears very close to that of the most famous action RPGs but remains simple in its mechanisms, given that we will not have to take into consideration hit points, dexterity modifiers and so on. The growth of the character is completely linear and differenfrom one survivor to another, assisted by a skill tree that we will be able to travel in the direction we prefer, unlocking skills that perhaps have to do with survival or physical resistance, rather than with combat and precision. An interesting system, which however takes shape in a far from perfect way: even if the Storm Warning Edition puts a patch on the technical shortcomings of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, thanks to 1080p and a stable frame rate, stylistic choices remain that are often repetitive and devoid of personality. Added to this is a too basic combat system, characterized by a largely inaccurate collision detection, by a poor yield of impacts and by a control layout with a questionable configuration, as hitting an enemy by pressing a controller trigger is anything but natural . In short, the new edition of the game enriches the formula and optimizes where possible, but clearly does not revolutionize the experience.", "date": "2014-11-05", "grade": "7.0"}
