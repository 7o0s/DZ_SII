The curious fact is that these titles are not role-playing games. Since Last Word was also developed with RPG Maker, we expected it to focus like its predecessors on the narrative aspect. Much to our surprise, it's a real RPG, just very different from all the ones we've played so far. Or rather: the basic mechanics are the classic ones, but the context in which they are applied is surprising. Before going into detail, however, it is better to frame the game in its bizarre setting. In fact, the story takes up a lot of space in Last Word and, like its game system, it is nothing short of original. The story takes place inside a villa, the time of one night. The guests are members of noble families, with the exception of the protagonist, Whitty Gawship, whose family has fallen on hard times. The strange fact is that the landlord does not show up. There is only his haughty servant around, who limits himself to mistreating the guests and telling them to wait, perhaps enjoying the reserve of precious bottles of wine in the meantime. When the host finally enters the scene, the result is most unexpected. In its place there is in fact a mechanical mouth that seems designed to always have the last word, thanks to which it holds its guests hostage psychologically for an unclear experiment. In the role of the protagonist we must therefore talk to the guests and understand what is happening. In fact, all of them are linked to each other in some way and can provide important clues. What appears out of the ordinary is the society in which these people live. Indeed, it seems that in their world, strength is measured in the ability to dominate an argument. Whoever has the last word wins. In the background of Last Word there is a society that we discover indirectly in the course of the dialogues and which could resemble the Europe of the early twentieth century. We know that a military career is very important and that without a family title you are nobody. Unfortunately, the background is not very clear, and the whole story is often far-fetched. Since the antagonist spends most of his time offstage and seems unable to harm anyone, the guests of the villa look like bored eccentrics who wander around the house with nothing to do as in a Chekhov play. What drives us to continue is therefore not the narrative tension, but the taste that one feels in winning verbal duels. Thankfully there are plenty of these, and the way they translate social rules into game terms is Last Word's best quality. So let us drink a glass of water and we'll be ready to duel with words with you. Last Word is an RPG in which you fight with words, but which loses points precisely in the dialogues Said as it should be said Instead of fighting with weapons, in Last Word we have to face the other guests with blows of eloquence. The aim is to reach a certain degree of knowledge about a specific topic, after which one moves on to the next stage of the story. This argument is equivalent to the key that opens the door to the next level in a traditional RPG. There is usually at least one character who has the information needed to obtain the key and therefore he is the one to beat. Unfortunately, our opponent's level is always higher than ours. We just have to gossip with the other guests on the secondary topics and thus accumulate some experience points to level up. Even by interacting with some objects in the house, you can explore topics and discover new information about the game world. At a certain point, however, friendly chats are no longer enough and someone has to be challenged openly. You lose a lot of fights initially, but still gain experience points. To shorten the time, it will seem strange to you, you have to beat a low-level opponent over and over again. In short: the classic ~grinding~, to use a technical term of role-playing games. However, the low-level victim is always and only one, poor Seymore, the only character in the game with whom it is easy to sympathize. In fact, Whitty treats him like a punching bag, although she claims to do it to help straighten his back. As we see it, if there's a hero in this game, it's him. Once a challenge has been issued, however, whether it be Seymore or another opponent, the aim is to reach the extreme point of a graduated bar, while thechallenger was to reach the opposite point. By balancing three distinct ways of speaking, you increase resources with which to strike your opponent and gain ground along the bar. However, there are numerous factors to take into consideration during duels, and certain challenges against higher-level opponents quickly become epic verbal contests. The only drawback is that in the long run the fights become repetitive, with only six guests available. But Last Word lasts as long as it should: a good three hours, during which it's hard to get bored. Plus, the funny gimmicks don't end with word duels. In fact, there are special abilities that are activated by accumulating bow ties and a cat that takes the place of the classic RPG merchant. Everything would therefore be fantastic if it weren't for the fact that Last Word slips right where we least expected it, namely on words. Unfortunately there isn't much life in the characters' sentences, they all keep the exact same humor from start to finish. Also, to be masters of speech, they are often short on low blows and psychological witticisms. A real pity because you risk clicking like crazy just as the characters are talking to cut short and proceed with the interaction, thus losing those interesting narrative threads which, although buried under hundreds of slightly watered down words, are still present. Last Word therefore fails to be a great game. Yet, the different elements that compose it, the successful ones and the lame ones, harmonize with each other according to inscrutable logic, making this role-playing game a mysterious and seductive video game. Therefore, also considering the affordable price, we recommend it to all those players who like to venture along unusual paths with a light heart.", "date": "2015-05-19", "grade": "7.4"}
