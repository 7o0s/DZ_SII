The first moves are rash. To select a unit, just click on it with the left mouse button and, having chosen its destination on the hex map, click again to make it move. Fighting is just as simple: just select a unit and click on an enemy within its range and that's it. Everything seems so immediate that one is led to underestimate a series of factors which we will discuss in the course of the review. Even the presence of the hero is a harbinger of deception: one hopes/fears that, as happens in most of the recently published strategy games, it will be enough to make him invincible to have an easy life. Nothing more wrong. A hero is certainly a troop stronger than the others, but it is still extremely fragile and, under certain conditions, can take massive damage even from troops of a much lower level (for example a general on horseback left on improper terrain such as a forest can be shot down by smaller, nimbler troops like goblins). Obviously it can be upgraded, but don't think in the slightest that, even if of a high level, a hero can win a war alone by defeating dozens of enemies. Indeed, overestimating it is lethal because the death of the leader entails total defeat. I hazard We were saying that the initial simplicity is deceiving, in the sense that the first moves are dictated more by the experience with other titles, in which the first missions are mere tutorials that can also be overcome by moving the mouse with the tongue and pressing the keys with the eyebrows; then you advance calmly, you face the few enemies without getting too many problems and you don't take into consideration the damage suffered. This way of doing, however, soon turns out to be harmful. After a few rounds of play you realize that you can not recover energy, that the CPU is not the usual naive and risky moves lead to total defeat. Let's get to the concrete: you have to cross a river to get to conquer a stronghold held by a unit of orcs supported by two units of goblins (one of archers and the other of foot soldiers). The only point to pass is a bridge connected with a destroyed village. The alternative is to go through a swamp to the right of the bridge. Taken by the excitement of the first game, we move some troops into the swamp and let one pass over the bridge. The tactic turns out to be harmful: the troops in the swamp are targeted and destroyed by the goblins, the troops passed through the bridge, weakened by the previous clashes, are unable to do enough damage to the orcs in the stronghold and suffer other wounds that make them weak. When we take the situation back in hand we find ourselves having to deal with a sad reality: we can no longer do it. The limit of fifteen turns needed to complete the mission is approaching and we no longer have enough strength to face the enemies. It is at this moment that we find ourselves looking back on all the mistakes we made and understanding the nature of the game. And it's always time that we are forced to reconsider all the other factors that make up the battlefield, including the capabilities of the troops, the type of terrain on which it is best to have them fight, the way they explore the map and everything that makes the simil unknown Fantasy Wars a gem the likes of which have not been seen in a while. Hope is the last to die Having passed the first mission on the second attempt, we are going to tackle the second, which is very similar to the first, although more difficult. However, it is from the third that the game reveals all its cards showing all its depth. The positioning of the troops in two different areas, to be carried out at the start of the battle, immediately makes us aware that there is something different than before. It is only when we find ourselves surrounded by rival troops that we understand: things get serious. If in the first missions mistakes were paid dearly, in the advanced ones committing too many becomes lethal. Advancing badly exposes us to attacks from multiple fronts. Betting everything on brute force leads to initial victories that prove harmful due to the excessive weakening of the army due to indiscriminate clashes. On the other hand, advancing too slowly means sure defeat due to running out of turns. What to do? A hero is certainly a troop stronger than the others, but it is still extremely fragile and, under certain conditions, can take massive damage even from troops of a much lower level Hope is the last to die When the units in the field become many, you have to get to know them properly, make them grow in a rational way (for example on a mapfull of woods it can be useful to have troops assigned defensive bonuses when they are among the vegetation) and make the most of them without making rash moves but also without showing excessive submissiveness. It therefore becomes very important to develop interchangeable dynamic strategies that allow you to deal with different situations and that also try to take into account potential surprises, such as sudden attacks by unexpected enemies that can cause real reversals in the fate of the battle. It is also essential to better prepare each battle, evaluate the mistakes made when you were defeated, rethink the initial positioning based on the troops you faced, better evaluate whether it is better to have more long-range, flying or skilled troops in melee and buy the necessary ones at the beginning of each fight without believing that having the most powerful ones is enough to win. Sometimes, even in case of victory, it's better to replay the mission you just carried out if the number of troops lost is too high; the risk is to negatively affect the next mission (each troop can be used throughout the campaign, provided it remains alive, of course). One last note before moving on to the commentary: the game is completely translated into Italian: both written and spoken texts. The level of translation is excellent and the dubbing is of a good standard. Comment In short, you will have understood that we are not talking about a game for everyone. Especially the advanced missions of each campaign are blood spitting and require some dedication. Those looking for easy and immediate satisfaction will be deeply disappointed. So, before going to buy it driven by the vote and the more than positive review (you read the reviews, right?) take into consideration some factors. Do you love true strategic games where strategy counts more than the indiscriminate and random accumulation of troops? Don't let yourself be frightened by extremely demanding challenges? Don't you cry if your army, however numerous, is taken out by a small group of enemies because you have completely taken the wrong approach to battle? If the answer is yes to all three questions, then rush to buy Fantasy Wars. If, on the other hand, you are less inclined to face difficulties that test your brain and tactical skills, forget it; it might not be for you. Pro Long-lived and deep The interface is simple and clear from the very first game Finally a strategy game where you have to use strategy!

In 2008 we never expected to become passionate about a turn-based strategy game with a map divided into hexagons, and instead here we are talking about a small masterpiece which, shunning the latest commercial trends, while presenting itself with a captivating albeit stereotyped look, manages to restore strength to a genre now considered niche. That the path taken by Nobilis is unconventional for these times characterized by the search for immediacy at all costs can be understood from the first mission of the first campaign (there are three campaigns in total): at a medium difficulty level you have to work hard a lot to overcome it, while already from the second mission the difficulty goes well beyond the average of other and more famous representatives of the genre such as Heroes of Might & Magic V which, in itself, was by no means a walk in the park. Yet, at a superficial glance, everything seems normal: the hero is there, the troops can be leveled as well, the plot is very classic and trivial and the interface is very simple but hides a great depth of game.", "date": "2008-02-28", "grade": null}
