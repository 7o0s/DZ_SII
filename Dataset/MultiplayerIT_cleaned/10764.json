Anchorage is not a completely disappointing package, the problem is that in itself it does not contain a tenth of the elements that made the return of this historic saga great. The Pitt deepens the expansion approach by also bringing into play other factors of the Fallout experience, namely those of the descriptive goodness of the setting, the charm of the quests and that sick spirit that reigns from the beginning to the end of the game. However, it remains a rather short experience and which still lacks many factors to be considered a real extension of what the Multiplayer.it editorial staff voted as a game of 2008. The Pitt is north of the Fallout map. An area recovered from the troglodytes, a new form of mutants, by a handful of soldiers who have found refuge there by collecting metal sheets and working them to build a fortified city, capable of prospering and growing faster than Washington DC. Society is quite clearly divided into two classes: the soldiers, who go into the wasteland to look for food and new recruits, and the slaves, or workers, who spend their days cutting and smelting metal to build the new city. . For both there is a problem, that is an unstoppable epidemic that sooner or later turns everyone into troglodytes and the player's task is to support (or not) a group of rebels who have learned of a miraculous cure, kept in secret by the head of The Pitt. Where Anchorage was little more than a fps on rails with some RPG vein, here we return to talk about a well-articulated quest, with an alternative ending and with a setting worthy of the best Fallout 3 sub-quests. The Pitt is however in a separate area of the map, but you can enter and exit at any time to return to complete outstanding tasks (not many to tell the truth) or to buy certain items. However, the feeling of a partially castrated version of the game remains, either because most of the main characters after just one conversation do not add parts of dialogue, or because the maps, even among the best made by Bethesda, are few and because, not counting a particular goal, the game ends about four without too many second thoughts. Even this new expansion, therefore, while substantially improving what was done for Anchorage, is still far from what Bethesda did at the time of Shivering Isle for Oblivion, which managed to replicate in all respects what happened in the main adventure. Fallout is exploration, rather than entertainment, and it is love for narrative detail, rather than cinematic dynamics, limited as it is by the cold expressiveness of the few facial movements of all the NPCs, or by the total absence of cut scenes that can enhance the points nodes of the plots told. Hence, having to focus on little more than a main plot, albeit good, but not being able to exploit it properly, it remains a distressing place and graphically really well done, but which will not be able to leave its mark, except in those that really don't they can do without other hours in the company of the Bethesdas. The hope is that with the planned third and final expansion, the team will aim for a true extension of the world of Fallout, with all the unique features that make it one of the best games of recent years. And maybe they pay attention to some bug that forced us to recover previous saves to get to the end... Comment With this expansion, Bethesda redeems itself in the face of the very high expectations of those who loved Fallout 3 as one of the best titles of 2008. The atmosphere and setting of the main game are there, but still missing that underlying plot, quests and complexity of possible outcomes that have given life to a pulsating world full of surprises. The problem, here too, is that however good the intentions may be, the structure with which these two expansions were built fails to fully do justice to the potential of Fallout. Those who have stripped the main adventure will almost certainly appreciate this The Pitt.Pro AtmosphereMain QuestArt by Pitt Against LongevitySubquest numberA few bugs Xbox 360 - Goals Of The Pitt's 100 points, 80 are achieved simply by finishing the main quest and without distinction for the choices made during the game.
