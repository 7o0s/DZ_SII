{"name": "Kona VR", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kona-vr-recensione-202087.html", "text": "The setting is one of the most important aspects for games that make use of virtual reality. Feeling in all respects in a world different from the real one can in fact offer gamers that something extra that the technology of PlayStation VR and similar has always promised, however managing to balance the gaming experience on and off from a point of overall view. As for the charm of the setting, Kona certainly knows its stuff: released at the beginning of 2017, the game by Parabole is now back to being talked about, thanks to the publication of Kona VR. As you may have guessed, this is an update that allows you to play the title in virtual reality, available for both PC (HTC Vive) and PlayStation VR. We took advantage of this last platform to return to investigate the events that took place in Atamipek Lake, in order to express an opinion on this Kona VR. The plot: a mystery in the cold and frost In terms of content, Kona VR remains the same as Kona, in the sense that Parabole has added virtual reality to the game that already existed, adapting it to the control dynamics offered by PlayStation VR. For this reason, most of the things written on the occasion of our review of about a year and a half ago remain completely valid for deepening one's knowledge of this title. However, since plot and setting are two important elements of Kona VR, it is worth giving a refresher on the story that sees us engaged in the role of a certain Carl Faubert, a private investigator. A new job takes him to the imaginary area of Atamipek Lake, in the Canadian region of Quebec: a very inhospitable area due to the cold, where a community of native Cree has come into conflict with the wealthy industrialist W. Hamilton, client of the protagonist . Upon arrival at the place Carl will find a deserted country waiting for him, where a series of mysterious murders lays the foundations for the adventure that we find ourselves living with a considerable sense of unease on our shoulders. Why did all the survivors run away in a hurry? What is so frightening about Atamipek Lake? Kona VR shines especially in its initial part, managing to raise such questions in the player's mind. Unfortunately, the development of the plot fails to maintain the charm of the early hours, up to an epilogue that can leave a bitter taste in the mouth. However, Carl Faubert's story deserves to be experienced if you love the ~Nordic~ setting of Kona VR, where you can get lost in the white of a snowstorm that seems to never stop. Playstation 4 trophies Like its twin, Kona VR has a total of thirty-six Trophies: one Platinum type, five gold, twelve silver and eighteen bronze. Many of them are related to the completion of the main storyline of the game, but the list also includes some details belonging to minor aspects. The gameplay on PlayStation VR Having made the due presentations, let's see how Kona VR actually behaves once you wear your viewer on PlayStation 4. Let's start from the control system, compatible both with DualShock 4 and with the PlayStation Move coupling, represented in the PlayStation VR lenses with the protagonist's hands. The player can choose which type of movement to adopt to avoid motion sickness in the event that free walking bothers him, with a double alternative in terms of teleportation. In fact, you can choose to point to the place where to make Carl go, or advance through pre-established points, similar to what was seen in Batman Arkham VR with its hot spots. This last option is perhaps the best of the three, because it allows the player to approach areas of particular interest to find the elements necessary to continue the story of Kona VR, following the path determined by the developers. If you have a strong stomach and prefer free movement, it is perhaps better to rely on the DualShock 4 controller, which is more versatile in combination with this type of solution. Kona VR saves are compatible with those of the original game, allowing you to switch between virtual reality game sessions and others on the normal screen. The graphics: few lights and many shadows Already at the time of the Kona review we had highlighted what were the limits of this production, as skilled in representing the desolate and snowy scenario of Atamipek Lake as it is deficient in terms of optimization. With the arrival of Kona VR and virtual reality, the need to compromise with the PlayStation VR hardware makes things even more complicated. Opportunity to step into detective Carl's shoes in first person adds comAlso in the original game that pinch of involvement made possible only by virtual reality, thanks to which the sense of loss that envelops the player in the initial stages of Kona VR increases. However, from a technical point of view, the game has numerous limitations, starting from a really pushed aliasing to get to a graphic detail at the limits of acceptable, especially when it comes to having to read written elements. Moving from one part of the map to another, unfortunately, the loads found in the original game also return: if at the time they were annoying, breaking the immersive experience offered by Kona VR with virtual reality in this way only makes things worse.", "date": "2018-07-07", "grade": "6.0"}
