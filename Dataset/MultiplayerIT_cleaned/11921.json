Indeed, behind this title lies one of the last, great titles for Nintendo 64, released in a period in which the not particularly successful console of the Kyoto house was abandoning the scenes. Precisely due to the weakened public interest in the N64, the title never managed to cross the Japanese borders, thus remaining the prerogative of the lucky Japanese users or of the few Westerners capable of obtaining and using an import copy. Today, thanks to the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console and the Hanabi Festival which also brought to our parts games relegated so far to the Land of the Rising Sun, Sin and Punishment is available at a cost of 1200 points (12 euros). What was it yesterday Developed by none other than Treasure, a team revered -actually more at the time than today- for huge productions of the caliber of Gunstar Heroes and Radiant Silvergun, Sin and Punishment represented the classic swan song for Nintendo 64. Thanks also to the taste a little ~exotic~ and elitist made up of the aforementioned Japanese exclusivity, the cartridge has gained value among collectors and curiosity for many users, without ever being able to reach mass diffusion. The Nintendo production is a decidedly ~old school~ arcade shooter, so much so that it looks like a mix between Space Harrier, Starfox and Panzer Dragoon; the protagonist Saki has to cross levels - in this case on foot and not in flight - infested by aliens and creatures of all shapes and sizes, obviously trying to eliminate them one by one without pity with the supplied gun. The progression is automatic, since it is a shooter on rails and therefore the movement is not managed by the player; the only concessions are linked to lateral swerves and jumps, essential for dodging enemy bullets. The analog stick is therefore used to move the viewfinder that is always present on the screen, and it is possible to choose between manual or automatic target; the latter is obviously more comfortable and precise but less powerful. Finally, a kind of energy sword is available with which to hit close enemies or projectiles and thus make them bounce backwards, thus transforming them into weapons to one's advantage. It is therefore an absolutely action game, which requires you to remove all energy from the brain by concentrating it on the speed of reflexes and the trigger. The greatest source of difficulty, or rather of challenge, lies precisely in the need to control both the viewfinder and the protagonist at the same time, trying to avoid being hit and in the meantime eliminating the enemies. What is it today Sin and Punishment is the confirmation of how quality games are able to stand the test of time. Even from a graphic point of view, the effort of Treasure maintains its charm unchanged; of course, there are a fraction of polygons compared to those on which modern titles can count, but nevertheless it is evident how the Japanese team had managed to practically bring out the maximum made available by the Nintendo hardware, and with great style. Yes, because the dozens of enemies on the screen at the same time ready to attack are a good sight even today, as is the typically ~dark~ manga art direction, the solid frame rate, the huge bosses and the variety of settings offered. But above all, Sin and Punishment is a fun game, which confirms the great skill of a team that probably showed its best in the shooter genre. The major flaw, if not the only one, must therefore be sought in the extreme brevity, which can lead to reaching the end of the dozen levels in just under two hours. Sure, there are 3 difficulty levels that invite you to replay it at least a couple of times, but don't expect great things. Despite this, Sin and Punishment undoubtedly remains one of the most valuable titles that the Virtual Console has in its catalog today; By buying it, you'll be doing yourself a favor.", "date": "2007-10-18", "grade": null}
