Unlike other video games bearing the LEGO brand and inspired by famous mostly cinematic franchises such as the aforementioned Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean, but also Harry Potter and Indiana Jones, LEGO Battles games are not hybrid platformers but real real-time strategy designed to appeal above all to the youngest audience thanks to the simplicity and immediacy of the gameplay. The idea, however captivating, is unfortunately undermined by various problems that make this new episode superfluous and inconsistent. Let's see which ones. Brothers Knives While the first LEGO Battles was inspired by various themes among those that make up the boundless universe of LEGO construction kits, this second appointment focuses only on the recent Ninjago brand, consisting of a mix of mythology and science fiction: ninja, magic, arcane powers and technological vehicles are at the center of the war between two brothers, the positive Sensei Wu and the evil Lord Garmadon. The latter, at the head of the Skeletons army, wants to take possession of the magical weapons bequeathed by his father and this evil intention unleashes a war between the two brothers: divided into four acts per faction, it basically constitutes the ~campaign~ of the game and the theme of the missions that we will have to face. The story is told through the nice cutscenes typical of LEGO video games, which do not take themselves too seriously and outline characters and situations with silent irony. Unfortunately it is perhaps the best element of the game, and it is not that it makes you cry out for who knows what miracle, since the rest is quite forgettable, starting with an incredibly uncomfortable control system. The actions that the player can carry out are scattered in a disorderly way between elements of the touch-screen and front and back buttons, so much so that in the most agitated moments it is literally uncomfortable to hold the Nintendo DS while trying to use the stylus and simultaneously act on the cross directional. The problem is significantly more funny in the light of the disarming simplicity of the gameplay: Hellbent Studios' proposal, mind you, is clearly aimed at a rather low age group, as demonstrated by the linearity of the objectives and the paucity of options in our ~armies~ , consisting of a handful of characters and few skills. However, the game struggles to clarify the function of certain commands or how to solve a mission, requiring a trial & error process that does not suit the nature of the product. Step back The inevitable presence of an infinite number of bricks and secrets to collect in the missions in order to later buy new characters or accessories to enhance your army. While trying to imitate the usual level of replayability to which the LEGO productions signed Traveller's Tales have accustomed us, this LEGO Battles: Ninjago unfortunately fails to hit the target despite offering a fair variety of game modes, which include quick personalized battles against artificial intelligence or, even better, a friend with a Nintendo DS and cartridge. Hellbent Studios certainly reveals its good intentions in offering an alternative to the campaign that increases the longevity of the product, but on the other hand the game remains and it could hardly be of interest to those who have lived more than a dozen springs. Moreover, LEGO Battles: Ninjago disappoints from a purely visual point of view due to a graphic realization absolutely below the standards of the ~old~ Nintendo portable console. If simplicity and essentiality make the LEGO universe special, Hellbent Studios has taken this concept literally by creating maps, settings and characters that sadly recall a low-budget production for mobile phones. The mini-character sprites all tend to look a bit alike and show very few animations, the choice of colors is also excessively clear and makes the already bare settings even more bleak. From this point of view, in short, much more could have been done even on the Game Boy Advance.", "date": "2011-05-16", "grade": "4.5"}
