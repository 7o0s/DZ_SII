Lately, however, the house of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest seems to have gradually increased its strategy in this area, embracing the latest trends with some enthusiasm. This does not necessarily lead to titles appreciated by historical users, indeed often on the contrary, but, as we see in this review of Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, games centered more precisely on the dynamics of use and mobile business models are emerging , which demonstrate the remarkable mastery achieved in this area. Unfortunately, this also leads to titles that move away from the historical tradition, for a publisher usually linked to types of games distant from these genres, but in some cases a way of half convincing. Considering that Octopath Traveler itself was also a rather experimental project, perhaps this favored its adaptation in this new form: its focus on the encounter of different characters along the way actually seems an invitation to decline it in the form of the gacha mobile RPG , even if this last feature always seems a sort of blasphemy, in front of the more traditionalist JRPGs. Square Enix has managed to exploit the idea in order to create a well-structured game in balance between its classical origins and the most modern trends of the mobile market, exploiting the charm of the world already built for the console chapter and modifying its history and progression to place them in the new context. The result is convincing as regards various aspects, such as the narration, the setting and the combat system, but the distortions of the free-to-play gacha system still emerge in the long run, pushing towards even expensive micro-transactions to get to the levels more advanced. Characters in search of stories Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, a screenshot from the game Like the progenitor, the story of Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent is centered on its characters and changes according to the choices we make at the beginning about the characteristics of the protagonist. In particular, the initial part offers three different paths with very different stories depending on the goal we set for our traveler: wealth, fame or power. Each of these desires opens a different path, leading to explore different environments and fight a particular antagonist, but all three are characterized by somewhat dramatic tones. Just the narration represents one of the characterizing elements of this game: although it does not shine in a particular way compared to other role-playing productions, the quality of the writing is certainly superior to most mobile RPGs with gacha elements and this is already an important distinctive feature .The gacha system naturally marries with a game strongly focused on the protagonists and on the possibility of expanding one's group, with over 60 different characters with which to get in touch, some of which with a narrative background to be discovered, especially the protagonists of the various banners proposed progressively. Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, HD-2D style remains fascinating The summoning of the characters follows the standard rules of the genre, with different rarity classes that correspond to the maximum achievable power: the drop percentages are in line with those typical of most gachas, i.e. minimum for five-star fighters that can reach the highest levels. It's clearly a system that pushes microtransactions and technically it's a pay to win, even if the absence of any PvP multiplayer element at least avoids the most annoying drifts of this genre of games. The idea remains that the application of this solution, moreover with very expensive in-app purchases (up to 100 euros for currencies, 30 euros for 10 summon pulls) dirty a pure JRPG born with very different intentions, but yes can say, if nothing else, that it is not one of the worst applications of the gacha. Gameplay and mobile adaptation Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, a screenshot in combat The tutorial is obviously long and tedious in this case too, but the menus appear quite clear and not too full of incomprehensible text or icons, which is quite rare in this type of experience. Perhaps the most positive element of Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent is the combat system, which appears to have been drawn heavily from the console chapter with some variations related to theabove all to the progression of the characters and their management, but remained otherwise as deep and tactical as the original. Here too we have a party of eight fighters arranged in parallel rows of four, with characters that can be swapped if necessary and a ~guard break~ system that pushes you to hit the enemy's weak point using particular weapons or skills with a certain insistence, to then be able to concentrate on more powerful attacks through the boost system. Also considering the amount of different specializations (jobs) that can characterize the fighters and the various upgrades that open up new slots for special abilities, in addition to the variety guaranteed by 8 characters on the field, it is easy to understand how the clashes are always quite stimulating, so much is true that autoplay is not even taken into consideration, despite the need to level up. - albeit conceptually free - is directed on very specific tracks that only require you to change direction with quick finger movements and there is not even support for controllers. On the technical side, Champions of the Continent convincingly takes up the ~HD-2D~ style that was so successful with the original, but there is still a general simplification especially in the use of 2D sprites. Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, a screenshot It must also be said that the graphic system is rather expensive and in many cases the game automatically downgrades to the lowest settings to try to maintain performance (in any case not very high), and in this case the graphics undergo a considerable qualitative decline. In any case, the glance remains truly remarkable and the atmosphere is always pleasant and particular, also thanks to a truly high-profile soundtrack. Finally, we point out that the dialogues (at least for the moment) are exclusively in Japanese and the text is all in English.", "date": "2022-08-02", "grade": "7.0"}
