In DC Universe Online the choice is up to us, and although it is not an original feature in the world of MMOs it is at least put in interesting terms. The narrative incipit of the title developed by Sony Online Entertainment in fact sees a battered Lex Luthor reporting to the various Superman, Batman and Green Lantern how a terrible threat is threatening the possible future of the Earth, that of an invasion by Brainiac's robotic troops . In fact, a few years later, Luthor and the other super-villains will team up and manage to defeat the heroes together, only to understand that they have fallen into a trap and find themselves defenseless in the face of the onslaught of the extraterrestrial android. The only hope for the planet lies in the Exobytes, nanomachines that Brainiac himself released into the air to acquire genetic information on super humans and which, controlled in this case by Lex Luthor, can flesh out the ranks defending the Earth by going to ~infect ~ hundreds of ordinary people, who then suddenly find themselves possessing special powers. Our character in DC Universe Online belongs precisely to this new generation of heroes or villains, and after selecting the faction and the game world (PvE rather than PvP) we will be able to modify its appearance and capabilities based on many parameters different, most of which are also available to free users, while others are the exclusive preserve of subscribers. In addition to the build, costume and powers, we will also be able to select a mentor for our alter ego (Superman, Batman or Wonder Woman, in the case of the ~good guys~), with whom we will often have the opportunity to collaborate and who will determine the initial scenario in which we will carry out our missions. DC Universe Online comes to PS4 on the strength of its extensive content, but the experience retains its rough edges New generation, old game Three years have passed since the launch of DC Universe Online on PlayStation 3 and PC, while the arrival on PlayStation 4 coincided with the launch of the new Sony console. Time has certainly given the developers the opportunity to solve a series of problems, but those who expected an enhancement of the technical sector with the transition to the next gen will unfortunately be disappointed: beyond the higher resolution (1080p) and a fundamentally stable frame rate (however limited to 30 frames per second), the game is exactly what we already know, with its few merits and its many defects in aesthetic terms. The pop-up is sensational, so much so that you have to approach the roof of a building or an open place for the characters, allies or opponents, to ~materialize~ above it, which the radar punctually reports instead. Likewise, the polygonal complexity of the scenarios has remained unchanged and the glimpses of cities such as Metropolis remain rather anonymous, fortunately alternating with something more valid when it comes to the Gotham City setting. Our hero, as well as all those who move on the same server (the game remains cross-platform, which is undoubtedly a big advantage in terms of active population), is characterized by decent but far from spectacular animations and indeed often ~old gen~, while the design of DC superheroes properly so called is clearly inspired by cartoonish reality, that of bright colors and stylized anatomies, rather than the pages of current comics and least of all film reductions, which have always heralded a more ~dark~ and aesthetically believable vision of the various Batman, Superman and company. Go and strike We were able to access a series of DLCs to compose a more in-depth picture of the experience offered by this interesting MMO, which is still usable even by those who do not intend to put a hand in their wallet. As mentioned, free users run into some limitations right from the selection of the character's powers, given that certain skills are only available to subscribers, however the standard missions are the same, just as the procedure that leads us to move to various areas of the city (indicated from time to time on the map) to complete rather simple objectives, in this case the elimination of a certain number of enemies and / or interaction with a certain number of devices. Usually these actions culminate with a boss, and unfortunately it is in these situations that the combat system reveals all its weaknesses. Our character in DC Universe Online has two basic attacks and a series of special maneuvers that can be ~purchased~ as experience points accumulate, whether they are combos or attacks linked to our powers; however the variety ofthe clashes are scarce, and the hundredth opponent we knock out with the same one-two things actually start to get monotonous. Also because, beyond elements such as the parry and the lateral swerve, which should guarantee a comparison that is not based only on the level of the characters but also on the ability of those who control them, the SOE title retains some of the less pleasant traits of MMOs, such as the fact of remaining targets of enemies until you get very far from the hot zone, without the possibility of performing a more effective evasive action in case of need. Thankfully the experience isn't particularly punishing, and after a defeat you simply roll back to the last checkpoint. The importance of the premium DC Universe Online, on PlayStation 4 as on PlayStation 3 and PC, can be played for free without problems but presents the same obstacle on all platforms, or rather a very monotonous and repetitive first phase, which fortunately recovers at a certain point and culminates with good final sections which, however, lack a valid ~end game~, or rather extra quests that have the ability to keep the interest high even once everything has been seen and done. From this point of view, the purchase of individual DLCs or, better still, a monthly subscription that guarantees access to all expansions, powers and modes becomes essential. In short, after downloading the game for free and doing some missions, our advice is to invest 12.99 euros and evaluate the benefits of the legendary account for a month, which can then possibly be extended where the offer has convinced us. This is a much more convenient approach than buying individual DLCs, which are in fact all included in the premium membership (and now quite numerous).", "date": "2014-02-17", "grade": "7.3"}
