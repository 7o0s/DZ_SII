{"name": "L'ultimo rifugio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/178107-shadows-of-kurgansk-lultimo-rifugio.html", "text": "Shadows of Kurgansk is a survival with some horror elements in which you take on the role of a plane crash survivor who, having found himself in an unknown and disturbing environment, must understand what happened and why those who appear to be normal human beings try to kill him on sight. The game offers three modes: Story, consisting of the tutorial and the two single player campaign maps; Survival, in which you simply have to be able to survive as long as possible by doing what you want freely; and Adventure, in which missions are carried out in bursts always with the aim of surviving. The game mechanics are typical of the survival genre: at the beginning you have almost nothing, but slowly collecting raw materials and makeshift resources you get to be well armed and well defended, as well as full of food and water. You can imagine for yourself what raw materials are and how to recover them: rocks to split, trees to cut, fences to demolish, fuels to burn, contaminated water to purify and so on. How are objects built? Easy: selecting the recipes from the menus that make up the crafting section. If you have all the necessary resources, the item is made immediately, otherwise we are told what we are missing and how to get it. Unfortunately, the backpack we carry around doesn't have infinite space and if our loot goes beyond the transportable weight, the protagonist slows down in the grip of excessive effort, so choices must always be made. Not all objects can be built immediately: the recipes of some must be discovered, while others are related to missions. Still others require the use of a workbench, lab table, or stove. The values to keep an eye on are health, hunger, thirst, and psychic stability. The presence of shelters is inevitable, with the possibility of building makeshift ones in case of strict necessity, such as when you are outdoors at night in a particularly dangerous area. After twenty-four hours in the game, then a complete day/night cycle, you automatically level up and you can spend the accumulated experience points to improve the character's characteristics. So far Shadows of Kurgansk works well. It doesn't try to distinguish itself from the competition in the slightest, apart from the graphic point of view, with a cell shading that looks like the poor version of Borderlands 2, but the limits of its mechanics begin to manifest themselves soon and inescapably. Shadows of Kurgansk is yet another survival that does not offer any original ideas Dangers One of the most glaring problems with Shadows of Kurgansk is the combat system, which simply doesn't work. As already mentioned, the protagonist can create many different weapons. Between rudimentary tools such as wrenches or badly finished axes, and more complex weapons, such as pistols and rifles, there is no shortage of tools to fight. Too bad that doing it doesn't give any satisfaction, whatever weapon you use. In the meantime, it must be said that the enemies are for the most part questionable from a stylistic point of view, given that their clothing clashes with the setting. In short, hooded men who seem to come out of a New York vampire movie, demonic dogs and all the rest of the company are not in line with a desolate world constantly swept by radioactive anomalies and acid rain. We understand that by now in the most famous survival games a bit of everything can happen, because they are titles designed to say not much more than their mechanics and are often victims of a degrading kitsch due to the need to produce constant updates, but let's not exaggerate. This wasn't enough, the ~bad guys~ of Shadows of Kurgansk are also not very interesting to face, because they usually limit themselves to attacking the protagonist head on, taking his blows with indifference, and are more or less dangerous depending on the level reached: the stronger we are, the stronger they become. This results in situations that make progression really frustrating, with deaths caused by opponents who don't go down even after taking dozens of hits, identical in appearance (apart from some color) to those who died after a couple of well-rounded slashes settled with a simple wrench. Speaking of deaths, it should be noted that the respawn system also works badly: both that of the enemies and that of the character. Sometimes it happens, after being killed, to reappear in the midst of hordes of opponents from whom you can only escape, while other times you explore areas where there is apparently no one, only to be attacked by creatures that have appeared out of nowhere. In short, in Shadows of Kurgansk one is never calm, but in the ne sensegative. Surviving... little Another annoying aspect of the Yadon Studio title is the time management of the survival part. We know we are dealing with a title made with limited means, which evidently did not allow the developers to increase the size of the game world, but the two maps that make up Shadows of Kurgansk are really tiny. From this it follows that the values u200bu200bof the protagonist degrade at impressive speed. Just take a walk around one of the villages that can be visited, all made up of semi-empty and mostly identical houses, to find yourself hungry and with mental stability problems. How do timings and the game world relate? Simple: if the developers had opted to grant more extended times, the exploration would have been much faster. Probably too much, given that even as it is now Shadows of Kurgansk doesn't last very long, despite the different modes already illustrated. In terms of gameplay, with about thirty days you can see everything there is to see, and by playing a second time the times are shorter, since you already know what to do and where to find the resources you need. In total we are talking about a few hours of gameplay. Going too far with days isn't advisable, because the enemies just get way too strong. It should also be specified that there are few differences between the two maps that make up the single player campaign. Sure, the scenario is different, but the things to do are the same, aside from the main quests. It probably would have been better to have a single larger map, instead of two so limited and repetitive. The substance is that once the main plot, not very interesting, is exhausted, in Shadows of Kurgansk there is not much left to do and the incentives to continue doing what has already been done are very few. In short, it is a survival that cannot survive itself.", "date": "2016-12-28", "grade": "4.9"}
