{"name": "The Division 2 - Episodio 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-division-2-episodio-3-recensione.html", "text": "The Division 2 is a controversial product: praised by critics, it hasn't been able to break through to the public as perhaps was expected. The reasons are to be found in causes exogenous to the title rather than endogenous, given that in trivial terms the game is exactly what the first chapter should have been, refined and enhanced. An agglomeration of optimal choices both from the point of view of the post game and of the loot which is in any case fundamental in a title that falls into the ~looter shooter~ category despite the fact that it prefers the definition ~cover shooter~. In working on the review of The Division 2 - Episode 3, the last chapter of Year 1, we were transported with our agents to Coney Island among old familiar faces and some interesting news. Coney Island Coney Island is the iconic entertainment island of Brooklyn in the federal state of New York, the scene of a large part of the summer evenings of young people who fill up the famous Cyclone roller coaster every day. In The Division 2 however, the festive air has given way to smoke bombs, insulating tape and fluttering tarpaulins lashed by a night that does not bring anything good. The agents of the division are planning to find a cure for the virus and the man they believe best for them is called Vitaly Tchernenko. Rescuing this virologist from the clutches of Black Tusk on Coney Island won't be a walk in the park as old acquaintances will make their return with several surprises in store. The two main missions present in Episode 3 (namely: Baseball Field and Amusement Park) are well structured, as are all the missions of The Division 2. In fact, they offer what the player wants and needs, i.e. a diversified typology of challenge that allows him to face the following contents in an optimal way. These are not superlative missions, but still discreetly inspired above all thanks to the excellent level design of Coney Island which, although it is not a large map, has been structured in an intelligent way. In addition to the main missions, players will also be able to count on new extra content such as the raid and two new classified assignments (the latter very well done inside a detention center and a nightclub). The set of contents is therefore more than decent, able to satisfy each of the needs of The Division 2 players, from those who are looking for new challenges, passing through those who want to carry on the story and all the material connected to it and ending with those who instead enjoy collecting new loot between one mission and another. Flamethrower and Chameleon Episode 3, however, is not just missions: in fact, within the latest content of Year 1 of The Division 2, the guys from Massive Entertainment have included several new exotic armaments and interesting weapons, as well as a new specialization. As for the specialization, the agents will now be able to equip themselves with the K8-JetStream flamethrower useful for lovers of short-range combat. Together with the flamethrower, however, the new specialization comes with a shotgun as a sidearm and with a tantalizing variant of the shield as a skill thanks to which to buff all the allies who are behind it by increasing their damage inflicted based on the number of enemies that are attacked has in front. In addition to specialization, however, Episode 3 brings with it some new and exotic weapons: as regards the former, we will have a UIC15 MOD2 assault rifle, a Honey Badger assault rifle and a G28 Marksman semi-automatic sniper rifle. Above all, the Marksman proved to be really useful to use and also very flexible in different situations. As for the exotics, however, the Chameleon has been introduced, or a Vector 308 assault rifle with a special weapon skin that can change color and guarantee buffs to those who use it based on how much more precise you are in the hits sent on the targets. In short, also in this case we are talking about a quantity of introductions that is certainly not very large, but certainly able to offer enough fun and variables, with the Chameleon which has proved to be a truly unique and very fun weapon not only to play but also to see . Episode 3 of The Division 2 is certainly not a revolutionary and sublime content, but an episode that stands in the normality of a post-launch content of a genre such as the one to which the Massive Entertainment title belongs. Coney Island is a little jewel, not only for the intrinsic charisma of the island of fun for this we would have liked a few more missions between horror houses and abandoned roller coasters. Everything that is on the sidelines of the main contents, come the new specialization or the new weapons are decidedly positive, while remaining without peaks of excellence. Episode 3 is certainly the best of this year one of support, but now the eyes are focused on the future where Massive will have to demonstrate that it knows how to bring a great breath of fresh air.", "date": "2020-02-11", "grade": null}
