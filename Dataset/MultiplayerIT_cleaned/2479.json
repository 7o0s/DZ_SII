{"name": "Crazy Taxi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crazy-taxi_a.html", "text": "Taxi drivers you become As many of you already know, this game was first of all a very successful coin-op, after which it was also released for the Dreamcast, where it then really depopulated. It is therefore difficult that you have never seen it, or at least that you have never heard of it. In any case, it is not very complex to explain, even if until now you have not had a precise idea of what it could be. In this game it's basically about driving a vehicle, or rather, a taxi, through the ups and downs of a San Francisco-style city, where you'll have to pick up and take as many passengers to their destination as quickly as possible. To start we will have to choose one of the four taxi drivers at our disposal: Axel, B.D.Joe, Gena, and Gus. The only real differences that can be found between them are not in the driving, but in the different model of taxi owned, therefore the choice must be made exclusively according to one's tastes, and not according to actual characteristics. Once this is done, we go down the street, look for other customers and load what is right for us, after which he will tell us where we have to go and how much distance separates us from the destination. The countdown starts and off we go: it's total chaos. We go at full speed through the streets of one of the two cities (the first taken verbatim from the coin-op and the second created especially for the Dreamcast and shown here in full), with all the traffic that congests it, passers-by (who naturally cannot be run over), vegetation and objects that fill the various paths. The passage of time forces us to run like hell on the asphalt, off the asphalt, and even underwater, with our client constantly asking us to speed up and insulting us heavily if we don't, or if we crash somewhere. Before loading the next passenger on, however, we will have to pay attention to the time left, given that the ~need~ of the latter is characterized by a circle of various colors at their feet, which determines the difficulty (and the corresponding monetary gain ) of their transport, according to a color scale that goes from red (closer and easier) to green (further and therefore more difficult). The ultimate goal of the game, so to speak, is to make as much money as possible before the timer reaches zero, and in this regard we will also have to count on the tips of our customers, obtainable thanks to some combos that can be carried out by cutting curves and making jumps and slalom between the various vehicles, without being involved in accidents. Rather simple maneuvers to perform thanks to the bizarre behavioral routines typical of your vehicle: in fact, the distinctly arcade nature of the driving model adopted by the programmers is evident. The game offers the exact same options as the Dreamcast version, and the same scenarios: Arcade (the one in the arcade) and Original (created especially for consoles). In addition, just like on the Sega console, to increase its longevity, the Crazy Box has been included, a mode consisting of some mini-games, which has more of the function of making us practice with the various adventures that can be performed by our taxi. Conversion or repurposing? Graphically speaking, the work of the Acclaim, in carrying out the Crazy Taxi conversion, was absolutely perfect. Unfortunately, however, this is precisely the point. The conversion was all too precise, to the point of being able to call it more of a real ~re-proposition~. The three versions available to date (coin-op, Dreamcast and Ps2) are in fact identical to say the least, without the game having undergone the slightest technical improvement from one step to another. Not that there's so much harm, given that the frame-rate runs constantly at 50 fps even in the most chaotic situations, the two cities are large but very detailed and well done, and the characters and taxis certainly offer animations funny. The problem is that much more could have been done with the Playstation 2 hardware. Just see how, for example, the boring pop-up effects (concerning cars suddenly appearing on the road), which afflicted the now almost defunct Dreamcast (where, however, we remember that the excellent sequel to Crazy Taxi), are also quite embarrassingly present in this version for the Sony console. It will mean, however, that Sega will prove its true worth when it develops its games on Ps2 without having to go to DC first. As far as the background music is concerned, on the other hand, it certainly couldn't have been done better, because the presence of the songs of two groups such as the Offspring and Bad Religion happen to be a fagiuolo in a title whose soundtrack had to be absolutely unbridled. Rest assured that hearing these punk songs at full volume, while you go crazy in the streets of San Francisco, will charge you a lot. Thanks to the memorable phrases exclaimed by the taxi drivers and their passengers, the sound effects are also truly excellent. Playability VS Longevity The differences between Crazy Taxi and the rest of the car competition are all in the two words that give it its name, and which already give an idea of the schizophrenia that pervades this video game. No simulative ambitions, here you have to drive like we never could in reality. In short, it presents itself as the extremity of the ~arcade~ concept. Of course, this means that this title does not last forever, and in the long run its very immediacy will become a limitation. However, we must also underline how it is so new and different from the other racers in circulation, such as to literally capture the player, thanks to an exceptional gameplay to say the least. This makes the initial impact great: just hold the joypad for a few seconds to be completely absorbed by the vortex of images and become one with the game. Surely letting go won't be that easy. It must also be said that the lack of a real multiplayer mode, Crazy Taxi cleverly compensates with the possibility of holding challenges with friends to whoever achieves the most abundant collection and consequently the highest score, just like in the old days . Recommended purchase therefore for those looking for pure fun from a game, without too many frills and without too many keys to memorize. Ideal for an unforgettable evening at home with friends, or for a well-deserved hour of mental rest after study or work. And if you like the Offspring, have no more doubts and run to buy it. I'll leave you with a gem: whether you buy it, or whether you're still undecided, go and see this site entirely created by Crazy Taxi enthusiasts. It's in English, but you'll find all the detailed information you need: www.come.to/crazytaxi. Pros: Fun like no other Offspring music Gigantic cities Cons: Limited longevity graphics identical to that of the Dreamcast few game modes I can not believe it! Disbelief. This is the first feeling you get as soon as you pick up the Crazy Taxi package. Yeah, it doesn't quite seem real to see two brands that until recently were such bitter rivals a few centimeters apart. Yet it is so. Finally Sega and Sony have decided to bury the hatchet, starting, at least so it seems, a profitable (for them and for us) collaboration. At the beginning it's a bit like seeing a Lazio and a Romanista embrace each other during a derby, but we hope that over time the converted games will be so many that we will quickly get used to it. What is certain is that if all the titles produced by Sega are brought back to the Playstation 2 with the fidelity with which Crazy Taxi was brought back, this plot can only be positive.", "date": "2001-06-20", "grade": null}
