{"name": "7 Sins", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/7-sins-2.html", "text": "7 Sins is set in the Big Apple, and oriented around seven missions. Stage by stage, the player takes on the role of the typical rampant dude with no morals, thirsty for money and power and without scruples of any kind. The aim of the game is to accumulate money by any means, to engage in sexual relations aimed at pleasure, money or power, and in general to assert oneself strategically in the power relations of the missions. Accumulating points is equivalent to earning money by fulfilling the success conditions of each mission, and also corresponds to the requirements required to unlock them in succession. Much of the gameplay then consists of a series of strategic dialogues: each character has its own characteristics, is sensitive to certain themes (marked by different symbols representing power, money, romance, irony, flattery, culture, fame, sex, and so via) and consequently circumventable for our purposes, through a system that rewards our attempts to win the friendship, esteem, love, passion of the characters in the game for our interests. The interaction with the characters that populate it constitutes the main part of the game and takes place through dialogues, which present a variety of phrases from the distinct ~genre~. It will therefore be necessary to talk romantically to conquer the beautiful naive and idealistic woman, avoiding vulgar jokes or allusions in the first instance and enduring the irritating silly outbursts produced by the sweet young lady, perhaps pretending to donate the proceeds to the ~vegetarian orphans~; while to win the trust of the rude peasant boss it will be necessary to be synthetic, never repeat oneself and flatter him, accompanying himself with business talk. The rich noblewoman will have to be able to produce stereotypes and racisms without us insulting her, but rather feeling flattered, until the degree of trust is such as to make her confess that she steals from the shop, making it possible to betray her. In order to ensure that the transvestite buys everything we want in the shop, it will instead be necessary to display one's charm with rough jokes and vulgar irony, not disdaining naughty allusions. The system is a continuous test for error or success: in the first instance it is only possible to guess the characteristics of a character, but once you have tried different approaches, it will be clear which category of dialogues the character is inclined to, indifferent to or against. The ~cornerstone~ of this type of interaction is the relationship bar that we will build with our interlocutors (and future robbed, more or less lasting sexual partners, fans willing to give money away). Focusing on a dialogue or topic, in fact, corresponds to an increase in the level of the bar, which gradually advances from ~first contact~ to ~relationship~ up to ~flirt~, ~sex~ and ~passion~, with certain thresholds that can be overcome in suitable contexts (change to achieve) and which constitute the moment or transition beyond a relationship threshold or to change strategy; making a mistake, however, cools the relationship just as quickly, exposing us to the need to strengthen it. In game practice, for example, in the level where you work as a salesman in a ladies' clothing store, you will find yourself flattering the customers, conquering each one through the appropriate dialogues, letting the bar grow to the point where it will be possible to have sex in the cabin, to finally buy everything that is offered in the shop (with the possibility of stealing the proceeds), to borrow money, to cuckold the boss with his wife in his own office, and so on. However, winning over the characters has a decisive counterpart: three bars at the top of the screen, which represent the conditions of stress, self-esteem and sexual excitement and expose us to total and irreversible crises (with a drop in conquests and fame and a re-start of game) if they are not downloaded. In the case of stress, which grows by stealing or enduring the most insipid dialogues, it will then be a question of destroying furnishings, performing reprehensible acts such as urinating in the plants or in the boss's water dispenser, or imagining what to do with little animals. In the case of sexual arousal, which derives from conversations with the most attractive women, spying on necklines and tight skirts or touching assorted curves will help to lower the bar, while self-esteem - which hurts the boss's lecture or the wrong mini - sex game giving little pleasure to the partner - sex, success and theft are very beneficial - this is also necessary to conquer the most superficial women by offering left and right and pretending to be an acquaintance of this or that celebrity. Some actions - destroying furnishings, urinating in the sinks - take place in real time, while in the rest of the cases questsor it happens through mini-games. In some it will be possible to massacre small animals in the fantasy, hit the flies with the jet of urine over the toilet, fight with certain characters, in others it will be necessary - as in the case of sex situations - to find the G-spot of the partner or rotate the analogs successfully as if you caressed the breasts, in still others it will be enough to keep the cursor on the neckline marked by a target or press a suitable succession of buttons to voyeur, shoplift, or challenge certain characters in some types of games. All of this, combined with the scenes of sex and nudity (never complete), together constitute the fulcrum and the limit of the game, the playable whole to which everything boils down. As one transgresses, betrays and performs illicit or amoral acts, a bar of seven notches corresponding to the seven sins will fill up: it will then be necessary, to transgress again, to do something ~correct~ such as ordering or cleaning the dishes, to clean conscience and go back to sinning  perhaps, unfortunately, having to change the scene and go home because the particular environment in which we find ourselves does not allow us to expiate ourselves. The interaction, in fact, takes place in environments such as the shop, the sauna, the night club, and is ideally inspired by The Sims, complete with dialogues in typical Simsian speech. 7 Sins, however, not only does not have the class of Will Wright's title or its complexity, but it does not even reach the already low level of dialogue of Singles, with respect to which it has similar ambitions in terms of sentimental and love relationships through dialogues, even with the different mission - a little forced? boulders! - of the total transgression. On paper, the 7 Sins project may seem useless, adult, childish, politically incorrect and therefore exciting, exuding bad manners and therefore ridiculous, negligible or even exciting depending on tastes and perspectives: what's wrong, in any case , is the realization, both in technical and technological terms and in terms of game design. The biggest limitation of 7 Sins is the repetitiveness, banality and predictability of the dialogical relationships that are undertaken with the players. In fact, these relationships are structured in the more obsolete conception of tree dialogues, characterized by unilateral ramifications and always identical jokes: the interaction resolves itself into a sort of strategic game in which, having discovered the right cards, it is enough to explore all the places in which certain proposals will be successful. What matters worse is that these relationships are all practically unrelated to each other, despite the possible triangulations between the characters unlocking different possibilities. In particular, it is the criterion of time that leaks. The environments of 7 Sins are not small closed worlds in which our action allows the occurrence of more or less original interactions, but barrier fields that can all be crossed in the same way and isolated from each other. Indeed, overcoming a mission consists in losing the degree of relationship conquered in the previous one. Or, making gross mistakes with characters won't change anything about their future membership: only the bar will go down, while their future behavior will not be precluded in any aspect. To make such an incomplete game structure worse, a decidedly low-profile technical realization contributes, not so much on an aesthetic level (the models of the characters are pleasant and quite realistic, with well-rendered curves and sexual attributes of the young ladies who inhabit the game and will lend us their own thanks; while the music is mainly pleasant erotic funky) as for the level of interaction between man and interfaces: in 7 Sins everything, from the movements in the environments to the slow and cumbersome dialogues, from the game map to the loading, is only at levels just enough. Uploads, in particular, are tediously long and exhausting, taking minutes for a few meager environments or even a couple of seconds for dialogue to be interpreted by the machine. All this affects even more heavily on a game that offers little in terms of interaction: the dialogues are mechanical and exhausting; sex and incorrect actions soon leave the time they find, beyond the variants and variations on the theme; mini-games are played more out of necessity than pleasure, and are often impossible to pass due to poorly implemented control. In short, the proposal remained on paper. 7 Sins attempts to bet on a market in which adult-themed games can constitute a renewed source of income, but practically stops at the idea: there is not much concrete about the antimoral game centered on sex and mind games, andthe obsolete game design and the amateurish realization clearly show that the attraction of a ~hot~ theme, not at all developed in playful terms, was preferred to the creation of the interaction. Some element of lowbrow irony and the ~charm of sin~ elevate some moments of the game, but in all other cases information is mentally stacked on which dialogues to carry out, one returns home to atone for the sins by washing the dishes and, in the midst of all this languishes in the endless uploads. While giving credit to the idea behind the game, it is difficult to be won over by 7 Sins, let alone feel ~adult~ in playing it. So let's do the big kids well and let's all go back to princesses and mushrooms, because once again the ~adult themes~ cannot be played well. Pro Sin in power? The idea intrigues for wickedness Moments of good desecration Yes, it's politically incorrect Cons but of an ostentatious and posing impropriety A kind of Sims-clone, without the merits Above all: game design with holes everywhere Poor presentation and uploads unheard of No full nudes?! Wasn't he an adult? Courting and seducing, deceiving and indulging, inducing betrayal and misleading, shoplifting, robbing and beating, but also urinating in the sinks, spying in the locker rooms, destroying and assaulting things and people represent for MonteCristo the essential means to produce a game with the opposite morality to the ~dominant respectability~ of the videogame panorama. In 7 Sins the primary objective consists in climbing the pyramid of success, in obtaining fame, money and power, in satisfying vices and excesses without any rule or moral principle: in short, as the title suggests, living in the indulgence of the seven deadly sins , with a lot of attention to lust, some sporadic mea culpa and a large dose of cynical irony. Translated in terms of gameplay, the idea - in itself valid, so there is the rating for minors, or not?  is embodied in a sort of strategy and dialogue game that draws mixed inspiration from The Sims, Singles and the recent Playboy's Mansion, inserting itself and elbowing itself into the reborn vein of so-called adult games, which has returned to the honor of catalogs in recent years after a couple of generations of production stagnation. But the games of this vein, it is being noted, are more attentive to attracting by exposing digital ~merchandise~ than to entertaining the player with solid and long-lasting interaction, and 7 Sins is perhaps the most evident example of this philosophy. With big technical limitations, the idea of an incorrect and adult simulator of a smart-ass thirsty for sex and power has practically remained on paper.", "date": "2005-06-13", "grade": null}
