{"name": "Dino Stalker: Gun Survivor 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dino-stalker-gun-survivor-3.html", "text": "Guncon + Dino Crisis = Dino Stalker The rest is now (sad) history: not only Gun Survivor for Psone, but also Gun Survivor 2 for Playstation 2 (inconvenient, among other things, what was seen and destroyed with gunshots and rifles in the famous multi-format episode Code Veronica) have completely missed the target, due to a poorly implemented cosmetics (also due to an engine, unfortunately, unstable) and unfortunately cumbersome gameplay. Available for a few months in Japan and America, the pal version of Gun Survivor 3 arrives in Europe, this time inspired by the atmospheres breathed in the various Dino Crisis, strengthened by the promise of reviving the fate of an equally interesting franchise from oblivion. Let's see, therefore, if Capcom has kept faith with what was announced in the past months. Storylines Second World War, Atlantic Ocean, a young American lieutenant (just 23 years old), a certain Mike Wired, is shot down and thanks to an emergency landing he manages to save his skin, crashing into a dense jungle; finding himself with an unconventional weapon for those times (read = futuristic) and surrounded by tyrannosaurs, brontosaurs, pteranodons and what has already been seen in the (pre)history books, poor Mike, at least at the beginning, will be able to do nothing but survive, trying to figure out how it ended up there thousands and thousands of years ago and come back in the first half of the twentieth century. Luckily for him, our young lieutenant won't be alone, given that he will receive messages of various kinds over the radio from a stranger, as well as quickly making the acquaintance of a young girl named Pola, important for the purposes of a more than discreet plot that it will slowly come to life during your walks in the past, blasting all those dinosaurs, ready to give our hero a single mouthful. Revolution or involution? Those who buy a lightgun shooter know they are dealing with pre-established paths where the only interaction left to the player is to destroy everything that moves, innocent apart. However, the last great exponents of the genre have raised the enjoyment of this videogame typology, influencing with the course of events, more or less triggered by the player, the routes taken by the same (as seen, more clearly, in The House Of The Dead) . Dino Stalker, on the other hand, is usable in the same way as a third-person shooter, given that the movements that can be carried out are in the player's hand, no longer unable to follow a certain track; shoot down hordes of angry dinosaurs (grouped into a dozen distinct species), find certain objects (also and above all by destroying crates containing medkits and ammunition), win the (classic) final bosses, reach certain locations (abandoned cities, jungles , deserts, etc), keeping an eye on the time limit (fortunately upgradable through power ups to search far and wide) and above all the very useful radar (able to warn you of the presence of enemies in time) is what Capcom (by the hand of Flagship) offers in the seven tight levels enclosed therein. Unfortunately not everything, again, went smoothly: playing with the joypad, first of all with the basic configuration, is really frustrating and cumbersome, making the use of a Namco Guncon 2 a real obligation. Revolution or involution? Other problems with Dino Stalker reside in the flatness of the game in the long run, although the first signs seemed to presage full-fledged fun (freedom of movement, about fifteen and more secondary weapons and the possibility of sniping distant enemies), the low biting because of the radar that detects enemies (a hypothetical failure of the same, perhaps for a level or the ability to use the radar only under certain conditions, would have benefited both the plot and the gameplay) and the brevity of the adventure (to be avoided easier difficulty level), do not place this third installment of Gun Survivor in the Olympus of pistol shooters, letting the foremen to whom we owe the most famous sagas Time Crisis and House Of The Dead sleep peacefully. Graphics and sound Even in cosmetics, Dino Stalker suffers the prequels of deep beatings, although Playstation 2 has accustomed its delighted buyers to very different visual shows; a bad use of the cg, some very meager backdrops, contrasted with others that are decidedly well done, the presence of dinosaurs created and animated in a simply excellent way and a handful of special effects worthy of our attention, complete the visual offer of Flagship. Graphics and sound From the sound side, indeedce, good news from the point of view of massive sound effects (weapons in action, dinosaurs snacking on you, etc) as well as good digitized speech. Conclusions Gun Survivor 3: Dino Stalker is by far the best episode of the saga, although we are not yet at the levels that Capcom had repeatedly promised us with this release. If all goes well, a hypothetical fourth episode will perhaps be the good one to also count this saga among the unforgettable ones, alongside Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, Strider, Onimusha and so on. 7 A couple of reports before the summary box: it seems that Guncon45 (the legendary Namco lightgun included in the first episode of Time Crisis for Psone), despite being mentioned on the back of the package as perfectly compatible, doesn't work with the aforementioned game, at least according to the complaints received by a couple of shopkeepers in the writer's city; by finishing the game on all difficulty levels, numerous extras will be unlocked, from a collection of images, infinite ammo for secondary weapons and an at least dubious paired game mode, since the task of moving and shooting is divided among the players. Pros: Indispensable for those who need gun games Indispensable for those who love dinosaurs and games full of them Cons: Improved playability Very poor longevity Guncon + Dino Crisis = Dino Stalker CAPtive COMmunication (better known as Capcom) is certainly one of the most important software houses in the entire gaming sector; present for over twenty years, author of absolute masterpieces (Street Fighter, Ghost'n Goblins, 19xx, Bionic Commando, Resident Evil and Final Fight among others), belonging to completely different genres (matching or scrolling fighting games, platform, shooters, horror adventures and so on) and very few spots, perhaps one nonsense for every 100 masterpieces. Among these little videogame scribbles, born no one knows how from Capcom, the Gun Survivor saga stands out for its two ~qualities~: born to fight on equal terms in the pistol shooter sector, firmly in the hands of Sega (the trilogy of The House Of The Dead and the Virtua Cop bilogy) and Namco (the Time Crisis saga, also a trilogy soon) and strong in the idea (although good) of unifying the structure of the game and gameplay with the setting and the monstrous ~fauna~ of the profitable Bio Hazard / Resident Evil franchise, many were waiting for this Capcom excursus in a sector unknown to the Japanese software house.", "date": "2002-11-07", "grade": null}
