{"name": "Dragon Quest VIII: L'Odissea del Re Maledetto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-quest-viii-lodissea-del-re-maledetto.html", "text": "Dragon Quest changes its look For the average Japanese gamer, spectacular graphics and CG cutscenes are something interesting, complementary, but not a priority, the backbone of a game. This is why the Japanese software has always favored history, playability over the purely aesthetic and sometimes enduring tinsel of certain themed productions. However, and it is obvious, after so many years we realized that the time had come to change course, and to wisely combine technical quality intended as gameplay, with visual quality. Having effectively abandoned the ancient 2D engine that had characterized the series, DQVII on Psx included, Enix has focused on a new entirely 3D graphics engine. This engine, fortunately, has not only been used to manage a respectable aesthetic sector, but also for the representation, construction of really large areas to explore. The totally explorable landscapes that stand out as far as the eye can see are the most detailed and varied ever seen in a video game and range from vast prairies to hot deserts passing through the immense expanses of the sea to snow-capped mountains, large dungeons (although very similar structurally to those seen in Final Fantasy X), large and detailed cities and castles. The first game area, just to give you an idea of what we are saying, is so vast that if you want to visit it all properly, stopping to browse here and there, it can even take you twenty minutes to get out. Exploring a huge world A universe that has a beginning and an end, obviously, so as not to make the gamer lose the leitmotif of the game's events, but at the same time free to be explored in its entirety. As mentioned above, it can take tens of minutes, even hours, to carefully visit everything. It just depends on you, on your way of conceiving a similar gaming experience. Even Shenmue, just to give another example, was theoretically linear, in the sense that you could normally follow the course of events and get to the end in a certain number of hours, or really enjoy it, hanging around the arcade or the clubs , or the alleyways of neighborhoods, trying to complete sub-quests, mini-games, or simply strolling through an absolutely believable virtual world for the fun of it, thus finishing it with triple the actual hours needed to complete it. Apart from perhaps Wild Arms, in the memory of the editor and enthusiast of the genre, no other next-generation RPG has ever offered such a vast world to explore as this Square-Enix title. Let's just hope it bodes well for future RPGs from this and other softctos. The exploratory element is a fundamental component of the game, and is also enhanced by the presence of a first-person view that allows the gamer to be able to examine the surrounding environments in more detail at any time. Just as great importance has been given to the interaction with the elements that ~populate~ the various towns or the various places that can be explored. In these environments it will be possible to talk to the inhabitants to collect useful information or unlock side-quests, and interact with various objects such as barrels, vases, bookcases, wells and sacks, in which precious surprises are very often hidden. Or still play at the casino, which offers the possibility of doubling your money (but also of losing it completely) with Bingo, roulette or slot machines, or make purchases in the classic shops or stalls crammed full of weapons, protections and objects Of every kind. The map on which we orient ourselves is detailed and modeled on the geographical conformation of the territory, which allows us to understand the very structure of the areas that can be visited on foot right from the start. Furthermore, the route taken and the places visited are conveniently marked on the map, so as not to confuse the gamer, and to help him adjust for the best if he wants to return, which is feasible at any time, back without getting lost. Perhaps by moving around the various territories with some of the ~means~ of transport made available by the programmers, such as a ship or a legendary bird, which will also save us from too many random clashes. Plot Dragon Quest VIII confirms that it is a ~classic~ RPG also in terms of plot and setting. Wizards, castles, medieval villages, all key elements of the story in the purest and most traditional fantasy style, surround the story of a brave soldier of fortune without a name (the protagonist), traveling the world, looking for a magic scepter endowed with a terrifying dark force, stolen from Troden Castle by an evil and mysterious clown namedDholmagous, who transformed its inhabitants into stone, and the King and Princess respectively into a goblin and a horse During his journey, our hero will meet other characters who will join him in an attempt to recover the magical object and to stop the dictatorial aims of the evil clown. The story, while not being as complex or melodramatic as that of Final Fantasy X, is immediately captivating thanks to its unusual structure made up of ~real, present~ and ~past~ moments, relived through flashback sequences, from our favorites, which unfolds slowly, slowly revealing details and key elements of the plot. It is interesting to note how, should we lose the thread of the story, it is possible to interact with our travel companions to obtain vital information for the continuation of the adventure, which, as previously mentioned, given the dimensions of the world to be explored and in which is easy to get lost, proves to be very useful. Although not very large, the party appears well characterized, especially as regards the personality of each individual member of the group. Not to mention the strong visual imprint that only the hand of an artist of Toriyama's caliber can give to a character. The Battle System Graphics aside, the most interesting novelty of DQVIII is the ~old-new~ Battle System. It does not differ much from the one seen in the previous episodes of the saga (which is a good thing for purists of the genre), except, from an aesthetic point of view, the graphic restyling undergone by the menus, and from a technical one the two new ~ features that characterize it, and that we will analyze shortly. As for the technical aspect, the battles, random but not excessive in quantity, have the canonical turn-based structure, and usually start, as in the previous Dragon Quests, with a screen complete with a first-person view of our main Pg , and virtual camera that zooms in on the first monster in front of him. Then, when the actual fight begins, the shot shifts, ~resuming~ the entire scene. During the battle, the gamer will be able to decide whether to control only the protagonist, while the rest of the party will move automatically following one of the predefined tactics chosen by us prior to the clash, or all the PCs with the usual turn-based system via menu. In this sense, it should be noted that instead of the classic black windows, those seen in the Japanese version, in the American one we are dealing with, a more comfortable to use menu has been introduced, similar to Final Fantasy. The attacks are essentially divided into four types, the ~classic~ ones of any self-respecting RPG: ~Normal~ (ie with a weapon), ~Special~ (with the help of special skills), ~Magic~ and through ~Objects~ . And this is where the first of the features we were talking about comes into play: the ~Tension system~. This system almost appears as a sort of homage to Akira Toriyama and his Dragon Ball Z series. During battle, each character can logically carry out an attack. But if you avoid using it right away, this attack will double in effectiveness the next turn. If you continue to load the appropriate bar for the attack without ever performing one, your characters will assume the so-called ~High Tension~ or ~Super High Tension~ state, visible through the energy charge that will wrap your PCs in a similar to Goku and co. At that point it will be possible to launch a devastating and spectacular attack against the enemy. Obviously this condition of Tension will not be possible to always keep it to the end, at its highest level, as the adversaries will not stand by and will tend, hitting you in turn, to lower your level of ~tension~ so as not to make you use. Other than pokemon... Another feature that in DQVIII constitutes in our opinion a further enrichment of the gameplay, is the one that allows the gamer to capture and raise some of the monsters in the game as if they were Pokemon. Not happy with all the good things offered to us, in fact, Enix and Level 5 have decided to give ~space~ to the animal breeder who is in each of us thanks to the ~Monster Raising system~. The ~recruitment~ of monsters is not an absolute novelty for the saga, since it was introduced in Dragon Quest V for Snes, and is present both in the sixth episode and in some specific games set in the DQ universe such as Dragon Quest Monsters and Dragon Quest Monsters 2 (GBC) or Dragon Quest Monsters Caravan Heart (GBA). However here it appears a little more interesting than in the past, even if unfortunately the control of creatures in battle is no longer allowed to the user but will be managedito entirely from the CPU. Through the ~scout~ option we can identify some particular monsters on the map (they are the only ones visible during the exploration phase), and after having reached, challenged and defeated them, we will be able to recruit them to our ranks. Among these creatures, the faithful of the saga will not fail to recognize old acquaintances of the series. Another interesting novelty is the Camp Screen. At any stage of the game, the player can access the appropriate menu by pressing the select button. Once this is done, a detailed list of statistics will appear on the screen revealing all the data concerning the adventure lived up to that moment (time taken, distance travelled, monsters faced, etc.), options regarding the kitchen, various information on the bestiary of the areas explore and much more. Final notes for the audio sector. The music created by the composer Koichi Sugiyama is, as usual, of an excellent level and blends well with the narrative context in which it is performed. The musical genre adopted by the artist seems stylistically inspired by the greats of the past, the symphonic masters such as Bach, and effectively adding to the game an added value of great charisma and impact. Finally, the more nostalgic will certainly be pleased to know that as regards the various sound effects, explosions, battle noises, etc., there are sounds that have brought to mind the old DQs for SuperFamicon! Almost as if the authors wanted to further confirm their intention to mix the old with the new. The passage of time This type of offensive, as well as spells or other special moves, varies according to the PC, the weapon and its Level-Up, and takes place visually in a spectacular way to say the least, with a whole series of light effects and graphics absolutely spectacular despite their brevity. Here the sensual and ironic magic performed by Jessica stands out in particular, such as the 'Sexy Beam' or the 'Blow a Kiss'. To be seen absolutely. As in DQ3, in this last chapter of the saga there is a system called ~day/night~, which marks the passage of time during the adventure. This time change will not be sharp, but gradual (dawn, day, afternoon, evening) and will even be visible during battles. It will also have a very important function for the adventure, as well as aesthetics, with important implications for the gameplay. In fact, the passage of time plays a fundamental role in DQ: some villagers will only go out at night, for example, others will barricade themselves in their homes, perhaps leaving some valuable information pending until the next morning, while certain events or ~quests~ will be possible to be performed only during the day. Even the monsters change depending on the time of day you are in a certain area. Very realistic. In parallel to the adventure, DQVIII also presents a whole series of mini-games designed to vary the gameplay and to allow purists of the genre to fully enjoy the game, discovering everything that can be discovered. As in Namco's ~Tales of~ series, Enix has implemented a ~cooking game~ in its RPG. In practice, you are offered the opportunity to create weapons, various objects or armor simply by having fun with the so-called ~pot of alchemy~, thanks to which you can ~cook~, helped by special recipes recovered around the world, all that you think, inventing increasingly rare items from time to time. Character level up But who are our fearless fellow adventurers? Here they are. Hero (which you can give a name to your liking) is the typical narcissistic dandy. Vain, a bit of a braggart, despite appearances he proves to be a fierce fighter, ready to face any enemy with indifference. Yangus is the strongest of the group. Little inclined to dialectics, he prefers to ~speak~ with force and weapons. Jessica is the only girl in the group, and is a powerful sorceress animated by an inexhaustible thirst for revenge against Dholmagous. His bold temperament and his impulsiveness actually hide a sad and tormented soul. The four characters are rendered in gorgeous cel-shaded 3-D and boast a high-quality texture coating that really gives them the air of an anime PC. Each of them features a large number of animations, especially in battle, and depending on the weapons they have equipped, their look changes visually. This aesthetic ~treatment~ has even been reserved for the monsters of Dragon Quest VIII. All the creatures in the game are animated in an excellent way and cared for in every detail, some even with such detail that they almost seem like key characters in the game rather than simple ~sparring-partners~", "date": "2006-04-15", "grade": null}
