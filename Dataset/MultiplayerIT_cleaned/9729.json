Gameloft wants to get everyone to agree, apparently. Although in the portable field it is natural to feel the need for simple and immediate titles, to be played when you only have a few minutes available, this does not mean that users have to give up productions of greater thickness, capable of boasting a design and dignity equal to the best seen on PSP and Nintendo DS. Considering then that the most famous video games on the App Store are sold for just over five euros, it goes without saying that this type of product is not only capable of elevating the entire sector, but also offers an incomparable quality / price ratio. This is precisely the case of Modern Combat 2: Black Pegasus, which brings with it such a load of improvements and optimizations compared to the prequel, both from a technical point of view and from that of gameplay, as to impose itself without major problems even on a competitor of weight like NOVA: the two games share some elements of the interface and the efficient control system, but in terms of level design and multiplayer possibilities the superiority of MC2 appears rather clear. The twelve stages that make up the single player campaign are well characterized, and the fact of impersonating three different characters during the story certainly facilitates this factor: one suddenly passes from desert locations to snowy expanses, moving within urban cross-sections and above all of closed environments, generally rendered well even if every now and then there is some small ingenuity (see the walls destroyed by explosives - not even LEGOs are so blocky!). Black ops It's not just about visual variety, however: the clichs of the genre of belonging are not lacking, and so we are committed to spitting fire from the machine gun of an armored vehicle during a desperate race to safety; or to run on the roofs of buildings, armed with a sniper rifle, to defend the advance of an allied vehicle between enemy positions; or still intent on placing explosive charges on some columns while they shoot at us from all directions. There are even quick time events, even if they are limited to a few sequences: suddenly an icon appears on the touch screen and you have to touch it quickly, otherwise it will be game over. However, these are not situations placed there ~treacherously~, given that they are somehow announced through a wise use of bullet time, an effective visual solution that is also used to emphasize the most spectacular killings. The campaign doesn't last long, but it turns out to be a rather intense and engaging experience, also thanks to an excellent attention to detail. However, it must be said that in certain situations the game design shows the side to some uncertainty: at the normal difficulty level it is practically impossible to run out of shots in the magazine, and the presence of two slots for weapons completely avoids this eventuality. It is possible to carry out close-quarter kills, but in general we tend to rely on firearms, after all there are fifteen different ones and you can indulge yourself. The touch screen controls (but recently those via the accelerometer have also been implemented, as already happened for the aforementioned NOVA) offer different configurations, but in the end the starting one proves to be the most practical: the left thumb on a stick virtual analog, the right one free to move in the relative portion of the screen and then press the fire button if necessary and use that same button to direct the bursts, as if it were a second virtual stick. A little further up, the selection of the special weapon (grenade or smoke bomb). Finally, at the top right, the selection of the primary weapon: one touch only to reload, two quick touches to switch to the secondary weapon. The aim assist system protects us from unpleasant situations, especially at the beginning, even if it doesn't always turn out to be perfect, on the contrary; and the controls, in general, unfortunately sometimes tend to get a bit ~stunned~, which is very annoying. Modern warfare Once we become familiar with the philosophy behind Modern Combat 2: Black Pegasus, we can dedicate ourselves to the multiplayer modes, available both locally (via Wi-Fi or bluetooth) and online for up to ten players, clearly via Gameloft Live. In the latter case it is possible to play a quick game, host one with our parameters (duration, number of players, assisted or manual aiming) or search among those already in progress. There are five scenarios available and four modes: ~battle~, or the classic ~all against all~ in which all we have to do is shoot atwhatever moves; ~teams~, that is the competitive deathmatch that we all know well, in this case with two opposing teams of five people; ~defuse the bomb~, turn-based mode in which one team must place an explosive charge and while the other must prevent the bomb from exploding by all means; ~capture the flag~, which just needs no introduction. The game has a class system with seventy-two levels to unlock, each of which corresponds to new features and new weapons. During our games we never encountered problems due to lag, even if the predominance of matches with only manual aiming forced us to find quite imaginative solutions to be able to be competitive, in this case we had a good time controlling the aim with the right index finger to leave the thumb free to open fire if necessary. Certainly the octopus Paul could surprise us in this sense, but in general it is a matter of practice and you can become competitive even using only two fingers, provided you have quick reflexes. What we liked least, in general, is the small size of the scenarios: in the presence of ten players in the ~battle~ mode, you often end up being reborn right in front of an opponent, who at that point just has to press the trigger to send us back to the other world. However, in the end, it is one of the few notes that it is possible to move to a truly extraordinary product, which combines a technical realization of absolute excellence with effective and intelligent solutions as regards controls via touch screen.
