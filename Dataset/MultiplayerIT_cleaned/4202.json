The Bugbear driving game, finally available in full version on PC (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One users will have to wait a little longer), takes up situations, atmospheres and mechanisms that seemed lost in time, at the time when the demo disc attached to the first PlayStation it was literally consumed in an attempt to conclude that Destruction Derby session as short as it was exciting in the best way. However, the experience offered by the game is not limited to demolition races, giving us a solid and multifaceted structure, which includes various types of races and a progression system that leaves nothing to chance, hinged in a framework made up of experience points, challenges , vehicle classes and upgrades of all kinds. At the base of everything, however, there is the excellent graphics engine created by Bugbear, characterized by an extraordinary ability to render impacts in a realistic way, deforming car bodies, destroying arms and transforming destruction into the true protagonist of Wreckfest, despite being sometimes an element that is simply complementary to the action. The game modes, from the demo to the full version The path that led Wreckfest to debut in full version on Steam began a long time ago, in this case in 2013, when the developers released a first demo to demonstrate the degree of destructiveness and the excellent physics engine guaranteed by their title. We are therefore talking about almost five years of development in close contact with users, a period certainly not short but which has allowed the Bugbear guys to improve and substantially enrich the game, building a not indifferent set of contents around the starting concept . In fact, we have a career mode made up of five championships, each with a variable number of events; twenty-two tracks with two or more configurations each, designed for demolition derbies or traditional racing. And then a great abundance of vehicles, divided into categories (from muscle cars to compacts, from micro cars to trucks, passing through lawnmowers and ... buses), which can be upgraded by unlocking or purchasing new components to improve acceleration characteristics , maximum speed, handling and impact resistance, but also the aesthetic side by mounting different wheels and accessories or by changing the paint. Aspects that are part of a very solid progression system, which provides for the release of experience and credits for each good placement, allowing us to access new races only when we have reached a certain number of points. The free mode and online multiplayer complete the picture, which allows up to twenty-four users to challenge each other in predefined or scratch-created lobbies, giving vent to their desire to compete and to knock out their opponents not only in terms of performance, but also and above all physical, hitting the other riders whenever possible. Our experience in this sense has been very good: the matchmaking is fast, the matches do not suffer from problems due to excessive latency and the very spirit of the experience leads to having a lot of fun, without paying too much attention to the rules. Gameplay: I smash everything, but with style In addition to a very solid structure and a well-paced progression, which unlocks events as we gain experience, Wreckfest can also count on excellent gameplay, which has also been improved and refined during the long early access phase. The cars featured in the game are equipped with the traditional four-speed gearbox and driving places a great emphasis on drifting, which can be activated by pressing the B button on the Xbox 360 controller to tackle the tightest corners without losing speed. However, using automatic gears can frustrate our efforts in this sense: launched into oversteer, the car tends to remain low in revs and it is at that moment that the opponents can take advantage of it to regain the lead of the race. So it's better to opt immediately for the manual gearbox, playing more with it than with the handbrake, in order to always keep the engine on its toes and avoid coming out of the curves exhausted, so as to quickly launch towards any straights. Of course, in demolition derbies priorities change radically, and so it becomes necessary to mount reinforcements that make the car slower but also more resistant, to avoid multiple impacts that damage the bodywork too much and to opt for a conservative approach, watching the opponents fight each other while we go around it: a strategy that pays off, albeit after a certain number of seconds withoutza bumps you end up suffering an automatic disqualification. However, it is interesting to note how the system developed by Bugbear works well in both cases, placing destruction at the center of the scene or leaving it a bit on the sidelines: an element that intertwines with the high degree of interaction of the tracks, equipped with barriers, tyres, fences that you can tear apart but also harder areas, which you really don't want to crash into. The visual realism of vehicle damage can be combined with a higher impact on performance via the appropriate option, but we believe that the spirit of Wreckfest in the end is what we find in the default settings, in service of a distinctly arcade imprint and the pure entertainment rather than the plausibility of situations. The artificial intelligence of the opponents also falls within this perspective, which with the default parameters proves to be bad only in a few situations, looking for a fight or trying to get us stuck in some wall to slow us down, although there are no shortage of catastrophic accidents that develop on the background, in a completely spontaneous and credible way. In the end we are talking about a very different experience compared to FlatOut or Ridge Racer Unbounded, more reasoned and consistent, with a precise personality that does not make high speed its focus. A nice graphic While not being able to boast the visual richness of the most famous simcades, the graphics of Wreckfest do not miss anything and offer a respectable show. Naturally we started with an advantage, being able to enjoy the experience at 2160p and a fixed sixty frames per second, with all settings maxed out, thanks to the use of a powerful GTX 1080 Ti; but, as mentioned, the game is well scalable even on less sophisticated configurations, given the many options available. In addition to resolution and vertical synchrony, it is in fact possible to adjust the quality of the textures and the related filter, shadows, reflections, grass, effects, motion blur and antialiasing, the latter to be chosen between FXAA and MSAA . However, the options also extend to the controls, with all the controls repositionable and, on the controller, the possibility of modifying the intensity of the feedback, the sensitivity and the dead zone of the steering, but not only. Returning to the visual sector, the work done by Bugbear is generally really appreciable, even if a little lacking in variety. The lion's share is obviously played by the deformable polygonal models and by the technology behind this feature, very well implemented, undoubtedly among the best examples currently in circulation when it comes to damageable cars, which literally lose pieces depending on the impact and they bend, reducing themselves to pathetic sheet metal messes in the most striking cases. It would have been nice to have dynamic weather, variable climatic conditions and a few more details (see the view from the cockpit with no visible driver), but this aspect is at least functional to the action. As for the sound, some rumbles are less believable than others and, in general, the pleasant rock soundtrack constantly takes a back seat to the effects, but fortunately the levels can be adjusted.", "date": "2018-06-18", "grade": "8.0"}
