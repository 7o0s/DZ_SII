{"name": "Deadpool", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/120553-deadpool-il-mio-senso-comune-pizzica.html", "text": "If you have read any of his comics, you certainly know that Deadpool is one of Marvel's most absurd characters. His real name is Wade Wilson and he is a skilled mercenary, subjected to experiments that have given him a healing factor even higher than that of Wolverine, while disfiguring his skin. Deadpool is practically immortal, given that he can only be killed by cutting off his head (but sometimes even that is not enough), and this peculiarity has earned him a love affair with none other than... Death. Sure, the side effects of her transformation could be summed up in three words: freaked out. Wade hears two distinct voices in his mind, opposing consciences that advise him for better or for worse, and he is absolutely fixated on sex, even if he makes up for very little in this situation. A figure of this kind could only be the protagonist of an out-of-the-line video game, very close to the canons of Suda51 as regards screenplay and direction; and so the guys from High Moon Studios, already authors of the two excellent action games dedicated to the Transformers, have succeeded in the arduous task of translating the comic reality of Deadpool into something more, giving him a voice (that of the excellent Nolan North ), a devastating arsenal and a repertoire of spectacular moves, to then catapult him into a decidedly crazy ~story~, which sees Cable returning from the future to warn his friend of the threat of the evil Sinister. The talkative mercenary After an introduction that sees us visit Deadpool's dilapidated apartment and learn the convincing reasons that lead High Moon Studios to develop the game, we start with a tutorial to get familiar with the combat system. The solutions devised by Rocksteady for Batman have evidently made school, and so our character can not only produce deadly combos by pressing the X and Y buttons, but also intercept an opponent's imminent attack and counter it with the button b. The same key activates the teleportation device (yes, the one stolen from Norman Osborn during the Dark Reign), which allows us to quickly dodge blows, while the A button activates the jump. We talked about a devastating arsenal, and so blunt and slashing weapons (a pair of swords, a pair of daggers and two battle hammers) are supported by double pistols, a shotgun, a light machine gun and a a beam rifle built by Cable. Some types of special objects are added to this equipment: stun grenades, explosive grenades, contact mines and leghold traps that block the enemy. In short, the ingredients for a high-impact action game are all there and the management helps to make the situations always very varied and fun, just in time hiding any clashes that last too long with platform sequences and with a minimum of exploration. The rendering of the shots has been well taken care of, it is fun to beat the enemies and the double combat system works well, with the triggers that instantly activate the equipped firearm, while the back buttons allow us to throw bombs and so on. other. Around the world The seven levels that make up Deadpool's campaign, which kept us busy for about six hours (but bearing in mind a long series of consecutive deaths during the last boss fight), offer an action experience of medium duration but below the expectations compared to recently made superhero tie-ins, see the aforementioned Batman and The Amazing Spider-Man, which had a much more substantial sandbox structure on their side. In fact, beyond the story mode, the High Moon Studios title can only entertain us further with a challenge mode that honestly leaves the time it finds, focusing exclusively on the fights and therefore showing its side to repetitiveness. In short, longevity is not among the strengths of the game which, however, as already mentioned, can count on an absolutely crazy narrative, with lots of funny and spectacular scenes, in addition to the various vulgar jokes of the protagonist. His interaction with the other characters is also very funny, whether it be Cable, Wolverine, Rogue and Domino or the enemies of the moment. The scenarios themselves don't offer beautiful landscapes or set a new standard for detail and depth of field, but they feel well differentiated from each other and the platforming sections are enjoyable. Furthermore, the presence of walls and obstacles allows us to retreat if there are too many enemies and our vital energy is almost at the limit (but it recharges after a few secondsdo, after all, do we have a phenomenal healing factor or not?), and this contributes to creating some really lively and tantalizing fights. It's a shame that the melee weapons are poorly balanced, in the sense that the default pair of swords proves to be the best solution in all cases, where daggers deal too little damage and hammers are too slow. The same cannot be said, fortunately, of firearms and grenades, which offer different but equally valid solutions, urging us to switch from one to the other also for the question of far from infinite ammunition. Deadpool is a solid and fun action game, but a little too short and with some technical problems Xbox 360 goals The fifty Objectives contained in Deadpool are obtained by completing the most varied actions. As soon as the game begins, achievements are given almost for free, after which you have to work hard and defeat the various bosses, complete areas within a time limit and even perform particular actions, such as slapping Wolverine a certain number of times. Deadpool shots From a technical point of view we are faced with a solid product but afflicted by some problems that are far from negligible, at least in the console version. In fact, as soon as the situation on the screen gets crowded, Deadpool shows the side to evident and systematic drops in the frame rate, which testifies to a less accurate optimization phase than was reasonable to expect. The problem does not arise in the PC version, which runs at a fixed 60 frames per second and 1080p, without however offering advanced options for graphics, rather limiting itself to allowing us three levels of global quality. If the game lacks something in terms of visual impact, it must still be said that the enemies are very numerous and divided into a good number of categories, each with its own abilities. An excellent job has also been done with regards to the sound, with amusing and very well interpreted dialogues; pity only for the lack of an Italian dubbing which, put in the right hands, could have really surprised. Of course, in the wrong hands it would have been a disaster, and then perhaps it would be better to settle for subtitles alone, as in this case.", "date": "2013-06-28", "grade": "7.0"}
