We followed the development for years, then the tormented auction house experiment upon release, then the big resurgence of the Reaper of Souls expansion and the succession of updates that made it what it is today. While it failed to repeat the critical and commercial success of the extraordinary Diablo II, the third installment of the Blizzard franchise still engaged fans first on PC and then on consoles for hundreds of hours. We shed blood, sweat and tears - not necessarily our own - in the Rifts, searched for the best items and then the even better versions of those same specimens, completed the season paths, got bored, gave it up for a while, then we're back, because Diablo III is like this: it's fun, especially with friends, and best expresses the meaning of ~pastime~ applied to video games. And in the meantime, Nintendo console owners watched us and waited for their moment, which arrived today with a Switch version that includes absolutely everything and even something more. And that takes advantage of the capabilities of the console to offer the ultimate multiplayer experience ... as well as the ability to exterminate monsters even outside the home. Which is pretty much the best thing that could have happened to Diablo. What is Diablo III? It may seem like the most obvious question in the world, especially six years after its release on PC, but the world of Blizzard has always been very distant from Nintendo platforms and you can't imagine how many Switch owners grope in the dark when they hear its name. Well, Diablo III is an action and adventure game with an isometric view that catapults us into the world of Sanctuary, a medieval land tormented by monsters and demons of the worst kind, among which Diablo and his brothers stand out. In this episode we take on the role of the Nefilim, a chosen one who will have to vanquish the forces of evil before the conflict between Heaven and Hell also exterminates humanity. The campaign is not particularly inspired, narratively speaking, but it tells an interesting story, divided into five acts and punctuated by various twists and turns. The real goal, however, is to grow our character - chosen from seven different classes - and combine dozens of skills and variants of them with the thousands of objects found randomly in the maps. Most of these enhance some skills and combinations, therefore Diablo III becomes a continuous search for the best configuration, for a practically unattainable perfection but which in any case always seems within the player's reach thanks to the generous distribution of loots and the various ways to obtain them. All the contents of the Switch version Diablo III is an incredibly long-lived title, if you belong to that category of gamers who commonly define themselves as ~lootwhore~. Even if the search for new objects on a certain character tires you, you will have the other classes available to grow and equip - perhaps with the tools already found, since there is a shared bank - and which are played in a completely different way. The Switch version of Diablo III also includes the Necromancer, the class released as paid DLC only last year, free here and available from the start. Obviously repeating the campaign to exhaustion would be nothing short of indigestible, despite the numerous difficulty levels - no less than seventeen - and the possibility of running into random secondary objectives while exploring the maps, which is why Blizzard has implemented it with the Reaper of Souls - also included in the Switch version from the very beginning - the so-called Adventure mode which, with each game, generates a series of missions per act to be completed in order to receive extra experience, money and loot. In fact, the player can grow the characters up to level 70, but at that point he will continue to earn experience points and increase the so-called levels of excellence, which give bonuses to be freely assigned to different parameters to further improve the characters. In Adventure mode it is therefore possible to engage in various secondary activities which include the Gates, randomly generated maps in which to massacre hundreds of monsters plus a final miniboss, and the major Gates, timed variants of the aforementioned Gates. The records established in the major Rifts are automatically uploaded to a leaderboard which allows you to analyze the progression of other players and provides an additional level of challenge to the most competitive users. In this sense, Diablo III offers two more variants to the experienceence in general, whether you play in Story or Adventure mode. The Hardcore mode, in fact, is selected when the character is created and, very simply, imposes the so-called permanent death: if the player is defeated, he will have to start over. Seasonal mode, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated. In previous versions of the game, Blizzard implemented each new update - and therefore balances, new items and other achievements - in the form of limited-time ~seasons~. Players who restarted the adventure in Seasonal Mode, creating brand new heroes, had access to new loot, challenges and rewards. Once the season is over, the seasonal heroes lose their exclusivity and all the objects and points of excellence earned pour into the space shared by all the other heroes: the seasons therefore add a further level of complexity, distorting some configurations thanks to the implementation of new equipment and synergies, and granting a series of timed objectives, through the so-called Seasonal Path, to be completed to earn new frames, pets and other bonuses to show off when playing alone or in company. So the Switch version of Diablo III is a summation of every content, update and improvement implemented in these six years, but Blizzard has also thought of some small bonuses that make this late conversion for the Nintendo console a little more exclusive. Players of the Switch version therefore have some themed cosmetic content that no other version can boast: the Cucco mascot, the Triforce frame for the portrait, a pair of wings inspired by Majora's Mask and an outfit that transforms our hero into Ganondorf. None of these extras affect the game on a practical level, mind you. They're just little nods to The Legend of Zelda that allow you to customize the player's look a little more on the social side. On the other hand, amiibo is different: Diablo III is in fact compatible with the figurines produced by Nintendo, just select the appropriate option and register the amiibo to get an instant reward in the game. The amount of this ~reward~ varies: the amiibo we tested (the first version of Link from Super Smash Bros.) spawns a rare enemy on the spot, but it doesn't seem to have any influence on the loot that turned out to be absolutely standard . However, there are persistent rumors about the possibility that Diablo III-themed amiibo with particular abilities will come out in the future: we will probably know more during the upcoming BlizzCon. The conversion The first thing you need to keep in mind is that Diablo III was born essentially as a point and click title on PC, which made transposition for consoles particularly difficult. Blizzard has in fact had to rethink and redesign the controls for the joypads and therefore the interface, originally structured with a view to use via the mouse. The second thing you need to know is that the guys from Irvine have succeeded excellently in the enterprise, even integrating the possibility of dodging with a somersault by pressing a button - an action that very simply replaces clicking on an empty space on the map - and reprogramming almost completely configurable every interaction. The most widespread opinion of those who have played Diablo III first on PC and then on consoles is that the title even earns points in its second incarnation, becoming even more like an intuitive and frenetic action game. The Switch version of Diablo III is an almost perfect conversion from a control point of view and Blizzard has also taken the trouble to optionally associate the aforementioned dodge with a movement of the controller rather than a key. The Switch version, however, offers the possibility to choose between various control systems. The Pro Controller is obviously compatible, but we can also decide to play by holding the two Joy-Con normally or just one of them, which is useful in multiplayer mode, as you will see shortly. The response to inputs is precise and immediate: a little practice is enough to gain control of the character and all his abilities. Unfortunately the Switch version also drags along the defects of the previous incarnations on the console, in this case the invasive aspect of the interface and the less practicality in navigating the menus: it is not an insurmountable problem and one quickly gets used to it, but considering that you spend a lot of time switching skills or equipment in the various windows, it must be admitted that it can be a bit frustrating at first. There isn't much to say about the technical sector: Diablo III is a well-kept and detailed title - some would saywhich is also a little too colorful, for the atmosphere you breathe - but it's not a polygonal monster and on Switch it runs very well at 60 frames per second, net of some small and rare slowdowns in the most excited moments, such as when they explode dozens of monsters at the same time under a shower of fireballs, lightning and bolts. We got the impression that Blizzard has lightened the visual load a bit, reducing the complexity of some models, but it's a difference that can only be noticed by the attentive eye who has already spent hundreds of hours on PC. The most important thing to add, however, is that Diablo III also works wonderfully in portable mode, where it almost seems to reach its maximum expression. The action is always clear and precise, the texts legible, and thanks to the stand-by mode it becomes even more fun and relaxing to indulge in short game sessions that always manage to give a sense of progression and completion. Finally, the multiplayer mode is one of the strengths of the Switch version of Diablo III, if only because it guarantees a variety of ways to use it. It is obviously possible to play online - if you subscribe to a subscription to the new Nintendo service, of course - and participate in games in four via a practical and painless drop-in / drop-out system. Alternatively, just like on the PlayStation and Xbox platforms, local play is allowed on the same screen. This solution has some advantages and disadvantages: the most obvious benefits are the social aspect, since you can play in person and maybe nudge a lifelong friend in the face who has just picked up an antique-quality object and won't let you know. wants to give. On the other hand, the Switch version inherits the annoying need to share the image even when navigating the menus, freezing the action while others are playing: as we have already said, Diablo III is a title where the menus open continuously and you also lose a lot of time, which obviously can be annoying if you play in company. Finally, it is always possible to play locally but by connecting several Switches in wireless communication, probably the best solution that makes everyone happy ... especially the landlord who perhaps can put his console in the Dock.", "date": "2018-10-30", "grade": "S.V."}
