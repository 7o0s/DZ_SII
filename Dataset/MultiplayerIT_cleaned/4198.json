{"name": "Mario Tennis Aces", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-tennis-aces-recensione-switch-201324.html", "text": "The latest games in the Mario Tennis series didn't quite convince us; despite the good qualities on display, in particular the valuable control system and the physics of the ball, they were titles with questionable game design. The introduction of magic circles, rather than pacing the action, simply made it more chaotic and, even worse, detached from tennis. If the first two chapters for home consoles were exaggerations of the sport they were inspired by, the last two, those for 3DS and Wii U, were - unintentionally, God forbid - anything but. Mario Tennis Aces for Nintendo Switch, which was directed by the historian responsible for the saga Shugo Takahashi, does not disavow any component of its DNA. Instead of going back to its origins, therefore to a simpler and more arcade game, it takes the mechanics of Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash, refines them and spices them up with some fighting game touches. As absurd as it may seem, this move is extremely intelligent: by various journalists tennis has often been defined, by type of matches and tactical intersections, as a kind of boxing without physical contact. The developers of Top Spin 4 themselves had described their game as ~a fighting game with rackets~. Well: Camelot was not limited to this, because it has translated the concept into an interactive key, inserting typical elements of fighting games. In particular: special shots, an energy bar to be charged to execute them, the possible K.O. due to the exhaustion of the rackets available. The most interesting thing is not so much the choice, which we consider intelligent rather than atypical, but its consequences: the action on the screen is very far from a real tennis match, but given the real affinities of this sport with the fighting games themselves, the sensations generated by a match of Mario Tennis Aces have many points in common with a real match. You have to be quick and reactive while trying to create a reasonable tactical plan to beat your opponent. The right controls for gameplay So let's see the various levels of stratification of Mario Tennis Aces. The commands that regulate the basic gameplay are the usual: A for topspin (i.e. a rotation from the bottom up), B for backspin, also called slice (a rotation from top to bottom), Y for a flat shot (fast and and without rotation), X for lob (tilt stick up) and paper ball (stick down). Each shot can be launched in three ways: with a short click, which however generates little power; loading the shot, i.e. holding down one of the three main buttons, and this will give you more speed and angle; finally with a double click - the greater the distance between the two pressures, the stronger the shot will be - a gesture that will guarantee you a more central but also more powerful shot. Many details blur these basic shots, but in general the ideal response to topspin is backspin (and vice versa), with a flat shot you respond in the same way, and above all you have to bear in mind that a lightly loaded topspin is a weak shot, unlike the slice, which instead (except in rare cases, see Boo) if boosted to the maximum performs much less than the lift. Every time you manage to move your opponent a lot, or to respond to him from the right point in the right way, a star will appear in your field, inside which you can throw a flat shot even more powerful than usual, which - if you're good - will allow you to keep control of the exchange. In all of this the energy bar comes into play, which will fill up faster in relation to the charge level of your shots, and even more quickly by performing a recovery with the technical shot (right analog stick). If not executed with the right timing, this last shot still sends the ball beyond, but subtracts energy instead of gaining it. Once loaded, what does this bar allow you to do? By entering a star, and pressing R, an Intense Shot: a very strong shot, to be prepared with precision in first person, capable of damaging the opponent's racket. He will be able to defend himself with a Block, or by impacting the ball close to his body: otherwise he will either let the ball escape, or the racket will suffer an injury. The defensive equivalent of Intense Shot is Intense Speed: by holding down R you will be able to slow down time, so as to reach distant balls more easily. Energy consumption in this case is not fixed, but related to the duration of the move; in theory, by crossing the pitch, you could even exhaust it all. Once loaded to the maximum, however, it allows something much more interesting, namely the Special Shot, very similar to the Intense Shot but even more powerful and, not a secondary detail, capable ofi destroy the opponent's racket - unless he ~blocks~ or refuses to return - on first impact. The single player adventure As you may have guessed from the previous description, the game, while immediate in the controls, is anything but simple. For this Camelot has not only included the Adventure mode in Mario Tennis Aces, but invites you to play it as soon as you start the game: after the short introductory movie, which has already appeared online, you will find yourself in Mario's shoes, on a map, having to face the various challenges that the game presents to you. Naturally it is possible to immediately turn to the main menu, but the simple fact that the title starts from the Adventure makes explicit how Camelot was aware of the need for a tutorial. Because, in fact, this is: it has nothing to do with the old history of the portable series, where a tennis player was chosen and, living within an academy, he was made to grow and progress, in skill and in the bulletin board trophies, up to challenge Mario. No, all that remains is the level of the character and the various statistics of the rackets, which in any case do not offer room for too many interpretations: in the Adventure Mario becomes increasingly stronger independently (without there being any possibility of alternative development, for example by choosing between strength and technique), and the same happens with rackets. The only vaguely strategic decision left to the player lies in the order in which to hold the rackets, but even here you can easily complete the mode without altering the pre-established hierarchies. The Adventure is basically a long tutorial, similar to the single player mode of Splatoon: its duration depends more on your skill than on the amount of events (between thirty and forty), the only certainty is that, once completed, you will be able to play Mario Tennis Aces reasonably well. We could estimate a minimum length of three hours and a maximum of ten, but it varies a lot - as anticipated - on the player's abilities. The seven areas into which the map is divided (however unified) gradually introduce more complex moves, and require you to know how to execute them with a constant increase in speed and safety: it is impossible to finish it, in a nutshell, without having mastered Intense Blocks and Hits, as well as Technicians. The events that Mario, the only (or almost...) protagonist of the adventure, will have to face are mostly similar, but with ever-increasing difficulty: a classic tennis match, a dribbling contest, more particular matches in which you don't have to let your opponent touch the ball, challenges in which you need to accumulate points by hitting elastic rectangles and, at the end of each area, a boss to be hit in various ways. The variety of the latter is good and satisfying, while we would have expected something more from the sometimes predictable passing events. Of the story, which is really very simple, there is little to tell: an evil racket - Lucigna - has taken possession of Wario, Waluigi and the poor, and eternally unfortunate, Luigi. Our tennis plumber takes action to save his brother and, as usual, the Mushroom Kingdom itself. To unlock all (so far) available characters as well as all stages, you need to complete the Adventure. Tournaments: stadiums and characters If the Adventure is well done and functional, the same cannot be said of the Tournaments, which have disappointed us both in terms of number and rewards. In the old Mario Tennis they were more numerous, but above all more central: the user was motivated to complete them with all the characters, because winning them made the tennis players faster and more powerful. In Mario Tennis Aces the developers have not given the mode as much prestige: characters and stadiums are unlocked directly from the adventure, there are only three tournaments, they have an increasing level of difficulty (but not modifiable), and an archive of the athletes who have won them. They are the Mushroom Trophy (grass), Fiore (earth) and Stella (concrete): each is marked by three matches, with the final being the best of five sets. The latter, unlike real matches, are made up of only two games, with the tie-break starting if two games finish. We also didn't appreciate the fact that the Star Tournament is simpler than the final Adventure mode events, and tends to be played later, making it even less interesting. On the contrary, the number of stages and characters is more than good. The former are eleven, and the most important terrain is certainly Marinarena: not only is it available both at night and during the day, but it hosts all three standard surfaces. We are referring, of course, to grass, concrete and clay. Their typical characteristics are well represented, and in sfhigh-level ide will be very important in decreeing the outcome of the match: on grass - for example - there is very little time to load the shot, so the deep-sea hitters will have more difficulty in dominating the rally. The other seven stages are much more atypical, ranging from the deck of a ship to the atrium of Bowser's Castle, passing through a forest and a desert. They emphasize even more the differences between the traditional surfaces, but above all they each present a different obstacle: in the forest there are Piranha Plants that eat and spit out the balls, the ship's mast is precisely in the middle of the field to intercept shots, from Bowser you will be constantly threatened by his minions (which you can hit and send to the other side). However, all the atypical fields can be played in the traditional way, and deprived of their particularities, maintaining only the characteristics of the surface. As we said, there are also many characters: no less than sixteen, but more will certainly be added in the future, given that some Adventure tennis players are not yet selectable (such as Kamek). They are divided into six macro-categories: Powerful, Versatile, Technical, Smart, Defensive and Fast. Each of these types has a different degree of speed, as well as a different effectiveness in the three main shots, while they are substantially paired as regards the Special Shot. Within the same category, the characters are not the same: Daisy, Versatile like Mario, has greater speed, but less power (at least, this we seemed to perceive). Spunzo, Powerful like Bowser, is much more mobile, but also less devastating when he has to push with topspin. On the balance of the same it is difficult to express now, but we have the feeling that, at least at a high level, the Technical ones - since they are easy to move with a strong roll - and the Fast ones will be difficult to use. Graphically the game is quite simple, sometimes it lacks aliasing, but the developers have been good at enhancing its best features, especially the animations. The latter are appreciable in their mix between the realism of the shots and the mariesco world, as well as in the particularities conferred on each character: Mario has harmonious movements, Wario is grotesque both in his movements and in his shots. In short, the overall effect is very good, despite observing the details several limits are glimpsed: the texture of the ground in the Forest is exemplary in this sense, appreciable from a distance, much less in close-up shots. Online and offline multiplayer Needless to underline how much the fulcrum of Mario Tennis Aces is represented by the multiplayer competition. Not that the CPU is weak, on the contrary: it has five difficulty levels, on the fourth it plays like a very skilled user, on Ace (the fifth, the highest) even better, and we also suspect that it tends to take advantage of some shortcuts. Certainly he doesn't even miss a Technical Shot, but he often seems to move even before the shot starts (after all, the direction must be decided during the loading of the shot). Out of a hundred games at Ace level, we've only managed to beat her about twenty times, half of them playing with Baby Bowser, then attacking and trying to de-time the opponent, the other half with Mario, then trying to understand how to dominate them tactically (we managed it with a lot of effort, and only once against a Powerful character). You can double challenge her with a friend, in any of the control variants offered by the Switch. However, the double is also the only appreciable part in the case of using the ~table~ mode, because in single battles the television is mandatory, not in form but in substance: the split screen and the smallness of the ball make it necessary to have a larger monitor bigger than the Switch one. Finally we get to online. You can face it alone or with a friend, so you can select both singles and doubles. Looking for opponents randomly, you must necessarily accept the quick mode (only one tie-break), and the possibility of finding yourself on every field (even with unexpected events); by opening a group and challenging an acquaintance, however, it is possible to change the options, lengthen the games, limit them to certain stages. The few - inevitably - fights we have had have flown smoothly, but before accepting a game the quality of the connection is signaled, in order to avoid slow-motion games (and, given the demo test, we do not exclude the presence). Certainly in the future there will be temporary tournaments similar to that of the test before the release, but in general, given the focus on the competition, we were surprised by the absence of a history of the clashes, the famous ~head to head~ ti", "date": "2018-06-20", "grade": "8.4"}
