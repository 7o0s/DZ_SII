{"name": "Codename: Panzers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/codename-panzers.html", "text": "Europe at war But let's get a little into the heart of the action, to better understand what is the offer proposed by this title, and how it intends to attract potential buyers. As can be easily deduced from the title, Codename: Panzers narrates the events inherent in the historical period that saw this fearsome model of German tank protagonist in military campaigns throughout Europe. In fact, the events of the Second World War are narrated, starting from the capture of Warsaw, which formally marked its beginning. The player is called upon to retrace the main battles of the conflict through three campaigns, which revolve around the three main factions that clashed on European territory in those years, that of the Nazis, the allies (especially the Americans) and the Soviets. Each campaign is linked to the figure of a ~hero~, who can be considered to all intents and purposes the protagonist of all the missions and who, obviously, despite having higher than normal characteristics, must survive each mission. Through the handwritten diaries of these characters, which merge with the real and well-known data of the conflict, it is possible to relive the clashes and intertwining that affected the armies in the five years of the conflict. At each briefing it is possible to deal with the maps of the territories and the data provided by the headquarters, which together with the personal and intimate descriptions made by the protagonists and the intermediate films, very well made (exploiting the game's graphic engine), constitute a very solid background and complete that gives a very high degree of impact on the player. A thick game The structure of the game conforms to the classic tactical RTS, where the phase of constructing buildings and recruiting units by investing resources is not foreseen, but only the use of units present in battle from the beginning of the mission is foreseen . This kind of approach, increasingly in vogue among RTS, in fact, escapes the alienation from the real historical events conferred by the structure of the old school RTS, as described above. So the style of play is closer to tactical FPS as a concept than you think. Once in the heart of the action, the player finds himself on the territory of the battle with his own units and a series of objectives to complete. In addition to the main one, optional ones are often provided and it is even possible to unlock some secret objectives, available only in some missions. Each objective provides the player with a prestige score, which can be spent on additional units and vehicles to be requested from the general command for the next mission; in practice, if prestige rises, the commander will listen more to your requests regarding support in vehicles and men, an ingenious and simple expedient to justify the purchase of vehicles for the various missions (it was certainly not very easy to buy heavy vehicles and soldiers, as if they were potatoes, during the conflict). The idea of grouping the infantry squads in mini groups of a few units is interesting. A thick game The interface highlights a few key parameters for each unit. If you select a group, the icons that symbolize the various troops turn green, yellow or red to indicate their state of health. The idea of grouping the infantry squads into mini groups of a few units is interesting, which despite having different characteristics and separate feirta points are treated as a single unit; this expedient greatly speeds up the operations of moving and using men. The characteristics of the units are not limited to describing the hit points, but it is necessary to keep an eye on details such as the number of ammunition (which can run out, especially for tanks and heavy artillery pieces) and the temperature of the vehicles. The heat of the explosions, of the free flames and those ejected by the flamethrowers in fact not only weaken the resistance of the unit, but cause the performance of the vehicle's mechanics to fall, compromising its correct functioning; to remind the player of the status of the unit in question, a thermometer will appear next to him which will explicitly indicate the condition of the subject concerned, bearing in mind that excessive overheating can cause the vehicle to explode and the crew to die by fire . Another interesting detail is the management of ~conventional~ damage to vehicles due to artillery shelling. Damage is even localized and it is possible to keep an eye on the particular state of the vehicles through the colored highlighting around each individual unit, therefore it is possible to calculate which side is more vulnerable to damage.attacks and handle the situation accordingly. Special repair units can follow the army on the move, distributing repairs and ammunition (should it be needed) just like medical units that follow the troops and dispense treatment when needed. Interestingly, these units capable of repairing vehicles and supplying them with ammunition cannot do it indefinitely, but have stocks of spare parts that can run out and are only rehabilitated through special supply buildings (which also act as hospitals from fields) and in which every kind of unit can be recovered and put back on track, a really spot on detail there is no doubt. Excellent dynamism The management of units in battle is facilitated by a well-developed AI, and the same is true for the enemy, which uses effective and aggressive strategies. The tactics that can be used on the battlefield are numerous, and practically all the resources available on the field can be exploited. The maps, sometimes very complex, especially in the case of city ones, provide numerous supports for all kinds of strategies, starting from the breakthrough strategy up to maintaining the position and slowly wearing down the enemy forces by taking strategic points . Every single building can be visited and used as an attack point by snipers and any infantry unit. Inside them it is possible to move (the walls become transparent and allow you to view the interiors, often very well-kept and personalized) and sometimes engage in a shootout with the enemy units that had already barricaded themselves there. Trees can be uprooted, and a forest can be safely crossed by heavy vehicles which can open a passage by breaking through obstacles, just as buildings can be destroyed. Unfortunately, some details take away some points from the realism of the game itself which is already quite high, in fact some scenic elements (for the purpose of carrying out the mission) cannot be removed in any way, such as, for example, the trams in the cities which are used as barricades for the tanks and arranged across the streets of the city. Another small detail is that the enemy units can be overwhelmed by heavy vehicles suffering very serious damage, while as regards the clash between units of the same player, nothing happens; however it is right to believe that this choice is due to practical reasons, because in games where this possibility is present, sometimes the management of movements in narrow places becomes very complicated, where the infantryman is forced to move alongside the tank and the truck. The various units have special abilities that increase their destructive power and enhance their particular use in certain situations. It is also possible to resort to interventions from the rear which, like a ~deus ex machina~, can fall on the points chosen by the player; these are air attacks by fighters and bombers, significant in the case of particularly complicated sieges, or shots from mortar batteries, lethal but not very precise, just as it is possible to recall an aerial reconnaissance which for a few moments renders the ~ fog of war which covers enemy movement in the most remote areas of the map. In conclusion Having reached the technical analysis and the sweaty final comment, all that remains is to define Codename: Panzers a respectable title, endowed with charisma and depth worthy of a best seller. The game difficulty, well calibrated, can still be controlled by choosing three different levels. The game modes also include skirmish and multiplayer (supported by Gamespy) which give the title increased longevity. From the point of view of historical reproduction this game pays attention to details, both in the narration of events and in the plot nitric, as well as in the reproduction of vehicles and troops which differ as the game progresses through the timeline, in practice in each battle the units actually employed in that period will be available, thus maintaining an excellent level of historical coherence. The graphic engine is of excellent workmanship and enhances the game both in the explosions and in the management of the particle elements, in the reproduction of the moving surfaces, in the transparencies and in the atmospheric phenomena. Lean and fast, it is configurable in many respects and allows you to test even the most recent cards, with a complete rotation of the visual angle and a zoom that goes from a few meters to panoramic shots. The models of the units and vehicles are of excellent quality and reflect the commitment put into this area by the developers; let's not talk about the rscenic creation and details, such as trees or buildings that sometimes really leave their mark. The intermediate films, made with the same engine, give that touch of cinematic class necessary to achieve the emotional depth worthy of such a title. The sound sector is distinguished by the good quality of the reproduction of the sounds of the battle, even if sometimes the noise of the heavy vehicles risks covering that of the explosions, but it is always very useful to be able to identify the threat by listening attentively to the noises. The soundtrack, while not particularly brilliant, always remains on a more than acceptable level. Final comment Finally, all that remains is to judge this game as an excellent product of that family of RTS focused on war, where military tactics and personal strategic skills meet in a very successful combination. Stormregion and CDV will certainly leave their mark with a respectable title, one of the most worthy of being purchased among those of its kind, personally one of the best games I've worked on in the last year. Pros: Excellent graphic design Detailed and complex Wide availability of vehicles and troops Cons: Some scenic elements cannot be removed Soundtrack not very incisive These days, the PC gaming landscape seems to suffer from a strange syndrome that induces developers to turn their fruitful thoughts towards the evergreen theme of war conflicts. Without disturbing the FPS, which for obvious reasons often shine for the faithful reconstructions of settings related to world wars or the historic conflicts that marked the face of the last century, RTS also seem to be influenced by this trend. It will probably be due to the strategic nature of this genre, which draws natural inspiration from plots linked to real war events, but we have already felt this trend for some time. The trouble, and there is always one, is that the excessive crowding of a genre on a single theme can lead to the fatal monotony that risks making the different productions seem like daughters of the same insipid soup. In the case of Codename: Panzers, it immediately seems to find ourselves in front of D-Day or Desert Rats Vs Afrika Korps; yet Codename: Panzers shines with a splendor of its own, and appears as a mature and valid product from the very first bars of the game.", "date": "2004-09-14", "grade": null}
