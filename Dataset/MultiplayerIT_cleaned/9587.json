The third release of the Texan software house on the digital delivery circuit of the Microsoft console could therefore only be awaited with a certain curiosity, also emphasized by a setting that can only tickle the attention of those who grew up on bread, comics and video games. The protagonist is in fact a classic superhero of American comics, Captain Smiley, complete with a tight blue overalls to emphasize the sculpted muscles. Unfortunately, however, it's not always rosy for those who dedicate their lives to fighting crime on the strips of collector's books, and indeed in this specific case poor Captain Smiley even saw his publication suppressed due to bad sales. Not that it's that hard to believe once you become familiar with the character in question and with his bizarre personality (not to mention the companion Star embedded on his chest), but evidently in the Twisted Pixel house there is more than someone with a soft heart. .. From strip to strip And so, to regain fame and popularity, the hero in tights is declassified from a protagonist to a simple extra, going to visit the comics of the most successful series thanks to the intercession of the Twisted Pixels themselves. At the beginning, for example, he is sent within a story of Nanoc the Barbarian (like Conan, to understand, just obese) with a completely different graphic style, characters and enemies compared to ~his world~; for the occasion, Captain Smiley's look is also specially modified to adapt to the comic, complete with leather underwear and horned helmet. The following passages are then dedicated to the comics of the 60s, with a lot of rigid censorship that very little gets along with the vocabulary of Star, and finally to the Manga. And this is precisely the most ingenious and attractive feature of Comic Jumper: each hosted in one of the present series brings with it a total change in the look of the game, with a homage to the specific genre that is truly irresistible, if not brilliant. Also because Comic Jumper is a product that doesn't take itself very seriously, indeed it goes out of its way to make fun of the seriousness of the world of superheroes, with a humor that sincerely constitutes one of the absolute peaks in this sense in the entire history of video games. It's a pity that some jokes get lost in translation, or that certain passages seem to ~forget~ the subtitles (fortunately the game hasn't been dubbed), because there are so many zany jokes and moments within Comic Jumper that it's not uncommon burst into laughter, often thanks to the cynical and irresistible Star embedded in the hero's chest. Another example? The special shot available to the hero, in this case called a ~hint~, should give perspective on things; in fact, once activated, some members of the Twisted Pixel itself (in the flesh) appear on the screen, who with blows of fists and headbutts wipe out all the enemies present at once. Or the super villain in Nanoc's comic, or that PuttMaster who wanted to transform the kingdom of the barbarian into a huge 180-hole golf course. Xbox 360 goals Comic Jumper's 200 points don't require too much effort in most cases, since almost all of them are unlocked in the face of normal continuation within the game. There is no lack of moments of hilarity, such as the 10 points to be obtained by punching poor Star or rather by concentrating on the hilarious dialogues with the various characters present inside the base. The important thing is to believe it But what does the gameplay ultimately consist of? Well, Comic Jumper is basically a two-dimensional action platformer, albeit with different variations on the theme along the way that are resolved in Quick Time Events, or over-the-shoulder sections, or scrolling beat'em ups. All quite pleasant, even if unfortunately the quality of the gameplay of Comic Jumper is certainly not up to the elements, so to speak, of the outline; a defect often common to Twisted Pixel titles, which in this case perhaps clashes even more. Beyond the fact that the absolute goodness of the mechanics is not exceptional, what is perplexing are some rather questionable design choices that make the experience frustrating. First of all the excessive difficulty, with really unpleasant peaks; Captain Smiley can initially take 4 hits before dying, but there is no ability to recoverand the energy lost. A decision that is further cursed in the face of the distance between the various checkpoints present in the levels. Even the lack of variety of enemies, with waves of opponents all the same that follow each other repeatedly, certainly does not help to improve the judgment of the purely playful part of Comic Jumper, as well as the rather linear and devoid of acute level design. Thankfully there is a ~but~, related to the character upgrade system that can be accessed within Captain Smiley's base. By spending the money earned in the various levels, even by conquering secondary objectives, the protagonist's resistance and firepower can be improved, making things much simpler; to the point of being able to tackle the missions in the shortest possible time, then entrusting their performance to the online rankings. Before getting to the point of really appreciating Comic Jumper's gameplay, however, a little too much time must pass, which represents a not insignificant flaw.", "date": "2010-12-07", "grade": "7.5"}
