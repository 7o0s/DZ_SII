We are not trying to create disparities between what is offered to users, rather we want everyone can enjoy the same experience.~ These were the words spoken by the producer Steve Papoutsis to defend the work of Visceral Games, fiercely criticized after the news that the PC version of Dead Space 3 would be based on the console edition, thus renouncing advanced graphic features. Beyond the questionability of these arguments, we wanted to try the game firsthand to understand how well-founded the controversies are and what perspective should be considered for triple-A multiplatform productions from here on out. Isaac Clarke's story is well known to fans of the series: after finding himself reluctantly fighting the Necromorphs during a rescue mission and almost losing his mind trying to destroy their energy source, the electronic engineer appears in this third chapter with a lucid but resigned attitude ... at least until some events lead him to throw himself headlong into an extremely risky mission, which however could really allow him to destroy the Mark and provide new hope to humanity. Have no doubts An excessive action turn for Dead Space 3 was feared, even considering the implementation of the cooperative multiplayer mode. Well, we can say without fear of contradiction that in no way does the experience appear ~debased~ compared to the previous episodes, the second in particular, and indeed intelligent and sensible choices have been made to best frame this new feature, which in the end it has the advantage of replayability. Tackling the already substantial campaign in single player and then replaying it together with an online companion allows us to discover new facets, access side missions and see reality alternatively through the eyes of Isaac Clarke and with those of John Carver, the latter marked by a series of traumas that have undermined the psychic balance. In short, the presence of the co-op does not detract from the game but rather enriches it substantially, through mechanics from which many development teams would do well to draw inspiration for the future. Contaminations are different, because it is true that we are essentially dealing with a third person shooter, but it is equally true that a ~survival horror~ style gameplay like that of Dead Space 3 has little to do with stakeouts and the firefights with human opponents, a variation on the theme that occurs during the early stages of the story and which actually left us perplexed. Fire and Ice Luckily this interlude, introduced for obvious narrative needs, is quickly closed and gives way to decidedly more familiar sensations, in the form of space bases with long corridors and, in the second part of the campaign, snowy expanses on the planet Tau Volantis, home of the Original brand and therefore the objective of the expedition to which Isaac joins, albeit initially for other reasons. In these situations, the elements that made Dead Space famous are all there: Necromorphs that suddenly emerge from a door or a loophole, making us jump out of our chairs, tantalizing environmental puzzles that involve the use of stasis and telekinesis, the feeling of urgency cleverly transmitted by a deliberately cumbersome but effective control system (we remain convinced that an episode of Resident Evil entrusted to Visceral Games would not be crazy at all) and finally the important novelty of customizable weapons. We are not talking about the enhancements already seen in the first two chapters, but about a new mechanism which, based on the resources collected (and with the questionable involvement of any in-app purchases), allows us to create tools from nothing, selecting a base and adding appendices that can be subsequently upgraded. The intention was to avoid the well-known phenomenon of players using only one weapon for the duration of the campaign, without even considering alternatives. We can say that the proposed solution is interesting and works very well after some initial hesitation, but at the same time the advantages of focusing on a single device are still intact and can only influence our choices. Once again. The PC version And finally we come to the analysis of the technical realization of Dead Space 3, with particular reference to the PC version. The game natively supports the Xbox 360 controller and is therefore possible to playare using the same control layout seen on the Microsoft console, which for a third person shooter we believe is the best choice. However, if you want to opt for mouse and keyboard, know that not only is it possible but that the interface is completely customizable, so you can assign the various actions to the buttons as is more convenient for you. The video options screen allows us to select the resolution, activate v-sync and choose a mix of preset settings for the graphics quality, from 'very high' to low. Contrary to what was initially thought, however, there is also an advanced menu through which to adjust the individual items: irradiation (bloom), glare (glow), depth of field (depth of field), SSAO (or ambient occlusion), reflections screen space reflections, blur, post processing, motion blur, flare, distortion, lighting quality, lighting buildup, dynamic textures, antialiasing, shader quality, shadow quality, and finally filter anisotropic. Quite a few options, right? Unfortunately there is no support for DirectX 11, and here there is a little reasoning on the future of cross-platform titles on PC. In fact, if it has gone the way it has so far, with very few development teams willing to invest resources to support the latest Microsoft libraries, with the release of the nextgen consoles the situation will inevitably change and Windows users will only benefit from it, whatever the situation may be. the reference platform. As for the assets, specifically the textures, these are taken from the console version of Dead Space 3 and therefore do not boast a high level of definition, indeed in close-up shots they generally appear not very detailed. The downside is a frame rate that reaches 120 (one hundred and twenty) frames per second, at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and with the graphics settings set to ~very high~, with the test configuration.
