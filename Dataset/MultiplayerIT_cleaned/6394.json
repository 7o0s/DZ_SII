A new way of conceiving the post-apocalyptic zombie game: a more rural, almost western vision, less focused on urban centers and more on the province and its stories of desperation and survival with a dirtier and more visceral style. The original State of Decay started precisely on this basis, but also from that of DayZ, a surprising mod by Dean Hall who wrote the story in 2013. However, if the Bohemia Interactive experiment was entirely dedicated to online, State of Decay - which was released in the same year - brought that universe into a single player context, which became a small cult on Xbox 360. After two years, preceded by the PC edition, a new version for Xbox One arrives which includes all the expansions released, but also more or less substantial changes. State of Decay: Year-One Survival Edition is the definitive Undead Labs experience on Xbox One and PC Mommy sends you out alone? Originally called with the code name ~Class 3~, State of Decay: Year - One Survival Edition still remains a survival horror with absolutely unique characteristics in the console market, which have contributed to making it a title loved by many gamers. Despite the limited budget, the developers have managed to create an open world universe in continuous evolution, where the dynamics never stop, not even in the inventory screen, consulting the map or exiting the actual game. Death is another focal point, 'permadeath' has been talked about since release, and the tradition continues in this Xbox One remaster. The death of the character, dramatic and gruesome, is irreversible, forcing us to pass command to a new survivor. However, this is not a ~roguelike~ setting, since Undead Labs provides the player with all the resources necessary to avert this fatality, and when it cannot do so, it is never stingy in giving suggestions. The first and most important is given immediately: never face dangers alone, never exceed your arrogance and never face problems without having carefully evaluated all the means and possibilities available. The consequences could be devastating. The second is the player himself to discover it, State of Decay: Year-One Survival Edition is not a solitary experience, it is the story of many survivors who must work together to save their lives, the plural is an imperative for everything and that everything is certain it doesn't limit itself to setting up a few barricades to prevent the invasion of the ravenous undead, it needs to go much further. The power of the community The Undead Labs production distances itself from other open world survival adventures, drawing inspiration from works such as The Sims, but not only; the typical action mechanics are joined by many others of a strategic-management type. It only takes a few hours for Trumbull to find himself only partially desired guests of a community that has taken refuge in a church, where we must win the trust of new companions by improving not only the relationships between the various elements (just like the Sims), but also by providing the group with materials and supplies necessary for their maintenance. We are not alone in the game's expansive map, there are many other survivors nearby ready to join us, or simply eager for help. However, the operation is less simple than it might seem, the prevailing anarchy makes it difficult to trust others, just as it is difficult to distinguish the owner of a house from a jackal. Ultimately, however, not even we are able to remain helpless in front of a closed door, especially when guided by the fierce and blind mechanics of survival. Procurement of resources is the new faith and a pernicious obsession, so much so that inspections of new areas and the search for structures to transform into strategic outposts become a natural progression. Parallel to a horizontal narrative development, weak and present almost for the sake of being there, the individual episodes, suggestions and stories of this small universe without a future take on ever greater force in the gaming experience. Accustomed to linear developments, even within the confines of an open world, the sense of precariousness and the relative of State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition is unsettling, do you want an example? In a mission we are asked to save a survivor who has barricaded himself in his home, we arrive in the place and we are ready to take the poor victim with us, when an endless horde of zombies assaults the house in full ~Romerian~ style, they come out from the fucking walls and every attempt at defense is in vain. We are forced to see the survivor we had to save succumb, torn apart by the clawsand devoured by the jaws, because we speak of angry beasts, and no longer human beings. All that remains is to escape in order not to die, knowing that you don't have a second chance, leaving behind the desperate cries of the victim. The rest is remorse and so many doubts. How could the victim have contributed to our agglomeration of hope if we had managed to save her? This is State of Decay. And again, could the intervention of the army have been missing? Obviously not, in the same way don't expect a collaborative spirit from the armed forces, as well as those of the order, perhaps more dangerous than the undead. Who's afraid of the night? ~This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this is mine!~. If you too believe in Sergeant Hartman's prayer from Full Metal Jacket, know that you will find a funny replica of the character among the survivors, but this is not the point we want to get to, but that of the importance in State of Decay: Year-One Survival Edition of the personal relationship with the resource in a changing and, indeed, relative world. And the relationship with people. Keep alive a character with a high charisma value and you will be able to be persuasive with the other survivors, you will convince them to join you and become stronger. Make a friend of a sniper and you will see him place himself in an outpost to repel the waves of enemies, always ready to assault the refuge and break all hope, hire a good cook and the table will always be full of dishes; with a full stomach you live longer, fight better and fight less. We could go on practically indefinitely. Then there are the zombies. You will rarely see them walking dumbly towards nowhere, most of the time you will see them running towards you, attacking your character from behind, encircling him and making their most fearsome danger out of numbers. There are various types, all to be discovered, and in the dark it will be even worse. The cycle of the Undead Labs title grants one real hour per day and one per night, we assure you that you will not forget the latter, as it is completely impossible to sleep to make time pass quickly. Every sunrise is a relief. Make up A revised and corrected Xbox One edition for State of Decay was not an unwarranted operation, the title has already passed through its PC incarnation, but there was ample room for improvement from the technically lacking Xbox 360 one. resolution has been raised to native 1080p, a sort of cross and delight to tell the truth, since, excluding a clear improvement in image definition, the limits of a graphics engine are exposed which bears witness to a not exactly stellar budget. Limits that paradoxically are the strength of the game in this edition as well. The choice of setting the story in the American province allows us to propose a map based largely outdoors, with few buildings, but almost all of which can be explored, as opposed to much more noble open worlds, and the almost total absence of loading thanks to the data streaming technique. The renovation work was not lacking: more defined textures, valuable fog and light effects, but Undead Labs has gone further, modifying the game sector. The interface has been revised, there is a new combat system, new vehicles, weapons and characters. State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition also contains the additional content Breakdown and Lifeline, selectable from the start, which further expand the balance of hours. Breakdown is a sort of infinite mode, where you leave any narrative structure in the drawer to devote yourself to pure survival, while Lifeline is a real new and frenetic campaign, this time on the side of the military, which presents a more urban scenario and is featuring memorable horde modes. Xbox One goals State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition features 72 objectives for a total of 1500 player points. A nice booty thanks to the substantial presence of three different games with relative, abundant amount of content. Conquering them all will keep you busy for a long time, but a few hours of play will be enough to get a good 10%. One of the first objectives obtained will certainly be the one relating to the inspection of the area, but it is impossible not to mention ~Zombicide on wheels~, achieved after having invested 250 zombies with a car. Even the moment of death is rewarded with a goal of its own: not all evils have a silver lining. Want to remaster State of Decay: Year-One Survival Edition is still today an experience capable of causing antithetical reactions, you may not understand it, or you may not have the time to do it, but if the spark goes off, then be careful, it may not be donedifficult to get out of its coils. The basic campaign can be completed in a span of about 15 hours, but if you have reached this point it will be difficult not to want to unravel all the secrets of the Undead Labs production, in this case get ready to triple the value, not counting the two additional modes . Even at the mercy of the most unbridled infatuation, however, we cannot remain impassive to defects, largely technical. The game is still slightly unbalanced in terms of challenge, resulting excessively easy, but it is also an understandable aspect if related to the delicate dynamics that characterize the production. Instead, it would have been desirable to see the code cleaned up of some bugs afflicting the title, unfortunately still present: the frame rate is limited to 30 frames per second and crashes heavily when the Cry-Engine 3 is put under load, making it difficult to target enemies with firearms. In the driving phases, probably thanks to the loading of streaming data, we arrive at truly worrying peaks. It is not uncommon to see weapons disappear from the protagonist's hands, the pop-in is particularly aggressive with enemies appearing out of nowhere, often and suspiciously behind the player's back, while it has happened too many times to see your partner - who can be recruited for missions - disappear into thin air during an action, and then find it again as if nothing had happened at the shelter. Still in relation to the action in pairs, it would have been preferable to have some possibility of exchanging objects with the partner, given that loot essentially represents the soul of the game, a soul which however is not willing to stop shining with a unique light and bewitching.", "date": "2015-04-22", "grade": "8.5"}
