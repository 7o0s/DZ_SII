This does not mean that it has been forgotten or that there is no longer a place for Goku, Vegeta and the others on our television screens: every now and then we have to squeeze a little more from this goose that lays golden eggs which continues to conquer new readers and spectators . Artdink has tried it with a different title than usual, a brawler that is more of a ~simulator~ of the famous fights of the series than a real fighting game. Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z is strongly inspired by Dragon Ball Z: Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu, a peculiar title released in the mid-90s for PlayStation and SEGA Saturn which, perhaps due to the technological limitations of the era, did not fully succeed in achieve the goals set, carving out a place in the hearts of fans and being forgotten by the rest of the world ... until today. Battle of Z is a different title than usual and full of excellent ideas which, however, fails to hit the mark Dragon Ball Z fragments While becoming more and more elaborate and spectacular, the various Dragon Ball fighting games have never managed to reproduce one hundred percent the frenzy and complexity of the choreographic fights orchestrated by Akira Toriyama in the second part of his manga. Battle of Z aims precisely at this goal, deploying a decidedly peculiar gameplay that is based on the most important and frantic battles of the series, taking some licenses here and there to translate them into a very long series of missions. The battles are more than forty, in fact: it obviously begins with the arrival of the Saiyans on Earth and goes through the narrative arcs of Freeza, Cell and Majin Buu, inserting in the middle some battles taken from some animated feature films - such as The Legendary Super Saiyan and Cooler's Revenge - to get to the most recent Dragon Ball Z cinematic proposal, The Battle of the Gods. The Dragon Ball GT series has been completely excluded and most of the missions offer ~alternative~ challenges that tell us what would have happened if the bad guys had won or that put us in the shoes of the enemies of Goku and associates. All in all, the proposal is more than generous, even if the choice of characters in the roster leaves a little perplexed, which includes Freeza's anonymous henchmen, for example, but does not propose Gogeta or Jamemba. Each mission is introduced by a short cinematic sequence that summarizes the story in a few bars, taking up those of the comic and animated series: in short, the plot is quite concise and there are no narrative sequences to link the various missions, thus leaving anyone bewildered don't know the history of Dragon Ball Z. The texts in Italian, fortunately, are quite clear, and subtitle the English-language dubbing which makes you regret the Japanese voices and their screams full of intensity. The result is a kind of fragmented cartoon, thanks also to the graphic design in excellent cel shading which, if not surprising on PlayStation 3, certainly leaves a very pleasant impression on the small OLED screen of PlayStation Vita, returning images that look like a real interactive anime. Never change a winning team? In addition to the story mode, Battle of Z also offers a cooperative mode - which allows you to tackle missions online together with friends and strangers - and a competitive mode divided into various types of challenges. Let's cut the bull's head, anticipating that playing online before the game was released in the West was not easy at all, above all because the options are very limited and it is not possible to start a game until the room has been filled. The few times that we have succeeded, we have had to deal with a decidedly disappointing netcode that literally boycotts the game with a lag that makes it difficult to coordinate and play strategy. In fact, Battle of Z's fights are not a mere matter of ~button mashing~ and instead require a minimum of strategy that emphasizes the RPG component implemented by Artdink. The concept is very simple: each character can belong to one of the various categories of support, melee attack or ranged combat and has a trio of special special moves. If characters like Goku or Vegeta, in their various forms, are particularly skilled in close combat or in the projection of energy attacks, otherssuch as Kuririn or Number 18 possess abilities capable of briefly stunning enemies or healing their companions. In short, the choice of the team that has to face a mission becomes fundamental, also because the Story mode, before being concluded, imposes limits on the characters that can be used to face a specific enemy, in agreement - or almost - with the original plot . In addition to having specific skills and attacks, the various characters level up by earning experience points and, as if that weren't enough, they can be upgraded by equipping them with the cards conquered at the end of each mission and by increasing values such as melee attack power and the ranged one, the speed of regeneration of the Ki, the amount of total life points and so on. Some cards, called Premium, are unlocked by completing the various missions in Story mode and can be purchased by spending Premium points and Dragon Ball points earned by fighting: among them, the objects that are activated in battle, temporarily influencing the characters' abilities, also stand out. In short, once you have chosen and configured your team, you launch the mission and start the battle  and it is at that moment that the pain begins. And not just for our enemies. Playstation 3 trophies You will be able to obtain 49 normal and secret Trophies in Battle of Z: in addition to platinum there are 32 bronze, 12 silver and two gold trophies. Most are earned by completing the various missions and story arcs; others are unlocked by performing specific actions, winning in particular ways and collecting all the cards and objects in the game. A nice kick in the Dragon Balls Actually, the first missions of Battle of Z are nice and refreshing. They offer a different approach than usual and reproduce the famous fights of the anime in a rather convincing way. The control system is not exactly intuitive, and it takes a couple of missions to get used to despite its apparent simplicity: one button is assigned to the melee attack which can extend into a simple combo, two allow you to get up or down in flight , a quarter allows you to launch an energy projectile. By combining the four main keys with a backbone, the special moves of the character we are controlling are performed, among which one stands out, the same for all, which allows you to throw the enemy away and start the famous ping pong games with the target on duty. It is of course possible to hook an enemy and change target with a simple key, but also to target a companion to heal or revive him if necessary, perhaps by transferring some of our Ki to him. The latter, in fact, feeds our special moves, and we need to calculate its consumption if we don't want to be stunned after using an attack that we couldn't afford. The whole scene is dominated by the Genki bar, which gets loaded as time passes and enemies are beaten, and which, once certain points are reached, unlocks the possibility of performing very powerful special techniques, if not even the final ones that only very few characters they can afford to throw. It all seems very interesting and fun so far, doesn't it? The problems instead arise after a few missions and once you get to the Cell saga you have to deal with Artdink's evaluation errors: the difficulty rises monstrously and you find yourself forced to ask for help online or repeat the previous missions to level up the characters or earn new cards and points to spend. As if that weren't enough, the artificial intelligence of our three companions, which we cannot control, borders on the most absolute stupidity. Not infrequently we failed a mission right at the end because our companions, a few meters from our lifeless body, refused to revive us, letting the countdown that marks the consumption of our ~lives~ expire. ...it's game over. Although it is possible to give general indications on the tactics to follow in battle, our partners seem to constantly go their own way, sporadically healing us or refusing to attack our own target, perhaps diving headlong against giant bosses such as Hildegarn or Vegeta in the form of ape. In short, although you play in four you always feel alone, and the frenzy of the fights continuously tilts a camera that is unable to effectively keep up with the action, often confusing our ideas. Even worse is the case of some missions that must be completed by throwing a final technique, such as Goku's Genkidama Sphere: in these cases our character will remain motionless when charginghis definitive hit and the player will spend a full minute repeatedly pressing a button to channel the Genki energy accumulated by all players in the world (a small touch of class, accompanied by the PSN usernames themselves). The problem is that the attacks of the enemy can interrupt the process, forcing us to start it over again if not making us fail the mission, underlining once again the embarrassing artificial intelligence of our companions who do everything but defend us: a situation to say the least frustrating that, in the end, makes us somewhat regret those trivial fighting games that we thought we no longer needed.", "date": "2014-01-23", "grade": "7.3"}
