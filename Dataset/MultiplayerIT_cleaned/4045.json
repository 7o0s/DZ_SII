In short, sometimes a video game can be derivative without necessarily entailing a negative load in its evaluation, and this is kind of the main point of the Timberman: The Big Adventure review. The game was already released in August 2022 on Nintendo Switch and to tell the truth, it didn't cause a great stir, as often happens in that impressive chaos of indie games that pervades the eShop, but let's take it into consideration now that it has arrived on mobile platforms, also because a good platformer around here is decidedly rarer goods, given the 90 pieces that circulate on the Nintendo platform. It all starts with a small and basic arcade game, called precisely Timberman, which has become a sort of mass phenomenon, with over 30 million players in tow. In the progenitor we find ourselves interpreting a lumberjack intent on cutting logs, moving from one part of the tree to another to try to avoid the branches, in a very simple game of reflections and a glance. In Timberman: The Big Adventure the frame expands dramatically, so much so that the original game is found inside it as a mini-game hidden in cabinets around the levels. In this new incarnation, the structure is that of the classic platformer, with the protagonist committed to saving animals and helping his friend the bear to reunite with his family, kidnapped by the evil ~Evil Corp~ intent on destroying the forest and bringing industries everywhere. The adventure of Timberman is grafted onto this vaguely environmentalist plot, who if necessary can also be accompanied by his friend the bear, who will have to go through numerous levels characterized by various settings, in a map that closely resembles the classic tradition of the genre. Platforms and actions Timberman: The Big Adventure has a decidedly classic look The gameplay is closely tied to the traditions of platforming, but this is a very good thing. In a landscape dominated by simplifications to the minimum terms or by complications designed to make room for micro-transactions, being faced with the classic formula consisting of jumping on platforms, collecting coins and fighting enemies is not bad at all. To tell the truth, there are also some more particular ambitions, such as the introduction of a sort of combat system that would like to recall almost scrolling fighting games, but the standard mechanics are very close to old-school platforms and the response to commands - fundamental element for a game of this type - is surprisingly good. Everything returns the feeling of a game straight out of the 90s, albeit with an aesthetic taste derived from modern pixel art. Each level contains a certain amount of coins and treasures to discover, as well as the letters of the word ~Timber~ to collect for bonuses, all according to the manual. There are also secret passages that lead to chests or cabinets containing the original Timberman, but the feeling of being in a title from other times also emerges from the settings, which offer some typical elements such as the forest, caves, factories and others scenarios each with their own environmental obstacles and enemies to face. Timberman: The Big Adventure, many game situations resume standard platform patterns We are far from the level design of the best exponents of the genre, but there is still a good complexity and variety in the various worlds of the game, although sometimes the puzzles are not very clear and well constructed. The ability to double jump and glide by holding down the jump key are essential to allow a certain margin of correction on movements, which makes the use of tactile controls on smartphones or tablets more pleasant and less prohibitive.Timberman: The Big Adventure is distributed as free-to-play with commercials, but it is recommended to make the in-app purchase which removes the ads and also activates the option for cooperative multiplayer with the bear friend. In this regard, however, there is a certain discrepancy in treatment between the mobile version and the Nintendo Switch one, considering that the latter costs almost half while offering an even better experience, in several respects.", "date": "2023-01-18", "grade": "7.0"}
