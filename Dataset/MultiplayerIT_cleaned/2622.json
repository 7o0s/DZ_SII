After this brief introduction, I'm going to introduce you to one of the most atmospheric games ever released on Playstation, a game that, while not frightening you with zombies and sadistic children armed with knives  la Silent Hill, puts you in front of one of the most famous celluloid monsters: the ravenous alien two meters tall, armed with claws, double teeth and acid blood, he has a great charisma and will be the real strength of the game, divided into different settings taken directly from the film, including the refectory and the flooded areas of the ship with deadly aliens able to swim, in addition to the historic protagonist of the saga Ellen Ripley, cloned by the military in this episode after she died in Alien3, you will be able to control all the other protagonists of the film and it is curious to see that everyone begins their mission with specific weapons: the mercenary Christie, unlike the others, has the possibility of using two pistols at the same time while the marine DiStephano immediately possesses a pulse rifle, the variety of weapons present is however vast, ranging from the canonical pistol to a shotgun of considerable power and to the explosive weapons such as rocket launchers or grenades, the flamethrower deserves a separate mention and I can swear that any fan of the saga would like to flame the aliens, but remember that they won't die if you don't keep them under fire for a while! Just quoting the flame effect it can be said that this alone already highlights the graphic quality of a title that has well-kept light effects and enemy sprites on its own which, although they are not very detailed up close, are perfectly animated. Among the many advantages, the game perhaps has only one major flaw: the control system will make your first games rather arduous and frustrating, due to the various difficulties that digital control will cause you, with different combinations of keys for some functions, and the analog one, which sometimes makes moving around inaccurate; the best combination, however, is given by the use of a mouse, capable of making the control system more precise and accurate practically as much as shooters on PC, the sound instead, before moving on to longevity, defends itself well in the average and in any case the The important thing is to always be careful to hear the movements and hisses of the aliens, always lurking in the dark on the ceilings. In conclusion.. While on the one hand learning all the commands of your character in the best possible way will make you a lot of fun from another point of view this game requires a lot of practice and honestly it is not recommended for those who do not want to spend time trying to unravel different situations difficult, sometimes made really too difficult by an enemy who will hunt you perpetually and who could attack you without any warning at any moment, also being damned difficult to hit. This Alien Resurrection (here localized in Italian and with the title of Alien Cloning) is recommended to all those looking for an alternative to the various Fifa and Tekken and in this era of terror dominated only by Resident Evil it was time for some other type of game made us jump on the chair, and remember: it is recommended to use the game in the dark. pros: excellent pure adrenaline license cons: more could be done... Aliens! The saga continues... The latest attempt to bring the legendary Alien saga to the console, excluding the beautiful and distressing Alien VS Predator for PC, was given to us by the discreet Alien Trilogy, a first-person shoot'em up that included elements taken from all three films of the series released up to then. After the release of the fourth installment of the series, in 1997, the Argonaut development team decided to produce a tie-in of the film with a third person view and action/adventure elements also inspired by Tomb Raider but, several months later , made a similar choice to Capcom's Resident Evil 2; believing that the game developed up to that moment was not satisfactory, the Argonaut programmers decided to make a radical choice, changing the view from the third to the first person, transforming everything into a first-person shooter like its aforementioned successor Alien Trilogy: the reasons they are many but their choice is not to blame since perhaps, only with a subjective point of view it was possible to create the terror they wanted, and they sincerely succeeded ... Imagine wandering around a huge military ship, with the help of a small flashlight with batteries, fortunately time-rechargeable, short-lived, the environment around you is in the darkmore complete and your only weapon is an automatic pulse rifle found next to one of the numerous corpses with the open stomach of your fellow marines, you are about to open a pressure door when an alien descends from the ceiling presenting itself in front of you and, unloading your the one and only loader you manage to stop him making his acidic blood squirt everywhere, approaching the door again a message warns you that this will not be opened due to a non-human presence detected and, at that point a face hugger has already jumped into it do without warning.", "date": "2001-03-04", "grade": null}
