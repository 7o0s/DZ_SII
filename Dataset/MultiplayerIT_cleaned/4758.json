We know nothing about her, just as we ignore the history of the place where we find ourselves. The first rooms we pass act as tutorials and teach us how to jump and use Eshe's agility to avoid obstacles. Eventually we arrive in a large area where there is a demonic shard which, once collected, becomes our main weapon for the entire game. There is only one disturbing voice to keep us company during the adventure, which invites us to perform certain actions and explains some key steps. Some enemies are drawn really well We can consider it as a kind of narrative voice that addresses the protagonist directly, a voice whose true nature we will only learn in the finale. When we are given the opportunity to explore freely, Sundered immediately throws its metroidvania nature in our face, between initially impossible jumps, doors closed by mechanisms that require specific objects to be activated and other similar tricks to block off the different areas. In short, we are free within the current limits of Eshe. As can be guessed, as we progress through the adventure we will unlock the skills we need to have access to the entire map, including a double jump, an energy cannon and so on. Meanwhile we have to navigate a sea of platforms, collecting precious crystals and killing the enemy hordes. We will talk about the fights in a dedicated paragraph, because they are one of the most critical elements of Sundered. The crystals, on the other hand, deserve a quick mention: they are used to buy or improve Eshe's skills from a tree diagram and are found by killing opponents or breaking some objects in the scenario, such as crates, or strange glass cases or cores pulsating energies of evil. They are essential because initially Eshe is very weak and is not able to face the most numerous hordes, but by increasing her strength, vitality and the resistance of the energy shield that protects her, she becomes a real war machine. In short: the collection of crystals regulates the progression of the character and in some way that of the game. Procedurality One of the main features of Sundered on a technical level is the procedural generation of maps. Once the game has started, the game takes care of creating the structure of an entire area, within which it places the various rooms. Dying, the macrostructure remains fixed, while the individual rooms, except the main ones, change their arrangement. In this way, in theory, each game will be different from the previous one and, again in theory, even the same game should offer some variety. In practice, however, the situation ends up being very different. Despite the hand-drawn elements, Sundered is overall a repetitive game. But we will return to this point later, because to fully understand it another element is missing: the enemies, which are also randomly generated. The skill tree We are not talking about a randomness like the one seen in Dead Cells, in which the positioning of each creature is still fixed and decided during the generation of the maps, but about something more impalpable. Basically in Sundered the explorable areas, apart from the boss rooms, are completely empty, but from time to time they are filled by hordes of monsters, which vary depending on where we are. They can attack anywhere and anytime, which keeps tensions high, but causes quite a few problems. The most obvious is that in some cases the presence of enemies clashes with the design of the level in which you are. For example, we happened to have to fight while we were climbing a complex series of platforms, protected by assorted traps, ending up literally not understanding anything anymore, such was the confusion. Too many enemies? Confusion which, moreover, is the true stylistic code of the combat system, given that there are often so many enemies that what is happening on the screen is unreadable. Imagine, for example, having to dodge the attacks of about thirty monsters, some of which appear in areas you have just crossed, immediately out of bounds, and strike at great speed. It is not uncommon for newly cleared areas to be reoccupied by enemies that appear out of nowhere. The bosses are truly a show Sometimes the only way to get away with it is to die and come back when you have a character fit for the challenge. All this translates into having to press frantically on the attack button hoping to get away with it. Strategy and tactics are pure utopia. Forget toexample the highly versatile system of the aforementioned Dead Cells which, despite the procedurality, allows different approaches to combat depending on the weapons in hand. Also forget about the design solidity of a Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. In Sundered the only valid option in case of excessive difficulty is to upgrade at the right point. Fleeing isn't often an option either, because the enemies are so many and so fast that it's enormously difficult to avoid them while trying to reach a safe area. Things improve a bit as the adventure progresses, that is, when you have more weapons available, but in general the confusion remains. Here, in Sundered the procedurality of the enemies combined with that of the maps often turns into a nuisance, rather than a strength. Most of the gameplay ends up being the exploration of empty environments that occasionally fill up with adversaries in a reckless way. At first it may even go well, but after a while the repetitiveness of everything begins to make itself felt, above all due to the continuous having to re-cross areas already visited, at least until the opening of providential shortcuts. The levels soon become very repetitive So far we have above all emphasized the critical points of Sundered which, however, does several things well. For example, we have already mentioned the hand-drawn graphics, which are really beautiful. Above all, some creatures are small masterpieces, but the best that the game has to offer from a technical point of view are certainly the bosses: huge, excellently animated and also intriguing to face. Of course, they are very difficult, thanks to their original and challenging attack patterns, which must be carefully studied before being able to get the upper hand, but they give great satisfaction, unlike normal enemies. Almost worth playing just to deal with them. Too bad they are rare. Mini bosses, usually larger normal enemies, are not of the same level however. The maps themselves, on the other hand, albeit well designed, pay a little for the procedural generation system, which makes most of the environments anonymous. Some objects are well made, but in general the variety is small. To save themselves are some special areas where you can see the greater space left for the graphics. From the audio point of view, however, the excellent soundtrack should be noted which represents a pleasant accompaniment throughout the adventure.", "date": "2017-07-27", "grade": "6.0"}
