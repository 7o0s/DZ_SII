{"name": "Dusk", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dusk-recensione.html", "text": "Among the various neologisms that have emerged in recent years to explain genres and trends in the world of video games, there is one that is particularly ridiculous - and also wrong in conceptual terms - but very successful both in terms of sound and the fact of condensing perfectly into two words his complex idea: ~boomer shooter~. With this definition we mean the nostalgic re-enactment of the classic first person shooter, that is the one belonging to the early 90s, to the origins of the genre. It must be said that the use of the term boomer would also be incorrect for a wide range of reasons, but what matters is the self-irony with which it is applied and the precise image that emerges from such a definition within a gaming market dominated by Fortnite, the new Call of Duty and the like. Instead of complaining about how much better you played when you were worse off and going to see construction sites on the street, some group of developers thought it best to roll up their sleeves and to propose precisely that type of shooter nowadays, complete with graphics faithful to the style of the time and gameplay pushed to a thousand. An operation that in some cases succeeds perfectly, as we see in this Dusk review. New Blood Interactive has taken the basic elements of old FPS such as Quake, Heretic, Hexen and Painkiller and recomposed them in an amalgam that is obviously derivative, but does not lack a specific and very strong character, managing above all to be immediate and fun , putting gameplay at the top of everything and proving once again, after Ion Fury, Project Warlock and the like, that this type of experience still has a lot to say. Gameplay: Old time action Dusk, an image with some hooded cultists, among the more ~quiet~ enemies It is possible to select one of three starting levels but there is really no time for any explicit narrative element in Dusk, since we are immediately immersed in the action from the first moments of gameplay, with a level of challenge that is already selective in the very first play areas. What emerges, taking a quick look at the surroundings (the only thing allowed, considering the pace) is that we are dealing with a horror derived from a mysterious cult, which seems to mix the demons of Doom with metaphysical elements such as Lovecraft, between altars mysterious, places dedicated to some ancestral religion and bizarre symbols. It's all a pretext to unleash the ferocious violence that takes place from the first seconds of the game. The levels made up of more or less large areas, indoors or outdoors, full of enemies of various types intent on hitting us using different attacks in contact or from a distance, forcing us to try to dodge the blows and respond with firearms or melee body.It is a return to the basic elements of the video game as a constant challenge, which requires skill and timing in juggling in a world characterized by pervasive and oppressive danger, in which survival is always in the balance. A crosshair in the center of the screen, environments built with few polygons and enemies galore to be eliminated as quickly as possible: these are the ingredients of the most classic formula in the world, but always perfectly functional. What is striking about Dusk is the speed and fluidity of the action: there is no running button because the basic movement is already very fast, and this says a lot about the gameplay, all focused on dodging and speed in eliminating threats , without shields or energy regeneration but with the good old medkits to collect around, when possible. One feature that emerges very clearly is the sensation of the damage inflicted, which stands out both when using one of the many and varied firearms and in melee weapons, which include swords, scythes and other means capable of inflicting excruciating and heavy blows on enemies . Simple levels but with construct Dusk starts from a rural village, as in the image, and transports us into a metaphysical nightmare There is a certain logical progression between the three selectable ~campaigns~ at the beginning, with one representing the natural continuation of the other, even if they can be tackled in any order. It starts from the outermost sections of a rural village now in the hands of a mysterious cultist sect to then move on to an industrial section and finally towards crypts and laboratories, in a descent into horror that transfigures the settings into an increasingly surreal nightmare. In all this, there is also a remarkable care in the level design: although at first everything seems simply functional to the fastest and most violent destruction possible, the levels are built with a certain criterion, also filled with features that stimulate exploration such as passages secrets, orobjects to find, ~secret technologies~, hidden weapons as well as elements of real environmental narration. Everything always follows the extremely low poly aesthetic that characterizes the game, of course, but the construction of the maps makes the various elements of the scenario and passages always quite original, also helping the sense of direction a little since a little backtracking is also necessary in order to continue. Dusk incorporates classic and now obsolete features such as the need to collect certain keys to open specific doors, therefore the accurate exploration of the environments becomes essential in order to have the elements to continue, even if everything always happens at super speed. On the other hand, in the general simplicity of the narrative, some elements that help build a sort of ~lore~ in the game are also appreciable, such as the messages written on the walls that help us immerse ourselves in its particular atmospheres. Nintendo Switch version Dusk comes up with increasingly weird levels, like this one in the screenshot Dusk is a game built primarily for PC users and the willingness shown by the developers to bring it to the Nintendo Switch also amazed at first. It's been a while since the game arrived on Windows about three years ago, but the result is truly remarkable. From a technical point of view there are no particular differences with the original, obviously, considering the deliberately low level imposed on the graphic complexity. However, there could have been doubts about maintaining the same lightning-fast performance that characterized the game on PC, but these were definitively dispelled: even on Nintendo Switch, Dusk runs very smoothly, at impressive speeds and without missing a beat, maintaining the 60 fps, which is of paramount importance when enemies also move and attack like possessed. Considering that the software base is Unity, which often leads to uncertain results on the Nintendo console, the work done by New Blood Interactive is truly commendable, even technically. The presence of various options and settings to change to customize the experience is also noteworthy. such as the FOV slider to change the field of view and various graphic parameters to adjust to meet different needs, as well as a significant amount of difficulty levels to select that actually change the experience substantially. The only really noticeable difference compared to the PC version is found in the control system: here the Joy-Cons emerge as a bit of a limiting element, given that the high speed of the action is not perfectly associated with the sensitivity and travel of the sticks analogue, but it is above all a matter of getting used to, perhaps starting from the lowest difficulty levels and then going up. Finally, a special mention must be made for the audio accompaniment, which obviously offers particularly well-chosen metal-style songs, by Andrew Hulshult, author of the soundtracks also for Brutal Doom and Quake Champions.", "date": "2021-12-06", "grade": "8.0"}
