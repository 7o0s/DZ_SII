{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer_a.html", "text": "When stylization beats the desire to overdo it... After a disappointing CG opening cinematic, characterized by poor modeling of the athletes, we are introduced to the main menu, which, apart from a different background, has the same options as the other versions. The most important innovations concern the Master League: it will immediately be possible to make friendlies with club teams with real players and values, in short, no pipponi; the second is fundamental: each purchased player will have his maintenance points, a sort of engagement. If at the end of the championship their maintenance points are higher than the team's total, the game ends. At a tactical level there are two macroscopic innovations: now the players have more pages of parameters to observe, and they are also equipped with stars that distinguish their special abilities. As already seen in the Japanese version, it will be possible to set awareness for entire departments or for individual players, only that the movement indication arrows use all directions of the pad, the four diagonals, up and down. Graphically speaking, the game has remained almost unchanged compared to the Japanese version, apart from the understandable cut of some frames which sometimes generates unnatural movements of the players, trifles anyway. Within two months, all the major football games were out, and each surpassed the last in graphics quality. The same happens now: P.E.S. it can't count on an exorbitant number of polygons like Fifa or Tif, but the end result is far superior. Although less rounded and sharper than their rivals Sony and EA, the players seem more real and less artificial: the skins applied are the best seen so far, the players then move with a grace and a frightening precision, let me explain: in other titles the animations, although technically impeccable, gave the impression of a certain choreographic redundancy, like kilometer-long slides and crashes to the ground like an Elizabethan theatre. The total impression was that he was always over the top, the desire to amaze with special effects reigned supreme. Here instead the players (or better to say the programmers) do exactly what is needed, they don't constantly look for the effect play. For heaven's sake, if you have to raise your elbows in the air, they do it, leaning on and defending the ball  la Inzaghi is a recognized specialty, like tunnels and sleight of hand  la Zidane with the ball on the ground, but the impression that remains is always that of fidelity, relevance and absolute visual realism. Clearly there are some flaws: in the beautiful stadiums the crowd is still shockingly badly animated as well as being visibly cartoonish, like the laughable photographers at the team entrances. If this is still the price to pay to get to the final result, for me you could also play behind closed doors or in some mangy pitch in the suburbs. Another unpleasant thing is the creation of the shirts, which in many cases are invented from scratch, not matching the colors apart from the real ones. The sound, pardon the sound effects, is as always at a high level, a pity that the two obscure Italian commentators make us miss the never too praised John Kabira. The sampled chants are as usual technically perfect and very recognizable, even if the most classic of the anti-Milan chants has sadly disappeared. Change everything to not change anything? We now come to the cornerstone of the piece, playability. There were many things that were wrong in the Japanese version, and it must be said that the right changes have finally been made. As already mentioned, the goalkeepers, the real drawback of W11 5 , have worked really hard and arrive at the start of the championship in splendid form: they are not inviolable shutters, but they don't fall asleep to wake up with the ball in the centre. The animation discourse also applies to them: not a single frame is wasted, the precision and obsessive correspondence (great applause to the programmers) in the interventions is sometimes astounding, as is their variety. Perhaps the peculiarity that makes P.E.S. the title closest to the real game is the presence of the force of inertia. Of course it is, it is not possible to move like the snake on the mobile phone, it is not possible to make perfect right angles after a hundred meters of fast running. Dribbling tightly while running is not easy, and performing the classic Di Livio trick, running, braking, coming back and crossing is not very effective and performing in the first few games, but as Konami teaches, application is never too much. The crosses from the goal, which most of the time ended up in the goalkeeper's mouth in oin accordance with the law of lack of lucidity in front of goal after a long buck (see Delvecchio) they are more insightful and precise, even if occasionally some players reveal their own shortcomings in the fundamentals. Still with regard to crosses, the programmers have included a choice option that allows us to switch from automatic (classic method) to a complex manual in which we take charge of everything. It should be added that after making a cross it is possible by means of a triangle to center the attacker's position automatically. But the big news for the European market is that the right analog stick is used to pass the ball in any direction and with any force you want. Personally, I have not benefited from this novelty in the short term, although it must be added that it is very useful in relaunching lightning counterattacks, which would have been less effective by pressing the triangle. The one-two has changed radically, being now totally manual: you have to open it and promptly close it as and above all where you want. The shots gave me the impression of being even more dependent on the foot with which they are fired and on the situation in which one is preparing to shoot. An all lefty right handed player will be a disaster, and if you are pressed your shots will hardly be effective. The R3 key is now used to jump when running, but you can definitely do without him as it is inconvenient (you end up passing very often) and not very useful. A new sprint key, R2, has been added, slower than the classic one, more comfortable to use when you want to pass diagonally between two men. In the defensive phase, as usual, the artificial intelligence of the opponents and of one's teammates is astounding: the team is always well placed on the field and they never give the impression of sleeping sensationally, perhaps they will be led by mistake when the imprudent human player double the marking (by square) creating confusion, skipping assigned patterns and movements. However, there are still some flaws, which the more time passes the more they seem to be peculiar characteristics, real trademarks of the Konami series. As usual, the response to commands turns out to be many times slow, both for passes and for shots, sometimes reaching the threshold of defenestration of the pad. The responsiveness of the players has improved even if, as usual, those who receive the pass need much more than the simple pressure of the cross to anticipate the opponent. Another small flaw is represented by the fact that many times the players either miss the stops or stretch the ball, but on the other hand even Zidane occasionally butts a few balls (1st life-saving axiom of pure football simulation). Final considerations In the end what is the crux of the matter? Perhaps the only real ~defect~ (pass me the term for a moment) of the Konami title turns out to be its own backbone, its lifestyle, the simulation as real as possible. This desire to be different, complete, profound and real, leads him down a little-traveled road which, today as today in the context of consoles, in the world of fast and immediate use, but where in the long run everything becomes the same and in the end little boring original, it manages to reward only those who will be able to deepen it, to study it with a lot of application. There are no double interpretations, it behaves like Fifa, despite being its total antithesis: as an arcade title it doesn't work, as a simulation product it is the state of the art. So it's a perfect breakout product, or in more prosaic terms, you either love it or hate it. Of course, for the avoidance of doubt, this does not mean that P.E.S. it's a difficult and not very fun title, I'm just saying that it has a very high learning curve, but when you manage to master everything with confidence, probably after a concerted and successful action, even the emotions you feel are more or less the same as those who play, sweat and struggle on a real field, with real opponents. Unmissable Pros: excellent graphics playability and infinite longevity Cons: initially difficult high learning curve The word to Boc: After the vicissitudes of Smau I finally managed to get hold of a copy of the highly anticipated Pro Evolution Soccer to be able to play it comfortably ~spaparanza~ on the armchair at home, in front of my 32~ TV, and above all in RGB! I would like to start from this fact, i.e. the difference between playing on a multistandard or similar television (at least of the latest generation) and a very common model 15~. The difference is there and it shows, not so much for the obvious larger dimensions that make everything more real and consequently more beautiful, but for the actual speed gain that the game has. Not having (strangely) added the game speed selection bar in this release, the gap between playing with one screen or the other is very noticeable. Seeing is believing! Another note concerns the impossibility of setting the position of the screen to your liking and above all the absence of a Widescreen selector, an option now present in any Ps2 game. Leaving aside these little notes and getting to the gist of the speech, I could begin with this sentence: what a show! Finally the game that will allow all PSX owners to abandon (albeit with remorse) the old gray box and its splendid Winning Eleven, because I'm sure many of you continue to have the Play just to play the aforementioned game (and I I'm among those if you hadn't understood!). After the partial disappointment of playing the Japanese version, I had to bow down to the great work done by the Japanese team. A real step forward. At the beginning, the impression is not the best, especially in relation to the response of the commands, even if with time you get used to it and you fully appreciate the goodness of this solution. Forget lightning-fast dribbling and 3-player slalom: this is real football people, indeed, FOOTBALL! Now all the movements are reasoned, indeed, they must be, because otherwise there is no mention of getting to shoot on goal, at least by setting the difficulty to 5 stars. It will happen many times to stretch the ball with the ~long~ run and lose it inexorably due to the interception of an opponent's leg or the end of the field! This can be annoying and I have to admit that I too didn't like it right away, in fact I believe that the occasional or undemanding player can even find it excessive and frustrating, but I can only tell you to put yourself down with a little patience, and once you get the hang of it a little familiarity with the system, you will no longer find one so complete and capable of giving you certain satisfactions. Yes, because now it will be necessary to dose any racing impetus and also to ponder every decision to start with only one player to take out the defense and score. Now every action will truly be the mirror of your skill. The features already present in Winning Eleven 5 have also been introduced in this version, such as for example the sprint (really very useful for jumping an opponent), followed by a lighter run, rather useless, and because you are reached immediately and because keeping pressing the button you can not shoot on goal. The only thing I didn't like is the introduction of the new 1-2, which this time has to be closed manually and doesn't go automatically as before. It's true that this gives more freedom of decision, but it's also true that often the player who passes and starts running doesn't follow the, shall we say, best trajectory. Before it was very nice to do tight and fast ~give and go~, now it is almost impossible or at least more rare. Then the introduction of the jump on the slide is not very comfortable on the R3 button, because most of the time you risk making a pass, in fact it is now possible to pass, as well as with the X, also with the analog stick, managing to send the ball in any direction so as to be released from any decision by the computer. As far as gameplay is concerned, this game is pure fun. The actions are so real and beautiful both to do and to see, that it seems like watching a real game quite a few times, watching a game on television, I think: why don't you push the X! Or, why doesn't he date the goalkeeper!! Speaking of goalkeepers, the usual ones are finally back (remembering the ducks of the Japanese version), if it weren't for a small bug that I invite you to notice: pay attention to the movement they make when exiting a player thrown at the net; most of the time they do not run in a straight line, but go in another slightly more lateral direction, allowing the attacker to score most of the time; moreover, the ~square~ command that should make them return to the goal does not always work, because I think it is confused with the ~doubling~ input that can always be carried out with that button. Last notation regarding the highest number of items concerning the values of the players and their skills. So the differentiation of the players is more objective but honestly comparing them has become more cumbersome and difficult compared to the PSX game, however you get used to it. I focused above all on the imperfections because to list all the merits of this", "date": "2001-12-01", "grade": null}
