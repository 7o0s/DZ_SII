Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. A brave warrior reaches the top of the cursed tower to get hold of the legendary sword that hangs in the clouds. Once the weapon is held, however, he must prove that he is worthy of wielding it and therefore face ever-increasing waves of opponents of all kinds, from simple knights to slimes, from archers to bosses with magical powers, in combinations that are made at each more numerous and lethal levels. Only One has the look and feel of the typical indie game, starting with the 8-bit style graphics, which visually represent the protagonist and his enemies with a handful of pixels, giving them tiny dimensions compared to the screen of our mobile device. The apparent simplicity, however, is deceiving, given that after just a few games you realize the thickness of the experience, whose survival structure is actually set up on seventy increasingly complex levels, which we can face relying on a save system that memorizes automatically the last checkpoint and makes us start from there instead of from the beginning, dampening the possible frustration of an undeserved game over that can cancel our dreams of glory. Only One is a simple and immediate action game, but at the same time engaging and endowed with depth Touch and run The control system adopted by Only One uses the traditional virtual d-pad, which appears and self-calibrates every time our left thumb touches the screen, ensuring excellent responsiveness and precision with respect to the maneuvers that the game asks us to perform. These consist in hitting the opponents at the exact moment in which they are vulnerable, and then retreating and possibly increasing the distance from the target if the situation becomes hot, perhaps when our vital energy is at its limit and we have only one left ~ little heart~. Each enemy has different behavioral routines, which must be memorized to understand when it is appropriate to approach and attack, and some of them carry shields that defend them from our thrusts but which can be destroyed after a few thrusts. The point is to deal with all these factors when the number of opponents multiplies, proposing death squads that try to injure us from near and far at the same time, thanks to the support of archers or insidious ~jumping~ slimes. Fortunately we will be able to rely not only on the standard attack maneuver, but also and above all on a series of special moves and passive upgrades that will flesh out a repertoire that we will not lose at the first failure, but which will remain saved exactly like the last checkpoint, giving us the opportunity to develop the character's abilities from a perspective that actually has little or nothing to do with the survival approach. In short, Only One's offer goes far beyond appearances and becomes clear after just a few minutes of action, revealing a surprising depth, which conquers and pushes towards the traditional ~one more game and that's it~.", "date": "2014-03-01", "grade": "8.0"}
