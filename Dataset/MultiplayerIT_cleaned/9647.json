Between a sport and a fitness course, a game dedicated to dance could not be missing, given that Kinect is able to ~map~ us from head to toe and one of its characteristics is precisely that of detecting movements. What better occasion to create a rhythm game? After the competition also veered towards this genre, with classics like Singstar and recent hits like Just Dance, Xbox users could not remain still on their sofas without pawing and dancing. Dance Central songs Every dance lover will be thrilled simply by reading the list of songs in Dance Central, a mix of pop, hip hop and funky that includes many great hits. Americans will go crazy in finally learning the steps of Soulja Boy, a real phenomenon overseas with his Crank That made famous by Fast and Furious. The big hits are also Satisfaction (Benassi), Meneater (Furtado), Just Dance and Poker Face (Lady Gaga), You Know you want me (Pitbull), Drop it like it's hot (Snoop Dogg), Down (Jay Sean), but also other equally ~lively~ songs such as those of Cascada, Beasty Boys, M.I.A., Nina Sky, Young MC and Kylie Minogue. In short, there are many (about thirty) and for all tastes. Furthermore, the first ones in digital delivery have already arrived and are ready to be downloaded, demonstrating that the game will enjoy excellent support for future expansions. Your personal trainer for disco Although the market is now full of good dance games, Dance Central has a strategic advantage due to the use of Kinect. In other titles, in fact, the movement of the dance is detected by the peripherals held in the hands of the players: a precise system, but it strictly concerns the spatiality of a hardware, and not of ourselves. Kinect ~sees~ our entire body and interfaces with it to detect its moves, movements in the 3D space of our room and even the smallest details such as a foot bent to the right rather than to the left. This precision does not lead to hesitation, however. Dance Central is not a bad, inflexible teacher like Amici's Celentano, rather he leaves a fair margin of appreciation of the movements. Basically, the important thing is to make the move with the right posture and movement, and the CPU will consider the pass correct. After testing almost the entire initial lineup of Kinect, one concept can be affirmed: Dance Central is the game that most effectively detects body movements (including Your Shape, if however this can be considered a game rather than a personal fitness trainer), even in relatively confined spaces. The goodness of the detection system is immediately evident from the beginning. The navigation system between the Dance Central menus is practically immediate, fast, perfectly precise, an example to follow from now on for all the others. The initial sequence immediately puts us in the right mood to go wild on the dance floor, the presentation of the game, drawn in a cartoon style, is super dynamic and engaging, showing male and female dancers in a decidedly underground urban environment doing their utmost in hip hop evolutions and moves worthy of a videos from MTV (which produces the game, by the way). Just after the introductory movie, we are given the opportunity to throw ourselves directly on the track or to learn the various moves to be performed in the dances. Given the setting of Dance Central we suggest the second option: just like a tutorial, the game explains one step after another and gives us the possibility to associate the names of the moves to the movements, so that once the actual game has started we are able to execute them in perfect synchrony. Indeed, one of the problems of this kind of game is that of the ~imitation~ system of what appears on the screen. In short, normally in the new dance games based on movement devices, the player has to imitate the movements of an on-screen guide, perhaps producing perfect movements but inevitably slightly delayed compared to the original on-screen. While we play Dance Central, however, the moves are previewed and each one is assigned a ~name~ that we will surely remember after the training. Despite having a pre-visualization system, in any case the CPU proves to be quite understanding and tolerates minimal delays. Jumping immediately on the track, therefore, is not recommended for those who want to take the game ~seriously~. By clicking on the menu item ~decompose~, our personal dance teacher shows us in factall the most important steps making us repeat them a sufficient number of times until we have metabolized them properly. Starting from the simplest choreographed songs, which include basic movements and relatively easy to learn moves, you can slowly get to real television-style ballets in which we are called to perform breakdance steps, robots, translations of the pelvis and complex rotations of the limbs. The learning curve is soft and constantly calibrated upwards, in a linear but progressive way so as to give us plenty of time to learn and improve. Xbox 360 goals Dance Central, like every Xbox 360 game, puts the classic 1000 points on the plate to unlock, in 50 objectives. How did the developers manage to create so many given the chronic lack of options and modes? Simply said: everything is linked to the scores obtained and the moves performed. To get all the loot it is therefore necessary to learn all the songs and steps well, after which it will not be difficult to do it. Everyone on the track... but one at a time! The great merit of Dance Central, in addition to the invaluable one of having an almost perfect control over the detection, are the perfectly studied and incredibly engaging ballet choreographies. Obviously designed by professionals in the sector, they manage to find the right balance between those who have never danced in their life and those who have already dedicated themselves to this passion with success. It was not easy to create steps suitable for everyone, but which at the same time also satisfied those who already knew how to dance, and the developer was fully successful in this. After showing you the strengths of the Harmonix game, we can now move on to the pain points. The game menu immediately reveals a certain lack of options and modes, first of all the classic ~career~ that has made the fortune of many other more or less similar Rhythm Games. There is no real single player mode that allows us to gain fame, travel the world to dance, become someone by progressing in the dance, but everything is ~simply~ reduced to an arcade-style hit and run game (dance dance by Konami docet). The progression of the game is there, but it is exclusively linked to unlocking new characters, costumes, sets where to dance and new challenges (dancing two/three songs in sequence). Someone might think that basically this can't be a problem, since this kind of games are designed to let us have fun in a fast and carefree way, perhaps in multiplayer with friends. And here too the donkey falls, because Dance Central has a multiplayer mode, but closely linked to two people and in a cooperative / competitive way in which you cannot dance together. In fact, once the two-player challenge has been chosen, the players must take turns in front of the screen one at a time, with intermediate freestyle sequences that serve to give time for the exchange. In the cooperative mode the score is shared, while in the competitive one it is obviously separate and contributes to decreeing the winner of the challenge. The idea of filming the freestyle movements and final moves to repropose them later and give us the opportunity to share them with friends is nice. In a nutshell, as far as multiplayer is concerned, Dance Central definitely gives way to other similar productions that even allow you to dance in eight people. The Kinect sensor is for Dance Central the strongest point in favor, but for now also its limitation precisely because (for now) it can't handle enough players all together. Probably also because it would take an entire stage to perform. The choreographies of the game are displayed by excellent graphics with highly detailed polygonal models of characters and settings, but above all with fabulous animations obviously derived from perfect motion capture. Nothing to say about the soundtrack, since we have dedicated a paragraph to it specifically, but we can only reiterate that Dance Central focuses a lot on the most famous hits of its tracklist, also proposing them in all the dead moments of the game. The Harmonix game is in some ways an example for future titles to imitate, in terms of tracking accuracy it is unmatched among the entire Kinect lineup, but we hope that in its future incarnations it will support true multiplayer and perhaps an eye in more for the single player.", "date": "2010-11-16", "grade": "8.0"}
