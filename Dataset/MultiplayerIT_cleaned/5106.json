We're talking about Angry Birds Blast!, a title that incorporates the traditional match-3 mechanics using, however, an inverse scrolling of the elements of the board, which move from bottom to top as they are in fact balloons. In each stage our goal is to collect a certain number of birds, which we can do simply by eliminating the balloons of the same color as the birds: red, black, light blue, yellow and white. To this are added, however, the inevitable green pigs, which sometimes infest the levels and which must be put out of action by triggering explosions in the areas adjacent to them. A gameplay that is immediately simple and immediate, if only because there are so many productions of this type available on the App Store and Google Play, games from which Angry Birds Blast! unfortunately it doesn't stand out that much. In fact, in addition to some variations on the theme, such as for example the missions in which you have to recover objects by sliding them from one side of the board to the other, by eliminating the balloons that stand between them and the destination, the experience of the new title produced by Rovio unfortunately turns out to be inconsistent and a bit too much based on luck. Angry Birds Blast! is a match-3 style puzzle game with all too traditional mechanics Do you want a balloon? The Angry Birds Blast! campaign is quite long, as has become the tradition for freemium-based puzzle games, and the developers have included some of the most classic monetization elements: the lives that are lost in game over and are recharged after twenty minutes, but can be donated by a friend of ours on social media; the upgrades that allow you to complete the most complex stages with relative ease; and finally the inevitable coins that we can spend on various things, first of all getting an extra set of moves at the end of a level. The basic concept of the game is in fact to achieve the set objectives while remaining within a certain number of actions: if we succeed, the remaining maneuvers will be ~shot~ on the board for a further collection of points and the achievement of the canons three stars that indicate the quality of our performance. The problem, as previously indicated, is that often the smooth completion of a stage or the game over due to running out of moves depend on luck rather than on our ability, in particular when the board begins to fill up with obstacles to be destroyed for one, thus sacrificing movements that we could have used for the sole purpose of achieving the objectives. Not a small defect for a match-3, considering that the most important titles belonging to this so inflated genre have long since learned to organize their own structure and mechanisms to offer the greatest possible variety, with a view to a system in where player skills really make a difference. Technically well done, equipped with the usual colorful graphics that have always characterized the Angry Birds series, Blast! in short, it stands as one of the less convincing spin-offs released so far.", "date": "2017-01-02", "grade": "6.5"}
