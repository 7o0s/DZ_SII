GGB offers the same modes present in its direct competitors: quick start, career and free ride and multiplayer. Going deeper into the options we find the jukebox mode and a playlist editor. If the first mode is self-explanatory, the second requires some clarification. The editor allows the player to select the sequence of songs that would otherwise always be repeated with the usual sequence, which in the long run could annoy given the kind of sound present in the game. If you are not a fan of hip-hop and nu-metal it will be better to keep the volume of the TV turned down, even if given the quality of many songs it is perhaps better that you do it anyway. Always remaining on the sound side, nothing relevant to report regarding the effects and noises, very few even if they are very well done. By tackling the career mode you will initially have only one bike and a few bikers at your disposal, the latter chosen from among true professionals or created for the occasion. However, the number is destined to increase if you have the patience to finish the game. In fact, the title proves to be difficult especially for newcomers to the genre, as well as for a series of problems that we will analyze later. GGB proposes the typical alternation between stages where you collect objects and points tournaments. Each level provides for 10 missions to be completed, many of which are similar for each stage faced, such as recovering letters to form the writing GRAVITY, making a certain number of points, performing tricks and so on. The aforementioned missions are only shown at the start of the race and given the nature of many of these, i.e. search or recovery, it happens that the player has to restart the game from time to time because he has forgotten where this or that other objective is. From this point of view, a map that showed the location of the objectives at all times would have been useful. The problem is accentuated by the size of the stages, very large to tell the truth but with a small flaw: they are almost completely empty. Apart from railings or tanks where you can grind, the arenas are so to speak uninhabited, which makes each game a continuous solitary race between one goal and another. From game to game, your character's ability to perform certain types of evolutions will increase and it will be possible to unlock new characters, new arenas and new ~bikes~. Problems Ahead! Speaking of serious problems, one of the title's major flaws is the control system. Very often there is the feeling of not having full control of your digital alter ego, in general it seems that the game responds late to your commands making any type of evolution difficult. Doing not only a trick but also a simple reverse becomes a feat, which is very irritating when you need maximum precision to perform, say, a jump or an evolution that requires a certain key combination. In this regard it must be said that the number of ~moves~ that can be performed is quite small, a factor that reduces your evolutions in the same 5-6 combinations and furthermore the realization of certain grinds can be extended indefinitely, which brings the player to grind in circles in the tanks to accumulate points instead of engaging in evolutions. If the control system is not up to the situation, it cannot be said that the virtual camera helps in this sense, in general, however, it is the whole graphics sector that would need a rearrangement. For the creation of GGB, Midway made use of the never too abused Renderware. Now, it's not like you can expect who knows what from this software package, but I feel like saying that it's not RenderWare's fault if the game technically seems closer to a PSOne than to the hardware set up to play it on. The polygon count is kept to a bare minimum, yet the frame-rate struggles to stay pegged at 30fps. The animations for their part denote a certain woodiness as well as being completely unrelated to each other. They close the textures, also resurrected from some old project on the 32 bit Sony. One last note on the multiplayer mode. The latter offers 5 different modes, all focused on the challenge between the two players. Fortunately in this case the graphics engine does not suffer any slowdowns as well as the number of polygons which is maintained on the single player levels. At least in this case the longevity of the title increases, unless you get tired of the defects mentioned above first. As you may have understood, the gglobal opinion can only be negative for the Midway stock. Comment As I said at the beginning of the review, mediocrity is the master in this game, the total lack of ideas and above all the desire to propose something new is evident as soon as you access the main menu, already in itself devoid of frills and so on . Mat Hoffman and Dave Mirra therefore sleep peacefully, even if the doubt arises that GGB would not have been saved even if he had been the progenitor of its kind. The amount of bugs and defects in the graphics sector and in the control system require at least a total revision of the game for the creation of a hypothetical sequel. PRO: +You will hardly finish it soon! +Good multiplayer mode CONS: -Mediocre in every aspect -Definitely inaccurate control system -Graphically it seems close to a PSOne title -Few sound effects Gravity Games Bike represents a decidedly unsuccessful attempt to create a BMX game in the vein of Mat Hoffman and Dave Mirra. Midway's attempt to create a BMX simulation like its most famous competitors has proved unsuccessful from every point of view, in fact there is not a single parameter of this game that borders on mediocrity.
