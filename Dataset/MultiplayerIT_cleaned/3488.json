{"name": "Rainbow Six: Siege - Operazione Ember Rise", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-siege-operazione-ember-rise-la-recensione.html", "text": "The protagonist of this season of Rainbow Six Siege is South America and, between mobile shields and grappling hooks, it almost seems to have taken a leap into the now distant 2016, precisely to the time of the release of Skull Rain. This time, however, the new entries of the Rainbow team have excellent eyesight and do not paint their faces in a disturbing way. No Capito and Caveira, therefore, but in their place Amaru and Goyo. No Brazil, but Peru and Mexico. Ember Rise - this is the name of the new Siege Operation - follows the philosophy of the previous DLCs, hiding in the title a veiled reference to the skills of the two operators who, with their recruitment, finally bring the large group to ~50 units~ ( ... and we're just halfway along the path mapped out by the development team). In fact, a spark is enough to ignite the embers (= Ember) that flares up from Goyo's ingeniously modified mobile shields, while great attention is required not to be taken aback by the very rapid rise (= Rise) of Amaru and his hook . The news, however, does not end there. After generating great hype during the semi-reveal of the last Six Invitational, Kanal's rework has finally been completed and, in this way, one of the scenarios most loved by veterans of the title has once again appeared in the pool of maps available in Ranked. For one that enters, however, there are even 3 out: Amusement Park, Hereford Base and Fortress have been removed from the rotation. The reworking of the first one coming with the next season is already official, so it wouldn't surprise us to see the last two again in the not too distant future. At least for the moment, however, we are sure that the game community will not miss them at all, which had clamored for an intervention by the developers aimed at correcting certain aspects that made these scenarios strongly unbalanced. The real innovation, however, is certainly the one brought to the system of degrees. The need for a more harmonious distribution of the players and a division that would better differentiate their in-game skills had already been felt for some time. Hence, therefore, the addition of three totally new grades (Copper 5, Bronze 5 and Silver 5) and the removal of Gold 4 (the limbo of most Siege players). The introduction of the Champions degree, on the other hand, makes history in itself: it is a real ranking that can only be accessed after exceeding 5,000 points (therefore well above the diamond). At the center of the pennant appears the number indicating the individual placement of the player among the first 9,999 within its own server. If it is true that the climb becomes more difficult, even the clash on the ~upper floors~ takes on new meaning and offers a further level of challenge to the best players. Ubisoft, however, has also thought of the less competitive and those who do not yet feel ready to risk their placement: here, therefore, is the ~Unclassified~ playlist. It is a list of scenarios aimed at promoting the learning of game mechanics, with the same rules as simple Ranked, but without the pressure associated with the rank system. This also implies that the new anti-boosting restrictions, introduced specifically with Ember Rise and aimed at preventing unbalanced matchmaking in Ranked, do not affect the Unranked environment in any way. In fact, lobbies made up of players with a score difference of more than 1,000 are denied access to Ranked, but not access to the new scenario list: groups of friends with extremely different skills still have the opportunity to have fun in Unclassified. Everything should be seasoned by the Mini Battle Pass presented during the Raleigh Major, but at the moment there is no further news on this system of ~challenges with prizes~, which could arrive in-game at any moment. For now we only know that the first phase of the introduction will be called ~Call me Harry~ (starring Dr. Harishva Pandey, the new ~Six~) and that it will be totally free. Battle points earned by playing can be converted into special rewards such as skins, uniforms and charms. Remaining in this theme, Operation Ember Rise also brings with it a brand new Elite Set, this time dedicated to Mira. With the Inspiracin uniform, the GEO representative pays tribute to those who served during the Spanish Civil War... complete with cannon in tow! Amaru & Goyo: like a family This time we even had to wait for the official release of the DLC to be able to enjoy the typical presentation trailer of the new operators, but the wait has been enormously rewarded: Amaru and Goyo interact with each other even atthere outside the ~working~ environment, inextricably linked by a much stronger relationship than simple friendship, almost as if they were relatives. According to the lore that surrounds them, in fact, the Peruvian would represent a true point of reference in the life of the young Mexican, especially following the episode in which Sofia, Goyo's mother and Amaru's best friend, would have been seriously injured due to - ironically - a huge explosion. Csar Ruiz ~Goyo~ Hernndez, specialist in the Fuerzas Especiales, is described as a pragmatic man, with an analytical attitude, always ready to evaluate any possible solution to problems. The defender with Armor 2 and Speed 2, despite his stats, breaks the rules imposed some time ago by Ubisoft: he is not a ~heavy~, but he can still accessorize an ACOG. Its endowment, in fact, as regards the primary weapon, provides two extremely valid and well-known alternatives to the players of the tactical shooter. It is a question of choosing between the Vector.45 ACP (Mira's submachine gun) and the TCSG 12 (Kaid's semi-automatic shotgun), the latter which can be equipped with the community's most loved viewfinder. The secondary weapon, on the other hand, is unique: the P229 pistol, already available for Hibana and Echo, becomes a trusted companion in extremely tense situations. Goyo is certainly the most ~explosive~ operator in the game... and we're not just referring to the possibility of choosing between Impact Grenades and Nitro-Cells. The thirty-one year old from Culiacn Rosales (Mexico) takes the field with as many as 3 mobile shields equipped with incendiary devices. The Vlcan - never a name was more suitable for a gadget - perform a double task: they act as a deterrent and punish the less cautious. From the front, in fact, they are perfectly identical to simple mobile shields, providing shelter and allowing the counteroffensive thanks to the small bulletproof windows, introduced right at the beginning of Ember Rise, with their 2.0 version. On the back, however, they have large magnets to which the Mexican automatically hooks petrol cans, the detonation of which is able to discourage even the most fearless of attackers. Goyo, in fact, thanks to his unique ability, falls into the category of ~area inhibition~ defenders (a bit like Smoke, to be clear). The flames given off by a Vlcan, which can be triggered both with explosives and with direct gunshots to the tank, destroy the shield itself and flare up in a perimeter of 2 meters for about 10 seconds. It is, therefore, an extremely lethal gadget that requires particular attention during placement because, being a trap that can be activated by any operator, it can also prove to be a thorn in the side for defense. If Goyo is in the team, the final moments of a round become hell... including tongues of fire. The Mexican's calculating character was certainly influenced by his relationship with the specialist Azucena Rocio ~Amaru~ Quispe, a resilient and prudent woman, strongly linked to her origins. In addition to a similar nature, the two share basic statistics: the new attacker, in fact, is also part of the group of ~medium~ operators (Armor 2 - Speed 2). Her unique ability, however, ensures her a considerable speed of movement: the Garra hook is a modified grappling hook that allows her to exploit the surprise effect in a completely new way for Siege. Although it is a rather cumbersome device, the attacker member of the APCA does not seem to be affected by its weight and, on the contrary, moves with the grace of a dragonfly when in flight. That's right: thanks to this gadget, Amaru can reach distant ledges or break through any type of window, hovering in the air at a speed of 7.5 m/s. The Peruvian is also the only operator able to go back through open trapdoors or certain skylights on some maps, previously unreachable from inside the building. The Garra hook - a device enviable even by the best Batman - allows a completely different approach to the assault phase, between completely new tactics and brutal rushes in the very first moments of a round. When Amaru is around, defenders are forced to guard against attacks from above and below. The grappling hook can be used up to four times, a number of uses that seemed to us higher than those really necessary in the economy of a game, but not unbalanced for this. Basically, it is really difficult to find yourself in a situation where you feel the need to consume all the charges... even when you try - in vain, in our case - to find the right timing to succeed in the ~Garra football~ (breaking in from a window with instant kill of the opponent behind him). Our modern Indiana Jones, after a past as a freelance archaeologist, decided to put her skills at the disposal of the Rainbow team and, to do so, she had to take on a respectable paraphernalia. The G8A1 (the big machine gun already available to IQ) gives great satisfaction thanks to its long bursts of lead just after breaking into a site, but also its alternative, the Supernova (shotgun of Hibana and Echo), can rightly throat. The secondary weapons are no less: in combo with the LMG, the ITA12S (compact shotgun, also used by Mira and Jackal) takes on great value, especially when you need to open passages through unreinforced hatches; the SMG11, on the other hand, has a potential we know very well, thanks to its large deployment among SAS forces. As for the secondary gadgets, together with the Claymore and after a bit of initial indecision - during the presentation we had attended we were shown the Breaching Charges - the development team rightly opted for the Stun Grenades. If with Nkk and Warden Ubisoft has not managed to give a major shake-up to the meta of the game, we can be sure it has succeeded with the two new operators: Amaru and Goyo change the cards on the table, they are fun to play and, thanks to their skills, they will also be able to carve out some space in the competitive scene. Don't change Kanale! They had promised it and it arrived with great fanfare: Kanal's reworking was one of the cornerstones of Operation Ember Rise... but it failed to bring the community to agreement. The bad experience with Hereford Base, whose rework has never fully convinced (see the removal from the Classified less than a year after its release), has certainly influenced the opinion of the players, who have repeatedly revealed the hatred for dispersive maps and with too many environments. A close look at this restyling in its entirety, however, highlights the painstaking work of Ubisoft. The developers reshaped Kanal using a precise chisel and avoiding going too deep. The building, now looking much more modern in every area (external and internal), consists of the usual two wings. The real difference is the introduction of a second bridge, parallel to the existing one, useful for providing a new path for the rotations of attackers and, above all, defenders. This simple structure is enough to avoid the ~funnel effect~ present in every match hosted in the previous version of this map in which, once one of the two areas was lost, one was forced to retreat and succumb to the advance of the attackers. A new bridge obviously implies the introduction of new corridors and the expansion of some existing rooms, especially near the Radar and Server site, on one side, and the Radio Room, on the other. The revision took place not only horizontally, but also vertically: each wing has two flights of stairs, each identifiable by a different colour. Moving between floors has never been easier! Another strong point of this reworking - at least in the intentions - was the drastic intervention on the number of windows with too clear a view towards the spawn points, but despite this it may still not be enough. It is precisely on this aspect, in fact, that the community is divided. While some players complain about an excessive number of run-outs and shooting lines favorable to defenders, others are fully satisfied with the result achieved with this rework. The truth, in our opinion, lies somewhere in between: the spawn kill must necessarily be a ~high risk - high reward~ mechanic and, even in this 2.0 version of the Kanal map, it cannot be said that it always respects this philosophy. The reworking, however, also affected the placement of the bombs in Bomb squad mode and some were moved to make their tactical management by the defenders less difficult. The sites are organized in a more harmonious way and allow less articulated rotations for both factions. In addition, in this way it is no longer necessary to go in and out of the building continuously to embark on an assault.", "date": "2019-09-18", "grade": "7.5"}
