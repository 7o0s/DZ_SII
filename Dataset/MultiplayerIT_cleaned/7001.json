{"name": "Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cuphead-the-delicious-last-course-recensione.html", "text": "Cuphead is wonder. What makes him willing to play are not the run and gun mechanics, which in a certain sense are only a pretext, but precisely the amazement of being faced with an unusual and personal aesthetic, avant-garde and at the same time deeply nostalgic , which takes the idea that generated it (the revival of the style of American cartoons from the 1920s/30s) to the extreme consequences. The curiosity to see all the bosses and all the splendid hand-drawn animations by the artists of Studio MDHR is the driving force of the whole experience, that is, satisfying it is the real, great pleasure that one feels by playing. It must be said that it also works well as a game in itself, despite not having who knows what original elements, but it is precisely the beauty that transpires from each frame that inspires the player and keeps him in front of the screen until the end and beyond. The first and probably only expansion of the game, given the time it took to produce it, has the same strengths, as you will discover by reading the review of Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course. Ms Chalice Will we be able to turn Ms. Chalice into a crock-and-bone cup? Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course is more of the same pure and simple, but in a good way in this case. Considering Cuphead, it can be seen as a new season of a hit series, with all the appropriate proportions. Basically the game remains the same, but it is expanded with a new island, which houses extremely difficult bosses. But let's go in order. After installation, the fourth island is not immediately accessible. That is, it is if you already have an advanced save, in which you have passed the first mausoleum, the one where Ms. Chalice meets. From that moment it becomes possible to reach it via the boat, the one that has always been used to move quickly between the three islands of the base game. Ms. Chalice is the true protagonist of the adventure, not only because she becomes a playable character, but also because she is the engine of the whole story. Attention because in the next paragraph we will be forced to give some small previews on the plot of Cuphead, essential to understand that of the DLC. So if you haven't played it yet... what are you waiting for? Come on, don't stand here wasting your time. As you know if you've continued reading up to here, Ms. Chalice is a specter who lives in mausoleums and helps Cuphead and Mugman by giving them power-ups. On the fourth island lives a very famous cook, Pinzimonio Salieri, who has managed to prepare biscuits that allow ghosts to incarnate. Unfortunately, their effect is limited in time, but the kind walrus claims to know a recipe that will make the girl's return to the physical world permanent. The problem is that the ingredients to prepare it are scattered throughout the island and are in the possession of some terrible bosses, who will do anything to put a spoke in our heroes' handles. The bosses Some of the new bosses are super tough, like this one To use Ms. Chalice you must select Salieri's cookie, called Astral Shortbread, as an amulet. While similar to the original two protagonists in basic characteristics, the sprightly girl has unique abilities that make her different enough to use. In the meantime, he does not parry with the double jump, but with the sprint. It also has a roll that makes it immortal and an extra life point. These extras are used to not miss the other amulets, which obviously are not selectable with her. In addition to Ms. Chalice, the DLC adds new weapons and charms, which can also be used in the old levels. These are variants of the original weapons (a slower but more powerful homing attack, a triple shot with a longer range and so on) which, like the others, are more or less useful depending on the boss. In reality, the weapons are not exactly transcendental (they are variants of the old ones) and we also found the amulets not very useful, since we played almost all the time with Ms. Chalice. Ms. Chalice is the protagonist of the DLC Speaking of bosses, the DLC adds five in total, plus a final showdown and, as already mentioned, they're all very difficult. In fact, already on the Normal difficulty level, the challenge is so high that it seems quite obvious how the new contents have been conceived for expert players. Each boss has multiple stages, all with different animations, which forces you to study multiple tactics within the same fight, changing them depending on the situation. The variety is very high, from giants who live on snowy mountains, ice wizards and more. In addition to the regular bosses, the ones that yield the ingredients, there is also a special challenge, against chess-inspired bosses, which areinstead, it serves to obtain very useful gold coins, with which objects are bought (in the same way as in the base game). In this, which we can consider a bonus stage, you have to beat four bosses using only parries, trying to figure out when to use them and how to avoid the attacks of the enemy on duty. Finally, there is also a boss to challenge in a classic shooter level: a nice cow that literally spits blood. As usual, once the bosses have been beaten, it is possible to challenge them on the highest difficulty level, so as to extend the game time. Beauty Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course has beautiful animations like those of the base game Being amazed in front of Cuphead, and consequently also with the contents of Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, is not a question of graphic power, but rather of awareness that something like this is literally unrepeatable. We would define it as an artisan experience, in which looking at the moving images it is also possible to clearly see the inspiration, the effort and the joy of those who made them, frame after frame. It is an impossible sensation to experience in the face of even more technically advanced titles, because it is epidermal and comes from the experience of beauty itself, which in Cuphead reaches very high peaks. In this sense The Delicious Last Course is simply an excellent addition to an already rich framework, which once again shows the skills of the artists of Studio MDHR and how their refusal to bend to more fruitful production logics has led to the creation of a perfect add-on pack for the game it's expanding. Never as in this case is the experience enriched in its essence, because the new contents are born from the same passion that led to the realization of the entire project.
