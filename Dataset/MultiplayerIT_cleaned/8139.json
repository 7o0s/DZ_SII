Does he remind you of anything? The only hope to avoid the worst requires traveling back in time aboard a Chronosphere, and the wily Jessica Chase volunteers to carry out the mission. Chronovolt's plot in itself would also be interesting, if it weren't a simple pretext to offer us an action puzzle ~with balls~ as we have already seen quite a few. However, the reference platform is PlayStation Vita, a terrain that is still far from beaten for this kind of production, and so here we are to control the heavy metal sphere within a fairly long and demanding single player campaign, in which we will have to take into account the weight of our particular ~time machine~, the inertia of each movement and, above all, the fact that the scenarios are often and willingly formed by platforms suspended in the void, from which it is very easy to fall, incurring a ruthless game over. To remedy the problem we will be able to make use of the time jump: by touching the touch screen of the Sony portable console with both thumbs, we will ~rewind~ time until we return to a few moments before the fall, consuming a bar that loads as we collect objects within the stage. Roll, roll The gameplay of Chronovolt is very simple, on balance. In fact, what we are asked is to control the Chronosphere, trying to collect as many ~energy spheres~ as possible, and to reach the exit. This operation during the first levels proves to be trivial, but the simple passage from point A to point B becomes more and more complicated. Primarily due to locations full of chasms and ~narrow~ sections, to be covered with great attention, as well as mechanisms to activate and keys to collect before the exit becomes accessible, but also due to the arrival of ~bad~ spheres, very heavy, able to make us end up below without too much effort. To eliminate them we will once again be able to draw on our energy bar, the same that determines the power to rewind time, and hit them by touching their silhouette on the screen. However, this is a temporary solution, which we will often have no way of implementing and which we will have to prefer simple speed or the exploitation of ~unstable~ platforms to try to bring down the enemy spheres. The game control system tries to exploit all the peculiarities of PlayStation Vita: from the two analog sticks to the touch screen, passing through the rear touch pad, which can be used to manage the view (but this feature can be deactivated). PSVita trophies Chronovolt contains nine Trophies, most of which are obtained simply by completing the game worlds in a simple way or by obtaining all the stars. I want bigger balls Chronovolt is currently part of the Instant Game Collection for PSVita and therefore can be downloaded for free by all subscribers to the PlayStation Plus service, but it is also available for standard purchase at the price of only 6.19 euros. A rather low starting figure, were it not for the fact that the unlocking of new Chronospheres, faster or heavier than the default one, can only be obtained for a fee. It goes without saying that we would have preferred a higher price (9.99 euros?) in the face of an integrated upgrade system, an element which would have made the progression between the various levels more significant beyond obtaining the traditional stars, assigned based on our performance. The second problem of this production lies in a technical sector that is anything but exceptional, despite the theoretically simple context to manage. Is moving spheres within a relatively bare scenario really that difficult for the Sony portable console to return a dancer frame rate, a lot of slowdowns and a bad drawing distance? We believe not, indeed we are convinced that all this depends on a poor optimization of the engine, a hypothesis supported by the presence of some annoying bugs. During one game, for example, we went downstairs and tried to use time rewind to get the Chronosphere back to the platform, but this action was matched by a mysterious ~debris rain~ that prevented us from going back up.", "date": "2012-12-05", "grade": "5.0"}
