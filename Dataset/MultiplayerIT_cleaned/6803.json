An average teenager, in short. Besides, he's with a girl who wants to get into politics and who treats him worse than a condom at a castrated party. The agricultural part is completely useless In short, his life would suck even a roll of toilet paper, were it not that one day the genius manages to make it worse, deciding to start looking at other women at the exact moment in which he was trying to recover the relationship with his girlfriend, treating her also bad for his jealous tantrum. Left alone and not knowing what to do to spend the summer, apart from enrolling in the club of five agitated fingers, he is persuaded by his father to go to the house of an uncle dedicated to agriculture. The nice old man, after welcoming him brusquely, not at all impressed by his excesses, puts him to work on a piece of land, which he will have to clear of weeds and sow with various types of plants. Meanwhile the good Steve will also have to visit different places in the town where he is to meet women and try to pick them up, deciding day after day what to do with his old love story. Will he be able to sleep with at least one of them, recovering even a little self-confidence? Or is he destined to become the protagonist of a first person shooter? Come and discover The Flower Shop, a visual novel to review in summer and winter What do you know about a cornfield... Flower Shop: Summer In Fairbrook is a dating simulator mixed with a farm simulator, at least on paper. The aim of the player is to get poor Steve to hook up with one of the girls in the game, each with different interests and activities. In a dating simulator there are beautiful daughters to pick up As a genre wants, the amount of text to read is predominant over all other aspects of the gameplay, even if in this case there is no shortage of choices to be made and multiple-choice dialogues that determine the improvement or worsening of relationships with the other characters. Based on the behavior held and the activities carried out, which can be selected in the classic calendar that allows you to organize the boy's entire week, you can arrive at one of the nine finals present. To see them all, you have to replay several times, perhaps avoiding rereading the lines and descriptions you have already read. In total, if you don't skip the text, that's several hours of gameplay (varies a lot depending on how many times you finish it). The dating simulator gameplay is broken up by the presence of a kind of really simple farm simulator. As already mentioned, Steve has to devote himself to cleaning his uncle's small garden from weeds, to plant something beautiful, useful or edible. The possible interactions on each of the squares that make up the piece of land are cleaning, which can require from one to three actions, and sowing, which requires a single action (each day there is a limited working time, which must be managed by deciding what to do). Flower Shop: Winter In Fairbrook The year after the release of Summer in Fairbook, Winter Wolves released the sequel, Flower Shop: Winter In Fairbrook, which maintains the same game system, complete with farming system, some locations and some themes of its predecessor, despite the change of season (winter instead of summer). There are also characters in common, despite the change of protagonist, here female. In short, if you liked Summer in Fairbook, you will surely like this too, otherwise forget it. The story got stuck Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbook is seen to be an early Winter Wolves work, as it has several issues fixed in later releases. The appointment simulator mechanics seem to be the classic ones of the genre, but in general we are faced with an immature product, which tells its story poorly. Who knows if at the end of the summer the uncle will have the same attitude Steve is a wild boy, at least that's what we are led to believe at the beginning of the story. Too bad it's really easy to make him act in contrast with his character to get the fateful appointment, a sign of mediocre writing and cut with an axe. In short, to pick up it is more important to grow Steve's characteristics instead of exploring the different sides of the character as happens in other dating simulators. The management of the farm deserves a separate discussion, for which we have not been able to find any use. Steve cultivates, then sells what he collects, finally accumulates a nice nest egg... all very nice, too bad you don't understand what it entails in terms of game, seeI know that the money is only used to buy more seeds and there's nothing else you can do about it. In short, the much-vaunted farm management phase resolves itself into a series of activities for their own sake, which basically just waste time. To say: we tried to get to one of the endings without cultivating anything and... we succeeded. Another significant problem is the narrative paucity of most of the characters, who in some cases completely disappear from the scene (see the uncle), while they behave and speak like living clichs. In short, Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbook soon resolves itself into a continuous carrying out of the same activities, to follow stories that turn out to be little or nothing exciting. Forget it, because there really is much better, and at a lower price.", "date": "2014-10-28", "grade": "5.5"}
