Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay a cent. Endless driving? Perhaps this will be the name of the curious variant of the running game created by Zombie Highway but which also belongs to Mutant Roadkill, the new title developed by GLU Mobile for iOS and Android devices. The concept of the game is simple: using a structure that everyone knows well, in Temple Run style, it puts us at the wheel of an armored car in a post-apocalyptic scenario, with cities devastated by who knows what nuclear disaster and streets populated only by dangerous mutants. There is only one way to earn coins, and that is to invest these pathetic creatures, perhaps trying to string together a long combo to fill the appropriate indicator on the left side of the screen. Once complete, it will allow us to unlock an upgrade on the fly: a deadly machine gun turret to be mounted on the roof, an electric shield to defend ourselves from enemies trying to cling to the doors, a special boost, a bomb and so on. After the first mile, which basically serves as a ~warm-up~, the action of Mutant Roadkill immediately becomes insidious: the obstacles along the way multiply, as well as the mutants capable of doing something more than waiting for death: those who attach themselves to the vehicle will arrive, damaging it progressively until we print them on an object of the scenario or make them fall following a drift; those equipped with claws, even more dangerous, or those that explode on contact, causing us considerable damage. In the lower part of the touch screen it is possible to keep an eye on the energy bar relating to our car: if it empties completely, it is game over. I'll rip off your panties The freemium nature of this new GLU Mobile product makes itself felt quickly enough: the game doesn't ~give~ us anything in terms of challenges and unlockables, handing out coins in a small amount to push us to reach into our wallet and buy one of the many packages available. It is also possible to obtain virtual money for free, for example by visiting the title's Facebook page, or by making purchases at affiliated shops (among which some of the best known English online stores stand out). Seen from this perspective, it is interesting, it is basically a ~cashback~ service designed to let us get new items without paying for them: perhaps some publishers specializing in free-to-play could take the trouble to delve into the subject in the future ( on Ouya?). We were saying, Mutant Roadkill doesn't give us anything but in the end it turns in favor of the depth of the experience, which requires more than a handful of games to begin to be truly appreciated. Tilt controls, for example, require a degree of promptness and precision that we will hardly be able to guarantee right away, especially when you have to pass close to an object to get one or more mutants off your back. From this point of view, the lack of an alternative control system, in this case touch, seemed quite serious to us: we hope it will be implemented through an update. Nothing to complain about the technical sector, very solid and convincing, with decent graphics in cel shading (had you ever seen it on iOS or Android?) which makes the ~comic book~ atmosphere of the title well. Too bad for the sound, which fails to stand out as too often happens in mobile games.", "date": "2012-08-04", "grade": "7.9"}
