Yes, we know, if you are a lover of this particular adventure since 2002 you've probably already seen it in the limelight recently: the version we're talking about today is none other than the Diamond Edition enriched with further content and improvements, to the point of offering everything a true fan could want from the work. It is therefore impossible to think of a more ~definitive~ edition than this, even if the conversion on console (on PC it arrived in the spring of 2018) is offered at a decidedly questionable price. So let's see all the details of the conversion, the contents and reflect on some important considerations. Contents Neverwinter Nights is the third-person RPG developed by BioWare, based on the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons and in particular set in the Forgotten Realms. The contents of the Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition offer an unimaginable amount of hours of gameplay: we note the presence of over 100 hours guaranteed only by the DLCs, with ten stand-alone adventures set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons, and in particular all the expansions are present you might expect, such as Shadows of Undrentide, Hordes of the Underdark, and the Wyvern Crown of Cormyr and Pirates of the Sword Coast modes. All this, moreover, was already present in the Diamond Edition, to which we have previously referred. From the Diamond Edition we then moved on to the Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition. The specific improvements of this version are mainly focused on refinements to the user interface and the correction of several minor bugs, as well as the addition of 4K/1080; all while maintaining support for mods and the breadth of the original source material (mostly on PC). Beamdog's attempt was that of a restoration work that was as complete and respectful as possible, without neglecting the possibility of attracting new players, who would certainly have turned up their noses several times at the sight of the ~old~ game graphics. Let me be clear: Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition is always the same, especially in the basic structure and in the polygonal models, and it could not be otherwise since it is a remaster: the years on its shoulders can all be seen. This last detail, depending on the point of view, could be considered an advantage or a defect: was there still a need for a new paid version, instead of introducing the graphic improvements via update on the Diamond Edition? When starting your first campaign on Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition you can choose whether to aim for the main adventure or for one of the two expansions included; alternatively waiting for you are the premium modules. Again, the title is fully usable in mode, but also supports online cooperative multiplayer. Playstation 4 trophies Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition arrives on PlayStation 4 with a glittering Platinum Trophy, but winning it will not be easy since you will have to complete the entire game on the highest difficulty; and even if by now you may know it like the back of your hand, you will still need many hours available. It certainly remains a Platinum that you can brag about with your friends. The conversion to PlayStation 4 Having clarified the contents and the operation behind Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition, let's move on to the real underlying issue: the conversion on PlayStation 4. PC players who for some reason want to switch to enjoying the adventures in the Forgotten Realms on PlayStation 4 will go against an unprecedented trauma: not because the mapping of the commands was carried out without intelligence, but simply because, even with a valuable adaptation and probably not further improveable, it remains uncomfortable. Almost every action and interaction with characters and the surrounding world is entrusted to a radial menu, which can be recalled with the back keys; navigation is instead entrusted to the analog sticks. Everything is cumbersome and also decidedly slow, because every single menu is divided into an infinite number of sub-menus. It will take hours and hours to memorize the ~route~ to certain actions and makes the process smooth. In any case, with a Dualshock 4 available and in general with gamepads, it was probably not possible to do better, unless you prefer to connect the keyboard and mouse directly to the PlayStation 4: and at that point it is worth starting a PC. After all, even the dated models now hold up perfectly Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition, also thanks to the optimization workdeveloper action made in recent years. As far as the graphic and technical sector is concerned, all the advantages of high definition noted last year on Personal Computers have also arrived on the Sony flagship console: renderings, textures, internal and external environments have been revised and improved, clearly without the possibility of eliminate the basic ~edginess~ of the entire production. The lines of dialogue deserve a separate discussion, which, although revised, still contain gross errors; moreover, sometimes they inexplicably switch from the Italian language to the English one. These are minimal defects, however, compared to an excellent conversion ... which in any case will cost you no less than fifty euros.", "date": "2019-12-11", "grade": "8.0"}
