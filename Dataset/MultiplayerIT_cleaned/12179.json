We are unarmed inside a destroyed psychiatric hospital. The corridors reverberate with sinister noises and terrifying screams. What happened? Obviously we know what our urgency is: to arm ourselves. We wander around the sinister corridors for a while. Some figures move among the rubble. For now we are not being attacked by anyone. Having found the first weapon, a wrench, we also meet a monster: another ~guest~ of the hospital, in a straitjacket, comes against us. He is armed with a pointed stick and has a retractor in his mouth which disfigures his face by distorting it into an expression that seems to have come out of a painting by Francis Bacon (the painter, not the philosopher). A couple of wrench hits on the skull and he's knocked down. Unfortunately it affected us by dropping our health. Not bad: the hospital is full of vials with an incredibly effective healing liquid inside. in some places it seems to pass through an interrupted dream, the corpse of a drifting world whose outward appearance, which pretended to appear glorious, is now only a deformed mask of itself Emptied Turning a bit we meet other enemies: the zombie nurse, the fireman with an ax and a masked man who does not look like a mutant. He's probably part of some government force sent to check on what happened in the city. From the first minutes of the game we get some interesting information: the setting is well done while some models of the monsters are really horrendous... yes, they frighten because of how ugly they are. We are referring above all to the zombie nurse, practically a model with a disfigured face, who borders on the ridiculous thanks to clothing more suitable for a brothel or a fashion show than a hospital. Going forward we verified that other enemies are also made just as badly, the yellow-eyed peasant women above all, of which you can find some screenshots in the game gallery. Fortunately, not all are like this and some let themselves be watched, but without ever reaching peaks of excellence. Let's say that it goes from the horrible to the passable, passing through the interesting. Among the best enemies we must certainly mention the zombies who fly using a kind of portable helicopter. New worlds On the other hand, the setting is pleasantly striking. The developers have evidently oriented towards the search for a coherence in the succession of levels, in order to make the scenario uniform, while traveling to different places (no fiery caves and snowy mountains, don't worry). The result is that You Are Empty in its linearity offers a great feeling of continuity, also thanks to the intelligent management of movements from one area to another, which never seem forced and are harmonized with some simple narrative tools (finding a car to the protagonist, put him in a trolley to enter a destroyed factory and so on). The preponderant element of the scenography is certainly communism: the architectures are inspired by the model of the industrial city of Stalin's Russia, and the icons of the regime are scattered everywhere: posters, flags, music everything contributes to creating that sense of profound decadence which pervades the game. In some places it seems to pass through an interrupted dream, the corpse of a drifting world whose outward appearance, which pretended to appear glorious, is now only a deformed mask of itself. What matters is to survive and understand. It is difficult not to get involved in a setting which, despite the not exactly avant-garde graphics engine, manages to produce beautiful views and a deeply dark and pessimistic atmosphere, as well as original compared to those we are used to. The weapons available to the protagonist are rather trivial, even if it is now difficult to find an FPS with original weapons. A wrench, a pistol, a shotgun, a nail gun, Molotov cocktails, a rifle, are the pieces that make up the arsenal at our disposal. Each weapon has its own peculiarities (it should still be specified that the shotgun is powerful at short distances but has few rounds in the barrel and is ineffective against distant enemies? Let's hope not, since it's like this since the first Doom) that the makes it more or less useful depending on the occasion. In any case, and with almost all weapons, a headshot kills enemies instantly, while targeting the body usually takes multiple shots to knock them down. Youth Unfortunately You Are Empty has its beautiful flaws. For example, a certain imbalance in difficulty, with some passages that are all too simple and with other really difficult ones that make you spit blood several times. Another problem, maybe iThe most serious, it essentially concerns the trivial gameplay. Perhaps this is not the case in which to expect something new, given the level of production, but by always doing the same things for years one begins to turn up one's nose even when one shouldn't. But perhaps it would have been enough to implement some of the latest generation FPS innovations to make the ~obsolescence~ effect less heavy. For example, there is a physics engine, but it has been exploited little and badly, it is needed just to blow up some objects in moments that seem scripted. The pace of the game is also rather slow, as well as lacking truly frenetic battles, above all due to the poor artificial intelligence of the enemies, who are unlikely to be able to chase us, putting us in difficulty. Often it is enough to climb a ladder to daze them and render them harmless. On the other hand, the soundtrack is positively striking, which boasts some excellent industrial songs by a Russian composer that, frankly, we did not know. If you are interested in getting a taste of the music, go to the game's official website, where one of the songs is available for free download. The beauty is that it's called Beat of the Communism. Ironic, right? System requirements Minimum Requirements: Not specified Test Configuration: Operating System: Windows XP Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Mysteriously the system requirements have not yet been specified. No slowdowns were recorded on the test system and the framerate fluctuated between 60 and 120 FPS with all the details set to maximum. Adjust accordingly. Comment You Are Empty is an old-fashioned FPS made interesting by the setting and solid gameplay for what has already been seen. Despite some poorly finished, not to say crude, details, it manages to involve and excite until the end. Probably a greater investment of resources by the manufacturer would have allowed Digital Spray to smooth out many of the defects found. Let's hope that their next game will make them emerge as happened to GSC thanks to S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. In the meantime, it would be good for us gamers to tune our antennas also to Eastern European developers, an area from which several positive surprises are coming in terms of play. Pros Excellent setting The graphics engine is very fluid in all situations Beautiful soundtrack Cons Some 3D models are unwatchable Nothing original Lacks refinement Game developers from the former Soviet Union can't seem to help but grapple with the fall of the communist regime. Already in S.T.A.L.K.E.R .: Shadow of Chernobyl we had the opportunity to face one of the fallen icons of what was once one of the two greatest world powers, but You Are Empty, also an FPS, is decidedly more explicit in bringing the Soviet communism and the impact its fall had on the population. GSC, produced by THQ, probably had to soften the more political contents of their work, which are in any case clearly visible to those who know how to observe, to avoid controversy and not be too alien to Western companies (especially the United States), which then represent the market bigger. The work of Digital Spray Studios instead, by virtue of lesser ambitions and an Eastern European producer (1C Company), enjoys greater freedom in representation and does not make too much mystery of the real theme that forms the backdrop to the protagonist's misadventures. We are still in full Soviet dictatorship, in 1950, in a Russian town whose name is not specified, where scientists are conducting an experiment to try to produce a race of perfect warriors, who can lead the Soviet to conquer the world. Obviously the experiment goes wrong and the quiet town becomes a lost place whose inhabitants are exterminated by the catastrophe's side effects (building collapse, explosions, contamination and other similar things). Unfortunately there are also survivors. Unfortunately it is due to the fact that they have become monstrous creatures and not very inclined to dialogue, but very skilled in tearing apart the living, especially humans. We get the clothes, dirty as well as very uncomfortable, of one of the few men who has not suffered mutant effects. Our task? Escape the city and find out what actually happened.", "date": "2007-06-21", "grade": null}
