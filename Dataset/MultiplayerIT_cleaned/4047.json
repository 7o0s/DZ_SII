We always stopped during our travels. He always said that they are all the same, always familiar, that it feels like home. But I don't feel at home at all.~ What you have just read is one of the many sentences from the first episode of Life is Strange 2 that has remained with us, because it is tremendously simple, and at the same time touching and profound: all adjectives that perfectly characterize the entire series. We lived the first adventures of Sean and Daniel, we were with them in the initial episode entitled Life is Strange 2: Episode 1 - Roads. In our review we will try to make you understand why, while not innovating anything and having several shortcomings, the second trip of the Dontnod guys has all the credentials to reconfirm itself, once again, as simply unmissable. And rest assured: there are no spoilers, I promise. The plot: it starts again in Seattle Life is Strange 2 tells the story of two brothers, Sean and Daniel, who, united against a series of events greater than themselves, try to hold each other up, endure the pain, and continue their lives. You also fell in love with Max and Chloe from Life is Strange, and then also with Rachel from Life is Strange: Before The Storm, right? Unfortunately, however, you will have to leave them all behind, precious memories of two unforgettable video games, because Life is Strange 2 begins years after the events of the previous series and far from Arcadia Bay, in Seattle. The boys of Dontnod could not choose more anonymous protagonists: a high school boy far from becoming an adult, and his nine-year-old brother who is always in the way of his feet. But the two love each other and live a quiet life in their city, until something happens, and from that moment on nothing can be as before. During their first adventures, Sean and Daniel will have to get by with the Road: the one with a capital S, the one Jack Kerouac talked about so much (have you read it ~On the Road~?), a path that even before being physical it is spiritual. The real journey takes place within the protagonists and in their relationships: don't turn up your nose, we are not being melodramatic, this is the philosophy behind Life is Strange 2, at least for the moment and at least for a good part of what we have seen; leaving it out you would miss half of what the game really wants to offer you. Once again, Dontnod knows which strings to touch, which points of our feelings hurt the most. Simply put: he knows what makes us human. It is for this reason that, although the previous series have dealt with the most disparate and profound themes of adolescence, Life is Strange 2 still manages to make sense. What else could you think of after the intensity of Max and Chloe, or Chloe and Rachel? Probably just what Sean and Daniel will be up against, and if any narrative drama can still work, it will hopefully be theirs. But don't think it's all roses and flowers: although the relationship between the brothers and the theme of the family still work great, Life is Strange 2 has to bear a huge boulder on its shoulders. This is represented by the first season and everything we have already tasted of the series: it is useless to pretend that the rest never existed, and it is very difficult to evaluate Life is Strange 2 without thinking about the past. Painful memories and what made us emotional are the hardest things to push away, and the ghosts of the old protagonists hover everywhere: a very quick reference to Arcadia Bay does not help, places that return to seem familiar to the attentive eyes of the players do not help. But there will be time for this: Sean and Daniel's true adventure has yet to blossom properly in the following chapters. Playstation 4 trophies The second season of Life is Strange 2 features a glittering Platinum Trophy on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro, but in order to unlock it, you will first have to wait for the release of the remaining four episodes. Each chapter has optional collectibles to collect, and for each of them there is a trophy: don't be afraid to miss them, it is possible to reload the individual game chapters once the specific episode is finished. I've seen this gameplay before We come to one of the biggest flaws of this first episode of Life is Strange 2, which for many of the players won't make any difference, but we can't ignore it: the gameplay. Life is Strange 2 - Roads is a narrative adventure in which, like the previous series, you will see the story of the characters on the screen, you will accompany them emotionally, you will listen to their speeches, and occasionally (not always) you will be called to intervene. In narrative adventures yeshe usually intervenes either by pressing the right button at the right time in certain situations, or by answering certain questions from the other characters with a series of optional phrases, and finally by exploring more or less vast game environments by examining the elements present. That's what the first Life is Strange did, that's what Life is Strange: Before The Storm did, as well as Captain Spirit. But be careful: all counted on an immediately recognizable element, which made the gameplay ~unique~ in a certain way. In Life is Strange Max rewound time, in Before the Storm Chloe often performed in his ~Insults Competitions~, in Captain Spirit we at least appreciated the attempt to simulate the protagonist's powers with the imagination of a child. In Life is Strange 2 there is nothing similar or even vaguely original. We continue to explore the environments, which seemed to us perhaps a little larger and more refined than the first seasons, and we continue to juggle a conversation by answering one of the sentences proposed by the narrators. Sean has to look after his younger brother, and from time to time the environmental interaction is enriched by a ~talk to Daniel~, ~show Daniel~, which they would like to enrich the gameplay, without actually succeeding. And that was it, no surprises, no new ideas. Perhaps we will see some in the next episodes, and if you play Life is Strange 2 - Roads you will also understand the reason for our suspicions by taking a look at the scene after the credits, but we will talk about that in the future. Good instead for the presence of ~narrative crossroads~ that have actually become ~ethical choices~, potentially able to influence the smallest of the protagonists: by observing the behavior of the older brother, Daniel could potentially develop a more or less aggressive character. This too will have to be analyzed well in the following episodes, but it is definitely a more appreciable way than the alleged choices capable of changing the narrative itself. Despite these shortcomings that can still be worked on in the future, Life is Strange 2 wins once again on the favorite playing field of the Dontnod boys: the accuracy in portraying the psychology of human beings, the references to pop culture and geeks, and the ability to know how to excite with seemingly insignificant little things. In short, if you enjoyed the first seasons, why should you miss Life is Strange 2?", "date": "2018-09-27", "grade": "8.0"}
