The long-awaited moment has arrived, Blizzard has pressed one of its magic buttons and, suddenly, at midnight on December 7, 2010, a new era has begun for World of Warcraft players. In truth, the real start was last November 24, when the 4.0.3a patch hit clients all over the world, permanently changing the game world through the Cataclysm narrative stratagem which is also the title of this expansion. A strategy, that of Blizzard, which is practically unprecedented in the now saturated online role-playing game market. World of Warcraft has been an integral part of gaming history since its debut in 2004 and, with six years and two expansions on its shoulders, it has literally seen everything and more. Sometimes considered stagnant in gameplay, but supported by a team of developers with volcanic ingenuity to say the least, World of Warcraft has managed to once again capture the attention of the media with a veritable rewrite of itself. The third expansion, officially announced during the 2009 BlizzCon, has been transformed before our eyes for months and between postponements, changes and previews, has arrived in our homes in a slightly different form than we had initially expected, but no less captivating and ambitious for this. The question at this point is: what else is there to tell? The Stories of Cataclysm There are actually quite a few stories to tell and from a narrative point of view Cataclysm is a real tribute to those who have been following Warcraft since its inception, from that 1994 Orcs & Humans that started the saga. Everything revolves around the return of Deathwing, a cataclysmic event that has triggered a series of ramifications for the entire planet Azeroth. In fact, the cataclysm did not only involve a geographical revolution, but it also undermined the delicate balance of power and the already tumultuous relations between the Horde and the Alliance and within the individual factions themselves. If in the past the minor incisiveness of the main storyline of each expansion has been criticized, this time it does not occur with Cataclysm: each quest and each NPC constantly reminds us of the gravity of the situation, the depth of the destruction caused by the catastrophe and the fundamental importance that any action, even the most insignificant, can have on the course of events. The quest cycles that cross each new area proposed by the expansion follow the now traditional Blizzard game-design, smoothly leading the player from a premise to a development to an epilogue in a crescendo of situations. Cataclysm is the sum of a multimedia universe which over the years has expanded like wildfire also through novels and comics; on the occasion of this real war on several fronts, Blizzard has rescued numerous characters who have played a more or less important role in the formation of the franchise, such as Malfurion Stormrage or the ogre Cho'gall. Virtually every quest in Cataclysm exudes epicness and importance, whether it's supplying ammo to stationed soldiers in Vash'jir or repelling the elemental invasion of Mount Hyjal: the player is encouraged to take part in the fight not only by the promise of rewards and experience points, but also and above all from the feeling of being part of a bigger and more important story, beautifully told through brilliant dialogues, unique narrative devices and an amazing orchestral soundtrack. The phasing system is almost abused in this expansion to create decidedly original and constantly evolving situations: the world changes before our eyes and because of our actions, increasing that feeling of immersion that is fundamental in this kind of adventure. Cataclysm doesn't need cinematic cutscenes to be told, just a little identification and a good knowledge of English are enough to appreciate the multiple plots that make this universe more alive and changing than many others. Collector's Edition As in the case of the previous expansions, Cataclysm is also sold in two editions: Standard and Collector's Edition (to which the unpublished version for digital download is added, for the record). The quality of the Collector's Edition definitely deserves a dedicated box. In reality, the type of content is exactly the same proposed in the corresponding editions of The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King. A large hard cardboard box with only the game logo in relief hides a padded container in which we will find, first of all, the software DVD and an extra DVD that offers a series of insights related to the development of the expansion, full of interviews , commentunedited airs and footage. The third disc, a CD in the typical square box, contains the Cataclysm soundtrack and various tracks integrated into the game already with the 4.0.3a patch for a total of seventeen tracks. The most valuable element of the package is certainly the book of illustrations, bound and completely in colour, which offers about 180 pages of artwork, drafts, sketches and unpublished images through which the evolution of the development of Cataclysm is shown. An additional gadget consists of the exclusive mousepad depicting Deathwing himself in close-up; for fans of the official card game, the Collector's Edition also offers a deck of 60 cards from the recent Wrathgate series, which includes two unpublished special cards depicting Worgen and Goblin. The package is completed by a virtual gift: by registering the copy of the Collector's Edition, each character linked to the account will receive an exclusive companion pet, Lil' Deathwing, by mail. If it is true that Blizzard certainly does not stand out for its originality with regard to the contents of its Collector's Editions, their quality is not discussed, starting with the materials used, and that of Cataclysm is definitely a precious and rare piece. Worgen and Goblins For new players, or veterans looking for new challenges and situations, thanks to World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, the doors of two new introductory zones open, linked to the same number of unpublished races that can be selected after installing the software: Worgen and Goblin. The last time such an addition occurred, things didn't go completely right: Blizzard itself declared itself unsatisfied with the integration of Draenei and Blood Elf into the Warcraft mythology with the expansion The Burning Crusade. But as far as Worgen and Goblins are concerned, that's quite another matter. The two new races, which start respectively from Gilneas and Kezan, already have a narrative construction of a certain thickness behind them and their annexations to the Alliance and Horde appear obvious and natural in the light of their past and the events caused by Cataclysm. Players are immersed in the history of these races through long cycles of quests which, through phasing and cutscenes, lead straight to new starting points, integrating players into the world of Azeroth in an organic and natural way, exactly as it happened with the cycle of quests initial of the Death Knights in Wrath of the Lich King, of which these are a perfect evolution. From a more practical point of view, the two new races are splendid: the ferocity of the Worgen conflicts with the royalty of the members of the Alliance, a contrast that is reflected in the annexation of the funny Goblins to the Horde, for which they mimic the madness and sympathy of the equally ingenious Gnomes. The new races have characteristic elements that differentiate them from the other ten selectable races, mostly in the form of racial skills or mounts (which in the case of the Worgen is actually a real four-legged race) but also in the care placed for the animations , decidedly superior to that of the pre-Cataclysm races, which therefore appear a little more antiquated also in terms of polygonal modeling, detail and texture. About 85 Obviously it wouldn't be a real expansion without a new level-cap and new areas to reach it. Breaking the tradition of the ten additional levels, the new level cap introduced by Cataclysm is 85: in reality, the new five levels should have originally been intertwined with a new growth system called Path of Titans, but then discarded in favor of more traditional mechanics , which reward the player with about three new skills or spells per class and additional Talent Points to place. The fact that there are only five new levels, however, should not suggest a smaller amount of content or a less intense experience: the new high-level areas are very vast and overflowing with quests; the variety of missions that we will be called upon to perform is decidedly over the top and the sophisticated design of most of the quests breaks the monotony of the typical recollection or elimination fetch-quests, present as usual but always well camouflaged. The new settings each enjoy precise narrative interweaving, linked above all to the return of the Destroyer and the invasion of the elementals, and the dimensions of each location are such as to accommodate multiple geographical variations, making each environment a carousel of situations, colors and atmospheres, always consistent and inspired. As usual, cinematographic, literary or videogame quotations are wasted, which always manage to elicit a smile thanks to the ability of the developers to place them in unique contexts and perfectlyconsistent. Technically, the work done is masterful: it is in these cases that World of Warcraft demonstrates how an amazing art-direction can compensate for its now outdated three-dimensional engine. Thanks to the refinement of the colors and a never banal 3D modeling, we find ourselves faced with breathtaking views and panoramas, whether they are the underwater temples of Vashj'ir or the wind-swept dunes of Uldum. Reaching 85 is a unique and compelling experience for everyone: the difficulty of the quests is calibrated to perfection, really suitable for all players, even those who prefer to play alone. For the others there are still dungeons and raids. Dungeons & Raids One of the predominant features in World of Warcraft returns forcefully in Cataclysm with a starter pack of instanced dungeons that are nothing short of superlative. The work done on this aspect of the Blizzard MMORPG has been truly commendable, able to make game fans agree on one of the most discussed and criticized aspects of recent years: the difficulty. Cataclysm goes into release with seven unpublished dungeons, to which are added the seven corresponding dungeons in Heroic mode and the Heroic versions of Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep. Having abandoned the too linear structure of The Burning Crusade, the design of the various dungeons is more reminiscent of that of Wrath of the Lich King: environments that are not particularly large but sufficiently intricate, in which a good dose of skill is required to defeat the various enemies and, above all, , the numerous bosses, each equipped, as per tradition, with particular skills that require specific offensive strategies. If normal dungeons may appear rather simple, the more daring players fear not: Blizzard has definitely listened to the criticisms of the low difficulty of the Heroic in Wrath of the Lich King, making those of Cataclysm much more than a simple variant, calibrating the challenge so which is more severe than the previous expansion but less frustrating than what happened in The Burning Crusade. The result is almost perfect: the Heroics require timing, precise crowd-control and good teamwork. Not surprisingly, Blizzard has also debunked the old motto ~epic for everyone~, which somewhat debased the idea of the rarest and most precious items: epic quality items are now the prerogative above all of 10 or 25 player raids. The three raids launched with Cataclysm present a natural evolution of the mechanics already conceived in Wrath of the Lich King, in which communication is everything, precision is fundamental and execution is what really matters. In short, Cataclysm's PvE endgame is configured as a further evolution of the World of Warcraft philosophy, which guarantees each player challenges and rewards of the right thickness. PvP Today World of Warcraft is not just a PvE game, especially since Arena-type PvP has become a sort of virtual sport with lots of prizes to be won. Furthermore, World of Warcraft PvP is far from flawless, subject to continuous modifications and changes also triggered by constant variations to the game system and the mathematics on which each skill or spell is based. It is therefore a bit premature to evaluate the evolution of PvP in Cataclysm since the real test bench, the Arena, will not be judged before a few weeks and it will be important to note the impact that the new statistic values, in particular the 'health-pool expanded, will have on player interaction. That said, Cataclysm also introduces three new PvP scenarios in the form of two new Battlegrounds and a contested region. In the first case, we are dealing with two variants of the old Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin: Twin Peaks and Battle for Gilneas, respectively, offering flag or resource conquest contests in which up to ten players per team compete, mixing some features of the predecessors in a quite original way. The two new Battlegrounds are decidedly fun and varied, embellished with truly inspired asymmetric maps, and allow lovers of quick games to break the monotony of the last few years of PvP with settings and tactics to learn completely from scratch. Tol Barad is instead the new Wintergrasp for high-level players: as in the case of the area added by Wrath of the Lich King, even in Tol Barad the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance will break out every two hours and in the following thirty minutes they will have to defend or capture some strategic points to maintain control over the territory. The winning faction will thus have access not only to a temporary raid boss, but also to a decent-sized quest-hub reminiscent of the Isle of Quel'danas introduced towards the end of The Burning Crusade. Tol Barad is way better than Wintergras", "date": "2010-12-07", "grade": "9.0"}
