The result was ICY, a 2D role-playing game aware of its limits that focuses entirely on its narrative side to involve the player. The first task we are called upon is the creation of the main character, the one who will lead a group of survivors in a very dangerous adventure in a world completely covered in snow and ice. All game events are described in screenshots like this one You have to spend the points available in the three main characteristics and skills, the latter related to combat, survival and social interactions. It only takes a few minutes of play to realize that these are not merely cosmetic choices, given that the resolution of each event is linked precisely to the skills. Thus a character with a developed gab will have more dialogue options, while with a high stealth value he will be able to open locks without suffering damage. So far we haven't described anything that the genre hasn't accustomed us to, but the setting of ICY is actually very peculiar compared to the rest of the RPGs on the market. Meanwhile there is no real action, but everything is described in a certain way. The narrative part has a very large space, with long descriptions of the events you run into and summary screens for fights and events. Let's take a typical case: we go into the woods to hunt (there is a special button to do it). The first thing you need to decide is how much time to dedicate to hunting: a swift and swinging hunt will consume less time, but will increase the risks, risks that will be decreased or canceled by a more cautious approach, which however will consume more time. Once the hunt has begun, various situations can therefore arise. For example, you may be attacked by a bear or some other wild animal. What to do? In our test we stopped them with a bow and arrow, having improved the relative skill in the character creation phase, but the choices proposed to get out of trouble are different. We have reviewed ICY, a small role-playing game with an exciting story developed in Italy A sea of ice Everything we have described is managed through static screens and buttons connected to the various actions. The fights themselves do not see the direct involvement of the player but are based on battle actions that can bring very different results depending on the characteristics of the party, the latter diversified depending on how the main story is tackled and the relationships that are established with various characters. The drawings that accompany the screens are very well done The only really active section is the exploratory one. The world of ICY is basically made up of a large map on which the party can roam freely in search of resources, be they tools, weapons or food, missions and places to visit. In this case the word ~map~ should be read literally, since in fact to explore you have to click on a static map and watch as the party placeholder moves, perhaps running into some special event such as blizzards or attacks of looters. Among the various places that can be visited there are also some cities where it is possible to obtain quests, summarized in the diary and to do business with the merchants, buying weapons, food and various tools. You soon realize that food is the most important resource to keep track of, because running out of it while exploring is tantamount to certain death, especially if you play on the higher difficulty levels. Ups and downs ICY is not a bad game. Indeed, taking into consideration only the narrative side, we would define it as very good, with its references to the survival genre and the re-reading of the planetary disaster theme in a completely different scenario from what has been seen elsewhere. There is a bit of Fallout, a bit of The Road (McCarthy's book), as well as dozens of other references, taken from various texts that are not necessarily video games. Exchange of goods in progress with a merchant Of course, don't expect Proust, but in general the story is not despicable and the evolution of events gives the right reasons to continue playing. We venture to say that even graphically ICY is not as bad as it seems, despite the map being very bare and there is nothing animated. To save it there are the beautiful designs of characters and scenarios which, although not miraculous, dictate a strong visual style that has its charm. However, other aspects take care of sinking the Inner Void game a (nice) bit.The first is paradoxically linked to the writing: the game is only in English, but in English evidently written by someone who is not a native speaker, because not only are there several spelling and grammar errors, but also the construction of certain sentences is, so to speak, foreign. Another problem of a completely different nature concerns the interface. We understand the lack of means, but using the same key that is used to select the destination also to scroll the map was not exactly a happy choice. Worse still, however, is the management of the party, practically non-existent from the point of view of the equipment. The only character who can be better armed and better protected is the main one, otherwise the found resources remain a dead thing in the inventory. The only possible interaction with others, apart from dialogues, is the treatment of wounds, which moreover reveals another problem with the interface: there are no visible references on the screen on the status of the party. For example, why not use the character portraits on the left to show their health status, instead of requiring that you have to open the specific screen each time? However at this point the picture should be clear enough, we just have to draw the conclusions in the commentary.", "date": "2015-08-19", "grade": "7.0"}
