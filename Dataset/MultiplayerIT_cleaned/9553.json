During the days of the Tokyo Game Show, we often saw the commercial created by Nintendo for the occasion on the subway, which recalls the atmosphere of the 80s with a boy who inserts the Super Mario Bros. cartridge into his Famicom, switches on a TV strictly cathode ray tube and with the remote control it tunes the video channel on which the console output is inserted. It was therefore only a matter of time, in this case a few months, for Super Mario All-Stars to arrive here too, a collection fundamentally identical to the one released for Super Nintendo almost twenty years ago, and which therefore contains Super Mario Bros. , Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, all with graphics redesigned to meet 16-bit console standards. In this re-edition for Wii, the games are accompanied by an interesting booklet and an audio CD whose characteristics we will shortly illustrate. In fact, we want to start right from the games, because never as in this case are we faced with a product that has little to do with the logic of the market, and which is aimed exclusively at two types of users: first of all, the ~fanboys~ Nintendo, those who for nothing in the world would miss the opportunity to celebrate the birthday of Super Mario Bros. in the most appropriate way, that is by holding the Wii-mote horizontally and preparing to relive those emotions that characterized the first contact for so many of them with the world of videogames; secondly, the ~old guard~ gamers, who don't necessarily dote on the ~big N~ and who, for one reason or another, have not been able to fully enjoy what is a series of extraordinary titles, still in able to involve and entertain thanks to a gameplay whose solidity has not been affected by time. Likewise, it is clear that those who already own the four Mario adventures (which are also present on the Virtual Console platform, and at lower prices) will find few valid reasons to buy them again. But let's go in order... Super Mario Bros. and The Lost Levels Super Mario Bros., first released in Japan in 1985 and arriving in Europe two years later, has for decades been a clear example of what talented developers (in this case Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka) are capable of with very limited technical means. Mario's sprite, in its original incarnation, was nothing but a handful of pixels of three different colors, equipped with a prominent nose and a big mustache for more practical reasons, namely the impossibility of giving him facial expressions due to the its small size and low resolution. The restyling operated by Nintendo for the release of Super Mario All-Stars on the SNES sees the design of the character enriched with details, especially in its ~grown~ version, starting to take on that ~chubby~ and ~rounded~ look that we know well and which, in the intentions of the Kyoto house, distances itself from the Japanese design style to approach the works of Walt Disney. In its structure, the game has not changed one iota, and offers us the usual eight worlds, each divided into four stages, which see Mario engaged in rescuing Princess Peach from the clutches of the terrible Bowser. Compared to the original version, an important save system has been added that allows us to resume the game from the last world instead of starting over, while otherwise the gameplay appears unchanged and even retains its old edges, such as the general unreliability of the jump when performed at the edge of a platform. The similarities with Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels are numerous, and in fact perhaps not everyone knows that it is the ~true~ sequel to Super Mario Bros., released in Japan in 1986 precisely with the title of ~Super Mario Bros. 2 but deemed by Nintendo too difficult and frustrating for the tastes of American and European audiences. The Lost Levels doesn't contain a turn-based multiplayer mode but allows us, at the beginning of the game, to choose our character between Mario and Luigi. A choice that is not an end in itself, as the two brothers, in this second episode, are endowed with different characteristics: Mario is the same as always, while Luigi is less quick but able to make more powerful jumps. The graphics are practically unchanged compared to Super Mario Bros. and while the degree of difficulty actually appears higher and can create headaches even for the most savvy players. It is perhaps for this reason that the save system, in this specific case, allows you to resume the game from the last stage reached and not from the last world. Super Mario Bros. 2 and Super Mario Bros. 3 The question arises: if Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels was actually the sequel to Super Mario Bros., where does what we have always known as Super Mario Bros. 2 come from? Also produced by Miyamoto, the game is an example of ~editing~ typical of the time, as it was originally titled ~Doki Doki Panic~ and saw us control a family of characters linked in some way to the Japanese network Fuji Television. This family was replaced in the western version of the product by the various Mario, Luigi, Toad and Peach, leaving the scenarios and a game structure intact that it was not difficult to perceive as profoundly different from the classic gameplay of Super Mario Bros. Constantly looking for keys to access the various sections, our heroes had to knock down their enemies by extracting plants from the ground and throwing them at them. Jumping on the opponents' heads had no effect, even if they were themselves ~liftable~ and usable as weapons. During the adaptation process, the developers endowed the four characters with very different abilities and inserted elements capable of recalling the classic Mario iconography (see the ~Pow~ block taken from Mario Bros.); expedients, which together with an unforgettable musical accompaniment, make this ~atypical~ episode of the series truly tasty and particular. The dynamic duo Miyamoto / Tezuka returns to have their say with Super Mario Bros. 3, released here in 1991. The differences in terms of gameplay appear clear compared to Super Mario Bros. and The Lost Levels: while not giving up certain concepts Basically, the third chapter of the series introduces very important elements that will be taken up again later and that still today constitute one of the trademarks of the franchise, such as the upgrades inspired by the world of animals, the anything but static connotation of the stages and finally the classic map that allows us to select the level we want to access (an idea still revived today with Super Mario Galaxy 2). Rich dish? On the quality of the titles, no one is going to argue. These are masterpieces that have defined not just a genre, but the entire world of video games, bringing millions of people closer to this type of entertainment and inspiring generations of game designers. Instead, what leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, and which determines the overall assessment of this Wii production, is the side dish and how it was packaged for the occasion. Assuming that all the games contained, even in their original versions for NES and not updated for SNES, are available for a handful of euros on the Virtual Console, it is evident that the triggering element for any purchase must be sought accordingly precisely in what this 25th birthday edition brings. Unfortunately, from this point of view, more could certainly have been done, and apart from a generous and sufficiently ~stylish~ cardboard packaging, what is added in addition to the disc containing the games is simply a 25-minute audio CD and an illustrated booklet on the history of the plumber. That's all. Both are patchy and incomplete, and therefore disappointing for any longtime Mario fan; the cd brings with it some of the most famous sound effects and songs but forgets others, with all due respect to those who hoped to find in it a musical compendium of the career of the Nintendo hero. The booklet is meager and really too synthetic, with some pleasant curiosities but nothing more; a reading of a handful of minutes in short, and stop. Gadgets that are really too narrow for those who make videogame fetishism a dogma of life, and which therefore make this celebratory package ultimately unsatisfactory. Finally, it should be noted that the version of Super Mario All-Stars chosen is the ~dry~ one, without the Super Mario World included in the richest edition. Mario certainly deserved something more.", "date": "2010-12-22", "grade": "6.5"}
