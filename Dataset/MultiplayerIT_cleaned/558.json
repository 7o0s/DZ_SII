{"name": "Wartales", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wartales-recensione.html", "text": "Often computer RPGs completely forget what it is to play RPG. In most cases there is a kind of underlying misunderstanding, whereby all that matters seems to be only the numbers of the characteristics of the characters, a misunderstanding which, it must be said, has also been cultivated by the gamers themselves. However, occasionally, albeit with many difficulties, some development studios try to put the concept of ~role~ back at the center of the experience, as for example happens in Kenshi, in his own way in Mount & Blade or in the unforgettable Darklands, which, as we will see in the Wartales review, it was one of Shiro Games' primary inspirations for its latest game, which has just come out of early access, at least on a philosophical level. Role play The world of Wartales is vast and must be explored on foot The idea behind Wartales is to give the player a system with which to develop his party as he wishes, giving him a series of characterizing choices to make, which shape not only the background of the characters, but also the way it is played. The first thing you notice is that there is no real story to follow: you choose the origin of the party (deserters? Farmers in search of fortune? Mercenaries?), the difficulty of the two main game systems, that is to say the combat and the survival one, the conformation of the challenge, with the game world that can be fixed or follow the growth of the party and we literally start the adventure. We therefore find ourselves in a remote place, with no other mission to accomplish than to make the band survive and prosper, perhaps making it grow in number and equipping it with more horses to transport the loot. It is up to the player where to go, who to talk to, who to recruit, what missions to take in villages (fixed, non-procedural generated), often how to carry them out, and how to manage the party's reputation. There are no constraints, even if, of course, the fact that our men have to travel and ask to be paid from time to time is a reason not to sit idly by but to continually look for sources of food and income, visiting villages or points of interest (farms, stables, outposts, abandoned towers and so on) to obtain information and missions. Note that areas where you can enter and talk to other characters are treated as fixed screens. Thus, for example, by visiting a blacksmith you will be able to bargain with the owner or interact with the anvil to create objects, while entering a tavern you will find mercenaries to recruit, a bulletin board with missions to take or shady figures who have tasks often not quite clean to offer us. By interacting with the merchants you will be able to buy their wares or, if you have a thief in the group, try to steal them and, as you rise in fame, you will access more important missions, assigned by prominent characters, with also important encounters when you visit the largest cities. Quests can also be obtained by visiting the various interactive places visible on the map and talking to the locals about their problems. For example, it may happen that we are asked to escort someone, or to recover stolen goods, or even to kill some particularly heinous criminal against a certain community. In general, there are so many things to do and depending on how they are done, they can push the whole party in a certain direction, making them acquire more or less prestige in certain environments (prestige points can be spent to resolve certain situations or to obtain missions). In the wide world Talking to people yields quests and information, as well as items Wartales takes place for the most part on a single, large map viewed from above, divided into regions, on which you move by clicking with the mouse. After some time walking through dirt roads, forests, more or less other mountains, ruins, cities and so on, we will have to rest our men, creating a camp and giving them food to recover energy and not lose morale. The amount of food needed to feed them varies depending on the difficulty level selected and some characteristics on which the skill points earned can be spent, but in general it is always advisable to have a good supply of food in the inventory, if you don't want to have defections due to dissatisfaction. The same is true of gold: having no money to pay those who end up working as mercenaries can be more dangerous than the enemies themselves. The latter are mostly humans and wild animals. The world of Wartales is decidedly gritty The world of Wartales is deciterribly realistic in that sense, so don't expect to run after dragons or wereferrets. On the other hand you will face many groups of humans, whether they are bandits or police forces. A lot depends on how you run the campaign. For example, if you decide to follow the path of crime, assaulting and robbing the caravans that pass between one village and another, it is inevitable that you will get a bad reputation and attract the attention of armed vigilantes, who will try to kill us at the first opportunity available. Mobility also follows the same principle: the map is open and you can go almost anywhere, but it is not possible to go around some natural obstacles, there is no fast travel and, in general, you have to develop your party to move faster. Despite this, the game provides systems to shorten some routes. For example, to descend the mountains more quickly, ropes can be lowered by hooking them to the rock, so as not to have to go all the way backwards. The combat system The combat system is turn-based The combat system itself is turn-based and is quite classic, with troops acting on initiative, albeit with some unique elements. So at the start of the battle, units are deployed on the battlefield, choosing positions based on preferred tactics. Incidentally, it is possible to concentrate the units in one area, giving them more attack strength, but leaving more room for the enemies to manoeuvre, or they can be scattered in such a way as to better absorb the number of opponents, but at the price of increasing the risks for the individual mercenary. Consider that at the beginning of the game the clashes are mainly between small groups, but that as the hours go by we often tend to end up on battlefields in which many units are involved, even belonging to multiple factions. In some cases it is also necessary to defend specific units, which must not die for any reason, under penalty of immediate defeat. In Wartales you can end up fighting anywhere In any case, once the fight has begun, victory is achieved not only by killing the enemies (which is the main activity anyway), but also by managing the morale of the party: losing too many men generates panic, worsening everyone's performance and leading to an escape out of control of the more sensitive members. The same happens to opponents who, when they decide to run away, can be let go, or they can be finished. It should be noted that these choices also affect the fame of the party and some general characteristics related to certain actions, which allow you to unlock unique traits. The combat itself is a comparison of the abilities of the various groups, with the available attack or defense options varying according to the class of our men and their equipment. For example, a character with a sword and shield will be able to use a cover ability from enemy blows, to reduce any damage, while one wielding a war hammer will be able to hit an area more than a single enemy. Technically Wartales isn't great, but it does its job Consider that Wartales also includes friendly fire, which becomes part of party management not only because it damages the characters, but also because it changes their relationships. Thus, just to propose a case, an archer who aims wrong and hits a partner, not considering the trajectory in the attack phase, could create some bad mood (arrows in the knees don't please anyone, especially friendly ones), as well as a brute who struck blindly with his two-handed weapon without considering the target too much. In this sense, the title of Shiro Games remains consistent and links every single system to the micro management of the party, that is, it provides direct and very clear consequences for each action performed by the player, in order to make the entire gameplay more interesting and profound. Character growth Growing in fame you also meet important personalities All of this is reflected in a very articulated growth of the characters, based on their characteristics, their class and their profession, as well as on the way they interact as a group, which creates small narrative moments during the rest phases, with the different members who express their views on some general topics and on their behavior in the field. So the player must not only assign the points obtained by each individual member of the party, increasing their characteristics and choosing combat-related skills, which vary according to the class, but must also give guidelines to the mercenaries, spending points for some collective characteristics, linked to the modus operandi of the group and to theyou take up trades. For example, in a party with a blacksmith, the number of objects that can be created in the forges can be increased (the raw materials must be bought or found, legally or illegally), while if there is a cook in the group, the cookable recipes (cooked food is more nutritious than raw food). If you wish, you can also choose to have a party of cannibals, making the corpses of your opponents excellent raw materials (for the series that nothing is thrown away). Some problems In Wartales it is often back and forth In general Wartales works very well and can be a really immersive experience, but not without its problems. The most noticeable, especially at the beginning, is having to do a little too much back and forth between discovered locations to get rewards and buy resources. Considering the speed with which our men get tired, in some cases we can end up creating loops in which they carry out missions only for the basic sustenance of the group, therefore to buy food, repair equipment and things like that, without perceiving no real progression, which isn't exactly pleasant. It must also be said that the game world turns out to be a bit too generic, with some situations that are only sketchy but which would have deserved more insights, perhaps with a nuanced but more articulated narrative campaign, in such a way as to give more presence to some themes . Let us think, for example, of the power relations in the various territories or of the question of refugees with related problems of public order. Even some stories related to certain missions would have deserved more attention. After all, Shiro Games' goal has always been to create a game system that is as open as possible in which the player, despite the presence of fixed elements, could lead his adventures as he pleases. In this sense it cannot be said that Wartales is not a successful title.", "date": "2023-04-18", "grade": "8.0"}
