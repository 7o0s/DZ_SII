{"name": "ABZ per Nintendo Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/abzu-nintendo-switch-recensione.html", "text": "Originally released in August 2016 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, ABZ was not exactly what can be defined as a blockbuster, but it has been able to win the favor of critics and a large niche of users thanks to a approach to the medium very similar to a cult title like Journey. And in fact, precisely to the work Thatgamecompany ABZ could almost be defined as a spiritual sequel, not only because it can count among the credits the names of Matt Nava and Austin Wintory (respectively art director and composer of both products) but above all because it is practically played the same way, even if placed in a scenario literally at the antipodes. If therefore in Journey it was necessary to lead a protagonist of whom absolutely nothing was known on his pilgrimage through a desert, in ABZ the player's task is to accompany an equally mysterious character among the depths of the oceans, discovering together with him the reasons for that journey . Having made this necessary introduction, however, we refer you to our review of two years ago to learn more about the characteristics of the work, while here we will focus mainly on the various aspects of the conversion for Nintendo Switch. Graphics and sound The declared goal of Giant Squid was to bring ABZ to the Nintendo hybrid console without leaving anything by the way in terms of graphics: an apparently easy goal (the game is not a monster of polygons), but which actually brought more of some headache to the developers. The ~fault~ is mainly to be found in the rich ecosystem of flora and fauna that populates the ocean where the adventure takes place, which includes a hundred different species of fish and many marine plants, all reproduced trying to maintain a certain likelihood with the real-life counterparts despite the game's far from naturalistic look. This, combined with the computational load reserved for the physical routines and visual effects that define the volumetric densities of the seabed, has evidently put the Nintendo Switch hardware to a serious test, to the point of bringing ABZ to run at 30 fps subject to frequent drops: nothing that seriously compromises the enjoyment of the experience, but which certainly puts it a step below that offered by more performing machines. Another price to pay is, inevitably, that of the resolution, fixed at 540p in portability and 720p in docked mode, with the latter which in particular makes the gap with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions more evident. Fortunately, the artistic direction of ABZ is so refined as to overshadow purely technical issues: even on Nintendo Switch the title is an authentic feast for the eyes, both when you move gracefully between the depths of the sea, and when you simply stop to observe the teeming activity of the living beings you meet along the way. All punctuated and enriched by the extraordinary orchestral soundtrack by Austin Wintory, beautiful as always but in this case slightly penalized by perhaps excessive audio compression which leads to a few too many scratches. Commands and contents The ABZ control system has always been oriented towards simplicity, making use only of the analog sticks to move the protagonist and shot and of four keys to manage respectively acceleration, sprint, pirouette (only useful for choreographic purposes) and interaction. A scheme that is well suited to all possible configurations of the Nintendo Switch controllers, and whether you play in portable mode, with the Joy-Con divided or joined using the appropriate handle, the result is still satisfactory: if you want to look for the fur in the new it can be said that the right dorsal trigger responsible for making the protagonist swim is not very comfortable to hold down continuously as required by the game, but that is a structural problem of the peripheral rather than a demerit of the software. Despite the two years that have passed since the original release, ABZ on Nintendo Switch does not enjoy any additional content: a choice also consistent with what can be defined more as a sensory experience than a video game in the classic sense of the term, but which nonetheless leaves a a little bitterness in the mouth considering that the game is offered at 19.99 Euros, the exact same price as the original release. In short, no increase to a longevity that has often been indicated as the greatest limitation of ABZ: even on Nintendo Switch the adventure is completed easily in two hours, with the aggravating circumstance of the absence of objectives or trophies that could in somehow invite the user to dive back into the seaAnd.", "date": "2018-12-04", "grade": "8.5"}
