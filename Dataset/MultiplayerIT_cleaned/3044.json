{"name": "Blade of God: Vargr Souls", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blade-of-god-vargr-souls-recensione.html", "text": "The Blade of God: Vargr Souls review comes at the end of a long period of development for the title created by the Chinese team PG Souls Games, which has made its appearance in various events in recent years, always receiving praise and important awards. the reasons for this success immediately become clear: behind the narrative contaminations of a plot inspired by Norse mythology, which tells of a clash between gods that threatens to destroy the world, there is a very ambitious hack & slash, strongly inspired by classics such as God of War and Devil May Cry. In the game we take on the role of Chaos, a warrior who intervenes in the divine battle to restore, uh, order but is initially defeated and has to start his journey all over again, in the context of a campaign made up of six increasingly complex chapters The download of the game can be done for free and allows you to complete the first stages, after which the complete experience can be unlocked with a minimum in-app purchase of 4.49 euros: an approach that we believe is certainly right and which gives you the opportunity to try the title well before deciding whether or not to invest your money. Gameplay Without a doubt, the term ~derivative~ fits the gameplay of Blade of God: Vargr Souls very well, given that the mechanics that the game brings into play are far from original and in fact represent an attempt to demonstrate that even on mobile devices it is It is possible to offer a thick, frenetic and spectacular action experience like the titles to which this production is so clearly inspired. The controller is unfortunately not supported, but there is a reason behind this choice: the developers have balanced all the elements precisely on the basis of the touch commands, also inserting some assistance and automatic lock to make the fights easier, however together with a large number of virtual buttons which are sometimes a bit confusing. A necessary sacrifice to make the protagonist's repertoire more varied, who in fact from the very beginning can count on basic shots but also and above all on a series of special maneuvers with relative cooldown times. By upgrading them and unlocking new ones during the campaign, we will be able to achieve truly surprising results, invading the screen with deadly trails, gigantic astral projections and so on. As a good action RPG, Blade of God: Vargr Souls punctually represents the hit points that we subtract with each slash, emphasizing the use of Bayonetta-style dodging: by executing it with perfect timing we will be able to obtain an opening that will allow us to inflict even more damage on the opponent on duty, whether it is low-ranking enemies or big bosses that close every single stage, and that they must be ~studied~ a minimum in order to react to their attack routines. The feeling is surprisingly good if we consider the touch controls and the great frenzy of some sequences, complete with quick time events when it comes to closing the fights and literally tearing the opponents to pieces, but the automatic camera occasionally takes a few goof and makes it difficult to follow the action decently, with all the consequences. your inventory in order to equip the most effective weapons and armor. Here there is obviously no shortage of microtransactions to speed up progression, but you can easily do without them. Technical realization Certain things are expected from an ambitious project like Blade of God: Vargr Souls, especially in terms of artistic direction, and from this point of view the developers have not disappointed; although the game is still afflicted by a certain amount of glitches, also and above all graphics, between interpenetrations and black bars that don't end up where they should, revealing an unpleasant ~behind the scenes~ that indicates poor optimization carried out on tablets. The amount of assets and animations put in place is however surprising and undoubtedly represents the strong point of the game, as well as the main reason why we feel we have great respect for the project, which starting from probably modest budgets tries to bring to iOS and Android an experience close to that which can be enjoyed on consoles. However, everything has a price, and obviously we are not referring to the 4.49 euros needed to unlock the full version of the game, which in our opinion is more than deserved considering the work behind it. No, it's a purely technical question: for some reason the polygonal models look likerendered at lower resolutions than the real thing, and this contributes to creating a dirty and rough feeling that unfortunately never leaves us during the campaign. A real shame, because with a proper polishing job Blade of God: Vargr Souls could really make that qualitative leap that would allow it to stand out without a doubt among the action RPGs currently available on the App Store and Google Play Store. Who knows, maybe future updates of the application will bring it closer to our idea of a real premium product.", "date": "2020-06-11", "grade": "7.8"}
