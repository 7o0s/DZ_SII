{"name": "Legacy of Kain: Defiance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/legacy-of-kain-defiance_a.html", "text": "Vampire barrel In Legacy of Kain: Defiance it will therefore be possible to impersonate both Raziel and Kain, through 15 chapters that will alternate the player in command of the two protagonists, until the inevitable encounter-clash is reached. In both cases, the game will be a third-person action/adventure, but the way you approach the levels will be slightly different. The missions that will see Kain as the protagonist will in fact be based more on action and combat, while the exploratory part will be limited to the discovery of some keys or enhancement tomes for the sword, necessary for example for opening certain doors. The combat system has undergone considerable care in its implementation: during the course of the adventure it will in fact be possible to learn new moves and combos, dynamically expanding the set of moves available. Kain will also have powers deriving from telekinesis, which will allow him to throw enemies from a distance, perhaps making them fall off a cliff or stick into nearby spikes, or activate particular gears. The energy bar is equivalent, as in the previous Blood Omen, to the bloodlust of the protagonist, who in order to always remain at full strength will have to suck the lifeblood of the humans he will kill in his path. But that's not all, even the sword can be fed on the blood of the opponents, and when it is fully charged, it can provide the main protagonist with a devastating move capable of annihilating all enemies in his vicinity. At Raziel's command, the needle of the balance will instead be oriented mainly towards solving puzzles, without however giving up frenetic fights. Taking advantage of the possibility of passing in an (almost) painless way between the real and the spectral world, Raziel will be able to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles, thanks also to the fact that going from one world to another the shape of some buildings will change, perhaps unlocking new passages. The moves available are largely similar to those in Kain's possession, but differ for example in the use of the Soul Reaver (the reaper of souls), which thanks to the elemental powers that will be instilled during the course of the game, will be indispensable for the resolution of some puzzles, which with Kain are usually solved thanks to the use of telekinesis. A further difference lies in Raziel's nourishment methods, which in order to survive will feed on the souls of unfortunate opponents. The Techniques The settings and style chosen by the developer contribute to making Defiance a very fascinating title from a graphic point of view, thanks also to an excellent use of textures, to the meticulous reconstruction of buildings of clear gothic and dark inspiration and in general thanks to a generous graphic engine, certainly among the best appeared on Playstation 2. Excluding the unfortunately not excellent graphic cleaning, the title boasts excellent polygonal models for the main protagonists, well-made particle effects (remarkable the realization of the spectral world of Raziel) and an always high, which however sometimes stumbles upon rather strange slowdowns, even in a situation where there is no enemy on the screen. The most serious defect instead lies in the camera, which although behaving normally in a good part of the occasions, sometimes leaves the player in a perspective that is difficult to manage in the platform sections, or to fight in points obstructed by close-up details, without the use of the transparency effect which has now become the rule in games of this kind. Turning to the sound side, we cannot fail to point out the goodness of the Italian translation, both as regards the texts and the dubbing, which perhaps lacks in a certain repetitiveness for the characters of secondary importance. The music dynamically adapts to the game situations and in general contributes to making the atmosphere that permeates the last chapter of the Kain saga fascinating. As already mentioned in the introduction phase, Crystal Dynamic has finally decided to reveal most of the secrets surrounding the two main protagonists, and we can undoubtedly say that the narrative plot is one of the cornerstones of this Defiance: well developed, with several original ideas and generally interesting. The game system bases its strength on the combat phase, with attention to every detail, and on the varied and frenetic action, thanks to the numerous moves available for the two protagonists. However, the game lacks a certain basic linearity and a not too high level of challenge, difeclearly visible tti that are fortunately mitigated (although not completely) by the plot and the game system. Comment Defiance turns out to be one of the best chapters of the Legacy of Kain saga, certainly the best from a narrative and (probably) artistic point of view. A varied and fun combat system, the possibility of facing two different styles of play and a good longevity seal an absolutely unmissable title for fans of the saga and recommended for action/adventure lovers. Better management of the camera and less linearity could indeed have made the title reach even higher peaks, worthy of the best exponents of the genre. Pros: Remarkable technical realization Varied and fun combat system Very well developed plot Cons: Inadequate camera management in certain situations Not very high challenge Vampires and the gothic settings that often characterize them have always aroused a certain fascination in various fields, starting from literature, up to video games. Defiance is the fifth chapter of a saga, Legacy of Kain, inspired precisely by vampires, which saw the light back in 1996 on Playstation with Blood Omen, an adventure with a bird's eye view excellently made which saw Kain as the protagonist, brutally killed by some thieves and subsequently transformed into a vampire, ready to swear revenge. Subsequently Crystal Dynamic decided to split the saga into two sections, thus creating two chapters of Soul Reaver, a third-person adventure centered on the figure of Raziel, a vampire transformed into a ghost following his insubordination to Kain himself, who in the meantime became king of the kingdom of Nosgoth. These two chapters could boast an excellent technical sector and a good game system, but a plot that often left too many questions, up to an only sketchy ending. Almost simultaneously with the second Soul Reaver Blood Omen 2 was released, which resumed the events of Kain but which unfortunately could not boast of the same quality as its younger brother, both from a technical point of view and from a purely playful one. With Defiance, the American software house has finally decided to bring together the events of the two charismatic antagonists in a single chapter and to answer most of the questions raised in the previous episodes, to the great joy of the fans of the series and the new followers, who will not have big difficulty enjoying this title, thanks to a narrative development full of explanations and references to past events.", "date": "2004-02-06", "grade": null}
