{"name": "Nidhogg", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/127498-nidhogg-asso-di-spade.html", "text": "In development for four years and around for some time now, Nidhogg is a small and desired multiplayer arcade that has long remained a privilege for a lucky few. The only way to be able to appreciate it was in fact to go to some international event, or alternatively to one of the rare Winnitrons scattered around the world. Mark Essen's game was so solid and promising that it had collected various prizes and awards since 2010, but the young professor at the University of Southern California preferred to take the time necessary to achieve two different objectives: on the one hand, insert enough content to make Nidhogg a complete and ~salable~ game; on the other, polishing the code, perfecting the gameplay and consulting various pro-gamers in order to make it a competitive title in all respects. However, the fact that the goal has only been partially reached is not enough to undermine what is already one of the most interesting multiplayer titles of this beginning of the year. Watch out, bastard! As often happens, Nidhogg is a game that works perfectly because it starts from an extremely basic idea. Two swordsmen face each other in a guard position, and the aim is to be able to overcome the opponent to reach the last room behind him. To do this, however, it is necessary to kill the rival and obtain a sort of green light, represented by the flashing arrow typical of scrolling beat'em ups. Once the arrow is obtained, the player will have a few seconds to run to the other end of the level before his opponent recovers and tries to stop him. What is created is a frenzied back-and-forth halfway between tug-of-war and the classic capture of the flag, in which there is no downtime and the two players' curses accompany the incessant daggers of their respective avatars. Avoiding making everything too complicated, Essen has however included various skills and techniques capable of making each fight more lively and unpredictable: for example, the player can change the height of his guard to protect himself or displace the opponent; or he can disarm him, roll on the ground, kick him in the air, climb walls or tear his spine out after knocking him down. It is also possible to throw the sword from afar, but with the risk of missing the target and being unarmed. Put it all together and the result is an intense game, where you only need to hesitate for a moment or make a rash move to be skewered like a skewer. One moment you are jumping, running and doing somersaults like hell, while the next you are studying yourself, almost motionless, passing from one guard position to another and trying to anticipate the opponent's lunge. Imagine Bushido Blade, but faster and above all more essential. And this is precisely Nidhogg's greatest merit: Essen's game starts from a single, lucky idea and never goes away, does not add diversions out of context or try to dirty it with superfluous gameplay mechanics. Instead, let the players themselves create memorable matches. When you knock out the opponent and you start running towards the goal, you feel charged like a spring, invincible like Mario after having collected a star. Not to mention the satisfaction you feel, after being unarmed, dodging a lunge, catching your weapon with a somersault and, with a precise shot, sending the other player into pixel hell. Nidhogg is Bushido Blade, but faster and above all more essential The art of the sword Always without overdoing it, the four levels available try to further stimulate matches full of bizarreness. Any examples? In one of these you can crouch to hide behind tall grass, in another there are doors and conveyor belts that slow down your escape, or narrow tunnels, in which it is not possible to jump or throw the sword, and finally windows and platforms that create alternative routes. Too bad for the unfortunate color choices of the level in the clouds, which not only make it difficult to see the two characters but, in the long run, are also rather annoying to the eyes. It is a stain of dirt in a game which, despite the intentionally rough style, has all the personality and freshness that the author of Flywrench and Punishment has always maintained in his titles. Nidhogg reaches its highest peak when played against a friend sitting next to it, possibly with the pad, even better with an arcade stick. The single player component, among the main innovations compared to the Winnitron version, simply does not give the same emotions: instead of proposing a campaign or a simple story, it is limited to a sequence of matches against opponentsi all the same, characterized by a decent artificial intelligence but in different situations also quite predictable. In short, it's a bit like playing a party game alone: you can do it, but you end up losing much of the fun. The most anticipated option is undoubtedly online multiplayer, and unfortunately Mike Essen's game slips on a netcode that needs to be reviewed. At least at the time of writing, inviting a friend to play is almost always impossible, while in the rare event that matchmaking is able to connect you with a user, you have to cross your fingers and hope you don't have lag problems. Among other extras there is a tournament option, in which up to eight players can challenge each other in different offline matches, or a list of variables that add a little spice to the clashes, perhaps by reducing gravity, increasing speed or making so that swords return dangerously like boomerangs when thrown.", "date": "2014-01-16", "grade": "9.0"}
