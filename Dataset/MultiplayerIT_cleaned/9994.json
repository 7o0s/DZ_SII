It is natural to sympathize with such an ambitious project on paper, carried out by an independent team of Spanish developers who certainly could not count on the same budget that characterized the creation of Gears of War. We are therefore faced with a product that is in many ways courageous, therefore, which does not mind clearly copying a certain type of gameplay (albeit with all the limitations of the case) and even suggesting some interesting strategic elements. The protagonists of the game, i.e. the four mercenaries who form the Echo Squad, each have armor that uses Ambrosia energy to give them special abilities: the leader of the group, for example, can activate a shield capable of stopping enemy projectiles or a shockwave that knocks out opponents in close proximity. A power that turns out to be almost useless in the single player campaign, given that with the shield activated you cannot attack or move freely, but which in cooperative multiplayer takes on very different connotations and is an ideal maneuver when you find yourself in a situation uncomfortable and the team needs to find shelter quickly. Speaking of multiplayer, the offer of the Tragnarion Studios product also from this point of view appears anything but innovative, with modes already seen a bit everywhere that have the only novelty being the ability to use AI-controlled characters in case there are not enough players to start the game. Artificial stupidity? It is precisely the AI that represents the biggest limitation of The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2, both as regards the behavior of the enemies and, above all, that of the ~colleagues~. The vital energy of our alter ego is managed as in Gears of War, so if you expose yourself to enemy fire for too long, you fall into a state of infirmity that can only be remedied by another member of the team. Well, the behavior of the characters in these situations somewhat reflects the general quality of the AI: one of them systematically comes to our rescue, regardless of the presence of opponents a few centimeters away, and it is not uncommon for this behavior to lead to game over when all our friends are knocked down. In the same way, on more than one occasion we can see our companions throw themselves headlong into locations literally crammed with enemies, to collapse one by one and thus also mark our fate, given that it will be impossible for us to put them back in sixth without exposing ourselves to attack. A solution to the problem comes from the interesting strategic element present in the game, in this case we can order group members to advance or stop, reach a particular point on the map and attack a specific target. Giving orders during the most hectic phases is not easy, but at least it gives us a few more chances to survive. Not that our opponents' AI is in better shape, on the contrary: the attack and movement patterns appear extremely simple, there is some attempt at variation during stalking (with enemies crouching behind cover and sometimes moving for not lean right where we are waiting for them) but the ~perception of the other~ is frankly mediocre and it happens that you find yourself a few centimeters away from a soldier of the Nogari Corporation who does not notice our presence in the slightest, perhaps busy observing the movements of the others. Same story, same place, same bar As already mentioned, the gameplay of The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2 clearly refers to that of Gears of War. The characters have two ~slots~ for weapons and one for grenades, aim, shoot and stand in exactly the same way. When they are in position they can also shoot ~blindly~ without leaning out, just like in the Epic Games masterpiece, and overcome obstacles by performing an extremely similar movement. In short, GOW fans will find in this product many of the elements they already know and appreciate, but sometimes implemented a little haphazardly and without the necessary optimization. There are eleven different weapons and they all have their own value, which is very important, but the developers have not been able to make the most of the sensation of impact that is absolutely necessary in this kind of title: you open fire and the sound effect manages to plausibly support the action, but it almost seems like theour volleys do not hit because the opponents do not accuse the damage as they should. Comparing the disruptive effect of Gears of War's shotgun with that of The Scourge Project smacks of blasphemy, but the feeling affects all weapons a bit. So the ambush and aiming system has been well copied, even with the shelters that are damaged under enemy fire, but we got a little lost in the best part and the final result inevitably suffers. The most absurd situation occurs on the occasion of physical attacks, truly horrible in terms of visual rendering, with the enemy who doesn't flinch. The similarities with GOW extend to the technical sector, given that the Unreal Engine was used in this case too, but the differences in terms of design and global quality are sometimes abysmal: the characters of The Scourge Project have very little personality and possess an aspect that goes from the anonymous (the commander, the woman) to the abused (the ~ninja~, the big guy), with polygonal models that pay duty for faces and hair but return a good result as regards the armor, which at first glance they seem inspired by that of the protagonist of Crysis, with the various ~muscle bundles~ in sight. The animation moves between highs and lows: the walk, aim and attack are good, the run is unwatchable. The game starts in a really mediocre scenario, a forest where the only thing that can be saved are the puddles; then fortunately it moves to internal settings that may not be spectacular but at least discreet, in which it is generally necessary to obtain keys and open doors to continue. We tested the game at a resolution of 1680 x 1050 pixels, with all effects maxed out and v-sync engaged, resulting in somewhere between forty and sixty frames per second.", "date": "2010-05-25", "grade": "6.5"}
