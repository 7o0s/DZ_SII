In contrast with other works, however, ZiGGURAT does not waste time talking and immediately gets to the point: alien robots have conquered the Earth and you are the last survivors, on the top of a pyramid armed with a laser rifle. Put your soul in peace. You are already doomed, and the only thing left to do at this point is to delay your defeat by trying to bring as much alien scum with you as possible. Presenting what is undoubtedly one of the most successful action games on mobile devices is Action Button Entertainment, a small team led by Tim Rogers, industry journalist, somewhat hipster blogger and, judging by his latest work very talented designer. A strenuous resistance Like Jet Li in the final minutes of a regrettable The One, ZiGGURAT sees the user atop a pyramid intent on fending off the onslaught of aliens coming from every direction. It is all too easy to trivialize the game after a quick glance: placed in the center of the screen, the blonde protagonist has to do nothing but shoot left or right trying to hit the increasingly numerous robots; no power-ups or experience to accumulate, while a single level of play continues indefinitely until inevitable death. Note how much the formula brings to mind the excellent Canabalt, but above all how much the similarities between ZiGGURAT and Adam Atomic's running game go beyond the simple lack of content or the frequency with which one dies. A few games are more than enough to realize and appreciate the numerous attentions and small various ideas that make the Action Button game absolutely unique. For example, we found the mechanics on which the player's attacks are based simple but ingenious: by holding down a key on the screen it is possible to charge a devastating blow, but once the maximum power is reached it will begin to regress again making the attack much less effective . If to this is added the possibility of creating ripple effects by hitting enemies at the right time, an unexpected alchemy is formed whereby the player stops firing shots as quickly as possible and begins to have a much more strategic and weighted. It is no longer a continuous alternation of shots and reloads, but a matter of waiting and synchronizing your attack with perfect timing with the movements of your opponents, while when the screen fills up and things go badly you are forced to make a further change of strategy: too many enemies and the short time between one attack and another force not to charge all the way down, but to launch weaker and faster parabolic shots, although in extremis one's rifle can be used as a shield to defend against enemies too close or incoming bullets. In addition to the design choices listed so far, the variety of aliens, not numerous but extremely characterized in behavior, makes ZiGGURAT an extremely deep and strategic experience. Some of them just approach hopping, others, more difficult to hit, crawl on the pyramid preparing an ambush, still others defend themselves in a plasma bubble, where gigantic robots can act as dark and require multiple hits to be shot down. The charm of the challenge offered by the game is based precisely on the prioritization of one's attacks, on better managing the pile of opponents by making one decision rather than another, aware that an empty attack or a wrong move can cost those precious moments useful to escape from a very uncomfortable situation. Another very characteristic element of ZiGGURAT is represented by the controls and by the two different systems that can be selected from the options: if the first, optional and inspired by the Angry Birds slingshot, proves to be uncomfortable and not very suitable for managing the most crowded moments, the second proves to be absolutely perfect after just a few minutes of practice, allowing you to adjust the parabola of the projectile simply by swiping a finger across the bottom of the screen. It's really hard to find obvious flaws in the game, and indeed the negative surprise is more the absence of a button to pause a game rather than a pixel art without infamy or praise. However, what could represent the real bone of contention is, as anticipated, the total lack of progression and content to unlock: with the exception of the objectives on Game Center, ZiGGURAT focuses only and only on balancing and on the pleasure of facing a single partita for the purpose of improving itself, without needing to disguise an anonymous design with a series of secondary extras. This aspect may or may not like it depending on the needs of the player, but the fact is that, while countless games are filled like a pinata in order to create a sort of addiction to unlockables, the Action Button Entertainment title manages to keep you glued for the simple fact of being funny.", "date": "2012-03-07", "grade": "9.0"}
