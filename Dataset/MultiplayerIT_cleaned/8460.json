{"name": "Un pesce di nome Yello", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/105313-chasing-yello-un-pesce-di-nome-yello.html", "text": "The theme of ~fishy~ freedom and above all of protection from dangerous and capricious spoiled girls, masterfully developed by Disney-Pixar in ~Finding Nemo~, returns for passionate players equipped with iOS devices thanks to Chasing Yello, a reinterpretation in ~endless running~ (but it would be more correct in this case to say ~endless swimming~) of the adventures of the little fish Yello. Already encountered in the previous title Saving Yello, which was inspired by Angry Birds as a style of play, the little protagonist this time has to deal with a stubborn little girl determined to capture him and thus interrupt his long run towards the coveted freedom. Although its position is certainly more advantageous than that of the friendly inhabitants of the aquarium in the aforementioned Disney film, there will certainly be dangers and adventures on this occasion as well. Go with the flow In Chasing Yello the player is therefore engaged in the typical infinite escape, a peculiar feature of the genre, which can only be interrupted by Game Over. In order to accumulate a large score, essentially due to the combination of the distance traveled and the gold coins collected, one must try to resist the obstacles placed along the way for the greatest possible period of time. The control system chosen by the developers is essentially based on accelerometers and vertical slide. The former are used to move Yello to the right or left along the waterway, thus avoiding dangers but at the same time collecting as many coins as possible while thanks to a timing slide from bottom to top it is possible to blow up obstacles such as boulders in flower of water and floating logs; swiping the finger backwards, from top to bottom will finally cause a momentary sinking of the fish, a useful movement to overcome the fiery logs and in general all the obstacles that cannot be jumped. Speaking of unexpected events, in addition to the aforementioned normal or fiery boulders and trunks, the young fish can encounter sudden crossroads and ferocious piranhas but, thanks to the incredible practically instantaneous response of the commands, after a minimum of trial (and the inevitable ~try and die~) it will be really easy to juggle in the water. During the irrepressible race, we will be frequently attacked by the small and pestiferous Mathilda, sometimes from the shore but sometimes even with a small boat and a net, obviously to be avoided at all costs. Chasing Yello also offers some very useful upgrades to improve game performance, the most important of which are the rocket and the magnet. The rocket is exactly reminiscent of that of Mario Kart and is in fact able to transport the young protagonist much further and at high speed, regardless of enemies, walls, obstacles or crossroads; the magnet on the contrary is an upgrade purely dedicated to the score, whose job is only to accumulate the golden stars faster. However, the whole game system, despite a very low initial investment, is ultimately strongly conditioned by the possibility given to the less patient user to invest real money within the application. Although the positions on microtransactions are certainly varied and sometimes even hostile, in this case the situation appears really limited: in fact, with a few euros one could very well ~cheat~ to buy extra stars and invest them in upgrades or, even more sensational, in a sort bonus that allows you to resume a race exactly from the point where it ended previously, rather than restarting from the beginning as usual. From a purely technical point of view there is absolutely nothing to complain about, thanks to the nice colored graphics with a ~bird's eye~ view and a fluidity that always guarantees pleasantly challenging game sessions. Of note in the sound sector is the sampling of a beautiful little girl's laugh that will surely be able to elicit more than a smile. Finally, a marked vocation for sharing social scores and support for Game Center complete the picture of what is offered.", "date": "2012-07-03", "grade": "8.0"}
