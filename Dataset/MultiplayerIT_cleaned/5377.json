Seldom does a minor title have such a media resonance in the environment after all, and it doesn't matter if it's incredibly inspired or artistically fascinating. No, here it was obviously the human story of Orth that was of interest, followed by his rebirth in the form of a developer and supported by his desire, together with a group of programmers, to go and enrich that sector of ~committed~ videogames which is often neglected by warheads in favor of blockbusters. The press was therefore ready to throw up their hands at the discovery of a new, unpredictable group of geniuses, or to point the finger at another pariah, guilty of having used his (negative) fame to create an opprobrium. Instead, against expectations, it was practically impossible for anyone to switch from one weather vane to another: ADR1FT has in fact proved to be a product with a great visual impact and an interesting experiment in the field of VR, but from a purely playful point of view. ... turned out to be mediocre. Between those who saved it for its technical sector and those who branded it as an unfunny failure, there have never been really sensational reactions and the attention towards the project quickly diminished. But now the PlayStation 4 version arrives, ready to make it known to a new audience. Will it be significantly improved compared to the PC version, or are we dealing with an equally limp game? ADR1FT has arrived on PlayStation 4, but it's a stellar journey that's not without its problems Still floating Let's quickly brush up on the basics, for those who have no idea what game we're talking about. ADR1FT is a title belonging to the Gone Home, Journey or Firewatch genre, but where instead of walking and enjoying the narrative and/or landscape, you float in zero gravity. You are Alex Oshima, astronaut in charge of a highly advanced space station involved in a disastrous accident, which left the orbiting structure in pieces. With all of your comrades already confirmed dead, you'll need to collect the recordings scattered around the devastated facility in order to get a better picture of the situation and understand exactly what happened. Now, going to review the mechanics in detail is useless, also because they are extremely simple: ADR1FT has already been widely criticized for its slowness and for its unique survival mechanic, an oxygen deficiency which forces the protagonist to collect floating containers during the exploration so as not to suffocate. The movement speed is also very low in this PlayStation 4 version, while the attacks on the indicator linked to the oxygen cylinders were a bit excessive in our opinion (the mechanics are criticized because they limit exploration, but after the first phase a modification to the suit clearly improves the air supplies, making everything almost negligible). The developers have inserted this element as a ~forced limit~ to prevent the player from going too far out of bounds and at the same time in order to keep the anguish high, but - exactly as we had already written in the PC review - they have partially failed, churning out a title that becomes tedious after a while despite its considerable artistic impact. On PlayStation 4, as to be expected, none of these elements have been touched up, so the value of ADR1FT remains unchanged for us in terms of gameplay. However, there is a rather heavy lack for the Orth project and his on the Sony platform. Crashing in space We are clearly talking about the absence of VR headsets, at the moment, on PlayStation 4. A large part of ADR1FT's appeal basically lies in being thought around virtual reality, and actually being ~inside~ the space station disaster is a remarkable experience for the first hour of the game. At this point you will rightly say ~boys, Playstation VR is coming~, but the Sony headset will not be able to solve a rather serious problem with this port: the low frame rate. ADR1FT on PC was already a difficult game to handle for people without an iron stomach; we, and many of our colleagues, after barely half an hour of playing the game were pretty upset, and all that with a high and stable frame rate. On PlayStation 4 ADR1FT runs at 30 frames per second, with some stuttering. We let you imagine what could happen if you played it with a viewer. This version of the game therefore loses any appeal for lovers of VR viewers, and is already a rather heavy blow for an experiment of this kind, which has very little to say from a gameplay point of view and does not shine excessively from this point of view.n narrative loop (the basic story is interesting and has a commendable closure, but it's really hard to feel empathy for the characters brought into play, in the knowledge that they are already dead and that they communicate in the form of rather trivial ~testimonies~). In addition, the title seems rather unstable: graphically the level of detail is remarkable, and certain scenes remain a feast for the eyes, but we have repeatedly run into annoying crashes, which forced us to repeat some very slow sections. We do not doubt that corrective patches will arrive, however it is quite evident that the test has not been done perfectly on the title. Finally, even in terms of content, we have not noticed any changes, apart from the immediate presence of the Eva Free Mode which was added later to the PC version.", "date": "2016-08-01", "grade": "5.8"}
