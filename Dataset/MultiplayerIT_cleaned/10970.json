{"name": "Su giu con LocoRoco", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/locoroco-2-recensione.html", "text": "Despite the excellent sales in Japan and more than discreet in the rest of the world, Psp has always struggled to carve out a concrete space for itself within the world of video games, thanks to a poor characterization and a labile identity of the hardware which often and willingly pushed the 'Sony handheld to be framed by developers as a simple portable PS2. And if therefore, while we celebrate the fourth year since the Japanese launch of the console, the great third-party exclusives continue to be in hiding (with some exceptions such as the very important and devastating Monster Hunter by Capcom), it is Sony itself that must therefore put itself into first line by offering the user products of a certain caliber. And the spearhead of the European winter line-up in this sense is Locoroco 2, the sequel to one of the most original and fun games to appear in recent years. To whistle in the shower... However, those who expected revolutions from Locoroco 2 or did not appreciate the first episode can easily stop reading here. For the others, however, SCEI has packaged a sequel absolutely in line with what was offered in the past, a classic more of the same in short, a factor which however can hardly be considered a defect in the face of the simple and irresistible gameplay that distinguishes it. Certainly the surprise effect of the debut is missing, but so be it. And so here again we find ourselves facing the threat of the Moja, who have returned to invade the planet of the peaceful Locoroco with the same evil intentions of the past. Obviously the aim is to get rid of them, by controlling a series of particularly expressive colored blobs and above all endowed with unsuspected singing skills. The interaction is limited to the use of the two back buttons of the PSP, which are delegated to the inclination to the right or to the left of the levels with consequent rolling in this direction of the Locoroco. Pressing both allows creatures to make a short jump, which is also the only attack mode they have. Finally, the circle button allows you to bring together all the Locoroco available in a single blob, or vice versa to separate them to overcome the narrowest and most narrow passages. Basically the game is all here: cross the colorful environments from one end to the other trying not to be eliminated by the Mojas. Such a simple concept that however can benefit from further developments, so as to offer stimuli and interpretations both to casual players and to those who are looking for a greater challenge. Let me be clear, Locoroco 2 never becomes a game that requires particular skills from a seasoned gamer; but to complete the adventure 100% much more is needed than proceeding headlong in search of the level's exit, with the risk of also encountering a few moments of frustration. For example, you have to collect the fruits, with which to increase the number of little creatures at your command to reach the 20 locoroco present in each section. And recover some musical notes, which over a hundred will make it easier to obtain the pink fruits. And free the Mui Mui, who will thus be able to populate the house that we will be able to furnish with the parts (still) collected during the levels. The main theme of the entire challenge factor offered by Locoroco 2 is therefore not so much linked to one's ability to control the blobs, as to explore the stages with enormous attention in search of all the hidden areas that hide a handful of the many ~things~ that you have to recover. A collect-a-thon on which perhaps the programmers have pushed their hand a little too much, varying the balance of a formula which in all probability did not need to take this direction; even more so when for a small mistake you find yourself leaving something behind, perhaps towards the end of the level, without the possibility of going back. MuiMui! Despite this not very convincing element from the writer's point of view, and bearing in any case well in mind that none of the above is mandatory to continue the adventure, SCEI must be given credit for having tried to expand the gameplay while still maintaining the great simplicity that characterized the first chapter and confirming a well-made level design. In this sense, the locoroco's new ability to swim should be seen, thus tackling a whole series of underwater sections, and again the musical mini-game that accompanies the singing phases which were previously completely non-interactive, or the possibility of entering certain holes into the ground to come out in other areas, or the sections where you actually find yourself inside an afro with which to destroy the rocks that hinderthe passage. Absurdities that find their dimension perfectly in the world of Locoroco, which still defines his point of greatest attraction in the purely aesthetic component. A unique style, which in some ways recalls flash games with a bright, vibrant, colorful and sugary look that really can't fail to arouse at least sympathy in anyone. An astonishing personality that really bursts from every pixel as well as from every note of the songs that make up the soundtrack, indissolubly united with the aesthetic component so as to form an audiovisual picture of a cohesion rarely noticeable in other products. It is only sad to note that a good portion of the songs, as well as the settings, have been taken directly from the first chapter. It is also a pity for a rather reduced longevity, which is only marginally helped by the non-irresistible minigames available.", "date": "2008-12-12", "grade": "8.5"}
