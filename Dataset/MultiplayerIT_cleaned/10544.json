Among the products of this type most loved by personal computer users, titles of the caliber of Falcon 4.0, Microsoft Flight Simulator and Il-2 Sturmovik stand out without any doubt. In particular, the latter, released way back in 2001 by 1C Company and 505 Games, with its subsequent expansions had and has few equals in its field for the complexity and realism of the physical model applied to the aircraft. It should therefore come as no surprise if the producer has decided to fill a gap in the vast game library available for consoles, namely the one concerning the lack of a real aircraft simulator, by creating IL 2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey for this market, a title that seeks to best combine the simplicity of an arcade product with the typical depth of a real simulation, whose development for consoles was entrusted to the Gaijin Entertainment team. The game is set in a historical era such as that of the Second World War in which it retraces some of the most significant battles from 1939 onwards up to the last clashes over Berlin in 1944 complete with the bombing of the Reichstag. Six scenarios in the single-player campaign (there are also Sicily and the former Soviet Union) and dozens and dozens of missions divided into basic operations, let's call them that, and additional ones, which can also be accessed separately when you want. Arcade As per tradition for this type of product, there are several military actions to be performed and they are not limited to the usual combat between aircraft, offering the player an ever-changing level of challenge. In addition to the canonical firefights, typically stealth missions are added in which, avoiding enemy radars, it is necessary to fly over certain areas in absolute silence in reconnaissance, or operations in which one is called to destroy positions, factories or columns of moving enemy tanks, obviously avoiding the anti-aircraft. Other times support is required for squadrons of bombers or transport aircraft, etc. The game system then takes into account the actions performed and assigns specific points for the results obtained thanks to an internal evaluation system. But let's take a closer look at the options and their influence on actual gameplay. To make the product immediately accessible to most and not scare casual gamers too much with too complicated settings and parameters, the development team decided to insert three different difficulty levels corresponding to three different game modes (the extremes are Arcade, i.e. easy, and Simulation, very difficult). In the simplest one, the gameplay closely resembles that of productions of the caliber of Namco's Ace Combat. Lots of action, unlimited ammunition, fully automatic targeting and target locking system, HUD that shows the precise distance to the next enemy aircraft (opponents and allies perfectly distinguishable visually) and above average bullet resistance. In short, everything you can expect from simplified gameplay. However, this does not mean that in this mode the game is reduced to a mere hook and shoot. The AI of the enemies is less complex than the Simulation level but not for this less intelligent and still increases in level depending on the missions, in order to still offer an excellent degree of challenge to the user without however compromising playability. While the control of the aircraft, which takes place with the aid of the two analog sticks of the Pad (with the buttons the radar or the zoom on the target framed. With the front buttons, however, weapons are used, including bombs - Ed.) remains all in all credible. Flying a Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf.109 rather than a Soviet L-2 Sturmovik or an American Republic P-47 Thunderbolt will therefore not be the same. Simulation But as we said at the beginning of the article, the most interesting aspect of production is the simulation component. By playing at this degree of difficulty, in fact, you can better appreciate the game of 505 Games and Gaijin Entertainment. Provided, however, that you have a lot of patience and a desire to learn the commands well. The controls thus become more sophisticated, not so much in number (they are always the same as before) but in their greater sensitivity in relation to the physics of the aircraft and the environment, which is pushed even further, up a hypothetical scale of values that measures the degree of realism, precisely in this modality. Aircraft steering is more complex and difficult to manage: now a slight incorrect stick movement is enough for a sudden change of trajectory or aircraft overturning. I disappearno on-screen aids and therefore all control of the vehicle and of incoming enemies, as well as aiming and killing them, rests on the player's shoulders who must personally check every single detail by keeping his eyes wide open and acting manually (without i.e. automatisms of sorts). In this context, in fact, it is necessary to take into account dozens of factors if you want to progress in the battle, such as the failure of parts of the engine and of the structure of the vehicle itself. The aircraft could be damaged for many reasons: a bullet could puncture the petrol tank and therefore there could be a certain loss of fuel, or the temperature of the water or oil could be too high with serious consequences on the stability of the aircraft. Atmospheric pressure, overload, wear of the mechanical components of the aircraft or exceeding certain speeds in relation to the vehicle being piloted are other elements of risk for the failure of the mission and the premature end of one's virtual alter ego. The game doesn't even forget the atmospheric conditions and their influence on driving and carrying out missions: an attack in full daylight in the heat of Sicily or a night bombing in the cold of Eastern Europe are different and imply a different level of difficulty. Clouds, turbulence, sun, darkness, smoke, all affect the pilot's field of view, for example, and always affect control of the aircraft. Ditto for one of the three views available, namely the one from inside the cockpit (the others are in the third person and outside the cockpit), which turns out to be the most difficult to use. Multiplayer In addition to the various single-mode missions we mentioned at the beginning, there are numerous options for online multiplayer play. The multi-player mode (up to sixteen at the same time), in which it is possible to set every little detail, from the weather conditions to the time of the fight, has four basic options. The first two are similar in some ways to the classic Deathmatch of normal Fps both in single and in team. Needless perhaps to add that the aim of the challenge is to shoot down as many opponents as possible and stay in flight obtaining the maximum required score or at least the highest one compared to the other competing pilots. The third, called Strike, is probably the most balanced and strategic of the four game modes on the net and consists in destroying the ground objectives of the enemy aviation, but at the same time paying attention to defending one's own bases from adverse attacks. The last option, Capture the Airfield allows users to challenge each other in a mutual attempt to occupy as many of their opponents' airfields as possible, settling in the various conquered areas for a certain amount of time. It should be highlighted that for each team of participants there is a certain number of tickets that can be spent every time a player enters the game after being knocked down. Once these tickets are sold out, however, you will no longer be able to re-enter the game. Playstation 3 trophies THE 2 Sturmovik Birds of Prey offers the player 51 Trophies, of which 41 bronze, 7 silver, 2 gold and one platinum. The prizes are linked to various aspects of the game and to unlock them all it will be necessary to sweat the proverbial seven shirts. They depend on various factors ranging from the number of enemy aircraft destroyed to the type and number of online victories, from the unlocking of single-player missions or secret aircraft to the completion of the various game modes or a certain number of objectives in all three options available. While to receive the coveted Platinum it is necessary to obtain all the Gold, Silver and Bronze Trophies. Graphics and sound From a visual point of view IL-2 Sturmovik can count on one of the most beautiful graphics engines that have appeared so far on PlayStation 3. In this respect, in fact, if we exclude some small occasional drop in frame-rate in the most chaotic situations, we find ourselves faced with a very good product, with attention to every detail: the wings of the aircraft in which the holes caused by enemy bullets open, the realistic explosions, the smoke, the glimpses of the vast underlying scenarios full of details, the successful design of the aircraft reconstructed down to the apparently most insignificant finishes (for example, while piloting a Soviet aircraft it could happen that you look out of the cockpit and read the emergency instructions in Russian), the variable atmospheric conditions leave the players' eyes fully satisfied and contribute greatly to that feeling of realism we mentioned a little while ago also in regards to physics and the type of game. The same discourse we can easily do it for the audio sector. Simply succeeded. For the soundtrack of the game, in fact, Gaijin Entertainment made use of the experience of Jeremy Soule, the American composer author of the music for successful video games such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Neverwinter Nights and Prey, just to name a few , and winner of a BAFTA award (British Academy of Film and Television Arts, a British organization that awards cinematographic, television and interactive authors and works every year - Ed.). Add the excellent sampling of battle effects or the typical noises of aircraft in flight (each also characterized in this) and we have a complete picture of the excellent work done by the audio engineers. The only drawback some of the voices for the localization in Italian: too recited and sometimes tending to caricatural (involuntary) due to the dialectal accentuations of some characters.", "date": "2009-09-09", "grade": "8.5"}
