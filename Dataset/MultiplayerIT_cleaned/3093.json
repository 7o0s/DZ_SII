Also because so far you could only try it there: it is only in the next few days that Nintendo Switch will also officially debut. But if this possibility has been withheld from you, perhaps it is even better after all: on the hybrid console of the Kyoto House, in fact, it lands as crazy as ever, and with the addition of the local multiplayer mode - a real novelty. So let's see why you might particularly like this game based on golf, and designed specifically for golf haters. The conversion to Nintendo Switch A golf game for golf haters? But isn't that a contradiction? No, it's not. The production of Triband was conceived as a real madness in the form of a video game, an experience to be enjoyed only partially keeping the starting sport as a reference point. In reality it consists of a series of irreverent and original mini-games and puzzles, very entertaining and suitable for all ages. We got to experience What the Golf? on Nintendo Switch, in its first official console conversion. Not that it's who knows some complex game or with a very remarkable graphics sector: but often even the porting of minute productions can go wrong. It depends on how you work on the conversion. That of Triband has succeeded perfectly, and therefore you will find in your hands (playing in portable mode) the same colorful game of last autumn, without any hesitation, very fast in loading, in switching from one game mode to another, in loading various levels. The framerate at 30FPS is also stable, which has never given signs of abating even in those (few) levels in which the objects on the screen are many or potentially explosive. The attempt to exploit the potential of Nintendo Switch is appreciable, but it has only succeeded up to a certain point. The HD Rumble, for example, has been adequately implemented to return the most faithful tactile feedback possible, but the gyroscope leaves a little the time it finds; no motion control, finally, to throw the balls. The latter case must be considered separately because, as you may know, the balls are not the only game tool in What the Golf? Indeed, most of the time everything else is thrown into the hole: stones, clubs, machines, gaming chairs, desks, and the player included. Contents: Party Mode and Multiplayer What the Golf? arrives on Nintendo Switch full of all the content already present on Apple Arcade and analyzed at the time in the review, plus a precious novelty: local multiplayer for two players (or more, if desired). And it works exactly as the soul of the Nintendo console requires: the two JoyCons are detached, and you play by holding one of them horizontally. With the left stick you aim, with the command A (or in any case the right button) you throw the ball; the higher the pressure, the farther it will go. Party Mode has been cleverly designed, adapting the craziness of the game to healthy competition, without making it too frustrating or overly luck-based. A certain degree of skill is therefore required, and of course controlling the confusion that reigns on the screen is not easy. Once you assign two unlikely avatars to the contestants, they take on a series of levels one after the other at the same time: you win one point per level, when you manage to get to the flag first. The last level, however, changes all the cards on the table: it is a gigantic arena where you play dodgeball. Here the aim is to hit the opponent several times until his life bar is brought to zero: and here is the point of the matter, because each health bar consists of one of the victories in the levels addressed up to this point. Therefore, paradoxically, even those who have triumphed in only two games up to that point can win, as long as they know how to ball their friend with precision. Of course, all the other standard game modes remain available: the main campaign, which lasts just a handful of hours but is designed in a very intelligent way, also presenting crossroads and bosses to beat (all in the name of a light-hearted and irreverent spirit) ; the Show to a friend mode, with which it is possible to make known in a few minutes What the Golf? with his soul to those who have never seen him before; Impossible challenges, for those who are certainly not afraid of missions that defining them difficult would be an understatement; the Challenge of the Day, where the player's total moves are also calculated. In this way it is possible to compare in online rankings, forfind out who is the best among all these golfers who hate golf. The gameplay and originality of What the Golf? Several months after its launch on Apple Arcade, it is good to note how What the Golf? has not even partially lost its polish, especially on the gameplay side. This, of course, as long as we consider the production for what it is: a continuous joke, an attempt to surprise the player and amuse him by constantly making him smile, satisfying his pleasure of discovery. Golf is marginal: what matters is inventing funny situations, one after the other. Here then is that running cars are launched towards the finish line, or even the game mechanics are modified; but everything lasts a second, just enough to pass over. The overall and particular originality of the individual levels is never really questioned: even considering what it costs, What the Golf? it really is a little gem. Of course, it is true that in the end the game mechanics are trivialized and flattened: but this, more than a defect, is a precise choice of position on the part of the developers. With deeper gameplay, What the Golf? would no longer be What the Golf?", "date": "2020-05-15", "grade": "8.5"}
