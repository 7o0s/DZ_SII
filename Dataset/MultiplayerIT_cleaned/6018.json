We too dedicated an enthusiastic review to it in which we underlined how the game mechanics reminded us more of the beautiful Sim City than the casual / free-to-play drift taken by the genre in recent years. In short, cheers Cities: Skylines, just to make you understand that we have no prejudice towards the title of Colossal Order, of which we still recommend the purchase without any hesitation. Is After Dark the expansion that Cities: Skylines really needed? Light and shadow After many free updates, proof of the first paid expansion has also arrived for Cities: Skylines. In these cases, a lot is always expected in terms of content. Of course, no one expects the base game to be revolutionized, but at least one would like enough meat to be put on the fire to justify lighting the fireplace. After Dark, this is the name of the package, fills a large gap in the basic title: the lack of the day / night cycle. Sure, some modders have dedicated themselves to creating darkness for Colossal Order's never-setting cities, but none of the published changes have been really satisfying (at least not to the point where you don't want something better). From this point of view, we can only applaud the work done by the developers, who have worked very carefully to manage the behavior of the light over the hours. Evening falls over the city and the shadows lengthen to completely cover the streets. The electric lights of the houses and street lamps come on, the traffic decreases and some places are transformed to welcome the people of the night. The atmosphere that is created is truly fascinating and walking around the city at night with the camera free has its reason. From a gameplay point of view, however, very little has changed. The only real novelty is the possibility of creating poles with venues dedicated to night entertainment, which give different revenues from those of daytime venues. As for the day/night alternation, that's all. Unfortunately it is essentially an aesthetic novelty, which has very little impact on the gameplay. Indeed, it also has a problem: if you have installed custom buildings, incidentally those made by modders and published on the Steam Workshop, during the night they will appear completely dark. Probably some will be updated over time, but at least the first few weeks expect to have completely black city areas, more or less large depending on how many mods you have installed. Obviously mods are not the responsibility of Colossal Order, but we imagine that many of those who have stuck to Cities: Skylines for all these months have not disdained to experiment with more than a few. At least turn them off until they're updated. Other (few) news After Dark brings other novelties in addition to the day / night cycle, which we talked about in the previous paragraph. These are small additions to the gameplay, which are sometimes even difficult to notice. For example, now tourist businesses built along a beach can be specialized, or criminals are transported from police stations to prisons. Some infrastructure has also been added, such as international airports, which are larger than normal, commercial cargo hubs and bus terminals that allow for faster line changes. Something has also been done regarding mobility, as cycle lanes and bus lanes have been added, which help to ease traffic. The problem with After Dark is that that's all. The innovations we have listed certainly help to develop more complete and dynamic cities, but overall most of the introductions do not go beyond what can be obtained by installing some mods. Of course, the night cities are very beautiful to see and finally having an effective representation of the whole day is a pleasure, but it is really too little to justify the purchase, unless you are a huge fan of the game. Surely After Dark won't be able to get those who abandoned it to reinstall Cities: Skylines, just as it won't convince those who didn't buy it that the right time has come to do so.", "date": "2015-09-24", "grade": null}
