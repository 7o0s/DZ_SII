{"name": "Car Tycoon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/car-tycoon.html", "text": "Let's Play Avoiding being critical at all costs it can be said that CT offers an extra game perspective for lovers of the genre. In favor of this title plays the fact that it is divided into missions that each have a specific purpose (invoicing a certain amount per year, monopolizing the sports car market, etc.), saving the player that feeling of frustration so widespread in managerial in which you often play without having a precise goal. On the other hand, however, there are the limited possibilities that the player has to achieve the various objectives; in fact everything comes down to the mere choice of models to produce (there is no section dedicated to the trends and tastes of the buyers, in our opinion it would have been a good idea and not difficult to implement), to the possibility of grabbing factories and retail outlets by participating at municipal auctions (thus expanding one's power, but the results are not obvious), establishing the price of the models and carrying out sabotage actions against rival houses (I personally tried but nothing significant ever happened). It is not possible to build buildings, it is therefore possible that the competition can auction off all the useful structures before us, and the game flows static ... without any twist (a beautiful snowstorm, a hurricane, a terrorist act would be were appreciated :P) The development costs of the various components of the machines are high and the times very long, however there is the possibility of buying parts from sub-suppliers at more accessible prices and in a very short time. The industrial cities To give an opinion on the graphics of the title, the comparison with managers of the caliber of Tropico is inevitable, however we must say that from this point of view CT proves to be up to par; the graphics are very sharp, the playing fields clean and very detailed. The range of buildings is varied, all different from each other and very well designed, but there is no possibility to change the appearance of the city, consequently this very good artwork remains only a game accessory something that makes the game less boring everything and pleases the eye. Citizens walking through the streets do not interact with us, while on some buildings (banks, town halls, factories, stores, etc.) it is possible to click to access various management menus. Sound and conclusions Finally we could not avoid talking about the soundwork; the music is of a good standard, the soundtracks are varied and are perfectly implemented with the game scenarios, the same cannot be said for the sound effects, which are limited to some machinery noise when you are near a factory and to the sound of the cash registers which highlights the sales of our vehicles. However, it must be said that the sound often ~clicks~ in an irritating way (and we played with a 1.7 Ghz processor with 320 MB of RAM!!!) reaching the point of completely blocking the game. Having said that we can safely define Car Tycoon as a fairly anonymous drop that adds to the already immense ocean of managerial and similar, if you want to measure your business acumen you just have to open the doors of your factory ... good luck! Another Tycoon Here we are facing a new chapter in the ~tycoon~ saga, after having managed railway companies, having become oil tycoons and more, we will be called this time to manage and expand our dominance in the automotive market. Car Tycoon is part of the now highly exploited (and perhaps saturated since there is a lack of original ideas) vein of managerial titles. As a manager of a car manufacturer we will have to manage the production, sale and assistance of the cars we produce, establishing prices, options, services for consumers, etc. However, a doubt arises, how much relevance can be given to a game that fits into such an exploited trend without offering anything truly innovative (we've seen much better)? Let's see what the consolidated combination Jowood-Fishtank (RIM Battle Planets ed) offers us this time", "date": "2002-05-09", "grade": null}
