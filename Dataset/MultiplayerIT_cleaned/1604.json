For details on the revolutionary concept of this title and its difficult place within the current videogame genres, we refer you to the long preview that was dedicated to it in March. Having already offered on the aforementioned occasion a broad overview of the game mechanics, the technical realization and the brilliant developers of the Sick Puppies group, this time we will focus on the direct experience with the definitive version of Ghost Master. On the other hand, this strongly deviates from most of the titles we are used to and it is rather difficult to tell, in short, it should be played to be understood. So here's a detailed account of my first chilling exploits as ~Lady of Darkness~... A day in the life of a Ghost Master Gravenville, New England. The darkness of the night envelops a particularly gloomy American college, the ideal context for my debut as Ghost Master: a group of bored students are gathered around a table for a sance, but this time they have disturbed the wrong spirit, my , who thanks to their stupidity was able to cross the threshold between the earthly and otherworldly world and is preparing to bring together all the ghosts of the city to unleash hell ... well, actually I was sent here with a very specific mission, to investigate unusual paranormal activity, but nothing prevents me from having a little fun at the expense of mortals! To get rid of the poor fools who have unknowingly invoked me, a gremlin, a shower of ghost spiders and the creepy performance of Hellraiser's fat brother are enough (evidently, I'm not yet a Ghost Master authoritative enough to be able to afford serious ghosts, at this stage of the game). From now on, this building will be my headquarters: here I will be able to gather and train the handful of creatures that has been assigned to me and possibly welcome new ones, after having recruited them during the various missions. A day in the life of a Ghost Master But let's get straight to the action: to begin with, I have the task of uncovering a series of crimes committed by a nice local old lady, who had the bad habit of poisoning anyone who came into her house. Currently the building is inhabited by a family completely unaware of its horrible past and the time has come to blow up the corpses hidden for years between its walls. Now that I know the objectives of the mission and the scenario in which my helpers will have to move, I just have to select the ghosts to deploy on the field and I have two options: accept the team recommended by the Infestor Committee, with which I always have the guarantee of achieve the pre-established objectives, or personally choose the ~agents of the afterlife~ that I consider most suitable to achieve the maximum possible score (a potentially risky operation, when attempting the feat for the first time and not yet fully exploring a setting). A day in the life of a Ghost Master In the selection screen I have all the necessary information on the various types of infestors at my disposal: there are as many as six classes, different in terms of characteristics, powers and ~consumptions~ (spirits, disturbances, elements, vapors, scarers and horrors). Regardless of the class to which they belong, ghosts are also distinguished by the type of constraint, i.e. the means of access to the physical world (which can be water, a particular object, the scene of a crime, a source of heat...) . Since my job is to guide humans towards the corpses buried in this house, I will have to avoid scaring them to death and rather try to manipulate their fragile minds, employing spirits with psychic powers and able to act in domestic interiors: for for example, a gremlin that affects electronic equipment or a banshee that dominates the elements and attracts mortals with her siren song will be valuable. Inside the house I will also be able to count on the collaboration of local ghosts, willing to join my team if I manage to free them or satisfy certain conditions: the disturbing ghost-antenna operator imprisoned in the chimney of the fireplace, the talkative Avon representative forgotten in attic and the hapless technician surprised by the unpleasant effects of arsenic while repairing the boiler in the cellar. A day in the life of a Ghost Master With such a well-matched team the foodria is insured! Now I'm ready to unleash my efficient pests. The first step is the accurate exploration of the place and all the constraints present in it, which is natural and intuitive thanks to the versatile interface: you have maximum freedom of movement, with just the right mouse button you can rotate and zoom the view isometric 3D to your liking and moving from one floor to another of the house is just as simple; in addition to the panoramic one, we have a cinematic view to enjoy live animations of our favorites at work, a view through the eyes of ghosts and one that allows us to put ourselves in the shoes of our mortal victims, to live from them emotions firsthand. Subsequently I move on to the analysis of the residents, who I must know well to complete the mission: the biographies and the status of the humans are accessible via the icons in columns on the right side of the screen and it is good to always keep their fear levels under control. madness and belief in the paranormal, as my success depends on these parameters. At the beginning of each infestation, faith in the otherworldly dimension is always rather low and must be appropriately nourished with the intervention of ghosts at our service: the ideal are telekinetic powers and inexplicable atmospheric phenomena. When mortals sense that they are threatened by occult forces, they are more prone to fear and this is the source of the life energy of our ghosts, the plasma: the greater the fear generated in humans, the greater the amount of plasma a disposition of the haunters to unleash ever more terrifying powers. A day in the life of a Ghost Master The trick is to find out as early as possible what scares the mortals we are dealing with, but there are two types of terror in Ghost Master: fear, triggered by random phenomena that would impress anyone, and madness, unleashed by leveraging phobias and unconscious fears of the victims (it is obvious that driving them mad with terror leads to significantly higher scores). To know the weak points of humans, we can experiment with different attack strategies or directly use powers aimed at revealing them. The game's realistic artificial intelligence means that people react differently to the same power and that skeptics are much harder to scare: a shower of spiders, for example, would leave no one indifferent and would guarantee a general increase in discomfort, but a flood of blood in the corridor could prove even more effective for the unfortunates who cannot tolerate the sight of it and would allow them to be liquidated faster! The status of the haunters and their power options are displayed on the left side of the screen. Before deciding how to deploy our ghosts, some tactical reflection is necessary, given that their range of action is limited by the constraint they use: it is necessary to establish whether it is better to place them in common areas or passage points, in order to hit the largest number of mortals at the same time, or whether it is more effective to target them one at a time, pushing them inexorably into the abyss of madness and despair. We will also have to be careful with the plasma, which risks running out quickly if used by too many ghosts at the same time: in this case, an alarm is foreseen that gives us a few seconds to bench a ghost or two and save our resources. A day in the life of a Ghost Master The awareness of being able to observe these mortals, intent on their daily chores and helpless in the face of our boundless paranormal powers, gives the player an insane sensation of omnipotence, which makes the explosion of screams and delirious special effects that follows the initial stages of each mission. To leave you the taste of experiencing this satisfaction on your skin, I will not tell the outcome of the mission. But be careful, humans are not all that defenseless: they have ghostbusters, witches and exorcists who will try in every way to put the poles in our wheels. Once we have completed our tasks and visualized the scores obtained, we will be able to return to the headquarters to invest the credits earned on the field in new powers to be conferred on our ghosts. Scares for all tastes Obviously the skills of a Ghost Master are not limited to blasting out corpses, he is good at that as wellLady in Yellow! We will also find ourselves emptying entire buildings to the sound of screams or persecuting predestined victims, rescuing other ghosts in difficulty, surviving enemy attacks or helping deserving mortals. The plot of the game unfolds in 30 scenarios and 16 settings, one more varied and intriguing than the other (from the woods to the ~Blair Witch Project~ to the psychiatric hospital) and some are truly impressive in terms of extension and complexity. Every Ghost Master will find bread for his teeth, grappling with about fifty monsters to make Pokemon pale and with a wide range of paranormal powers to master, from the telekinetic storm to the blood that gushes from the walls. Scares for all tastes And one mission leads to another: one is always eager to discover the next scenario, to sneer at the idea of the movie or the urban legend that apes, to probe every dimension of human fear by anticipating the astonished faces of the poor mortals at our mercy and to find a way to get around the medium on duty. The level of difficulty is variable and well calibrated, also because it is relative: usually the primary objectives are simple to achieve with a little experience, but the same cannot always be said of the optional ones; moreover, freeing all the ghosts trapped in a scenario is not obvious and one is often tempted to replay a mission that has just been completed to win one that could prove useful later, as well as to raise the score or experiment with a new formation of ghosts. In short, the longevity of Ghost Master is guaranteed, especially if we consider the fact that the developers have declared that they have also contemplated a multiplayer option and that they are already working to offer expansions with increasingly insane missions and a new stable of infestors ready to amaze us with unprecedented powers. A thrilling simulation On the technical front, beyond the fluid and pleasant three-dimensional graphics, the masterful character design, the impressive volumetric effects, the skilful use of lights and transparencies or the amazing soundtrack, two things particularly struck me in Ghost Master: the first is the incredible freedom of action and experimentation enjoyed by the player, which ensures variety in the ways of completing missions and a multi-level approach (strategic, instinctive, analytical...); the second is the frighteningly flexible and realistic artificial intelligence, which gives the characters natural behavior (complete with habits and preferences for certain environments and activities) and unpredictable reactions to encounters with the paranormal, worthy of the best horror or comedy film , depending on the circumstances. The only potential risk of frustration comes from the lack of direct control over the ghosts' actions: in fact, the player positions them and gives orders on the powers to be used but then he just has to watch what they do... and not always they do what you want! On the other hand, this partly contributes to making the challenge and the strategic aspect even more interesting. A thrilling simulation Some of the images accompanying this article are taken from the original version of the game but don't worry: Ghost Master is entirely localized in Italian and also quite well, I'd say, apart from some small oversights and the obvious difficulties encountered in rendering the puns. However, the voice acting could have been far better; in particular the narrator's voice, which in English perfectly matched the ironic atmosphere of the game without betraying the horror setting (do you know Uncle Tibia from Tales from the Crypt?), while in the Italian version it not only sounds irritating but often willingly seems to read a script without punctuation, atrocious! As a ~fetishist of the packaging~, I can guarantee that the Ghost Master one is very appreciable, first of all because it is not the usual sterile DVD-style case and secondly because it includes a rich extra CD with a documentary on the production of the game, backgrounds and utilities for the desktop, artwork, a posteron and a bonus infestor! In conclusion... To be a management strategy (provided that it can be defined to all intents and purposes as such), Ghost Master boasts an enviable technical realization and graphics, while demonstrating excellent fluidity in the management of special effects and", "date": "2003-06-30", "grade": null}
