On the other hand, after having seen a Zelda-style adventure RPG based on this sport in Golf Story, this particular digression into RPGs with Japanese visual novel grafts doesn't seem even the strangest of those possible, but it certainly ranks in a good location. The whole story revolves around Delion Bridge, a prestigious academy where the boys try to learn the art of golf, at the same time developing interpersonal relationships and distinguishing themselves on the course by learning new techniques and special skills that can lead them to climb the general classification of the most promising young players. There is therefore a sort of story that ties the various matches together and which manages to characterize this title in a particular way, enriching the experience on the field with a progressive story, even if the narrative is not exactly deep and developed. In any case, it is a narrative construct almost like a visual novel, in fact: this is the impression that emerges after a few minutes of play, after an intermission phase in which we choose the character among the four available and we witness the beginning of the story, with the classic dialogues composed of partially animated screens, spoken in Japanese and texts (commendably) transcribed in Italian. However, it soon turns out that the soul of the game is actually found on the golf course, where an arcade interpretation of the famous sport is staged that also has a certain complexity, somewhat contravening first impressions. To the action between the bat and the ball is added a rather deep management of the characters, who progress and evolve on the style of the role-playing game, also thanks to the inevitable micro-transactions that support the whole free-to-play scaffolding. The magical art of golf Placed on the golf course, the gameplay does not differ much from the arcade interpretations of this sport that we have seen in Everybody's Golf for example, or even in the historic Neo Turf Masters, obviously beyond the anime characterization present in Birdie Crush. The paths are extremely imaginative as scenarios but it is still a question of trying to put the ball in the hole with the least number of shots possible, avoiding obstacles and looking for the best trajectories just as you would expect from a game of this genre. We can set the direction, the effect and the power of the swing, calculating the wind and other possible variables such as the conformation of the land in short and simple steps, through a clear interface that does not give up taking into consideration all the elements that contribute to make golf complex. Except that obviously everything is rather simplified, compared to a real simulation, as regards the elementary management of physics and above all the introduction of very unrealistic elements such as power-ups and special abilities, which give Birdie Crush a very special tone . In addition to the bonuses that we can collect directly along the courses, this area includes the numerous micro-transactions focused on customizing the players' appearance, potions capable of increasing their stats and special abilities that can be activated during the race and all microcosm of purchases between in-game currency, access to special leagues, costumes and many other additional elements that probably represent the economic engine of the game, being a free-to-play. It is probable that as the competitions progress, the challenge rate will force the use of some paid accessories, but at least in a good first phase it is possible to safely overlook the in-app purchases, also counting on the rewards you get by playing, making the login or waiting for the various meters to be recharged. On the technical front, Birdie Crush counts on excellent polygonal models, even if the presence of only four characters currently limits the visual variety somewhat. Similarly, the courses with the various holes are many but are limited to rotating a few variations of the scenario, although a progressive expansion is likely also through updates in the next period. The visual novel-style interlude scenes are also of good quality, with a rather standard but clean and well-characterized anime-style design.", "date": "2021-02-18", "grade": "7.0"}
