More than the great Goldeneye 007-like work, difficult to repeat for obvious reasons, the mass of good games that characterized the era of the 80s and, in part, the 90s is missing. Not only is it rare for a prestigious company to invest its money for the use of a well-known brand (like not regretting the Disney-Capcom combination), we have even reached the point that video game enthusiasts, even before having any news or judgments regard, they ignore these kinds of products regardless. And not without reason, however: it is the facts that have generated this attitude. Observing the situation from the outside, it is evident how the qualitative decline of the tie-ins has gone hand in hand with the increase in development costs: the most renowned companies prefer to enhance their brands, without having to shell out money to appropriate some licenses , and those who opt otherwise hardly ~waste~ the best talents in the creation of a game that in any case, from their point of view, would sell for the simple name it bears. The 5 Legends does nothing but fit into this context, without moving it one iota (like many other past games of Torus Games, after all). Beat beat Based on the most recent Dreamworks animated film, The 5 Legends follows in the footsteps of some great tie-ins of the past, such as those based on Konami's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: it is a hack'n'slash, a side-scrolling fighting game isometric view. Context and characters are obviously taken from the original work, so to accompany the formation of Jack Frost, in the fight against the dark Pitch, intent on appropriating the dreams of children around the world, there are four already established guardians: Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman. The latter character has nothing to do with the famous namesake created by Neil Gaiman, being the fruit of the imagination of William Joyce, author of The Guardians of Childhood, a series of novels which inspired the feature film. The characterization of characters and settings (one for each protagonist) is excellent, and makes the best use of the original material: it won't take you too long to become attached to the ruthless and grumpy Santa Claus, who relegates the intense Christmas work to the Yetis rather than to the elves , contrary to what one might believe. There are always four guardians active on screen, whether you're playing solo or multiplayer - the AI of your companions is good, but at any moment one person can step in and take control of a CPU-driven character. The commanded guardian can be changed in real time, simply by pressing a key on the d-pad: a simple and fast operation, just as the map on the Gamepad screen is also convenient, which allows you to contemplate the whole area (provided play without tv, of course). Too (not) simple The controls are excellent, simple and with immediate response, as it should be in any game of this type. There's a button to roll and activate co-op actions, one for special shots and one for simple attacks: no jumping or special technicalities, the only difficulty is pressing at the right time to trigger a satisfying combo. All of this is quite reminiscent of Phantasy Star Online, without however the operations being declined on the basis of the weapon (unique for each character) or in relation to the statistics. Yes, statistics: if on the one hand The 5 Legends is an extremely simple and immediate work, aimed at children and families, on the other it has many typical features of the more complex hack'n'slash. There are several factors to keep under control, and many distinct paths to develop the various characters: all difficult and branched operations which, on balance, are poorly reflected in the game mechanics. Just as the excessive freedom granted in facing the adventure, lacking a pre-established path, is out of place: a characteristic that we would like to find and see developed in other types of productions, not here, where in addition to the intent one can well appreciate little. The Torus Games work has its main limit precisely in conceptual indecision, always poised between a product for families and the one ~for everyone~ in Nintendo style; too complex to belong to the first category, too shallow to be included in the second. Another non-negligible defect is the repetitiveness of the missions (but unfortunately this is typical of the genre), and above all the superficiality of the fights, which do not in the least enhance the good controls: the clashes are trivial and difficult to read, snot to mention that the entire adventure can be tackled in its entirety with a simple press of the action button. To complete the picture there is the frame rate, limping in the most agitated phases (especially in multiplayer) and low in general. Too bad, because stylistically the game is not bad at all.
