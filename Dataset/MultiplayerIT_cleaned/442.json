Just place the pen over an enemy to lock them into a sort of ~lock-on~ and watch your X-men attack the target until they're down. Aiming at another enemy will obviously change focus. Through the stylus then, it is possible to directly destroy some opponents while your character is attacking elsewhere. The shoulder buttons are used to change your x-men based on the obstacles in front of you. There are four in all party characters: Wolverine, Iceman, Nightcrawler, and MagnetoyeahMagneto! The game tells the events that occurred between the last two films, and develops during an uncertain and dangerous alliance with Magneto and his men, in order to thwart a plan orchestrated by some mutants to exterminate the entire race. However, not all the x-men of the party will be available every time, but depending on the plot of the plot, each level includes only some of the protagonists. Nightcrawler, on the other hand, will always be engaged in solo levels. The abilities of the mutants are immediately recognizable, and you will immediately be able to understand which character is best suited to a given situation.

Wolverine is superb in melee, with greater power than his companions, and with the ability to take down some enemies who shield themselves in a circle of flames. The Iceman can attack from a distance, and can also strike flying enemies, but is powerless against those defended by fire. Magneto has no limitation on the types of enemies he can fight, but he cannot attack them directly. Thanks to his power to manipulate metal objects, he must use the various materials that are scattered around the level, generally barrels and floating mines, to hurl them at the enemy. Obviously the approach to the attack changes slightly: instead of pointing the stylus at enemies you will have to place the tip on an object and drag it against the enemy. By defeating the enemies you will get green diamonds that have the ability to fill a bar useful for activating the ~X Factor~. When the bar is sufficiently charged, placing the pen on top of your character will increase its characteristics. Wolverine will become a war machine, Iceman will fire three shots instead of one, and Magneto will be able to move larger objects. NightCrawler skilled in hand-to-hand combat, will be able to stop time and move undisturbed around the stage, probably to simulate the teleportation of which the character in the comics is capable. Just a shame that the bar dries up outrageously soon. Mutants in their underwear Although the idea may appear inspiring at first, in reality it has not been developed with due care and craftsmanship. The attack system isn't as polished or interesting as it should be, and sees your character repeatedly attacking the selected enemy until they're defeated, even if they're out of your reach. There is no type of control that helps give a certain credibility or strategy to the action, but only an automatism whereby, when touched by the enemy, your character stupidly begins to repeat the same action until the target is killed. The levels, about forty in all, apart from someone more successful than others, are rather trivial and are repeated for situations very soon, so that you find yourself doing the same things already after the very first levels. The pace remains quite fast however, since a countdown, generally under 5 minutes, will force you to get to the mission objective in a hurry. Furthermore, the situation does not improve once we get to the bosses, since most of the time they are a pure formality, rather than a challenge or a moment of variety. These and other important flaws, such as an often inconsistent framerate, and a certain inaccuracy in collisions with the stage, make the game unworthy and boring. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Comment Too bad that the initiative to base the title on interaction via the touch screen was not followed by a scrupulous analysis and planning of the game system. The basic idea is not to be thrown away, but due to an absolutely inadequate level design and enemiesthe always identical and not very aggressive, the attack system very soon reveals itself as just a boring succession of actions. Actions otherwise trivial (~enter the enemy-choose the mutant-attack~) and which never show a flash of inventiveness during the entire duration of the game. The touch screen has repeatedly shown to be quite versatile in many situations, and in this game it would have been appropriate to make the experience more sophisticated and refined, adding something more elaborate to the basic system. Therefore, ~X-Men: The Official Game~ for DS is a game that is appreciable in concept, but neglected in practice, and that will only be able to satisfy those who are willing to turn a blind eye to having mutants on their laptop. Pros Use of the Touch Screen 4 mutants with different abilities Cons Trivial despite the use of the touch screen Inaccuracies and slowdowns in the graphics engine Limited longevity A few days after the review of the game for the flagship consoles, here is the test of the game in the Nintendo DS version. Moving from home systems to the DS we lose in power but we gain in touch screen: the developers have decided to put the touch screen at the center of the dual screen version.", "date": "2006-06-14", "grade": null}
