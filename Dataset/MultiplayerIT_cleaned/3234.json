{"name": "Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-recensione.html", "text": "That Dead Cells had the Castlevania series as its inspiration was clear to everyone. It has been ever since the game launched in Early Access on Steam, with only a fraction of the content it has now. The arrival of an officially licensed DLC of the Konami series is therefore the classic squaring of the circle, the extra content that you don't expect, but that somehow you've always wanted, which definitively reveals and celebrates what is basically one of the nature of the game, where moreover the title of the French Motion Twin continues to reap successes while the Castlevania series has been lying frozen for years. The review of Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania can therefore only be a story of elective affinities, more than a mere extra content, both for atmospheres and for cross-references. Two accesses The new bosses are taken from the Castlevania series, of course A handful of new enemies, two new biomes, three bosses, a new story, fourteen weapons, twenty clothes and sixty-three audio tracks taken from Castlevania and others reinterpreted by the game's authors. This, on paper, is what you get by installing Return to Castlevania. Quantitatively we are not far from the previous DLCs for additions, but playing it turns out that in this case the developers have thought a little more about how to exploit them, creating double access to the new biomes, the surroundings of Dracula's castle and the manor itself , which somehow multiplies the experience and allows you to make the most of them. We explain: the first access is found in the starting level and allows you to tackle the two biomes at a relatively low level of challenge (they are however more demanding than the others of the same range), because they replace the second and third levels, as well as the first boss. The new biomes are well designed The second access, which is unlocked after the first, is instead found in the Clock Tower, after defeating the Guardian of time. In this case the second biome overlaps the final part of the game, becomes much more difficult and allows you to fight against two different bosses, much more challenging. This is a very clever way to make the most of the new content, which thus turns out to be more layered and force you to replay it several times to discover everything, with completionists who will literally have to sweat the hell out of it to get everything. The many contents of Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania Alucard, it's time to stand up and help out! Naturally, the biomes of the DLC are full of references to the Castlevania series, starting with the first access, which takes place by talking to Richter Belmont, the protagonist of Rondo of Blood. Then you come into contact with other characters from the Konami series: Alucard, who you will remember for Symphony of the Night, and Maria Reinard, who also appeared for the first time in Rondo of Blood, with the first in particular having a decisive role in the new story. Playing the levels you face three new bosses, Death, Medusa and Dracula, all decidedly famous and predictable for a DLC of this kind, with Dracula in particular who takes up some of his original transformations making the combat very varied, and you come into contact with many generic enemies taken from Castlevania, such as armor with spears or harpies, adapted to the mechanics of Dead Cells. By playing you can also unlock an extra mode, Richter Mode, in which you control Richter who has his own specific moves and can in turn unlock objects that can also be used in normal mode. Overall we are talking about many extra game hours (difficult to quantify them, given the nature of Dead Cells), which are further extended by adding cells at the beginning of a game. In terms of game systems, don't expect big news. Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania does not aim to revolutionize anything, but only to add content that will make fans of the Konami series happy and make the game sell a few thousand more copies. Of course, there are some of the new weapons that are particularly tasty, such as Maria's cat or the whip sword, and it must be reiterated that the general healing is very high indeed, but they are still in line with the rest of the game. The design of the new biomes is particularly well done, with the ~Surroundings of the castle~ which includes an approach section and a climbing section of the ramparts, the latter built around a long central lift whose various sections must be reactivated, and the ~ Dracula's castle~ which instead offers a certain degree of free exploration, as if to recreate the structure of a mini metroidvania, and in advanced access sees Dracula himself take on a more active roletive for the entire level.", "date": "2023-03-12", "grade": "8.0"}
