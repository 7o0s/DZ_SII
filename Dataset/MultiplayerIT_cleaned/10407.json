If the first episode of the series, dedicated to the ~standard~ Olympics, was criticized for the fact that it was almost always necessary to shake the controller like madmen to play, this winter version partially corrects it and offers a more varied control system even if not always spot on. The ~speed~ disciplines are generally controlled via the simple tilt of the Wii-mote and Nunchuck, with a good response to inputs and a learning curve that is not at all steep, which sees us getting ahead and setting records already in the first attempts. Let's take slalom, for example: we have to hold the controllers in our hands as if they were our character's skis, tilting them to the right or left depending on the trajectory we want to follow and lowering their front ends if we want to gain speed. In a rather similar way, in the acrobatic jump it is necessary to acquire the greatest possible thrust (above all by getting the moment of departure right to the millisecond), ~detach~ when the trampoline ends by shaking the controllers upwards, then carefully adjust the position of our alter ego to face the delicate phase of landing in the best possible way. In this case, everything is played out in two or three key moments, and the experience in the end doesn't turn out to be who knows how engaging: if we get the start and the jump right, we will have done almost all the work. Shake and win The disciplines where you have to shake the Wii-mote like crazy haven't suddenly been eliminated, however. In speed skating, for example, in the starting phase it is necessary to shake the controller as quickly as possible to gain the necessary thrust, then give a big blow to the right and to the left, following the character's stride. Alerts appear on the screen that confirm or not the goodness of our work: if the timing is right, we will be able to lose the opponent even without resorting to the extra push that is activated by pressing the A button and which can make the difference pretty much in all sports, when we need only a little help to get ahead. Figure skating appears completely different, which in the list of available disciplines is the most ~casual~: for our performance to be perfect, we have to reproduce the moves indicated on the screen at the right time, i.e. during the ~key moments~ of the performance . In a very similar way to the aforementioned alpine skiing, snowboarding sees us incline only the Wii-mote (which we therefore have to manage as if it were our board) but gives great importance to jumps, which must be performed by shaking the controller upwards to right time and they can make us gain ground. Something similar is also used for bobsleighing, but in this case the Wii-mote must be kept in ~balance~ and to gain speed one must try to stay on the ideal line. The most atypical sports are undoubtedly curling and ice hockey: the first offers an all in all short experience, which mixes precision and speed, while the second looks a bit like a simple game of soccer complete with a passing of the puck (button A) and shot on goal (by shaking the Wii-mote). Fun but somewhat limited. Who will be on the podium? The game modes available are basically the same seen in Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, so we have the classic ~quick game~ that allows us to try all the disciplines already unlocked and a sort of ~story mode~ in which we have to choose a character to then accompany him throughout the Games, competing in various sports with the aim of placing us first in the standings at the end of the event. Each race won translates into a certain amount of star points which can then be spent in shops to buy music, logos, clothing for our Mii and so on. Once again, support for online multiplayer is missing, so the SEGA product is a recommended purchase especially for those who are used to playing in the company of their friends: the single-player modes, in fact, run out in a short time and as extras they offer just the usual challenge with the ~ghosts~. From a technical point of view it isDifficult to appreciate the changes compared to the previous episode of the Mario & Sonic series: the polygonal models are the same, even if the animations (of fair quality) and the scenarios obviously change. The mountain cutaways are not shocking due to the number of elements on the screen, but they flow smoothly and without uncertainties, which is very important for games in which the control is completely dedicated to motion detection. There is certainly a bit of flatness in the choice of colors, but that was to be expected. The sound boasts some good music and a number of suitable effects, with the announcer's voice in Italian.", "date": "2009-11-05", "grade": "7.0"}
