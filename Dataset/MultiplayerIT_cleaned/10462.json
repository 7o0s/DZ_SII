Once again, it is the political fantasy that forms the backdrop to the script of this JRPG, in which very classic elements are found: there is the passionate and forgetful protagonist, who hides a mysterious power, there is the comely, good and combative and there is a continent torn apart by civil war, under the guise of an evil tyrant. Following the typical plot, the illusion of tranquility of the protagonist who has taken refuge in the peaceful island of Ventalto will undergo a complete upheaval as soon as the war reaches his pleasant refuge, and the secrets enclosed in him will begin to manifest a nature that cannot keep him away from the battlefield. In short, there is a lot of fidelity to the tradition of the genre in Magna Carta 2, a devotion from a narrative point of view which however finds less confirmation than expected in the very structure of the game, in particular as regards the two fundamental elements of the combat system and the quest management. The result are valid variations on the theme that will certainly interest JRPG enthusiasts and that could more easily approach even those who have had little to do with it, although the verbosity (the narrative sections often take place through dialogues simply represented with polygonal models full-screen characters who move their lips and gesticulate) and the lilting rhythm typical of the genre still remains as a distinctive feature. A kind of secession The continent of Lanzheim has a history steeped in warfare. A thousand years after the sacrifice of the hero Strass, who eliminated the greatest of the Carta (the ~Magna Carta~, in fact, a semi-divine being) guaranteeing peace to the world, the political situation plummets. Prime Minister Schuenzeit kills Queen Ibrin and has her daughter, the rightful heir to the throne of Lanzheim, Princess Rzephillda (just ~Zephie~, fortunately, for friends) imprisoned. Schuenzeit takes control of the continent, but the princess manages to escape and, counting on the help of Count Alex of Abazet, organizes a movement of resistance (or rather, of restoration) by creating the army of the southern forces. Against this is the block loyal to Schuenzeit, for the most part formed by the regular army of Lanzheim and defined, by contrast, the army of the north. This is how the civil war of Lanzheim starts: after a first victorious phase for the army of the south, Zephie and his companions come across the secret weapons of the ex-prime minister, the ~Sentinels~, who completely and inexorably overturn the outcome of the war. These are mysterious sentient technological-magical weapons, which have destruction as their ultimate goal and against which the efforts of the princess, albeit valiant, are rather in vain. One hope is represented by the study of ancient artifacts that seem to have to do with the technology behind the Sentinels, and it is precisely during the search for one of these that Zephie arrives on the island of Ventalto. Meanwhile, on this peaceful strip of land, a quiet boy named Juto lives mostly idling and completing quiet chores, under the guidance of maternal (and prosperous, of course) Melissa. The young man remembers nothing of his past, and is afflicted by a strange phobia that prevents him from touching any metal weapon. Now combine the arriving princess, a mysterious artifact of war hidden on the island, the northern army in full war gear approaching and the secret power of Juto on the verge of exploding and you already have an idea of what's going on. to happen on the island of Ventalto: the beginning of a great adventure. Curiosity The combat skills of each character can be arranged in a tree diagram, by spending the points accumulated with advancing experience levels. The same weapons can be upgraded and modified with the use of kamond, a sort of standard material that can be obtained by defeating enemies, and is applied to equipment to modify its characteristics. Exploration and fighting Forremains, immutable, the fundamental dynamic of the JRPGs in this Magna Carta II, although we note some interesting variations in the way in which the secondary quests are proposed and carried out. As per tradition, purely narrative phases, dominated by dialogues and cutscenes, alternate with purely exploratory ones (within villages where it is possible to interact with various characters, make purchases and manage the inventory) up to ~mixed~ ones where most of the game takes place: it's the open map zones where exploration is interspersed with fighters against enemies. The areas that can be explored are decidedly vast and the clashes do not take place randomly, but as in an action game, the enemies are clearly visible and we can decide to attack them at any time by pulling out our weapons and arranging ourselves in warfare. A particular feature of Magna Carta II is the way in which the quests are proposed and carried out during the game, given that within the main story, wandering around the continent very often happens to come across people in need of help or willing to give some task to our heroes. By accepting the proposals, we can continue to carry out several missions simultaneously, with the game's ~diary~ updating the statistics in real time until the required objectives are achieved. At the end of a particular sub-quest, just talk to the ~employer~ to obtain the pre-established reward, with a system similar in some way to what we usually see within MMORPGs, much more dynamic and lively than the normal structure of JRPGs, as it allows you to keep a large number of sub-plots active even while continuing on the path of the main story. In some cases, however, these sub-missions consist of real mini-games, albeit very simple ones. Team play The combat system, we said, represents one of the breaking elements of the game, which in other respects is decidedly traditionalist. The clashes take place with an action setting, but they force you to weigh the maneuvers well and above all to manage the party in a choral way. Although the protagonist is Juto, in fact, the game is faced with the classic team made up of three characters usually selectable from a wider repertoire. At any time, by exploring the various locations (except for villages and certain safe areas) it is possible to switch to battle mode with the simple press of a button, with which the weapons are unsheathed. At this point, control is the direct action game one: one button is reserved for the normal attack, while the other two are reserved for special shots, which are performed using the ~kan~, the magical energy that it accumulates simply by fighting for normal warriors or by exploiting the elements present in the scenario for mages with elemental characteristics. What prevents us from launching mad blows is the ~vigor~ bar, which signals the physical energy of the fighters: by attacking relentlessly, the characters get tired and enter the ~reserve~ state, during which it is possible to launch more attacks powerful than normal but which soon lead to the ~exhausted~ state, during which the fighter will be unable to fight and therefore exposed to the initiative of the enemies. However, there is a particular system which, if well exploited, allows you to obtain all possible advantages and minimize exposure to enemy counterattacks. The player directly controls one character at a time, the ~leader~ of the group, while the other two are self-managed by the AI, which can also be set according to certain parameters by the player. However, it is possible to jump with the simple pressure of a key from the control of one character to another, moving the status of leader in an instant: in this way it is possible to carry out combined attacks but above all avoid exhausting the characters by managing to pass with the right timing from one character in ~reserve~ to another, creating the ~bond~ between the fighters and thus amplifying the power of the attacks exponentially, while saving the previous leader from the exhausted state. Xbox 360 goals 37 objectives for a total of 1000 Gamerpoints are the loot offered by the developers for Magna Carta II, to tell the truth not many compared to the total points, which consequently determines the presence of rather rich prizes. The objectives are distributed above all on the basis of the progression of the story, which can be reached at the end of certain significant episodes or by concluding a certain number of quests, advancing in experience levels or reaching certain evolutionary goals for the characters. For the player of ruOnly a perfectionist, a doable feat. Still the unreal engine The graphics sector is based on the now well-established Unreal Engine 3, exploited quite properly by Softmax which has managed to model large and rather well-characterized environments to stage the story of the game. Of course, there are not particularly particular scenarios with somewhat standardized representations of villages, forests and plains, but the style of the designer Hyung-Tae Kim intervenes to give a characteristic note, which however tends to get lost a bit in the three-dimensional modeling of the characters, who therefore often fail to distinguish themselves from the classic stereotypes historically present in the genre in question. The cut-scenes present in some narrative phases of the game are very pleasant, but most of the time the story simply advances through dialogues accompanied by simple full-screen representations of the characters, gesturing by default and not very exciting (accompanied by exchanges of jokes that are not always interesting, however). During fights, the camera movements do everything to emphasize the action and make it as dynamic as possible, although in some cases the result is almost excessive, while the special effects that represent the most elaborate and powerful shots are undoubtedly satisfying and pleasant to watch. see. The sound accompaniment plays its part well, with orchestral music and rock digressions in a slightly emo sauce that are always welcome in productions of this kind, as well as melodies with a somewhat oriental-pop taste, also to be taken into account as a stylistic feature in this type of game. The dialogues are dubbed in English for the most significant ones, while the less influential ones for the narrative are text only. The text, on the other hand, is completely in Italian (although, in the tested version, it is mysteriously missing in some parts, but it is probably a problem related to the non-definitive edition granted on trial).", "date": "2009-10-16", "grade": "7.3"}
