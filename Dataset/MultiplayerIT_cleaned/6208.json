{"name": "Fumettisti digitali", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/152928-comic-workshop-2-fumettisti-digitali.html", "text": "Let's immediately clarify a simple concept, namely that Comic Workshop, developed by Collavier, is not a traditional videogame, but a software to develop comics for Nintendo 3DS. It leaves no concession to the classic concept of challenge, the freedom offered to the user is almost total, there are no suggested tests or guides: in all respects it is a tool, a ~program~, to develop cartoons. Before diving into the analysis of the product, however, we can only ask ourselves a question that undoubtedly also tormented the developers of Comic Workshop 2: who could be interested in such software? There are no Art Academy-style classes, no attempts to improve your skills or introduce you to a new world, no mention of storytelling or drawing. No one here explains the difference between a splash page and a six-panel page, the variety of rhythms between placing two horizontal or four vertical panels side by side, the reason why one slows down reading and the other speeds it up; in the same way no information is provided regarding the construction of the figures, no suggestions are given on the shades to be combined. In essence, with Comic Workshop you can create comics, but relying on your previous skills: absurdly it would be the perfect tool for any cartoonist who wanted to create, and have their works read on Nintendo 3DS. But why would anyone want such a thing? The pages are - obviously - not at a resolution high enough to print. Knowing this, you were still interested, now let's talk about the ~game~. If you want to make comics on Nintendo 3DS, Comic Workshop is a great buy. But why would you want to? Brushes, cartoons, colours As you may have guessed from the previous paragraph, the alternatives proposed by Comic Workshop are not numerous, on the contrary, they are even essential. In addition to the main mode, which we will discuss shortly, there is the possibility of choosing between the left and right hand (an obvious but basic option), whether to use English or French, and finally the tutorial: that's it, nothing other. Putting two and two together, also in this case you should have understood an obvious problem for Italian users: the software is not easy to manage, especially if you are inexperienced in the graphics field, and the tutorial in this sense is vital. The ~lessons~ are well structured and have a prominent visual component, however the text is a lot and reading remains essential: should you have problems with English or French, well, you would hardly be able to understand what the CPU is trying to communicate to you. Once this obstacle has been overcome, we reiterate that the tutorial, divided into about thirty lessons (available in no particular order), is complete: perhaps overly pedantic, but well done. And, overall, it will take you at most two hours, an acceptable time to get familiar with the tools. Had you missed it or might seem to go against the trend with what was said before, we remind you that the tutorial, however considerable, is limited to the use of the software proposed by Comic Workshop: no suggestions on the composition of the page, on the combination of the cartoons and so on. The main differences between this software and a traditional graphics program, in addition to the limited resources, reside in small facilities inserted in a comics perspective: the table frame to be selected from a rich set of models, balloons that can be expanded and rotated in a few seconds, onomatopoeias and image patterns to insert at will. In general there is a notable and atypical focus on everything that precedes and follows the actual design phase. Talent to share? Excluding the appreciable aids just mentioned, for the rest Comic Workshop is a sort of miniature Photoshop: once you have selected the direction of the page (vertical/horizontal) and set the image resolution, you find yourself (potentially lost) in front of a blank sheet and a ton of tools at the top of the screen. Brushes and pencils in turn customizable in opacity and stroke size, straight lines, circles, pointers to select certain areas. The aforementioned balloons and onomatopoeias, the ready-made kinetic lines, the many colors to choose from (but which do not imitate the real ones in the overlaps). Even five levels per page to use: normal (therefore overwriting each other), with decreasing opacity and even to be put in ~multiply~, an effect often used to adjust shadows. You can also import photos from your SD card gallery, with the understanding, however, that doing so will prevent you from sharing your work on Miiverse; considering that it is the main onediffusion channel of one's work, it cannot be excluded that the option will be exploited by a few people. By listing these characteristics, however, we continue to revolve around the main question, namely that at a certain point you have to roll up your sleeves and, having decided on the screenplay (if it were easy...), start drawing: from this point of view, despite the many efforts and the tools inserted (zoom in/out) Comic Workshop 2 proves to be a rudimentary software. Also - certainly - because of the Nintendo touch screen, which, however, can only be partially blamed: the medium is not suitable for the work, but it is the latter that should have adapted to the first and not vice versa (obviously). Drawing with this ~game~ is difficult and very demanding, and even if you were talented, it is not easy to become familiar with the commands. Let's go back to the starting question, which is anything but secondary: who might be interested in such software? 3D is not contemplated, and in our opinion the only ones capable of creating pleasing works with this program could be professionals, or in any case talented designers; but why would they be interested in doing so, considering that the pages cannot be printed? Why shouldn't they rely on the usual tools, paper, scanner or Wacom tablet? The answer is obvious, and unfortunately it is not in favor of the Collavier title.", "date": "2015-07-10", "grade": "5.5"}
