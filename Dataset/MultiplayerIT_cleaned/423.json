{"name": "Winx Club", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/winx-club.html", "text": "The game Supported by a series of animated sequences, Winx Club follows the events told in the cartoon from which it is based quite faithfully, so as to interrupt the game action quite often (and in an annoying way), especially at the beginning, to make room to the ~narrative~ elements. Immediately after the meeting with Stella and the trolls who attack her, we move on to what will be the main location, or the school of magic. From there it is possible to access numerous ~missions~ of various types, which at a certain point lead Bloom to fight monsters of all kinds using his own powers. The location of the school, really huge and divided into many sections, turns out to be an inexhaustible mine of ~bonuses~ and secrets, a place where it is possible to collect various power-ups (in particular to increase vital energy) as well as the ~stars~ which are used as a currency to buy various things. The various challenges to be completed, which mainly concern the discovery of particular objects, wink at the ~customization seen by women~. A practical example: by accessing the game menu, it is possible, among other things, to choose the dress for Bloom to wear among those purchased or conquered up to that moment. Technical considerations The control system of Winx Club, related to the screen, reveals its weaknesses when the management of the view fails (and it doesn't happen infrequently). The problem is deeply felt during the fights: Bloom can ~hook~ an enemy and go around him to hit him from a distance and avoid his attacks, but having to adjust his view often makes the whole procedure ~cumbersome~. Otherwise, the character controls without problems and responds promptly to the joypad. The graphic design of the game is made up of ups and downs. The frame rate is rather dancer, a symptom of a lack of optimization, and alternates very fluid movements of the objects with conspicuous slowdowns. The rooms of the school show an average level of detail and are poor in terms of textures, however in some cases they boast the presence of interesting reflections (from the ~mirror polished floors~ series...). The characters do not have a large number of animations nor shine for the design, although they are very faithful to the cartoon. The sound sector sees the presence of the original music of the series, complete with songs in English (a pity: honestly the theme songs of the Italian version are not bad ...), and a speech in Italian that is sometimes good and sometimes less good, mixed a bit bad with the other effects (thankfully you can fix it in the options). It's no rain: Konami has certainly not entrusted the development of Winx Club to one of its best teams, and it shows. The game has the merit of faithfully reproducing what the TV series offers, both aesthetically and practically, denouncing the lack of a strong idea that could make everything more engaging and less monotonous. The fights, practically the only element capable of enlivening the action between the search for a pair of scissors or a star, are distributed sparingly and are characterized by excessive repetitiveness. In short, while discreet on a technical level, Winx Club does not differ from the average of products of its kind: mere merchandising, produced without too much attention to achieve the sole objective of attracting fans of the series. Pros: Faithful to the cartoon Some good graphic solutions Spoken in Italian Cons: Repetitive and boring Poorly managed visual Only for cartoon lovers Cross-platform Winx Club is also available for Personal Computers, where it can obviously enjoy a decidedly higher resolution, and better definition as regards textures and effects. Otherwise the two versions are identical. The merchandising machine doesn't stop, and so does Winx Club, one of the best Italian expressions in terms of animation, enjoys a PlayStation 2 transposition by Konami (no less). The game is based on the first ~season~ of the show: the young Bloom comes across a fight between fairies and ogres, discovering that she possesses magical powers. So she is invited by Stella, the fairy she helped, to attend a school for fairies which is located in a magical kingdom", "date": "2006-06-29", "grade": null}
