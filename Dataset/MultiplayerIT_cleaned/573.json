{"name": "Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viewtiful-joe-red-hot-rumble_a.html", "text": "So long and thanks for all the chips The pretext for this sort of royal rumble comes from Captain Blue, who tired and debilitated from a life as a superhero decides that the time has come to retire. However, the spry old man in a blue suit decides not to sit idle, and to embark on a career as a director to make a film about fellow superheroes. The problem lies in choosing the person who will have to fill the position of main actor, the prima donna among superheroes; Sprocket thus advises Captain Blue to hold auditions to be able to find the hero capable of replacing him. The main mode of RHR (Red Hot Rumble, from now on) is also based on this introduction: in the story mode the player will be tested in different stages (or scripts, to be precise) to be overcome by completing the proposed missions at the beginning of the battle. Each script will consist of four missions (or chapters) divided into a battle of two or more rounds. Each of these rounds will offer the player various missions such as: collect more gems than your opponents, don't get killed more than twice, don't fall off the stage, defeat more enemies or recover a flag and be able to protect it until time runs out. While the first three chapters of the script will test one's skills on specific missions, the last chapter is always reserved for the clash with the boss on duty where to win it will be necessary to score more hits than the opponents, and possibly also reserve the final blow that will give the player a bonus of points at the end of the game. Even though each script is divided into chapters, it is structured like a real story, there is no gap between one chapter and another, the action is unique like in a great cinematic action scene: in some stages it will happen that you start fighting above the roofs of some buildings, to then jump at the end of the chapter on the wings of an airplane for another set of missions and conclude your adventure on the streets of a city. The interludes between one chapter and another are well studied to give the player a credible sense of continuity to the film being shot, obviously always remaining in the logic of a game like VJ, i.e. explosions, infinite jumps and incredible acrobatics. The classic multiplayer is added to the story mode, however spoiled by a convoluted structure in terms of gameplay: playing in multiplayer in fact means nothing more than resuming one of the chapters already played and testing yourself against your friends, with the forcing of having to follow for force the missions assigned at the beginning of the stage in order to achieve the final victory. The result is in fact a truncated copying of Smash Bros Melee, where in order to differentiate the final product, a substantially useless, limited and unfortunately very little fun mode has been created. Machspeeeed! The battles are structured in all respects like a Viewtiful Joe stage, with the only difference related to the movement limitation: the settings follow the logic of a canonical fighting game, the combat is not 'spread' along a typical level of VJ but only in one particular area. The aim of the game is, as previously mentioned, to complete the missions assigned by the director and to do so the usable characters (12 and drawn from the whole saga both on the side of the heroes and on that of the enemies) will have a whole series of collectible items that can be used during battle. These items are a direct transposition of those already used and abused in the course of the series: it will be possible to slow down time to give the possibility to one's own character to hit objects that spin too fast or simply to deliver a few blows to the opponent in complete calm, send at mach speed the virtual counterpart and thus increase the number of strokes per second, use the zoom to become giant and finally use the sound effects to hit the opponents (these sound effects work like real onomatopoeias that the more loaded they will be the more they will physically hurt when they fall on the enemies heads). However, the real joker of battles is represented by the item depicting the 'V' of Viewtiful, this object in fact allows - if used conscientiously - to overturn the fate of a game that started badly in a few moments. This particular item teleports all the participants in the battle to a parallel stage where a mini-game capable of removing all the energy and all the money from those who will be defeated will take place, totally changing the ranking in the race. The mini-games proposed for this particular moment are five: in the first one you will have to crush the fastestse possible all the buttons from the pad to fill a bar and thus release a killing blow, the second will test the reflexes of the players with a series of indications of buttons to press as quickly as possible, the third - in a very similar way to the first - play on the frenzy and to win it will be necessary to rotate both the analog stick and the C stick, the fourth is based on timing with a bar that fills up and a key to be pressed at the precise moment of maximum intensity, the fifth and last is prefigured like a sort of beating dribble of a poor enemy, where the first player who misses the 'response' time will lose. The main problem to overcome in the game, unfortunately remains the excessive chaos during the battles, given the proliferation of movement during the round it will happen to be hit by unseen objects, to lose one's character in the midst of smoke, enemies and chromatically too similar. The game is flamboyant, animated and funny but all this does not make the gaming experience increasingly difficult, sometimes too disturbed by useless elements and which most of the time resolves itself in furious rambling tapping, in the hope of overturning the result thanks to a stroke of luck (and from this point of view the other possibility should also be underlined: winning all the rounds and losing everything for a stupid mistake. Frustrating.) Machspeeeed! Graphically, as already mentioned, the game is a riot of visual effects, colors and fluidity, and does not suffer any slowdowns even in the most excited phases of the action (and this time when we mean excited, we mean *really* excited). The sound remains slightly subdued but remains in line with the whole series, it must however be said that VJ is one of the few games in the world where sound effects matter more than music. cut! cut! cut! Vietiful Joe Red Hot Rumble is a barely sufficient attempt to emulate Smash Bros Melee and unfortunately little more: the basic idea with the inclusion of missions and scripts is good, but too distorted and too little cared for compared to the game created. In the long run the missions become frustrating and very confusing. A praise to the engine of the game, surprising as usual, and that moves all the good things. The neo linked to multiplayer remains above all, too tied to the mechanics of the game and little to those of the royal rumble or the fighting game. Pros: Always beautiful graphics Scripts and environments are well done Cons: Confusing Frustrating Multiplayer unplayable It was the year 2003 when for the first time Joe appeared on the gamecube, a strange character created in cel shading who roamed in a world halfway between comics and Hollywood productions, and asked to be called 'Viewtiful'. Viewtiful Joe -this is the title of the game- had, among the owners of the Nintendo home console, a good success thanks above all to the remarkable graphic creation, a strong ironic component and a particular vision of the theme of the 'supereoe' divided between the stylistic features of American and Japanese comics. Success (or presumed success) is known to be a bad thing, or rather a difficult situation to manage and so Capcom, after having released the sequel just a year ago without infamy and without praise from VJ, decided to give a last boost to the brand before dedicating himself soul and bit to the next-gen consoles. And so Viewtiful Joe appears on store shelves: Red hot rumble, a spin-off of the official saga that takes the form of a fighting game a la Smash Bros Melee without forgetting the basis of the series: action!", "date": "2006-03-22", "grade": null}
