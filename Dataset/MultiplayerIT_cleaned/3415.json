{"name": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-recensione.html", "text": "Writing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare review is a difficult and complicated task. Not that expressing an opinion on the previous chapters was something light and of little consequence, but this year it is undoubtedly more so. Infinity Ward's new 2019 project brings with it a series of expectations that only the most experienced developers can sustain. It comes at a time when the Call of Duty franchise is, to put it mildly, not at its peak and above all it must live up to the progenitor of the series which was something unique and to all intents and purposes seminal. Without forgetting that it is in the awkward position of having, in some ways, to chase Fortnite in the shooter race of the moment. This reboot, or rather this new beginning therefore has the task of drawing a line, of clearly separating what Call of Duty has been and what will be. A titanic undertaking for a bet won almost easily, but not without some missteps, which we will obviously talk about later. A memorable campaign The game offer of the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is as usual very wide: ~classic~ multiplayer, multiplayer with means (!!), Survival & Spec Ops cooperative and obviously the Campaign. The Campaign, whatever some personalities say about it on the net, has always been the calling card of the game. And it couldn't be otherwise if your name is Modern Warfare. Without too many words, let's say immediately that for long stretches the campaign missions set up by the developers are exceptional and when they are not, as unfortunately for the ending, they are simply good. There are therefore no dead moments or empty passages, the average quality is really high. We certainly can't complain about the variety either. We're entering the spoiler zone, so we won't go into details, but we can undoubtedly say that stealth has been declined in a truly original way: in some phases we will find ourselves faced with small environmental puzzles, without forgetting the exciting (perhaps a thread too long) sniper mission where we are asked to calculate the trajectory of bullets from a very great distance. And when it comes to taking inspiration from the movies, the Infinity Ward guys did it with great class, choosing the best of the most recent productions to stage memorable missions that have nothing to envy to the legendary All Ghillied Up, One Shot , One Kill and The Bog from 2007 Modern Warfare. The operation is similar to the one done by the first Call of Duty, those set in the Second World War that fished with both hands not only from Saving Private Ryan but also from Il Enemy At the Gates and Band of Brothers. Today's main and most evident references are Homeland for the general espionage tone, Zero Dark Thirty by Kathryn Bigelow, that little-known masterpiece by Michael Bay which corresponds to the name of 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi and to make sure we don't miss anything there it's also a sprinkle of Black Hawk Down. The setting of the new Call of Duty is the Middle East: if in the first Modern Warfare the invasion of Iraq echoed, now the story written by the guys from Infinity Ward takes us to Syria, or rather to the fictitious state of Urzikstan. The developers promised us a raw and visceral story and we got it. Urzikstan is overwhelmed by twenty years of civil war (did someone say Afghanistan?) and as with today's Syria there are a lot of players at play, each with its own agenda. There are moderate rebels, partisans modeled on the Kurds who are fighting to free the country from the tyranny of the Russians, there are terrorists with a gray eminence and even foreign fighters and suicide bombers. There are chemical weapons, the white helmets and then there are the Americans and the British who would love to do so but who often have their hands tied by the realpolitik practiced in Washington or London. Here, if we really wanted to find a flaw in this modern fresco, it would be that there is a bit of everything and, obviously, talking about everything is often done in a big way, mixing Syria and Afghanistan with impunity, outlining situations and events in a superficial way, however extremely functional for the staging of battlefields, as previously written, exceptional. Modern Warfare starts as a very tight and serious story of special operations missions and ends with the more classic few against all ~Team America~ style, which betrays a bit the political spirit with which the story began. In between, however, there are a couple of well-placed twists, there is a story of characters and personal events that work, an exciting and dramatic flashback and more generally great attention to making sure that there is no division manichean between good and bad. Understanding that the Russians are meaner than when they were the quintessential villains during the cold war. There are also moments in which moral choices are faced, difficult decisions that make the difference between life and death and very crude situations similar to the infamous No Russian mission. But how long does the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Campaign last? Which missions are more successful? Excellent Campaign but short-lived: we are (played on normal difficulty) between five and six hours of play. A bit small even by the standards of the franchise. Undoubtedly among the best missions is the one in which we break into the terrorists' hideout with the visors, where we are asked to clean up a small house floor by floor, paying attention to what we hear to understand if there are threats behind each door . Really creepy. The long and articulated outing to the embassy is then one of the strengths not only of the game but also of the whole series. But we cannot fail to mention the two sides of the coin of terrorism, the one that shocks London and the one that annihilates an entire town in Urzikstan with gas. Even the very first stages, graced by a clever play of so much darkness and few lights, is memorable: more generally, when you go back to beating situations already seen in the original Modern Warfare, you do it big. Emblematic is the Going Dark infiltration mission which expands and complicates the old Safe House in terms of construction of the environments, making everything much more intriguing to play. Bonus: weapon customization We know everything about the multiplayer sector, we have written about it several times both on the occasion of the multiplayer reveal at the end of July and with the arrival of the long and full-bodied September beta which we hope you have been able to play. We have spent rivers of digital ink on Gunsmith, the Gunsmith, the new weapon customization system for which we will now limit ourselves to describing it in brief without boring you with a long wall of text. You simply need to know that everything you mount on your weapon will have a significant impact on the way it behaves, returning tangible sensations capable of significantly distorting its use. In the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare the choice of a certain type of optics, a more or less long barrel, a particular muzzle brake or a more ergonomic stock gives the weapon a peculiar behavior that makes the difference once in match. Just one example is enough: a long barrel will cut the recoil and give us the possibility of using larger caliber bullets, thus capable of maximizing damage. However, at the price of a longer time for precision aiming and lower movement speed. And this is obviously only one possibility, given that we are talking about a minimum of thirty accessories for pistols and a maximum of sixty for rifles, including optics, barrels, lasers, grenade launchers of various types, stocks, magazines and much more. All within a specialized progression for each gun complete with dedicated weapon perks. Each accessory therefore brings with it a series of bonuses and maluses that change the behavior of the weapon and of the player himself in terms of aiming speed, or when from running, sliding or simple ~instinctive~ fire you pass to that of precision. It goes without saying that with such modifiers it is possible to create, in a phase that recalls a real racing game setup, a tailor-made weapon not only for one's style of play, but also for the map where we are going to play. Said like this, it doesn't seem like something not particularly new, but we assure you that never as in this edition is the customization of weapons the keystone of the gaming experience, a real ~metagame~ capable of giving new life to consolidated mechanics and consequently lengthen the game time by messing with weapons and accessories in search of the ~perfect build~. The return of the minimap On the occasion of the two previous meetings with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Infinity Ward had removed the minimap, unleashing the ire of the more traditionalist users. A courageous choice which, however, had generated a good number of campers despite an excellent positional audio like never before and the continuous use of the personal UAV after only two kills. We have therefore returned to the status quo, and it is a bit of a pity given that this radical choice (despite the presence of the compass) would have called into question old habits, paving the way for a new way, some would say more realistic, of playing above all in competitive field. Multiplayer mode: the new content Speaking more strictly of content, in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare it jumps right awayeye the presence of new multiplayer modes. As a further sign of the desire to go beyond the usual Call of Duty, Infinity Ward has thought of two new types of game as its main course which are the exact opposite of each other: Gunfight and Ground War. Gunfight is a very tight two against two in small symmetrical maps where you change your weapon every round, while Ground War reaches up to sixty-four players in huge settings with lots of vehicles such as helicopters, tanks equipped with cannons and quads, which you get whenever you conquer a base. If you are thinking about Battlefield we are right there, but obviously without Levolution. Of Gunfight we can simply say that it is perfect for competitive use linked to e-sports. The maps are small, but by no means trivial, just see Hill set in a wooded hill full of places to hide or Speedball, where you move with extreme circumspection between concrete barriers as if we were inside a paintball field. We had had a hint of Ground War in the past with the twenty-against-wind map of Aniyah Palace and to be honest it hadn't driven us crazy, which instead happened with the amazing Karst River Quarry and Tavorsk District. Karst River Quarry is a mining industrial complex located near a quarry, therefore not flat, where clashes take place between sheds, containers, towers and various buildings, perfect funnels for infantry and at the same time tailor-made ~killing boxes~ the means. It is pleonastic to remember how numerous defilations, escape routes and secondary passages are, as are the accesses to the elevated areas, a favorite ambush ground for snipers. Tavorsk District works in the same way we could say simplifying, only that now we find ourselves in the city with entire buildings to explore, such as the museum, and very tall buildings to climb to have clean lines of fire on the whole map. If you're thinking about some Battlefield urban maps you're not wrong. Ground War is therefore the most different from Call of Duty the series has offered so far (obviously setting aside double jumps and glitchy robots) and offers us something new while remaining extremely familiar. We liked the Ground War mode, it works and is fun, but it is impossible to say if it will replace the classic Deatmatch, Dominion and so on in the hearts of fans. At the same time, however, it is undeniable not to think that it is a method set up to take advantage of the lack of the competitor DICE. The Cyberattack objective super tactic is conceptually similar to Search & Destroy without re-entry, where it is however possible to bring your teammates back to life. On paper it has been well thought out, but it is not particularly intriguing, it will hardly be the queen of rotations. The same thing goes for the realism mode, which removes any interface on the screen. On the other hand, the nocturnal deathmatches where wearing the viewer the laser beam of the pointer is visible: we move easily and we aim better, but at the same time we make our position known to all those who in turn wear the viewer even when not there is direct eye contact. Bonuses and maluses here too. Unfortunately, not all maps are played at night, only four out of the twenty-one total, but it is as if the matches took place in brand new battlefields, the dynamics of the firefights are so different. Where there's little to complain about is the overall quality of the map design. Whoever writes about this new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has loved Euphrates Bridge madly. Imagine an iron bridge that divides a gigantic dry river bed in two, where on one side, the flat one, there are a series of small houses, tall grass and various debris and on the other a small hill that leads to a residential area half destroyed. Imagine then that this bridge becomes in the blink of an eye the contested area of excellence, heralding, for the best, a series of killings that trigger cruise missiles, carpet bombing, white phosphorus and the deadly and legendary ~BRRRRR~ of the A-10 that will literally give you goosebumps. Impossible not to mention, always among the largest maps Arklov Peak, with a typically rectangular shape, set in a steep mountain village in the Caucasus, a maze of houses and cottages complete with an Orthodox church that overlooks the center of the battlefield or the wonderful, complex and hyper-layered Rammaza, one of the most successful urban maps ever. But certainly those already seen such as Gun Runner, Azhir Cave or Grazna Raid are always of a high level, never trivial and tactically full of ideas. Maybe they just can't stand out", "date": "2019-10-25", "grade": "9.0"}
