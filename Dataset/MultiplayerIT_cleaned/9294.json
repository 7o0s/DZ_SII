Being able to propose a tower defense that is still attractive, and original enough not to be overshadowed by the strong competition, has thus become extremely difficult, although it does not seem to have held back the developers of Magic Dream Games, who with their Monster Trouble wanted give a new and interesting title to fans of the genre. Will elaborate polygonal graphics and some small variations in the game mechanics be enough to make us forget about seed-shooting plants and disco zombies for a while? Tower defense or RTS? First of all it should be noted that Monster Trouble, although it has received an excellent adaptation in its recent landing on the iPhone, was conceived and created from the outset to be enjoyed on the iPad, and it is on the larger screen of the Apple tablet that the tower defense of Magic Dream Games gives its best. Set in a not overly inspired fantasy world, the title sees the player grappling with hordes of goblins, orcs and other dangerous monsters intent on annihilating his village. Predictably, waves of enemies must be eliminated one after the other, placing along the way a series of defensive structures capable of weakening the opposing forces and channel them within a strategic path. In short, nothing particularly new, except that the game borrows a whole series of characteristics typical of RTS, thus enriching the experience and offering a more dynamic and complex challenge than that of a classic tower defense. Having abandoned the grid structure that unites all the exponents of the genre, Monster Trouble allows the player to arrange the structures anywhere on the map, creating less obvious and more interesting paths: however the same also applies to enemies, who Rather than following obvious single-file paths, they are able to move more unpredictably when challenged. While this peculiarity makes the game more interesting, it is also one of the causes of its steep difficulty curve, and although the recent application update has patched up the most serious balancing problems, don't expect to see the end of the adventure without breaking a sweat. Another difference with traditional tower defenses concerns the need, in addition to building defensive towers, to populate them with particular units: both the fortifications and the small soldiers who inhabit them have different characteristics, and it will be up to the player to decide whether to bet everything on the number or on the robustness of its defenses, while building small wells allows you to accumulate water necessary to extinguish any fires set by enemies. Thumbs up for the originality of the game units, which between fire eaters, hunters, gypsies and fierce old ladies give a pinch of color and liveliness to each level. Furthermore, having walls of different types and shapes gives the possibility to create precise paths in which to divert the enemy horde, offering the game an uncommon strategic depth in its genre. The high point of the title, however, is not its subtle originality in the gameplay, but rather the excellent audiovisual realization. With dynamic shadows and excellent particle effects, the graphics engine built in-house by the development team makes Monster Trouble one of the most visually intriguing tower defense games on the App Store. Similarly, the songs that make up the soundtrack of the game, the work of the young Italian duo of 93 Steps, are so catchy that you will find yourself whistling them after just a couple of games. Yet, as already mentioned, on iPhone and iPod Touch the game is penalized by the small size of the screen: after trying both the iPad and smartphone versions, you immediately notice how much more convenient it is to select units and arrange towers on the tablet, and obviously how much better you can appreciate the great graphics of the game.
