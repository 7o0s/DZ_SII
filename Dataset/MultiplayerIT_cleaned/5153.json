(known on the App Store under the name Super Cat Tales) the proverbial charm of felines with a playful system that seems to come straight from the 16-bit era. So let's see if this potentially explosive mix between the charm of cats and the nostalgia factor translates into a mobile game worthy of being downloaded. Super Cat Bros. is not only cute and cuddly, it also has well-structured gameplay Kitty friends That the main source of inspiration for Neutronized was that immortal masterpiece of Super Mario World can be understood from the very first bars of the game, when a world map appears on the screen very similar to the one cleared by Nintendo with the titles dedicated to the Italian plumber. In Super Cat Bros. we therefore proceed in a linear way by completing the levels in succession, in the context of a two-dimensional platform that pays homage to the great classics but without forgetting to put a touch of personality on the plate and above all a series of useful elements to make it perfectly in line with today's mobile standards. To begin with, the stages are short enough to allow even very quick games, while the control system makes use of simple touches to be made on the ends of the display: with a tap, the kitten moves in the desired direction and climbs the walls, while double-tapping activates the run that also allows automatic jumping. Everything works very well, with some extra action that you learn along the way but that doesn't complicate things too much: of course, the feeling of having a joypad in your hand is light years away (especially when a certain precision in the movements is required) , but Super Cat Bros. can be played without too much nostalgia for the physical medium. In terms of content, the title offers over 50 levels characterized by a rather substantial replayability factor, primarily due to the presence of a good number of secrets and collectibles that force the user intending to reach 100% completion to go back to their own pass later. In support of this practice there is also the presence of six protagonist kittens, to be unlocked along the adventure and who are all equipped with particular abilities that allow them to reach otherwise inaccessible places. In the list of tasks that Super Cat Bros. performs properly, there is also room for a decidedly valuable technical component: the pixel art graphics are delightful and will surely win over the hearts of nostalgics, while the sound makes use of effects and music that would disfigured in a Super Nintendo platformer. However, you don't live only on memories, and the developers of Neutronized were smart enough to best interpret the free to play formula that so many discontents often arouse in the mobile sphere: the game therefore makes a decidedly prudent use of in-app purchases - which in the vast majority of cases they are completely accessories - preferring the support of advertisements that are not too invasive. There are some inevitable bottlenecks (such as lives, after which you are forced to pay a small duty or wait for them to recharge themselves) but still remaining in a context of absolute acceptability that makes Super Cat Bros. easily usable even by those who have no intention of spending a penny on it. For all those who were conquered by the Neutronized title, then, there is also room for a certain element of challenge which compensates for the relative ease of the main campaign, and which translates into the search for the best performances to then be compared with other users in the appropriate rankings online.", "date": "2016-11-24", "grade": "8.0"}
