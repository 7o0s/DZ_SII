{"name": "Brain Juice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brain-juice_a.html", "text": "The gist of the speech Brain Juice broadly follows the path traced by Nintendo, offering a product consisting of 12 mini-games that can be progressively unlocked as you improve by following a daily workout. In fact, the game expects the user to undergo a test to evaluate his progress after each game session, so that new tests can be made available in the event of a positive outcome. Unlike Brain Training, however, the title Digital Chocolate uses electricity to define the capabilities of the brain and some images of animals to inform the player about his speed in completing a minigame. Minigames that are divided into three categories: math, visualization and memory. Some are very similar to those proposed by the Nintendo title, such as those that require you to perform simple mathematical operations in the mind in the shortest possible time or those in which you have to identify a certain type of figure within a set. However, others are quite original and decidedly convincing and do not struggle to stand out for their quality and fun factor. First we find a game in which you have to reconstruct the path of a line on a grid after observing a brief example; then a test that requires the completion of some mathematical formulas by inserting the correct operation sign must be indicated; finally, a minigame deserves a last mention where you see figures of men, women and children entering and exiting an elevator and in which you have to identify the final number of each type of person. However, each individual session is defined by a time limit (visible via an indicator at the top of the screen) which is reloaded following a series of correct answers. Like any self-respecting product of the genre, Brain Juice also offers its beautiful section dedicated to every possible graph or statistic regarding the player's progress, which can be viewed both in general terms and on the merits of each individual minigame. All framed by a cosmetics obviously more functional than elaborate, but still pleasant: the soft shades of the colors and the presence of a nice light bulb-shaped tutor accompany the user in his training path without smudging or particular defects. The sound, on the other hand, is justified: the few music and the minimalist effects go absolutely hand in hand with the spirit of the product. PRO * Good selection of minigames * Clean and functional graphics * Lots of graphs and statistics AGAINST * Very similar to Brain Training * In the long run repetitive", "date": "2007-01-28", "grade": "S.V."}
