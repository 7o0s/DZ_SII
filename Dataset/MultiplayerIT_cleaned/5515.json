The Japanese team has found its own specific formula that acts as a backbone for each of its productions and has decided to apply it to different scenarios and fields, incredibly managing to be almost always appropriate, creating titles that, although clearly derivative, are ultimately also enjoyable by who has played other titles of the same label with a substantially identical structure. The Story series, in particular, is the one that remains closest to the typical canvas: it is a question of carrying out some activity by examining various more or less in-depth aspects, from the construction of structures to the recruitment and training of collaborators and employees up to the marketing and research management, depending on the various areas to which the games refer. The paradigm of the series probably remains Game Dev Story, perhaps even the best known internationally, but this Pocket League Story 2 truly represents one of the best applications of the Kairosoft formula seen so far, at least as regards the more classic meaning of this, while some more recent titles (such as High Sea Saga) begin to present aspects that are more divergent from the old road. Undoubtedly, the popularity of the subject dealt with must also be considered, with the fascination of football management that always remains indestructible, but the set of elements, including the possibility of construction and internal micro-management of the various aspects of the sports club, result here particularly well matched and amalgamated. There is however a problem: it is not easy to distinguish which are the new elements inserted that justify the number ~2~ next to the title and the idea is that this is more a sort of updated and free-to-play version of the first chapter than a real sequel. Let's run a sports club in the palm of your hand with Pocket League Story 2 The art of winning As in every Kairosoft title, even in this one we have to start from the bottom to build our empire, in this case football, with the construction of the structures (football field, gym, stadium and so on), the recruitment of players, the management of team between training and specialization of the various players and the management of the economic aspects between contracts, sponsors, sale of merchandise and more. The aim is to set up a team that is able to compete with the great international champions, starting from a simple group of neighborhood drifters with a passion for football. We are not dealing with a real football manager, therefore we cannot expect the depth and quantity of parameters to be taken into consideration typical of specialist titles such as Football Manager or other similar titles (mainly European in origin). Pocket League Story 2 is a game of a different kind, built with a different mindset and sensibility, perfectly tailored for the mobile gaming experience and able to suit any type of player, not just the football super fan. For this reason, more than the depth in the micro-management of the various single managerial aspects, to tell the truth here reduced to the bare bones and focused on a rather simple progressive mechanics, what matters is the variety of elements to take into consideration and the different scale of these, leading us simultaneously to follow the construction of plants, the contract of the players, the sale of shirts and the like and the training of individual players, with the possibility of developing special skills through the use of power-ups. The result of our hard work then translates into the behavior of the team on the pitch during matches, which we mostly watch passively by activating the players' ~aura~ at the right moments. Compared to the first chapter, this sequel introduces some additional variables such as variable weather conditions and various types of field, elements that affect the performance of the players and for which specific training sessions must be developed, as well as various additional marginal elements. Probably the most significant addition is the ability to play against teams created by other users in a kind of asymmetrical multiplayer. For the rest, the new free-to-play structure also introduces some ~pay-to-win~ style aspects with the possibility of buying coins to cut waiting times and achieve better results faster, even if the insistence on this element is not excessive and does not spoil the overall gaming experience. Also note the possibility of eliminating advertising and unlocking extended viewing with an ssimple purchase from 3.99 euros, according to the classic solution also proposed by other Kairosoft titles.", "date": "2016-05-10", "grade": "7.7"}
