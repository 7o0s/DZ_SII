In the same way, there are titles that would have benefited from a leaner and faster approach and which instead get wrapped up in useless lengths. The truth, as usual, lies in the middle and Com2uS seems to have interpreted it well with its latest arcade basketball for iOS and Android devices. Characterized by the usual freemium format, the game literally delivers its contents to us in the palm of the hand, with two different options (three, also considering the automatisms) that will satisfy everyone a little. What intrigues you? Then read on for the NBA Now 22 review. Mode NBA Now 22, a sequence of gameplay with traditional controls We were talking about contents, which in fact are not lacking in NBA Now 22: the main screen, to be viewed strictly in portrait style like the whole game, allows you to access the full-bodied League Mode, which constitutes the core of the experience, but also outline such as the nice Arcade Mode based on free throws, the Battle Mode for automatic asynchronous challenges, the inevitable achievements and team management.

In this case it is possible to move the selected player and carry out the various maneuvers by performing gestures on the screen, in a rather intuitive way. Where you want a little more thickness, however, a touch is enough to switch to a more classic layout, with virtual stick and buttons for shooting, passing and tackling, all quite precise and responsive. As mentioned, there is also an option to make everything automatic and limit yourself to observing a scheme of the match, in a managerial style, with the possibility of speeding up the action to be quicker. Graphics and sound The portrait view of NBA Now 22 performs surprisingly well, enhancing the excellent graphics of the game and making three different cameras available if we don't like the default one. The polygonal models of the athletes and their animations seemed excellent to us, thanks also to an engine that maintains a fixed 60 fps with the highest quality on the iPhone 12 Pro. crowding of the starting interface, which has to put together a large number of elements to meet the requirements of a well-established freemium model, for better or for worse.
