The wait was long and it took months of public beta, but now everyone can register and start playing right away. In fact, Card Hunter is free to play and you just need to open your browser with updated Flash to run it. For the more adventurous, it is possible to purchase the Basic Edition for 25 dollars, which contains many interesting extras at an advantageous price. The earning method set by the developers is very honest and nothing that is for sale is necessary. We will return to this point later, because first we need to understand how Card Hunter works, which - let's clear up any doubts - is fantastic in more than one respect. The base is a fantasy miniatures game inspired by the world of Dungeons & Dragons. Our group of heroes is made up of three adventurers to be trained by choosing from the three available chests, warrior, wizard and cleric, and the three basic races, elf, human and dwarf. Nothing prevents you from creating a group with three wizards, but it is better to master the basics of the game first. If it is intuitive to imagine how classes behave, it is still worth spending a few words on races. Elves have extraordinary movement skills, dwarves are die-hard, and humans fall in the middle, a bit like clerics, who fight and heal. Our task is to complete adventures divided into sub-levels, at the end of which we receive loot from a treasure chest. Loot can be in the form of goods to be sold for gold or pieces of equipment for characters. Each weapon or garment has an associated set of cards that vary with the item's power. This means that after having dressed and armed one of our heroes, we will have composed his deck of cards as well. In fact, every turn all the pawns in play, whether they are allies or enemies, receive a hand of cards chosen at random from their reserve. Enemy movement cards are always visible, while others are not. You got it right: in Card Hunter you need to play a movement card to move a pawn, and this is one of the most intriguing and original aspects of the game, with ample strategic possibilities. Having an iron dwarf that can't corner a fast wizard can be fatal, because the enemy will be pelting you with lightning and spells at long range. On the other hand, a fast elf will always be in the right place to provide support skills, but at the first beating of a troll he will find himself dying. If we add all the complications that we will see in the next paragraph, the situation quickly becomes tangled. Returning to the turn of the game, when both players pass, the next turn proceeds, and whoever has more than three cards discards the excess ones. Passing or not is also a strategic choice. The first of the two to fold will also be the first to start the round. A major plus. If it seems complicated to you, we reassure you: the learning curve is very sweet and with your time you will undoubtedly become experts of the game too. Well: let the hunt begin! Card Hunter is a brilliant mix of a board and card game, with the added charm of old D&D Studied at the table The single player campaign is the heart of Card Hunter and will keep you busy for months, assuming you play hard every day. The frame that gives a minimum of context to the action is that of a game of Dungeons & Dragons played with pencil and paper around a table. The pawns are thus characters of an imaginary group of players and the storyteller forms adventures. This is the only one who will intervene before each adventure with witty and amusing comments. His name is Gary and he is learning the storytelling trade from his older brother Marvin. There is also a mini romance storyline between Gary and the pizza girl. These are very pleasant side elements but which in themselves cannot generate sufficient interest to continue. If you decide to fight, and Card Hunter is so addictive that we're sure you will, it will only be for the loot and to challenge new and powerful enemies. The game maps are small portions of squared paper with a drawn background, arranged on an imaginary wooden table. Around you will see twenty dice, chips, gum and details about the life of Gary and his brother. What matters however is what happens on the map. Here we will battle all kinds of enemies, according to a logic established by the module. We may find ourselves tracking down a necromancer in an undead infested city, or hunting down a terrible golem in golden armor that defendsnde a rich booty. The combinations are always challenging and offer a different strategic challenge every time. Geomancers, for example, are very fragile, but they cast the levitation spell on themselves and then rain stones on the ground that hurt and slow us down, or they open chasms of fire and acid under our feet, so that we are dead before we even smelled it. their fetid tunic. Then there are pawns that occupy more boxes, including the terrifying dragons. In short, as for enemies there is no boredom. However, the terrain also offers its challenges: some tiles slow us down, others block the passage but not the view, while the walls defend us from all attacks. Also there are levels in which to win it is necessary to check certain squares a sufficient number of turns. If we went on to list everything, there wouldn't be space left to say anything else. In the face of so many pitfalls it is necessary to play cunning, because often even a module of a lower level than ours remains difficult to overcome. In fact, each challenge requires a targeted strategic approach. Starting from the tenth level it is difficult for the strength of the cards in hand to pave the way. Enemies with heavy armor, for example, are nearly invincible when hit head-on. In fact, armor cards have a more or less high probability of parrying a blow and absorbing a certain number of damages. If the roll succeeds, the card remains, otherwise it is discarded. There are enemies who draw three pieces of armor in turn, the rock solid ones, and they must necessarily be taken from behind. In this case the cards that make us take a step and then hit are fundamental. But in this way we could end up surrounded, and so on with similar reasoning. However, you can develop more characters and save your own groups for each module, so as to load the most useful one. Or prepare different configurations of the same, with a wizard filled with fire spells in one and electricity spells in the other. The clashes are so fought and often won by the skin of the cuff that they give memorable challenges and great satisfaction. And if you die more than three times, you just need to spend a small amount of gold, which is plentiful in the game, to try the module all over again. No pressure or frustration, unless you stick with a losing tactic. In that case, defeat is assured, as well as painful. Since the cards are drawn at random, it is essential to balance them with the right equipment. Too many movement cards and we will find ourselves without attacks when needed most. The most difficult class to manage is the cleric, because he risks doing everything wrong. But what has never ceased to amaze us is how simple it is to manage the group and embark on a new adventure. Compared to trading card games, which require hours of brooding, Card Hunter offers such a smooth and immediate system that jumping back into the fray, ready to try a module again, is a matter of minutes. Credit for all the time spent balancing the game. And when involvement increases, the time comes to decide whether or not to invest a few euros. Ask Gary, he has the number for the pizzeria. Where gold cannot, pizza arrives Pizza is the currency that can be purchased with euros and reserved for special transactions that cannot be made with the gold earned during the game. For example, the alternate costumes of the pawns are on sale for absurd quantities of pizza. For example, the alternate costumes of the pawns are on sale for absurd quantities of pizza. It seems frivolous, but after days and days with the same group in front of your eyes, without even being able to change the color of their hair, the temptation to indulge in alternatives is strong, also because there are all kinds, even skeleton pawns, and they are all made with style and attention to detail. Speaking of more serious things, even a dozen extra modules cost pizza slices that give you a guaranteed epic item the first time you complete them. Compared to the global free offer, they are small, but they are very well done adventures and on sale at a good price. As always, the first one is free and, given that you can have them all for less than ten euros, this is likely to be your first purchase. You can also buy treasure chests or items sold in shops. The shops by the way are randomly restocked on a regular basis, but we have never felt the need for these until now. Then there are sets of pawns equipped for multiplayer challenges, which save us the time necessary to create a tailor-made party, and finally the most interesting option, a subscription which, with each treasure opened, gives us an extra object of the same value of the most precious one. Thereforeor if we find a rare object we will have an extra rare one, and the same for legendary or less valuable ones. The game always shows us what we would have achieved thanks to the subscription, so as to tempt us with each success. It must be said that Card Hunter is very difficult. Each module requires dedication and lucidity because the computer is smart and has brutal pawns on the field. It's hard not to want to win a few more epic items to alleviate suffering. Doing the math, buying pizza isn't very convenient: we always find ourselves with extra pizza with every purchase which is often not enough to buy anything else. In short, forget about paying for things their exact price and that's it. As always, it is more convenient to invest many euros at once rather than a few over time, but few would spend fifty or ninety-nine euros for Card Hunter. At the moment it's a good idea to play for a month and, if enthusiasm is still high, spend twenty euros to enjoy the extra content until you get tired. On balance Blue Manchu has thought of a system which, although imperfect like all free to play models, is however honest and transparent. And it focuses on long-term loyal players who, due to the quality and quantity of Card Hunter's offer, will not be few. Criticism of the narrator Card Hunter is very clean and balanced in mechanics. It's engaging, diverse and friendly, with no barriers to entry. But it's not perfect. In the long run the maps all look alike and there aren't that many modules for each level of the group. Also, the difficulty of the game is very high so unless you have exceptional equipment, you have to repeat the same modules day after day until you manage to pass them. Keep in mind that each module can only be completed once in twenty-four hours, so it's normal for it to take a long time to level up. As we have already mentioned, the first month the interest remains very high, and without the need to spend a euro. Then the casual nature of the game takes its toll, and without a story incentive to continue, it will become an office distraction for most players. But a month of play at these levels and without spending remains an impressive value for such a title. Then it is obvious that those who want to continue will be hungry for items and perhaps subscribe to a subscription, or buy extra tokens. Or he will throw himself into the fray of PvP, from which, moreover, one comes out with the strengthened desire to have a subscription, since winning for the first, third, week and twelfth game offers a chest with a rare item inside insured. Instead, all other victories ensure a chest with random items up to the twentieth, which contains a guaranteed epic item. During PvP battles, all pawns are of the twentieth level, and maps are won by checking certain squares for a defined number of turns. If there are no players available, you can challenge the computer and still get the chest if you win. Quite a possibility. The competitive part of the game is interesting but still limited. It would be nice to be able to form squads or recruit monsters to your army. And in any case at the moment having very strong objects pays off. Of course, the imbalance must be evident, but when it occurs every strategy goes down the drain. During the beta, the map editor was added, but the option for cooperative games is still absent, which would greatly lengthen the duration of Card Hunter and would give life to the game table, where you suffer a little of loneliness. The developers have promised that this option will come, so we just have to wait. The care taken in the creation of the tokens has produced superlative effects, superior to those found in the cards, designed with style but less impressive. Too bad only for the almost absent animations. Ultimately Card Hunter offers considerable value, but spreads it a bit between the various aspects. Its nature as a refined casual game with a strategic depth within everyone's reach makes it stand out from the crowd but one feels the lack of a series of options to customize the games and involve other players in their own. Over time, if Blue Manchu continues to follow him with the passion he has shown up to now, we could find a perfect game on our hands. It's free.", "date": "2013-09-12", "grade": "8.1"}
