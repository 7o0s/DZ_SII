So let's find out how the 505 Games product behaved in managing these two important factors. Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons also excites on mobile, albeit with some more technical limitations Traveling for dad Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons tells the story of two brothers who lost their mother in a tragic accident at sea, who find themselves forced to set off on a perilous journey in search of the Water of Life, the only remedy capable of saving the life of the sick father. A fantasy matrix setting goes perfectly with a basically dark and melancholy basic content, a combination that is visually reproduced with great effectiveness by a graphic realization that has little or nothing to envy to the home console versions. Framed from a three-quarter view, the game showcases well-constructed scenarios, full of details and above all characterized by a very pleasant color palette with autumnal hues that perfectly reflects the spirit of the narrative. The atmosphere is further enriched by a sound sector that performs its task simply impeccably, with evocative music that effectively punctuates the most intense moments and well-finished effects, among which the voices of the characters stand out who manage to make their feelings while expressing themselves in an invented and incomprehensible language. It is no coincidence that Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons puts such a rich offer on the plate from the point of view of presentation, which in fact represents the real spearhead of the title: the adventure can be completed easily between the two and the three hours, during which the player is captivated more by what he hears and sees than what he actually does in terms of playful action. Couple work In addition to everything listed so far, the mobile version of Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons also brings a peculiar control system that provides for the simultaneous command of both brothers on the screen, each managed by an analog stick. Compared to the console incarnations, where you could also rely on a couple of keys to perform the various actions, here everything has been reduced to pressing the appropriate virtual stick, with some obvious consequences in terms of pure comfort: the movements of the two protagonists are not always precise, and some more problems arise when you are forced to maintain pressure on the stick and move at the same time, for example to push an object. It is nothing insurmountable and a minimum of practice is enough to adapt to the situation, also because as with the previous versions Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons presents a level of difficulty that is anything but high (to put it mildly) and are very rare occasions in which it is necessary to show off a minimum of dexterity or skill to overcome the obstacles that the two brothers find themselves facing. The only potential component of challenge would be represented by the application of the different skills of the protagonists, with the older one tending to be able to take charge of the more demanding actions from a physical point of view while the younger one proves capable of sneaking into narrow spaces and take advantage of its superior agility: however, the mobile version removes even this minimal need for reasoning from the user, given that the elements with which it is possible to interact are highlighted with a halo of a color that clearly indicates which of the two brothers is called to perform the task. A solution that makes Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons an even more linear and guided experience than it already was, making it unsuitable for those looking for adrenaline at all costs. For all those who want to immerse themselves in a good story, however, the Starbreeze title confirms all its excellent qualities even in this latest incarnation.", "date": "2015-10-27", "grade": "8.0"}
