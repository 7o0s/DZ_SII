{"name": "Pearl Harbor: Zero Hour", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pearl-harbor-zero-hour.html", "text": "It seemed to me that I saw an aeleo December 7, 1941the date she will be remembered with infamy. At 8 am, 98 Japanese aircraft suddenly attacked Ford Island, Pearl Harbour. The attack force consisted of 9 Val dive bombers, 49 Kates equipped with 800 kg bombs and 40 Kates armed with torpedoes. In just a few minutes, five of the eight warships were nearly destroyed. This is Pearl Harbour, a very arcade-style war simulation limited to the use of aircraft. First of all, the game has a particular section, designed to be anything different from the usual database that distinguishes games of this genre. In fact, there is a complete reconstruction of the attack in real time down to the smallest detail, including aircraft, ships, bombs, torpedoes and everything that made up that attack. Everything is rather pleasant and lets you look at it.. the detail of the graphics and sound is more than discreet and, even if it is objectively difficult to control, everything gives the impression of being calibrated quite well also from the point of view of the reproduction of the reality. Of course, everything is rather limited .. the movie (with which you can interact very little, being able to control only the view) does not last more than about twenty minutes and completely lacks an encyclopedic section or any database that summarizes the events of that tragic December day. When the game is hard.. Pearl Harbor certainly doesn't shine with its wealth of possibilities; this is the first thing that catches the eye upon entering the main section of the game, and it certainly isn't an impression that will disappear over time. The game is based on a series of missions to be completed in sequence, and our choice is limited to the plane we want to use in each mission. However, each aircraft requires a certain number of Performance Points to be used. As you can easily guess at the beginning, the Points will be very few and very difficult to obtain; the plane with which you will begin to seek glory will be a banal P-40 Tomahakw, very agile and ideal for practicing the game but very limited in terms of armaments and the possibility of making your way through enemy lines. The planes are different, even if the number could have been much greater, and quite different from each other in terms of performance, armaments, speed and handling. But some require thousands of PP, and for the first missions you'll have to make do with what the convent passes. The first mission will consist in the simple destruction of an ammunition depot located not far from the starting point, and will not actually create major problems.. we can therefore relax and begin to study the game screen.. Simplicity.. a lot of simplicity.. even too much.. PH's graphical interface won't cause you big problems, unless you have serious vision problems. The view is the classic third person, even if it is possible to set it differently, as well as obviously the possibility of managing the Zoom. The panel, as already mentioned, is far too simple. Meanwhile, the speed management system is simply based on our choice, based simply on 3 speeds of increasing level. The plane will then move automatically, and we will only have to take care to keep the course. It is then possible to note the fuel level, the position of the landing gear, the damage suffered by the aircraft, the primary and secondary weapons supplied to the aircraft and a small map. Even if we want to be polite, one can only note that the interface is of an almost disturbing simplicity, and leaves all the responsibility, in fact, on the game system.. But here is the problem.. here too, we are in the absolute mediocrity. The exaggeratedly arcade setting greatly limits the player's possibilities, and in fact the only difficulty of the game refers to the actual combat. This is pretty well laid out and, if nothing else, when moving from an altitude it feels like you're actually in an aircraft, and all movement (both ours and the enemy's), is done pretty well, without going overboard in improbable Top Gun numbers. After 3-4 duels at high altitudes, however, boredom sets in again from which there is no escaping. Attacking ships and various land emplacements sure increases the level of interaction, but does not increase the amount of time this game can take away from even the most patient of players In conclusion The graphics and sound, as already mentioned when speaking of the Reconstruction of the Attack, are of a good standard, butnothing more. In my opinion the ships and everything that resides on land (Buildings, Anti-Aircraft, Vehicles, etc.) are made quite well, even if in a rather rough way. The planes are nice, even in detail, although once again, I have to note that much more could have been done. After all, this is Pearl Harbour; a discreet arcade, discreetly made and capable of taking away from you a few days of pleasant fun, above all if you manage to immerse yourself in the climate of the Attack, being the ~rhythm~ of the game rather vibrant and capable of not getting bored. But nothing more, really nothing more. As a flight simulator it doesn't hold up, as a war simulator it makes you smile, and even as an arcade it's way too simple. For all fans of the Second World War and various warmongers, PH can be a perfect purchase, if you are not the type who pays much attention to detail ... in all other cases, forget it: there will be better opportunities to fight against the Axis ! Introduction It was the year 1941. Italy was now immersed up to its neck in a war that it shouldn't, didn't want to, shouldn't have fought. The war scenario had now been extended to several continents and the Nazi threat was now looming. for some time now, even across the Atlantic. In the USA people were wondering what decision to take in the short term. hands of the States. However, Congress did not think like him, and with it a large part of the American people. The President needed something that would have jolted American pride, something big and scary, and so when he learned that the Hawaiian Base in Pearl Harbor was going to have a nice Japanese visit I think you can figure out the rest for yourself. At least so, says the legend. Difficult to know if, really, the biggest mistake of the most masochistic of peoples was already known to the Americans .. certainly there is that this attack has really changed the course of events, and that Pearl Harbor is a name that carries its own charm . The film, as usual, stirred up a great hornet's nest despite not being anything exceptional, and as often happens in these cases, the videogame industry has kindly joined the film industry.", "date": "2002-02-22", "grade": null}
