Potentials that unfortunately were never exploited in the year that followed, and with Sony feeling the urgent need to enrich the software park of its platform, few expected that the sequel to The Golden Abyss would be a trading card game set in the Uncharted universe. In a similar way to what Ubisoft did with Assassin's Creed Recollection, Fight for Fortune is Sony Bend and One Loop Games' attempt to combine a famous and appreciated franchise with the mechanics of a strategic card game, but unlike the original title for iPad, in this case the developers have followed more traditional paths, borrowing ideas and rules from some classics of the genre. The result, however, could have been much worse. They called him Nathan Deck Those familiar with the basics of Magic: The Gathering and its derivatives will have no problems assimilating the rules of Uncharted: Fight for Fortune, and although the tutorial does not cover every aspect of the game exhaustively, a few games are enough to get used to it. In a rather classic way, the aim of the game is to reduce the health points of the opposing player to zero, attacking him turn after turn with cards depicting heroes, mercenaries and enemies already encountered in the various adventures of Nathan Drake. These characters have an attack value and hit points, can defend the player from enemy attacks, and sometimes have special abilities. So far nothing new compared to games like Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh! and Pokmon, but the development team did a good job of differentiating the gameplay experience and making it strategic enough at the same time. Each player can only drop one character per turn, spending Faction points which are recharged each turn and which are different depending on the type of card; things are made even more unpredictable by the equipment that enhances the attack, defense and skills of your fighters, which can be activated by spending Wealth points, a resource that can be regenerated turn after turn through a system of artifacts to be sacrificed or associated with a particular character. In essence, a turn follows an extremely linear structure, in which you play a character, then an artifact, then an equipment, and finally the attack phase is resolved. Unlike Magic, however, the characters can only and exclusively attack the card they are facing, a factor that constantly forces you to evaluate where and when to place a particular character: it is better to immediately drop a powerful mercenary or keep it to get out of any trouble? Sacrifice an artifact to instantly gain a handful of Riches or equip it to one of the characters to gain more in later turns? Fight for Fortune is full of these small but crucial decisions, and while it does not reach the strategic depth of other games, it still manages to offer short and fun matches. Playstation 3 trophies Although the number of trophies is not high, in Fight for Fortune players have to work hard to get the coveted platinum. The vast majority require you to unlock secret content, including avatars, backgrounds and cards, making it therefore necessary to complete the entire Treasure Seeker mode and win against each opponent at least five times. ~abysmal~ differences In terms of game modes, Uncharted: Fight for Fortune offers the bare minimum for solo fun. The Treasure Seeker option is a series of challenges of increasing difficulty against characters familiar to those who have played Golden Abyss or the PS3 trilogy, giving you the chance to unlock new cards, backgrounds and avatars with each game you win. If desired, it is possible to launch directly into a quick match, selecting the opponent, the initial energy, the Wealth and Faction points, but unfortunately the game fails to offer a multiplayer mode up to par. The asynchronous challenges should be a welcome addition, but in this case they represent the only way to have fun in the company of a real opponent: through a notification system you are warned when your opponent has made his move, a mechanism which allows you to carry on up to eight games simultaneously but which displeases those who prefer to embark on faster challenges. Furthermore, at the time of writing, the shortage of online players often makes it difficult to find opponents in ranked matches, a problem thatand does not exist locally, given the possibility of playing on the same console. To close the round there is the customization menu of your deck, to be honest limited and with an interface that can certainly be improved, but which allows you to remove any cards to alter your game strategy. Through the purchase of two DLCs, expansions based on Uncharted 2 and 3 can be obtained, but it is precisely with regard to the balancing of the cards that the most controversial aspects of Fight for Fortune emerge. The update to the latest version of Uncharted: Golden Abyss has added an interesting integration between the two Vita games, allowing the user to find new cards while exploring and solving puzzles in the first title. What is a good excuse to replay The Golden Abyss by dedicating more time to exploration unfortunately ends up creating huge imbalances in multiplayer games, since those who have both titles can not only secure powerful exclusive cards but can even enhance those in his disposition: the result is that a deck can be much stronger than the opponent's despite sharing the same and identical cards.", "date": "2013-01-04", "grade": "7.0"}
