An entire universe Inspired by the Italian version of Stanley Kubrick's cinematic masterpiece, The Shining, where the protagonist's son read this word anxiously, the name of this game (and its protagonist) somehow represents the very atmosphere that PM Studios have created: a in the background to Etrom there is in fact a dark world where conflicts are the order of the day and the militarization of all cities has now become a normal thing, as well as the control of a few powerful people over the population, completely enslaved to power and also controlled in terms of reproduction. Everything is placed in a future of our own planet Earth, or rather in one of the imaginable futures, where the entire earth's surface has become desert and the population gathers in a few urban areas of millions and millions of inhabitants, called Megacities. What we could define as the new continents, in constant war with each other, are called Sighund, Hitland, Ursaton and Sakrum. The most precious asset is the Chroma, also used to produce weapons of great energy power but enormously expensive, which has prompted a large part of the armies to return to white weapons such as swords, shields and axes. However, the mineral is also used for the construction of respirators thanks to which it is possible to go outside the Megacities in what is called the Dying Desert, where the air once inside the lungs causes the so-called Dark Evil in man. Explaining Etrom's entire background in a few words is an almost impossible undertaking given the variety of elements and the enormous characterization work that has been done for anything that makes up his universe: after all, other projects such as comics are also in the pipeline and even a paper game you will understand that this title has nothing to envy as a setting to other famous products. In fact, however, Etrom takes place in a techno-fantasy world where mystical and magical elements blend with other hyper-technological and modern ones. In the sewers we will find several friends to keep us company Disabel, one of Etrom's first allies The gun shop An entire universe Inside the world described above, we find the protagonist of the game: ex-officer of the H.W.D. (Human World Defence), during a mission in the Dying Deserts Etrom comes into contact with a magical object, the Astral Essence, which penetrates inside his body causing visions and questions in his mind to which he is unable to give answers and a superhuman force culminating in the possibility of unleashing the Inner Demon, through which he becomes invincible for a certain amount of time. But as we said just now, reducing the entire background of the game to just the protagonist would be extremely simplistic as even the secondary characters have not been left without adequate characterization especially through the official site of the game: an example of this is the figure of Johan , that is the one who at the beginning of the adventure will assume the role of spiritual guide of Etrom, leading him through real predictions (even if very difficult to interpret) to the truth. It's battle time Belonging to the action RPG genre, Etrom basically takes on most of its features, to which are added some solutions devised by the development team. The first thing to know is that, as a descendant of Diablo, in this game the fights boil down to clicking frantically on your enemy, always present en masse on the screen, until he drops dead as a stone: while on the one hand all this it is always the most satisfying and adrenaline-pumping that can exist, on the other hand in the long run it could be tiring also given that the work of Blizzard is now videogames very far from our days. To break at least in part the monotony of this type of combat, PM Studios have well thought of equipping Etrom with the Astral Axe, a melee weapon coming from the Astral Essence that has pervaded the protagonist's body, but not only : in fact, he will have at his disposal a respectable arsenal of energy weapons such as pistols, assault rifles, machine guns, missile launchers and also a highly successful sniper rifle complete with objective mode, which will allow you to kill enemies in a completely and for everything similar to what normally onAccesses in FPS. However, as you progress through the game, you soon realize how the main and most powerful weapon, except in some rare cases, is the Astral Axe, thanks also to the various powers it will gain, absolutely essential to defeat most of the enemies, even through the use of the force attack, especially in Demon mode, capable of producing simply devastating damage. The first thing to know is that, as a descendant of Diablo, fighting boils down to clicking madly on your enemy. It's battle time Let's make it clear that Etrom is not a real RPG, therefore if one were to expect a whole particular system of attributes one could be disappointed: the only properties concern in fact the power and ability to use the Astral Axe, the precision in ranged attacks, the number of life points and those of astral points (the correspondents of mana, essentially), which can be increased to one's liking at each level-up of the character (30 in total) but which from the beginning it will be better to increase in fairly homogeneous way. In addition we also have a value called astral defense, to which, however, the points of choice cannot be assigned. The power-up system used in Etrom is the classic one we are used to: through drugs, called power drugs, the protagonist will be able to regain life points and astral points as well as some bonuses such as increased defense to the various types of attack and increased power to all inside the fighting. All the objects mentioned so far must obviously be kept somewhere, and this is where the inventory comes into play: we have twelve slots available for common objects, three for heavy weapons (including the one in use) and armor and ten for power drugs, plus seven for the various types of magazines. Although at first glance these numbers may seem adequate all in all, we will often find ourselves in the condition of having to choose which object to throw away in order to take one that interests us more, which is also linked to the fact that it is quite cumbersome to go and empty each time the inventory between the cash desk (also limited) and the gun shop, where you can also sell your items. For the rain perhaps it could have been done better The Circle of Experience Johan, our spiritual guide Two very special powers The intention of wanting to attribute a why to everything, in order to make the Etrom universe as enveloping and profound as possible, led the development team to also include saving the game among the powers available to the protagonist: in practice by pressing the T key it is possible, except in some cases, to access the temple, a sort of real base also equipped with a chest for storing objects that are not currently needed but which could come in handy in the future. Only and exclusively within this temple it is possible to save the game, but a kind of space-time door will remain open to go back even if you were to come from a place miles and miles away; be careful, however, not to leave the other two doors of the temple that lead to the weapons shop and the GW7 district of Sighundia as this would close the temporary door opened with the use of the Power of Time. This last consideration unfortunately leads to a series of problems, especially concerning the equipment at our disposal: given that very often we will arrive at the temple from remote places, it is good and right to keep a supply of power drugs always available inside of the chest of the temple, where to go in case these should be scarce inside a dungeon, the same goes also for the loaders of energy weapons. Know that the game is not easy at all, indeed the enemies will often put Etrom's life to the test, often causing his death, so waste time saving the game from time to time and don't skimp on spending at the gun shop. especially with regard to armor and secret files, which are fundamental as they reveal very useful details on the types of enemies we face and their weaknesses to be exploited often with a certain power of the Ax or weapon. The other power that can be used in the temple is the one linked to the leveling up of the character, who, once he has reached the necessary level of points, will have to place himself in the center of the Circle of Experience, in order to activate the increase in characteristic values. Up to that moment, even exceeding the threshold necessary to increase the level, this will still remain stationary, while the interfaceof the game will signal the ~real~ level to be activated by going to the temple. The rioting neighborhood of Sighundia, GW8 A magical portal back to the temple The damages are directly shown through a writing on the character The enemies Every self-respecting hero has a host of funny guys who would like to kill him at any moment and Etrom is certainly no less: the number of enemies, also shown in the ~monster~ on the game DVD, is decidedly high given also their different nature. In fact, we find ourselves facing human characters such as the criminals who populate the various cities or the armies in their defense, which obviously differ according to the territory in which we find ourselves, but also some undead creatures born of laboratory experiments or pervaded from Dark Chroma, as well as demonic or dragon-like beings. The artificial intelligence of the units is quite good, especially those equipped with ranged weapons will always try to keep away from us by sending forward those that instead have swords and the like: it will therefore be up to us to develop a counterattack strategy to make sure that those who do us the most harm fall first. Despite our efforts, it often happens that the enemies hear our steps even from a relatively distant distance or from behind a wall or a building and it is therefore necessary to be very careful not to find yourself surrounded, also learning to use the stealth mode, which it helps to make the game a little more varied by also introducing some stealth phases in which to avoid fights that would otherwise certainly see us defeated. Last but not least, PM Studios have decided not to stop there, also putting combat on mechs on the plate: where permitted, it is in fact possible, in full Mechwarrior style, to use these beautiful piles of scrap metal, through which to literally unleash hell . The technical sector While not offering state-of-the-art special effects, Etrom's 3D engine (the Pellicus 3D Game System, entirely developed by PM Studios) is appreciated above all for its solidity and for its versatility on not exactly recent machines: on an Athlon XP 1700+, 1GB of RAM and a Radon 8500 the game went practically perfectly, only showing in a few moments some uncertainties related to the high number of explosions on the screen. The textures are very pleasant as are the light effects, while for the more sensitive it is possible to choose the level of blood lost following a blow. From an audio point of view we are in the presence of a really not bad soundtrack, which will keep us company for almost the entire game time, adapting perfectly to the context in which we find ourselves and permeating in our minds that sense of oppression that distinguishes everything a bit the world of Etrom. Unfortunately for now the speech is only in English with Italian subtitles for obvious marketing reasons, but the development team has promised that if things go well (and therefore with a little more money available) a patch with the speech in Italian as well as a complete re-edition of the paper manual, given that the current one sees it in Italian but only in the electronic version inside the DVD, while in the game package there is a sort of immediate guide to interface and nothing more. The mode sniper Etrom inventory and characteristics Another dungeon, in which we will find undead creatures We can define Etrom as a valid title, which without excelling within its genre can offer satisfaction to a wide range of gamers. The technical sector Fighting with mechs When the demon is unleashed there is none. for no one, too bad it doesn't last long and consumes a lot of energy Final comment Judging a title like Etrom is not easy at all: if on the one hand we have an excellent setting seasoned with an equal characterization of all the characters who live within its universe, even the most marginal, seeing things from another perspective, someone could turn up their noses at the cumbersome rescue system or at the slightly higher difficulty than the norm, also due to the difficulty in finding some objects needed in times of need. This can certainly be remedied by dying sometimes but learning the right game strategies, but frustration and abandonment in the middle of the title could be the natural reaction of some less patient players, given that going back can mean completely redoing a dungeon. From the point of view of the originality of the title we have different elements such as mechs", "date": "2005-11-30", "grade": null}
