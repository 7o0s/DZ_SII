The central theme of Dead or Alive could be summarized thus, although at the beginning the fighting game branded Team Ninja made the sensuality of its fighters more of an accessory element, which remained in the background compared to some interesting innovations, such as the unpublished interaction with the scenarios and solid and engaging gameplay, capable of making the most of impacts and proposing spectacular and convincing repertoires of moves. The last episode was released in 2012, but it seems that the developers are really fond of it, to the point of proposing it for the fourth time to coincide with the debut on the new generation consoles. In the splendor of 1080p and sixty frames per second, Dead or Alive 5: Last Round relies on a new technology, the so-called Soft Engine, to satisfy professional onanists and fan service enthusiasts, giving them an unprecedented softness as regards bobbing of breasts and a very impressive extra set of costumes. All placed, however, in the context of an offer that adds nothing substantial to what has already been seen and reviewed. Dead or Alive 5: Last Round is an excellent match fighting game, but it is starting to feel the weight of the years ~A few days later~ The single player campaign of Dead or Alive 5: Last Round does not change one iota compared to previous editions of the game, and unfortunately adopts a choral approach, in which you find yourself controlling different characters following the progression of a ~plot~ (told frankly evil) who sees Kasumi in the end confronting an ~evil~ version of her, created in the laboratory by the MIST group after the abandonment of military experiments by DOATEC. The events of the story are often parallel and offer the point of view of various fighters who, for one reason or another, approach the Dead or Alive tournament. This means that many cutscenes are repeated several times, but above all that the large number of encounters that must be faced ends in a single way, rather than offering different final sequences depending on the character. A solution, the latter, which could certainly have guaranteed a longer duration of the experience, ultimately superfluous for anyone who has already played with Dead or Alive 5. The remastering work, however, is limited to resolution, frame rate and tectonic movement, but it does not in any way improve the polygonal modeling, which during some cutscenes shows urban glimpses that bring us back to the era of the glorious Dreamcast due to the ingenuity of the solutions used. Not exactly ideal situations, in short, where it would have been legitimate to expect at least an enrichment of the story mode. The path taken by Team Ninja was therefore that of pure and simple convenience: minimum effort, maximum result. Or at least that was the intention. What changes The transition from Dead or Alive 5 (2012) to Dead or Alive 5 Plus (2013), and from Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate (2013) to this Dead or Alive 5: Last Round was basically marked by the introduction of some new characters , a few new scenarios, some new costumes, and minor balance tweaks. This latest version includes two unpublished warriors, Raidou and Honoka, respectively the boss of the first chapter with cybernetic grafts and the typical Japanese student all in a skirt, pigtails and shrill voice. Her appearance is obviously misleading, because the girl knows how to assert herself and uses a powerful and determined fighting style, characterized by sharp movements and highly effective aerial maneuvers. There is no misunderstanding for Raidou: he has the appearance of a dodgy type and his repertoire confirms this impression, with movements that are not very fast but which do a lot of harm. The roster of the game therefore comes to offer thirty-four different characters, which also include the boss Alpha-152 / Phase 4 and four guests from Virtua Fighter (Akira, Pai, Sarah and Jacky). News also for the scenarios, which see the arrival of the Danger Zone and Crimson maps, taken respectively from Dead or Alive and Dead or Alive 2, exclusive to the next-gen edition and capable of proposing some interesting ideas (see the infinite jumps by Danger Zone). And then, as already mentioned, the costumes: a wide choice of dresses (over three hundred, many of which to unlock) ranging from the default ones to the Christmas theme, naturally passing through bikinis that leave nothing to the imagination, even adding alternative hairstyles and accessories. The Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate packages are almost all present, in this sense, but it is surprising how the developers continue to focus on additional DLC, which arriveeven at a disproportionate cost. Clearly there is a market out there that Tecmo Koei doesn't want to stop milking, to stay on the subject of udder. Playstation 4 trophies If the offer of Dead or Alive 5: Last Round does not differ much from what has already been seen in the Ultimate edition, it is funny to note that many of the forty-eight Trophies available are also exactly the same. To obtain them, you generally need to perform actions for the first time, reach consistent numbers in terms of matches and complete the various modes. Still current? There is no doubt that Dead or Alive 5: Last Round is still capable of exerting a certain charm towards fans of fighting games, thanks to the solidity of its gameplay and a system of interaction with the settings that can be very spectacular. between broken walls and dizzying leaps. We must also consider that on PlayStation 4 the genre is in its infancy and there are no real competitors to be able to annoy the Team Ninja title, rightly offered at a budget price. At the same time, however, we are talking about a product that is beginning to feel the weight of the years and whose formula now appears too inflated: with four different editions in less than three years, very little different from each other, the stench of commercial operation is felt loud and clear. Furthermore, on the Sony console (and, let's assume, Xbox One) the remastering work disappoints, leaving intact some aspects of the graphics that already appeared dated in 2012 and delivering us polygonal models optimized only in certain situations, the most itchy ones. Finally, the outline of secondary modes does not offer anything new and the online matches that we were able to try were often spoiled by a consistent lag, which made things extremely complicated. However, it is probable that the population of the servers in the coming days can guarantee a better experience.", "date": "2015-02-19", "grade": "7.2"}
