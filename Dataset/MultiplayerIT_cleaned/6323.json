We point our gaze towards the stars and dream of being able to wander there, perhaps in the infinite darkness or towards a distant destination, a new cradle for our species. We seek a safe place for ourselves and for those who will forget the Earth, those who will call home a spaceship and then an alien, strange, but wonderful planet. We hope to find our utopia where we live in peace, connected with our community and able to give everyone what they deserve, where things will be different. Then real life will hit us full blown, because humanity's problems pursue it without the need for a rocket. I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is also this: it is a dream of hope for the future, which however does not allow itself to be limited by naivety and does not really think that humans will be able to find their own paradise among the stars as if nothing had happened. More to the point, it's a long adventure that blends role-playing, life-simulating and strung with a card game. Developed by Northway Games - who we were able to interview by discovering the background of the game's creation - I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is available on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 from today, August 25, 2022. Here is our review of I Was a Teenage Exocolonist. Born among the stars Dyz, one of the characters from I Was a Teenage Exocolonist Our character will be born among the stars, on a spaceship that is destined to reach a wormhole, a portal to the planet Verturnia. It is our new home, a place to build a human colony away from the problems of the Earth, which has been affected by famines, wars and ideological clashes. What awaits us once we arrive on Venturnia is a ten-year journey, during which we will have to grow, learn, give direction to our lives by facing problems and coping with the loss of friends and loved ones, broken by the pitfalls of an unknown world . I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is a role-playing game where we are continually asked to choose what to do and how to make the story evolve, thus influencing the destiny not only of us, but of those around us. We already say it now: I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is not a game to be completed and set aside. This life-sim requires at least a second game (each attempt lasts about ten hours) to be fully enjoyed and gives you all the tools to play many more times. With 29 different endings, dozens upon dozens of unique events, and the impossibility of doing it all in one life, Northway Games' creation can be played over and over again. Everything is also justified on a narrative level right from the start, as our character has the mysterious ability to see the possible futures of Venturnia. He is also able to bring knowledge from a previous game with him, so as to unlock additional options in the next ones and change the course of events that seemed inevitable. Furthermore, we ourselves will know what troubles are coming and will be able to give each further adventure a new direction, trying to prepare for and prevent disasters... or to cause them. Role playing game There will always be choices to make in I Was a Teenage Exocolonist Our character will be ten years old when he arrives at his destination and we will decide his characteristics. At the beginning, we will be able to define a whole series of elements, such as our pronouns (also customizable), the appearance we will have once we grow up (male, female, androgynous), a unique genetic modification that will give a passive ability and social elements such as a childhood friend. However, all this is only the basis, because I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is a great role-playing game in which the character's enhancement will be determined at every moment and with every action. In fact, we have twelve characteristics such as empathy, physical strength, engineering knowledge and so on. Each feature, once you reach certain levels, also activates passive bonuses such as new equipment slots, new options for card challenges and more. Our life on Venturnia can be roughly divided into childhood, adolescence and adulthood. We will have until our twenties to truly give our existence a purpose and we will start from the early days. The character we created will, for example, be able to play with friends, study various subjects at school or help the colony with some chores: each activity rewards us mainly with an increase in characteristics but also with an accumulation of stress. The latter is one of our character's limitations: once you reach 100 stress points you have to spend a monthand to rest. We will also be able to meet the local fauna in I Was a Teenage Exocolonist I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is divided into ten years by thirteen months and each month allows us to carry out only a practical activity but, fortunately, there are no dialogue limits with the characters. Time is therefore limited, even if - very appropriately - in childhood it seems that everything is simple and that a year of play is actually more than enough to do everything we need. However, as we get older, the activities available to us increase more and more: real jobs are unlocked, for example, provided that our statistics are high enough. It will simply be impossible to do everything and we will have to focus on a few activities, both to maximize certain statistics and to continue with various subplots. The colony is in fact a living place and, even if we won't see them all, there are various adventures to complete and secrets to discover, linked to all the characters that will revolve around us. Carrying out certain jobs will unlock various steps of these subplots and allow us to influence them, based on our statistics, the information discovered in previous games and on the basis of our level of friendship with certain members of the colony. It can also be explored outside the colony in I Was a Teenage Exocolonist Over the course of ten years we will be able to save or condemn many characters, rebel against the colony to gain power, become biologists, engineers, soldiers, farmers, teachers, explorers and more. We will be able to find out what is really hidden on Venturnia, what are the origins of the attacks of alien creatures, cure diseases, avoid wars and much more. We completed two games, seeing various subplots and getting to three endings (we ~cheated~ by reloading a save to change a choice in the ending). We certainly cannot comment on every single narrative line, but everything we have seen has deeply impressed us. All the characters are interesting, they have secrets and a hidden side that they don't want to show except to their most trusted friends. We see them grow and change, we can even create loving relationships with them. Venturnia is a beautiful planet on a visual level, thanks to many beautifully designed screens, but it is the writing of the events during the exploration phases that strikes us, putting us in the shoes of a small human who takes halting steps in a varied ecosystem, which hides great beauty but also what invisible terrors. I Was a Teenage Exocolonist pushes you to discover more and more, looking for new events, dialogues and backstory. Unfortunately the game is only in English: we know that for some it will be a limitation and we confirm that it is necessary to be comfortable with the Albion language to enjoy the adventure without limits. Cards The I Was a Teenage Exocolonist card game board In all of this, however, we have not yet explained the third game component of I Was a Teenage Exocolonist: the card game. Most of the game actions that we will carry out will be preceded by a game of cards and, in case of victory, we will get additional bonuses to the characteristics or we will unlock various key events. In any case, card games always have more or less the same structure. Each challenge is played on a five-box board and our goal is to play up to five cards, each characterized mainly by a numerical value, to obtain a total value that is equal to or greater than that indicated by I Was a Teenage Exocolonist. Some sample cards from I Was a Teenage Exocolonist However, adding up the points is not enough: the real game is to place the cards in such a way as to create combinations based on poker. We will be able to create pairs, tris, ladders and more. In all this there are a few additional effects and modifiers of various kinds, both related to the cards and to the playing field. The options are varied, but structurally the game is more or less always the same, without too many changes. Overall I Was a Teenage Exocolonist works. If you play on basic difficulty, you win without difficulty and, indeed, often you get so many points that you get a special bonus. There is a higher difficulty that requires you to reach higher scores and will challenge the player a little more. Finally, you can skip the minigame and have victory automatically determined by a mix of factors, such as stats, age, and a flip of a coin. Of all the elements of I Was a Teenage Exocolonist, the card game is the least striking. It's a good way to break up the pace, interspersing dialogue and exploration with something more mental, but we felt there was room to inserire in the course of the game more variations. However, it is very nice that the cards are created on the basis of our actions: whether they are daily choices or traumatic events, our memories are transformed into a card and our deck will become a summary of our choices. We will also have equipment cards in I Was a Teenage Exocolonist Finally, a quick consideration on the sound component. I Was a Teenage Exocolonist was created with the support of many artists, all with their own style: this fusion of tracks, often different from each other, is perfect for representing the seasons (which also change visually) and the various periods of life of our character. We assure you that you will want to keep the volume as high as possible to enjoy every single song.", "date": "2022-08-25", "grade": "8.7"}
