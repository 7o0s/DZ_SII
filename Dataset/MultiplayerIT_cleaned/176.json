{"name": "PC Calcio 2007 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pc-calcio-2007-recensione.html", "text": "Nino don't be afraid of missing a penalty The first time you touch the turf of PC Calcio 2007 you will be asked to describe the characteristics of your alter ego based on three essential items: Knowledge, Character and Diplomacy. Depending on the values you attribute to these characteristics, in the course of the game you will be more or less facilitated in evaluating the characteristics of the players, rather than in dealing with your own staff or so on. This at least in theory, because on balance, during the game, we didn't get the feeling that these characteristics really affected the simulated events. Afterwards, you will have to select whether to play in Manager or ProManager mode. In a nutshell, by choosing the first one we will have a simple life from the beginning being able to choose to coach any club available among the various countries and championships present. Taking the arduous path of the ProManager, on the other hand, we will be called to climb the ranks having to start coaching a third-rate team to arrive, over the years, up to the top division. Epic. Stadium chants The graphic aspect of PC Calcio 2007 is always quite pleasant, with a clean and very readable style, a pity however that after just a few navigations with the mouse you realize how the user interface is not up to the situation. offering the different information in a confusing and often unclear way. This despite a couple of not bad intuitions, such as the pop-up menus - in tooltip style - which appear by positioning the mouse pointer over the player's name and which show all his characteristics, including photos (if available). The music and sound effects in general are as catchy as they are monotonous, forcing you to dust off your MP3 collection. Worth noting is the reproduction of the matches which, although for obvious reasons it does not reach the quality standard of the FIFA or PES series, succeeds very well in its tasks by reproducing - also thanks to the commentary - the stadium atmosphere quite faithfully. Both when it will be played on the bare fields of C2 and when the lawn of the great Serie A stadiums will be trodden, perhaps during a cup final. Furthermore, as an unusual but rather welcome option, during the course of the matches it will still be possible to navigate through the other menu items and thus be able to carry out various routine tasks, such as renewing a contract or setting training options, between a throw-in and the other one. We spread our debts The beating heart of PC Calcio 2007 is divided into two parts: the economic/managerial one and the more purely technical/football one. In the same way, we will be able to customize our stadium to our complete liking (and finances permitting, of course), planning the construction of new structures capable of attracting more audiences and prestige. Night lighting, changing rooms, digital scoreboards, heating and disabled facilities are just some of the additional facilities on our (former) suburban pitch. nothing is missing, except the possibility of betting in illegal circuits or to evade taxes on players' salaries We spread our debts At the managerial level, the game is presented in a more than complete way. The choices available are many, in-depth and decidedly plausible. Having to deal with budget management, the player will be called to use a large number of tools. The proceeds from the sale of tickets, for example, will be the result of the resulting data from the structures and equipment present in the stadium and from the prices fixed for the various sections of the stands (curve, grandstands, VIP, and so on), as well as from the seats reserved for annual season tickets and the importance of the matches themselves. And if the money at our disposal turns out to be too little, it will be time to exploit the sponsorship rights of our team. Based on our abilities and the ranking situation, we will be able to obtain more or less advantageous contracts both from the various television networks and from the various sponsors of the uniforms or the field. And if we really don't have to make it yet, we can always go to a bank to ask for credit lines and various loans. In short, nothing is missing, except the possibility of betting in illegal circuits or evading taxes on players' salaries. We can be satisfied. The bizone Unfortunately, a little as per tradition (or curse) for all the football simulations that decide to cover both the financial part and the more purely technical one, once you go down to the locker room to really breathe real football... thefirst flaws. Mind you, if you haven't been used to any of the latest Football Manager or even just Championship Manager (aka Scudetto) the whole thing might as well seem quite complete and polished. After all, thanks to the official license of FIFPro, the player database is heavy and rather detailed, and all the usual possibilities for customizing the squad don't seem to be missing. Differentiated workouts, tactics, formations, schemes, individual instructions are all aspects that can be activated and taken care of by the virtual coach. The problem is that however you go about operating on all these aspects, the results then seem to change very little, relying mostly on the personal characteristics of each individual player and not on the overall game system. The transfer market is disarmingly simple, especially when compared with the counterpart offered by Football Manager, and not only in terms of bargaining options but also in terms of the behavior of the various opposing teams and the ~psychology~ of the negotiation. The players themselves, here are just numbers and bits, with no presumption of a ~life~ of their own with dreams, goals and disappointments.

The game was tested on a 3.2Ghz system with 1GB of RAM and never experienced any kind of slowdown or glitches. Conclusions PC Calcio 2007 confirms all the strengths and weaknesses of the series. In fact, the change of developer does not seem to have wanted to change the philosophy that underlies the whole game and which seems to underline the desire to offer a simple product within everyone's reach. A sort of sticker album. Simplicity wouldn't be a problem in itself, were it not for the fact that the title is also simplistic and therefore not very stimulating (and fun) for those looking for a little more than sufficient degree of challenge. Pros Budget price FIFPro official license Entirely localized in Italian Cons Low game depth Monotonous Sometimes cumbersome user interface Punctual as the postponement of Sunday evening, this year too the PC Calcio series made its debut in all the shops (and newsagents) in Italy, now in its 2007 version - after two million copies sold throughout Europe. We say it right away, so as not to keep you on your toes: the supremacy of Football Manager, led by Sport Interactive still seems to be firmly established, however the titles of the PC Calcio family, albeit in a slow but inexorable decline since the 2001 edition they have always stood out for other characteristics, thus managing to find space in the hearts of simulated football enthusiasts. With a change of developer, the time has come to see if, after a disappointing 2006 edition from all points of view, the series is at least ready to leave the relegation zone...", "date": "2007-01-10", "grade": null}
