Those who have been able to try Ratchet & Clank: Height does not count on PSP will not find substantial differences in this conversion for PlayStation 2, given that the game appears practically identical, also as regards the plot: our heroes enjoy a well-deserved rest between one adventure and another, when they meet their little fan who, soon after, is mysteriously kidnapped by some creatures. According to Clank, the kidnappers weren't looking for the girl, but for the strange object she was in possession of: a device that comes from a vanished civilization and is able to draw on a technology that goes beyond imagination. The two immediately set off in search of the kidnappers, on a journey that will take them to explore different planets and face a large number of opponents. The developers have thought of carrying everything from PSP and PS2 in a faithful way, and this is also evident in the game structure, which is the same that we were able to appreciate last year on the Sony portable console, but which is not perfectly at home. comfortable in a different context. On the one hand, the strengths of this episode of Ratchet & Clank remain, in particular a gameplay that is based on the variety of tools and situations, which leads us to use a large number of weapons and to exploit the peculiarities of each location in order to continue exploring. On the other hand, very unpleasant situations occur due to the mediocre management of the view: it is possible to customize its functioning in three ways, but none proves to be able to do the job without problems. In the end, the best thing remains manual management, via the right analog stick, which in any case shows the side to numerous uncertainties when our character is in the vicinity of walls and large objects. Furthermore, the difficulty appears anything but well balanced: from the very first stages we will find ourselves facing really difficult enemies, who not only resist well to blows (especially those from a firearm), but fight back fiercely, often forcing us to repeat entire sections after the yet another game over. Very unpleasant situations arise due to poor camera management. A tool for every occasion As mentioned above, among the strengths of Ratchet & Clank: Height does not count there is certainly the great variety of situations, which must be solved not only by exploiting the many different weapons, but also objects that belong to the scenario in where we are. For example, in one of the first planets we will receive a strange water pistol as a gift that awakens small sentient plants and makes them grow in different ways according to their species: some generate explosive fruits, ideal for opening a gap where the walls they block our way; others turn into real elastic slingshots, capable of launching us towards otherwise unreachable areas; still others become vines that we can climb to overcome an obstacle. There is no shortage of situations in which Clank must be controlled instead of Ratchet, perhaps when there is a need to sneak into very narrow passages: even in those situations, the game is generous in terms of situations and possibilities. Every time we eliminate an enemy, bolts appear on the ground which constitute the current currency: having found a gadget dispenser, we will be able to spend our ~money~ to buy ammunition for the weapons we have or get new and more powerful ones. The choice is wide enough, and it's really a shame that the combat system always ends up being chaotic and approximate, preventing us from fully enjoying our tools of destruction. Technical realization In cases where a conversion from PS2 to PSP is carried out, there is often a general ~downsizing~ of the graphics, which are impoverished in many respects: complex polygonal models that suddenly become much simpler, textures of decent quality that ~expand~ and lose all of their definition, and so on. One would therefore expect that the opposite process (i.e. the transition from PSP to PS2) would produce opposite effects of the same magnitude. Unfortunately this is not the case, and the game presents itself with graphics below the current PlayStation 2 standards, coming out very shabby by comparison with Ratchet: Gladiator. The characters and enemies are well done and have a good set of animations, the problem mostly are the scenarios, really too simple and lacking in detail. The work done for the textures, in particular, is almost non-existent. The fewness of the locations always ensures a certain fluidity, without uncertainties, but it is a high price to pay. The plot of the game vietold through a series of cutscenes that are anything but exceptional to look at, but which boast an excellent dubbing in Italian. Probably the best aspect of a sound sector that otherwise doesn't offer much, between anonymous music and very little original effects. Comment We are faced with a poorly cared for and poorly optimized conversion: the game itself is certainly valid, as demonstrated on the PSP, but a version for PlayStation 2 cannot be made without the necessary graphic enhancement and leaving out important elements such as the balance of difficulty , the management of the view and the effectiveness of the combat system. Ratchet & Clank: Height Doesn't Matter offers us interesting and varied situations, along with a respectable arsenal and a rather large catalog of enemies. Unfortunately, however, this PS2 version fails to exploit all of this in the best way, getting lost in the classic glass of water since a little more effort and attention was enough to be able to pack another quality product. If you've played through every episode of the Ratchet & Clank series on PlayStation 2, and Height Doesn't Matter is the only one you're still missing, then think about it. Otherwise, rush to Ratchet: Gladiator without delay.
