Strategic, deep and endless, power struggle will only prove its value over time, almost certainly becoming a perfect culture water for clans and tournaments. After this roundup of good intentions successfully digitally transposed, it is impossible not to glimpse a small shadow, in any case not capable of nipping or even just undermining the judgment expressed up to this moment: it was decided to divide the servers according to the operating system used, XP or Vista, giving way to those in possession of the second to take advantage of a series of improvements in the management of physics, which make possible all the destructive evolutions experienced during the missions that make up the campaign, and in the alternation of day and of the night. Owners of the last born from Microsoft will still be able to participate in games based on DirectX 9, but the impossibility for all the others, the majority, to do the opposite, remains a significant limitation in terms of reachable users. Setting a new standard? No, better to be the future than to try to reach it Visually, the first impact with the island located in the Philippine sea which is the backdrop to the events, is in the literal sense of the term, seeing the player parachute with very little success into the icy ocean waters, a few meters away from the shore. Those first few seconds between apnea, a hint of swimming and then the shore, are enough to leave you speechless: the starry night does not in fact prevent you from noticing the shoals of shy fish intent on dodging Private Elite Dunn, while a turtle prepares with stealthy step to reach the sea again from which it had just come. All with an astonishing level of detail. Crysis is prodigious and does not fail to reserve breathtaking views in profusion, moments of quality that are difficult to experience elsewhere, between complex light sources and explosions never so close to reality, passing through a volumetric smoke and fog capable of squeezing any graphics card present on the market. The opponents deserve a separate discussion. Whether Korean or linked to the alien chapter, the models are treated in detail, with fluid and believable animations as well as having an excellent variety and, in the first case, accompanied by a perfect facial mimicry in doing justice to angry emotions , determination or fear, depending on the context. The artificial intelligence is also very accurate, which commands coverage and battle strategies still far from those that an expert player can devise, but superior by many lengths to the algorithms usually exploited. Setting a new standard? No, better to be the future than to try to reach it The settings make use of textures that are magnificent in terms of definition and detail, combined in shaders that offer reflections, refractions and transparencies that are literally able to pierce the screen, inside the forest, frozen or not, as well as in the buildings, in the water and in the alien structures . Impressive, then, how everything that has been described up to now is combined with a kilometric depth of field, with - almost - every element present on the seabed actually reachable. Crysis goes beyond the desire to impose a new technical standard, and everything else offered by the gaming universe is very distant, now and credibly in the coming months. Physics is directly managed by CryEngine 2 on a par with any other technical aspect  no, no Havok this time  and allows you to throw objects as well as knock down entire shacks, houses and small buildings with bullets and explosives. A typical situation, which is repeated several times, is the one in which the vehicle on duty goes off the road, either due to the death of the driver, or due to damage caused to the wheels and engine: this may skid and then crash and catch fire , knocking down meters of flora or, third example in an infinite series of possibilities, overwhelm other enemies proving to be more useful than expected. Even the sound does not disappoint, presenting itself as an icing on an already incredibly tasty cake. Nature, in particular, is made more alive by rustling, animal cries and footsteps rendered differently based on the surface trampled on, with a very unobtrusive background soundtrack often relegated to movies or special interthey. The dubbing, in Italian in the local version, is good and when it presents some declines it is not so much for the acting, but for the dialogues that are sometimes excessively didactic and only apparently intense. The longed-for moment has finally arrived: when these lines are read, the Multiplayer.it reader will probably already be able to see the copies of Crysis displayed in the shop window under the house; in this case, the advice is to get dressed, go out and remember your wallet, the review can very well be consulted during the long installation of all 12 GB that make up the new CryTek masterpiece. The wait was spasmodic for a number of different reasons, which do not reside exclusively in the wonderful setting externalized since the first official screenshot. The now three years old Far Cry, of which the subject of the review is much more than the spiritual successor, had fully convinced, narrowly missing the reputation of absolute masterpiece, probably due to some not brilliant design choices and the presence of a certain Half-Life 2 which in the following months would have represented a mirage of quality and depth. After many prizes won at every event and by any conceivable magazine within living memory, the German softco is therefore ready to show the fruit of so much effort and free this title from the immense responsibility that was now crushing it. Yellow man I'll have your scalp. Or I will silently kill you. But yes, getting around you can be fine too! The life of archaeologists is always particularly exciting in literary, cinematographic and videogame works. This is also the case of a group of American researchers who in 2020 make a mysterious discovery on an island located in the waters between China and the Philippines, then losing track of them. The consequent invasion of that distant patch of land by the North Korean forces convinces the United States of America to send a small contingent of four Delta Force soldiers to the place of events, including the user's alter ego, Jake Dunn. In the role of this wiry action hero, the opponents who from time to time will obstruct the road will have to be hired, the mystery solved and the planet saved from a monstrous alien race. Obviously, to unravel this articulated tangle of events, told along the game levels, extraordinary powers are needed: the Nano Muscle Suit dressed by soldier Jake is in fact a technological prodigy capable of amplifying the protagonist's physical abilities to the extreme , opening up a world of possibilities and choices. The suit is made up of a series of bundles of silvery fibers and guarantees, as a first function, the progressive regeneration of health, making it possible to avoid collecting medikits. Nothing particularly new up to now, if it weren't for the further peculiarity of releasing special substances or changing one's structure, so as to guarantee four special abilities: strength, speed and resistance to bullets that are nothing short of inhuman, in addition to the optical concealment. Yellow man I'll have your scalp. Or I will silently kill you. But yes, getting around you can be fine too! It would not even be necessary to specify what war-tactical implications such instrumentation brings with it. At any time and through the menu that can be consulted by pressing the mouse wheel, it is possible to shoot at monstrous speeds to get around an overly large group of opponents or, if caught by surprise, strengthen oneself so as to suffer less damage and then use super strength to make a spectacular leap towards the enemy, lift him off the ground with his bare hands and throw him away. On the other hand, entire levels, especially the first ones set in the luxuriant nature of a still untouched forest, ask for nothing more than to be walked through in silence and camouflaged in one's own invisibility, remembering that this is limited to a certain number of seconds and is consumed instantly when even a single shot is fired. The available arsenal consists of rifles, pistols, grenades, missile launchers and, in general, of the equipment that it is possible to imagine supplied to the super soldiers of the Delta Force of the near future and to the Korean army of those same years. To make the weapon management system profound, but not at all complex, are the changes that can be made to them: sniper sights, assault sights, spotlights and grenade launchers, but also stun or incendiary bullets and silencers. In short, there are all the resources to create tools sewn on the way of playing that everyone has. As I command you Crysis The CryTek guys have managed to enclose the many information and options necessary for the gplayer in a rather streamlined interface and a command scheme that is also not excessively laborious. Good to know, given that the release of the title under the Games for Windows label has imposed compatibility with the excellent Xbox 360 pad. Obviously the first person sessions take advantage of the mouse and keyboard combination, but also the ergonomic peripheral born on the console manages to guarantee good responsiveness, even proving to be equal when it comes to driving vehicles. If you are therefore in possession of both operating systems, a trial is recommended. Frost falls on the jungle The Crysis single player campaign is, as is now known from the many previews published, divided into parts that can be distinguished by the setting that from time to time you will find yourself traveling. By the way, it is immediately possible to dispel a rather pressing doubt: although the structure of the gameplay, open and approachable to the sandbox genre, is not a little reminiscent of what was experienced in Far Cry, the feeling of repetitiveness that this tended to manifest in the long run is completely absent , making the approximately 10-11 hours of duration of Crysis a compact and boring experience. The whole first part, with the merciless clashes against the Korean forces, is clearly devoted to the exaltation of the work done in the development of the technology underlying the title. The objectives, whether primary or secondary, lead the user to exploit every single resource made available by the nano suit and the graphics-physics engine, alternating clashes between the beaches and the trees  regularly razed to the ground by blows, with consequent and spectacular falls to the ground  to others inside or just outside human structures, be they small camps or huge concrete buildings. Despite this freedom granted, the story progresses credibly and many players will certainly want to replay these first few hours again and again to discover every single viable alternative path, every aspect of the gameplay and all the goodies inserted. Frost falls on the jungle The following lines are the result of a certain indecision about what to do: the intention not to spoil anything is firm, but the need to point out how the turning point taken by the title is not only aesthetic, it is seminal. Therefore, without revealing too succulent details, it is enough to know that the plot undergoes a turning point, the island is incorporated by a sphere inside which everything is frozen and that you will be inside it. The formerly lush jungle is now completely aseptic and, aided by the enemies of the past, you will be asked to move around this spectacular neo-Lapland, defeating the terrible machines sent by the aliens. The action therefore becomes less free, often a substitute for defending one's person from continuous attacks: the means previously optional will now be necessary and a large part of the previously allowed reflective approach goes down the drain in favor of adrenaline and racing at breakneck speed. Two distinct souls, which would then be three, considering the zero gravity sessions inside the spaceship: without dwelling on unwanted details, it is enough to know that the progression towards an increasingly guided level design is maintained, although there will be choices and ways secondary. The level of challenge offered is generally quite high and of the three standard possibilities, the intermediate one is certainly advisable for those facing the game for the first time. At the opposite end of the scale of values is the so-called Delta mode, a nightmare of bullets and continuous loading of saved games, which will put anyone's patience to the test. DirectX 9 or 10? What hardware? The chapter dedicated to the disquisition of the technical sector of Crysis is valid for the guaranteed yield - with a quantity of frames per second slightly under 30 - on a system equipped with a latest generation multi-core processor, a similarly recent video card and a minimum of 2GB of RAM. Obviously based on the models there will be differences and certain settings will have to be raised or lowered, but the splendor remains. For all the others it is necessary to make compromises: the single GB of memory, which becomes 1.5 GB under Vista, required as a minimum system is truly a significant bottleneck and does not allow you to go to resolutions now acquired as standard, let alone the native ones of the increasingly present 22 and 24. The differences between the use of DirectX 9 and 10 are marked especially when the more complex lighting and particle effects are displayed on the monitor, even if by modifying the values of some system files, it is possible to guarantee a rendering similar to that also on XP obtainable on Vista.
