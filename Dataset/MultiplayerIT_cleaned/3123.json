{"name": "Resident Evil 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-4-remake-recensione.html", "text": "The flagship of the Capcom Five project, and the only major commercial success of the five ~exclusives~ initially planned for the GameCube, Resident Evil 4 represented a gigantic watershed for video games at the time, despite having originated from a risky plan. Shinji Mikami himself, its director, doesn't really consider it a horror game: from the beginning, his and his team's intention was to create a much more action-packed game than the rest of the series, and it was precisely that change of direction to ensure its diffusion even among those who did not appreciate its predecessors, as well as inexorably bringing it to a myriad of other platforms. Thinking that its success is only linked to more adrenaline-pumping mechanics would however be a serious mistake: with inconceivable naturalness, the team led by Mikami managed to give life to a video game so well thought out that it became the inspiring muse of the entire third-person shooter genre. The most curious thing? His innovations - combined with the tension generated by the challenging fights - also led a large number of horror to take up concepts and ideas, not a small result if we consider how Mikami has recently stated that he held back a lot during his conception, trying to give priority to the ~producer~ in him instead of the ~creator~. Leon is still a real badass with a tendency to catchphrases in the Resident Evil 4 remake, even if his characterization is much more sensible and realistic At the same time it would be simplistic to reduce the novelties of Resident Evil 4 to just a close-up camera behind Leon, when in reality the game still represents a perfect lesson in map design today, without counting enemies with such spot-on behavioral and positioning routines as to have made iconic many of the most agitated phases of the campaign. And yet we are talking about a production that is now close to twenty years of age, considered perfectible in various aspects even by its creator, especially if we consider the many steps forward of the industry and some risky choices made during its production (it seems that the plot had been written in a few weeks, for one thing). Ample room for improvement have not, however, avoided discussions on the choice of Capcom to devote himself to the remake of Resident Evil 4. On the one hand, many historical fans went into jujube broth immediately after the announcement, more than ever eager to relive the Leon's adventure in renewed form; on the other hand, a fair share of enthusiasts turned up their noses, convinced that Resident Evil 4 didn't need who knows what intervention, or simply that there were games in the series much more in need of a similar operation (Codename Veronica, the more obvious one ). In the unstoppable clamor of the web, someone has even theorized that the game was chosen to make money with a relatively easy job, considering the minor entity of the intervention necessary to modernize the original. Minimally, it must be said, the last point is true: this Resident Evil is still today a very solid and brilliant game, which has lost very little of its charm; only that what Mikami said about the possible improvements was certainly not unsubstantiated, and the fact that some of its features have aged poorly is undeniable, especially in certain specific phases. We therefore tackled everything in the only way in our opinion possible, that is by playing the original title for the umpteenth time in parallel with the remake campaign, so as to compare the two works with the utmost mental freshness. And we can anticipate it immediately: Capcom's new born emerged triumphant from the confrontation, despite an unexpected final disappointment. Today, of course, we will analyze what was played in detail, in our review of Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 4 story and narrative Many characters, including Ashley, have been largely rewritten. Even the phases in the company of the girl are much more pleasant, thanks to a much improved artificial intelligence friend The Resident Evil series has always been pretty hard to pin down narrative-wise. It is certainly a brand loved by millions of players, around which a universe of rare complexity has formed over the years, as well as endless discussions and theories constantly carried forward by fans. At the same time, however, its original inspirations were not only the horror classics, but also the B-movies, and it is therefore far from uncommon to hear cheesy (when not completely insane) dialogues between the various chapters. Many fans appreciate the absurd tightrope that the series has been subjecting them to for years, and Resident Evil 4 is aa prime example of this trend, considering that he chooses to paint Leon in shades of 90s action hero and in doing so he gives some dialogues that are truly memorable for their dullness, despite an overall compelling underlying plot. However, the remakes have decided to follow a new course from a narrative point of view, more refined and serious, albeit not so distant from the exaggerations of the classic series as to completely betray its roots. Capcom's latest remake is no exception to the rule, and here too the adventure of the good Leon S. Kennedy has been largely rewritten with the intention of being more coherent and sensible. Let's be clear, we too loved the protagonist's catchphrases and some of the ridiculous scenes in the final stages of the original campaign, but there's not the slightest doubt that Capcom's changes to the story have been a real lifesaver for the experience. Many of the most ridiculous events have been largely reworked, practically every single character is infinitely better characterized, as well as more present in the story, and what happens to Leon acquires a completely different value once the final bars are reached. And the beauty is that, as mentioned, the general rewrite does not sacrifice the spectacular madness of some iconic moments that there was absolutely no need to cut. It is useless to further elaborate on the situation with unwelcome spoilers, so let's conclude simply by specifying that, as far as we are concerned , the work done on the plot is promoted with full marks, as well as significantly higher than what has been seen in the other remakes. If this is the case, it is seriously the case to be hopeful for the continuation of the saga (and, who knows, maybe a reconstruction from scratch of the fifth and sixth chapter). Contents and structure: complete menu, for two If you are worried about any content cuts in this remake of Resident Evil 4 fear not, the campaign has almost everything that was in the original in an improved form, with hours of additional content that significantly increase its longevity Sailing on the wave of narrative, we believe it is a good and right thing to move on to the structure of the game, also because the creation of a campaign with the same rendering as the original one and without content cuts represents for most fans an indispensable fundamental after the half-disappointment of the remake of Resident Evil 3. We already mentioned it in the introduction, but it bears repeating: the design of the maps and the meticulous positioning of the enemies are some of the main elements that make Resident Evil 4 a masterpiece, and if on the one hand it is not a problem to re-propose some unforgettable battles in a remake without major upheavals (such as the initial village, rendered to perfection), on the other hand, renovating the less successful ones requires considerable talent. It was therefore difficult not to be amazed by what Capcom has done in its latest creation, because all the contents of the game have been approached with the same strategic plan applied to the plot: to improve each badly aged element and expand as much as possible, with the utmost respect for what made it all great. The final result is, in all honesty, incredible, and it is even more noticeable if the two titles are faced in parallel. In the entire campaign, only one thing has been cut - a single boss, in our opinion among the least solid of the original - but the rest has been brought back in an evolved and modernized form, where everything that hasn't withstood the passing of the years has been totally reworked. Seriously, during the progression it may seem that some stages have been eliminated, when instead most of the time they are just recontextualized and appear in other moments of the story in an updated form. What's more, the title is chock full of extras: new fights, significantly lengthened and beefed up stages, and new explorable areas. To give you an idea, if today to finish (again) the original game took us just over eight hours, for the remake it took a good fifteen. Given the high level of Capcom games in recent years, we pretty much assumed that this remake would be more than excellent, but they really outdid themselves here. The unprecedented action sequences boast maps comparable in variety and intelligence to the best of the original game, however with clashes perfectly calculated around the many changes made to the gameplay. And if what was described still wasn't enough, even the few chapters with actual horror potential are more tense and distressing, to the delight of those who have always wanted a partial rapprochement between Resident Evil 4 and those who preceded it. Gameplay: Leon Texas Ranger's phlegmatic dance The knifeo is once again one of the strongest weapons in Resident Evil 4. In this remake it also allows you to perform very useful parries, but be careful to abuse them, because your blade is not indestructible Considering that it represents the backbone of the entire structure, the gameplay of Resident Evil 4 could not have been too distorted by Capcom, and it would actually have been foolish to throw away what Mikami and his companions have done. That said, the remake remains a title remade from scratch with the RE Engine, and this inevitably leads it to be based on a completely different physical system than the game on which it is based; the shooting here is a variant of what was seen in the remake of the second and third chapters, with a different management of aim and movement. To clarify, while in Mikami's Resident Evil 4 it was only possible to shoot from a standstill, but the aim was generally more precise and snappy, in the remake Leon can move freely and even move (albeit fairly slowly) while aiming at the opponent. It is a big advantage during clashes, considering that the enemies are so numerous and very aggressive, yet they tend to have rather phoned attacks and launch projectiles with a predictable trajectory; Capcom has partially compensated for this in two ways: by making the basic movement heavier and slower (although not by much), and by changing the weapon power and resistance of all opponents. In short, the weapons of the remakes don't have the same impact as the original, at least until they are properly upgraded by the game's legendary merchant (who, and we tell you with absolute joy, has even improved). The aiming system is therefore close to that of the other remakes, with a viewfinder whose accuracy decreases in direct proportion to how much you move, as well as a clearer diversification between the various weapons. Even once the characteristics of the various guns have been improved, however, the resistance of the monstrosities of the game tends to be significantly higher than what has been seen in the past (with only a few exceptions): the Ganados practically always require at least two shots to the legs to be thrown to the ground, if hit in the chest by low-potential weapons their movements are not always interrupted, and sometimes they even resist two blows to the head. Considering that the encounters tend to have a comparable number of enemies to that of the original (although in some cases the hordes of opponents are similar or even smaller, to counterbalance) these differences make the game more challenging overall. That arrow on the head means you can perform an execution on a stunned enemy. Use Leon's kicks, because they can instantly get you out of very awkward situations Attention, the renewed dangerousness of the infected does not mean that in this title the brutal executions of Leon are not still an essential element of the gameplay. Indeed, in all probability today the use of these maneuvers is even more important, due to a greater general scarcity of resources. While in the original using the knife strategically and eliminating groups of enemies with suplexes or roundhouse kicks (they inflict big damage, are invulnerable during the animation and hit in an area) guaranteed a huge surplus of bullets, the current Capcom approach is it's brought back to its survival horror roots and it's now more important to conserve ammo, because it's easily purged from the inventory during some hectic fights or boss battles. Once again there seems to be an adaptive difficulty, which evaluates the resources available to the player and changes the quantity and quality of the bullets scattered around the maps based on how many are used, however it has rarely happened to have so much lead available to feel safe, and the possibility of building projectiles with gunpowder found around is not enough to bring the situation back to normal. It is in all probability also because of these factors to be taken into greater consideration that the developers have decided to give Leon powerful additional maneuver, which will be one of the main tools for those who want to avoid any waste: a very effective parry with the knife that allows you to defend yourself from a myriad of different attacks. This is a much more forgiving defensive mechanic than we thought: the window is wide (at least on normal difficulty...), and it repels almost everything thrown at it, even going so far as to parry arrows and deflect Molotov cocktails (if you parry it with right timing a punch, Leon also manages to damage the Ganados by cutting off the limb cleanly); thus described it might seem overly powerful, but in reality Capcom has balanced it", "date": "2023-03-17", "grade": "9.0"}
