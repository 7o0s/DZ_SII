I will understand, but renounce your intentions! Nothing will remain of us... we will darken in a world of light!~, said Shaka of the Virgin to Ikki of the Phoenix, when the latter was about to sacrificing his life to defeat his opponent and allow his friends to continue their race towards the sanctuary of Athena. Okay, the original Japanese dialogue wasn't exactly that courtly, but every time we hear the lines of the historical Italian adaptation, however fallacious, we can't help but get excited. It is the great power of the Knights of the Zodiac, manga and animated series of the 80s that thirty years later continues to be very popular all over the world, to win new fans, to be milked like a cow by Namco Bandai who owns it the rights. In reality, videogames based on Saint Seiya - this is the original title, for the uninitiated - have not been developed many, and certainly many less than what has been made for franchises such as Dragon Ball or even the more modern Naruto . The fans, however, have not diminished, and with the birth of new spin-offs (for example, the recent Saint Seiya Omega) and a new comic series drawn by the author Masami Kurumada, Namco Bandai must have thought that the times they were ripe to take advantage of the gaming market. The Battle of the Sanctuary, 2012, was a decent ~musou~, but the fans wanted to have a happy fight with their favorites, and therefore here comes Brave Soldiers to satisfy them. Darkening in a world of light too. The Knights of the Zodiac deserved a much better fighting game than this... Playstation 3 trophies The list of trophies is substantial: 41 bronze, 8 silver, 2 gold and platinum for those who have obtained them all. Doing it won't be difficult, but it will require some dedication: you will have to complete all the modes, unlock all the bonuses, get the best ratings, etc. The Knights who did the feat For those who don't know who the Knights of the Zodiac are, let's try to clarify things a bit: the basic idea would be that the Greek divinities (and not only...) periodically reincarnate in predestined human beings, so as to be able to continue to carry out their atrocities to the detriment of the planet. Watching over mankind would be the goddess Athena, incarnated in the noble Saori Kido - or lady Isabel, in the Italian style. Athena is protected by an army of warriors (or saints) who fight for her against the forces of evil. Fate has it that Saori is all in all an idiot who constantly gets into trouble: once she is bullseye for an arrow, another time she risks drowning, then she ends up donating blood to the afterlife AVIS clinic, and so on. talking. Five saints of the lowest caste, the ~bronze~ one, always come to save her, led by Seiya, a young man who wears the armor of Pegasus and who is clearly recommended because he always gets to the final boss first of all, punctually takes them, the one then gets tired beating his friends, Seiya gets up, puts on a new armor or channels the power of others and delivers the coup de grace, saving Athena and earning her sweet eyes, while his companions are dead, blind or in a state comatose. Put like this it's a bit funny, it must be admitted, and Saint Seiya follows the tpoi of Japanese anime for children which he also helped to found, but is characterized, above all thanks to an Italian adaptation - literally - from other times, by a charisma and from an epic that is rarely found in Japanese comics nowadays. Most of the characters are far more complex than the judicious little soldiers they appear at first glance, and their tragic history emerges in secret last-team duels that never have a happy ending. Who remembers the wonderful and sad story of the twins Alcor and Mizar? Blessed are those who have raised their hands, because for the God Warriors and the Odin saga, which have always been mistreated in Japan, there is no room in this Story mode which slavishly follows the events of the manga. With a little too much zeal, we dare to say, given that each of the three chapters (the Sanctuary, Poseidon and Hades) is divided into numerous fights that repeatedly involve even the same opponent. Because if Hyoga/Crystal in the manga faced Camus first in the Libra house and then in the Aquarius one, he does it here too. And so you have to fight it twice. And you have to fight Gemini Saga three times: first as Seiya, then as Ikki, then again as Seiya. The fight is always the same, and if it were fun it wouldn't even exhaust, but so be it. Zealous, those of Dimps who developed it, able to let us choose the order in which they faceare a series of fights (first Chrysaor, Baian or Scylla?) but not so much as to offer us more interesting narrative interludes than a large amount of text that follows one another describing the story or reporting the jokes of the heroes involved, simultaneously dubbed in Japanese. In the background the static models of the characters alternate, or the original ~stills~ of the cartoon, which however have not aged very well. In short, a story mode proposed in an incredibly boring way, which risks alienating those players who do not know the saga and who will therefore hardly appreciate its nuances and epic tones. The Italian translation, however, has left us a bit dumbfounded: it is a discreet mixture of original names and classic Italian adaptations, sometimes not even reported correctly. It is a pleasure that some lines, however ~crippled~ in the original Italian edition, have been remembered as they are, but it is less pleasing if the same care has not been reserved for the proposal in its entirety. Another handful, perhaps less interesting but still able to offer a fair variety, is added to the story mode. In addition to the inevitable Training, Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers also allows you to fight against a friend or online in ranked and unranked matches, to face a Survival mode that needs no explanation and to embark on the Galactic Battle, an elimination tournament against CPU or up to seven other players. A few words about the Collector's Edition Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers is also offered in Italy in standard and collector's editions, the latter very similar to the one distributed in Japan, unlike what happened with the previous The Battle of the Sanctuary. In addition to the game, the box contains what shops commonly pass off as a ~figurine~, but which figurine is not: it is a Myth Cloth, a line of action figures that Bandai has been producing for ten years. Myth Cloths are articulated plastic models that can ~wear~ armor made of metal. The Pegasus Seiya in the Collector's Edition, however, belongs to the most recent Myth Cloth EX line: larger dimensions, better joints, more precise proportions and more detailed and cared for armor. As if that weren't enough, the Myth Cloth EX in question is not the same one released in June 2012, but an Original Color Edition version which, faithful to the (non) coloring of the manga, offers a sort of monochrome, and will not be sold separately. The edition is expensive, mind you, but for collectors it could represent an opportunity not to be missed. Too many riders over there ~Yes, well, Brave Soldiers is a fighting game: who cares about the story mode, when I can beat up friends and strangers by controlling the heroes of my childhood?~ We tried to tell ourselves this over and over again, but finally gave up. We just can't. Let's go in order, however, because in this case it is good to start from the positive notes, and that is from the fact that the Knights of Brave Soldiers are extremely faithful to their animated counterpart, thanks also to painstaking modeling, well-finished animations and excellent cel shading . Too bad for that aliasing that is a little too obvious, but let's ignore it. Hats off to Dimps, however, for having ~invented~ the fighting styles and animations of characters, such as Aiolos of Sagittarius or Saori herself with the divine armor of Athena, which we have never seen fight in the animated series. Dimps has reworked and perfected what he did with the two fighting games released for PlayStation 2, and we must also congratulate the way the armor was made, really convincing and pleasant, and the various stages, sufficiently differentiated and characteristic despite the absence of reference or precise details. In short, the characters come to life with a more than good visual quality which makes it even more difficult to swallow the bitter pill of a gameplay that leaks from all sides. We reveal a secret to you, namely that Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers is not a real fighting game, but a kind of ~musou~ passed off as such. At certain times, then, the suspicion that the assets of The Battle of the Sanctuary have been recycled was quite strong, and once you become familiar with a control system in which you jump by pressing the X key, and which allows you to turn freely for the battleground, we had practically the confirmation. The idea would also be excellent, if the problems did not already begin. First, the wayward camera that clumsily follows the action. Second, the shot that when it moves behind our character, or focuseson him from strange angles, it prevents us from evaluating distances well and from carrying out our attacks as we would like. Attacks which, then, are not even many: four or five combos all the same for character and two special moves, which can be activated by pressing the circle button or by pressing the circle button together with L2. Added to these are a handful of maneuvers, such as ~surge attacks~ that fling the enemy away, throws or dashing approaches. Almost all of these special techniques consume a notch of a bar representing our Cosmos, which regenerates over time or can be charged by holding down the L2 key. Also in this case, there is no shortage of conceptual problems, starting with the fact that each fight turns into a real continuous chase, looking for a free moment in which to load the Cosmos to prepare for the next attack. And if you think that seeing two golden knights chasing each other for several seconds in a circular arena without colliding is ridiculous, you are wrong: it is tragicomic. Another problem, then, is the animations and the hitbox of the various attacks, often meaningless or in any case inaccurate. Given that it is not possible to interrupt an opponent's combo except by consuming a bar of Cosmo to do the appropriate dodge, the combos and special moves often fail to bind to each other, with the animation of the opponent thrown away which effectively makes him immune to Pegasus Lightning, Phoenix Wings, and whatnot. Impossible to determine what will hit who, except for ~trial and error~. The Seventh Sense, a bar that charges over time and which once activated slightly boosts our hero, and the Big Bang Attacks, which have nothing to do with Vegeta and which should represent the highlight of each fight, complete the circle: super moves that consume three bars of Cosmo and that trigger a non-interactive cinematic in which our knight's most spectacular and powerful special shot comes to life. Here too, problems: not only are they less effective than they appear, and often not too spectacular as they should be, but the animation that should trigger the shot is so short, obvious and short range that it is almost impossible to hit the target Big Bang attacks if our opponent is moving or is a human being with a minimum IQ. Understanding that one shouldn't expect an ultra-sophisticated combat system for a game based on fan service (but even in this case, Persona 4 Arena and JoJo's Bizarre Adventures HD would have something to teach) and that all in all the fans will have fun, it must be said that Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers also disappoints from another point of view: the roster. Nearly seventy Knights to choose from; a respectable selection, except that a good fifty percent are nothing more than clones, differentiated only in the kinematics of the Big Bang Attack and in the armor worn. Seiya, then, is served up in all rooms: first armor, second armor, third armor, Sagittarius armor, Odin armor, divine armor, piece armor, casual suit, groom suit, summer yukata, night pajamas, Pulcinella costume, and so on. Remove five or six Seiyas, four Shiryu, three Geminis and so on, and the resulting roster is decidedly less impressive, especially if you consider that the various characters are absolutely identical in terms of speed and power of attacks, clones already one of the others that are distinguished only by the few special moves. This last problem is solved by the Cosmic Spheres, ~accessories~ that must be unlocked and then bought with the points earned by fighting in the various game modes, and which, set in special display cases, allow you to customize the characters, perhaps increasing their damage, life energy, the loading speed of the Cosmos and more. The Cosmic Spheres, however, occupy one or more spaces in the display case depending on their power, so it's up to the player to work out the combination that's right for him.", "date": "2013-11-18", "grade": "5.8"}
