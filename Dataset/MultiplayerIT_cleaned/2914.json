It could easily be one of the most dramatic and dark games seen recently, but it hides its inner meanings behind a sort of layered narrative that makes it very fascinating indeed, so much so as to push you to overlook its gameplay flaws to still experience what it can be an impactful experience. It's not often that a game opens up to different interpretations and stimulates a discussion of deep meanings and existential topics, especially when it presents itself on the surface as a simple action adventure with 2D platforming elements, like a sort of narrative-driven metroidvania. Yet Inmost is above all this: a deep, dark and melancholy story, which is progressively revealed through continuous metaphors under the videogame layer, with references that are not immediate and an interpretation that does not necessarily seem univocal, therefore even more stimulating. This is the backbone of the whole Hidden Layer title (nomen omen), which in itself does not offer great ideas at the level of gameplay, beyond some well-thought-out puzzles and the alternation between three characters that varies continuously the pace and style of play. As reported in the first review of Inmost on Apple Arcade, a very particular element is given by the fact of proposing three protagonists chained throughout its 30 levels, each characterized by specific skills and able to face challenges in a different way: a girl who he can move objects, stack them and climb, a mighty knight capable of slashing and grappling from one side of the levels to the other and a rather standard man, who mainly uses his intellect to solve the different puzzles. The design of the scenarios is built specifically to exploit the peculiarities of each character, just as the tone takes on slightly different nuances depending on the protagonist of the scene, while always remaining dark and disturbing. Three stories and three gameplays The three characters determine important variations in the gameplay and consequently also in the level design, given that their alternation is studied and foreseen by the unfolding of events, not free. The little girl is more set on simple environmental puzzles related to reaching certain areas of the map, the knight is all about combat while the parts with the bearded man are the more balanced ones, which could be assimilated to the classic mixture of metroidvania characteristics. The more action-oriented parts, such as the knight's fights, the man's platform elements or those in which speed and timing are required, do not particularly shine, remaining rather simple and rough, denoting how this is a more reflective title, but it must be said that on the console the big defect that invalidated the iOS version, i.e. the control system, is largely corrected: the use of the pad is certainly more suitable for Inmost than the touch screen and this represents a big step forward , even more on Nintendo Switch where the use of traditional commands is still associated with the portability of the experience. The mixture of dark fantasy, realistic and surreal elements which is the basis of the construction of the game world and of the particular narration is also found in the structure of the game itself, which inserts logical puzzles in contexts characterized by fantastic outlines, in this way making unpredictable and different game situations. Although the impression is that the game structure could have benefited more from a clearer trend towards pure adventure, the sense of constant threat given by the enemies scattered throughout the levels serve to keep the tension high and the general tone dark, while the combat phases above all have a cathartic role within the complex narrative, also giving an important characterization to the character of the knight and his hidden alter-ego. Ultimately, from the mix of features what comes out is, as we also reported in the review of the iOS version, really something similar to classic action adventures such as Another World or Flashback. An illustrated tale The graphics of Inmost could be defined as expressionist, taking up characteristics that seem typical of that cinematographic avant-garde of the early 1900s: the whole visual representation is built to underline the sense of anguish, sadness and melancholy that shines through astory all about pain and the faint hope that always risks succumbing. The exclusive use of shades of gray, green or blue depending on the various levels and portions of the story told manages perfectly to build a very particular aesthetic and to bend the graphic representation to the desire to convey certain feelings. Even the scenario, therefore, is part of this kind of allegorical narration that characterizes all of Inmost, in a reworking of past memories and events filtered through an almost dreamlike vision, which goes well with the style adopted. The atmospheres are always twilight, with generally dark scenarios illuminated by lamps or soft lights, playing with chiaroscuro which enhances the sense of insecurity and threat, also given the composition of the enemies which seem to be made of shadows. The 2D pixel art graphic style is simple but very expressive, adapting particularly well to the use in the portable version of Nintendo Switch, with some uncertainties in terms of scrolling and general fluidity but which do not affect the use that much. It is perhaps not the most inspired pixel art that has been seen among the many examples found in the indie field, but it is part of a very coherent vision of the game also in terms of artistic direction, creating a particular and surreal world.", "date": "2020-09-06", "grade": "8.0"}
