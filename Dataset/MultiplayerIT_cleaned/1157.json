{"name": "Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders: Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kingdom-under-fire-the-crusaders-recensione.html", "text": "Race stories The events of Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders (henceforth KUFTC) take place in a world with typically fantasy-medieval traits, inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, but above all by the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. The story takes up that of the prequel released on PC, and revolves around an ancestral conflict between humans and the dark legions, made up of elves, vampire men and orcs. The player is free from the beginning to choose the desired faction, selecting the respective generals between Gerald (humans) and Lucretia (dark elves). Each of them has distinctive characteristics, a peculiar fighting style and its own narrative plot, which unfolds through specific scenarios, in order to facilitate the replayability of the title. As if that weren't enough, there are two additional factions to unlock, so the player will be able to try his hand at four distinct campaigns. Once you have chosen your commander, we will take command of a real infantry unit, led by the general and two gregarious officers. These two support figures play a very important role. While not being able to control them directly, the player will be able to take advantage of their abilities, using their special shots in the most critical situations. The latter fulfill a function equivalent to the smart bomb of a shooter: they are visually spectacular and inflict a high amount of damage, but they can only be performed after the accumulation of experience points earned in battle, so it will be up to the player to choose the moments best suited to use them. Part Rts, part Action KUFTC is a mix between a real-time strategy (RTS), an RPG and an action game with strong hack'n slash grafts, clearly inspired by KOEI's Dynasty Warriors, but with greater depth. The structure of the game alternates between navigating the three-dimensional map, including management menus for your troops, and the actual battlefield. Once the logistical movements have been decided, the player is called to overcome missions of increasing difficulty, filtered by dialogues in pure jrpg style between our general, the two commanders and various minor characters. The missions are managed through a dual control system, the first used for movement and collective actions, the second for direct combat. In both cases, the key mapping to the pad is well implemented, offering a system that is easy to assimilate, but not without depth. the key mapping to the pad is well implemented, offering a system that is easy to assimilate, but not without depth Part Rts, part Action As you progress through the game, numerous support troops will become available, including archers and cavalry, which will be strategically exploited to ambush enemies, often and willingly present in much greater quantities than the troops under our command. Whatever happens, the player will be able to manage the frontal conflict only with the infantry led by the general on duty, in this case the game turns into a real mass fighting game with white weapons, not without devastating combos and a parry system that will have to be assimilated in the best possible way to emerge victoriously from clashes. The main objective will be to look after the health of the captain, the only one directly commanded, as his departure will instantly lead to game over. In case of danger, it is possible to attempt an escape from the battle site, otherwise the player will not be able to leave the perimeter area used for the battle, until he manages to defeat all the opponents, or their captain. A difficult battle The Rts aspects take on a fundamental importance in moments of rest between one mission and another. In the aforementioned game map, it is possible to manage the troops allied with the player, using the experience points to improve their skills, and the money to buy better equipment and weapons. Although more simplified than a classic Rts, this part turns out to be profound and satisfying, even if the small amount of experience points does not allow an adequate setup for the proposed challenges, a deficit that aggravates a somewhat questionable choice of programmers: the inability to save during the missions. This feature makes the title frustrating at times, as it will not be uncommon to lose the game at the end of a long mission (on average the duration of these is considerable), with the disheartening prospect of having to repeat it all over again. The management of the fights, albeit choreographically spectacular, has its greatest weaknesses precisely in the smug celebration of the chaos in battle. The player often finds himself disoriented among hundreds of denemies and a framing system that is not always comfortable. Although these are fully adjustable, the time spent finding an advantageous view makes our character vulnerable to attacks, with the obvious consequences of the case. The scripted nature of the missions does not help in this sense, which unfold along a series of predefined events and crucial actions suggested by the CPU. Although it is possible to interpret the methods to fulfill the objectives in one's own way, making a mistake in the aforementioned actions leads to an almost always disastrous outcome. A difficult battle Like in a movie Graphically KUFTC is definitely something to show friends, and does full justice to the Xbox hardware. Phantagram has worked hard on the graphics engine, one of the few capable of handling an impressive amount of characters on the screen (more than 100 at the same time), even large ones, without sacrificing a single detail. Efforts are concentrated on armor and special effects, both of high quality, less on the scenarios and terrain textures, which are much more simplified. But on the other hand, the player has very little time to notice them. The clashes take on spectacular levels that are difficult to describe in the review, simply, you have to see them to understand how much this title manages to recreate the visual majesty of the films inspired by the Lord of the Rings. The clashes take on spectacular levels that are difficult to describe in the review, simply, you have to see them A difficult battle The framerate only suffers drops in extremely chaotic situations, but nothing dramatic. The direction in the cut scenes is also beautiful, with many touches of class such as the steadycam that follows the clashes, or the drops of water that settle on the camera! The chromatic choice is absolutely breathtaking, with warm tones and successful meteorological effects, also functional to the clashes (the archers can be blinded by the sun's rays). The audio department deserves a separate mention for the bizarre choice made by the programmers, who decided not to fall back on epic-chivalric themes, but to entrust all the sound to a western team outside Phantagram, the Voice of The Arts. Anyone who knows this group knows that they work closely with film companies, a choice probably dictated by the need to give the title a filmic, brutal and irreverent impact. The songs have a distinctly metal, aggressive style, with wild guitar riffs that highlight the spectacularity of each blow and exalt the player, even if the choice of using an adrenaline-pumping soundtrack penalizes the most dramatic moments in the story. The English dubbing is bizarre, not without irony and decidedly strong terms. The Italian subtitles of the European version soften some expressions, such as ~bitch~ transformed into a much more harmless ~megera~. However, the lip of the dialogues is poorly made, evidently based on the Korean ones, the moments in which the characters open their mouths without saying a word are not uncommon. War Online Another very important (not to say crucial) aspect of KUFTC is the Live support, which offers the possibility of clashing with a human opponent by choosing the preferred faction. The online mode explores all the potential of the Phantagram title, much more than the single player does, which is why we strongly recommend its use. There is only to be hoped for a response from the users, and relative filling of the lobbies. Comment Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders took a long time to wait, but the Phantagram work is finally an exclusive reality for the crusader console, and is ready to make converts. Graphically spectacular, charismatic and remarkably aggressive, this successful hybrid draws on the best of Dynasty Warriors, adapting it to the dynamics of an RTS with enviable simplicity of controls. A tough title, sometimes frustrating due to its difficulty, penalized by some questionable gameplay choices, but certainly courageous, original and engaging. An almost mandatory purchase for all fans of the genre (and others), as well as being an excellent starting point for any sequels. The single player mode doesn't do full justice to all of KUFTC's potential, leading us to strongly recommend trying the online mode. Pros: Great graphics Effective mix of action and strategy Energetic soundtrack Live support Cons: Massive chaos causes confusion Some missions frustrating Sometimes cameras become problematic November promises to be a particularly interesting month for the Microsoft console. The appeal of the most awaited titles does not lack the first major project exclusively from the Korean softhousena Phantagram, released in stores these days thanks to Koch Media. We have finally tested the final version, and we must admit that it keeps intact the great expectations aroused in us by the beta test.
