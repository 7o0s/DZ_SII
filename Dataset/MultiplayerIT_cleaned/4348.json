He has demonstrated this on several occasions, especially with the Tropico series, which has sold millions of copies, always (or almost) finding critical and public acclaim. Despite this, the Bulgarian boys have hardly ended up in the spotlight, probably because they have given their best with products that are not in tune with the tastes of the masses and because up to now they have relied on publishers who have not valued them enough. With Surviving Mars things could finally change, especially if Paradox, their new publisher, intends to manage the product as done with Cities: Skylines and with most of its major strategy series. We have not mentioned the title of Colossal Order at random, because Surviving Mars is in fact a city management, only set on Mars. This is no small difference, because the development team had to study a series of specific rules to give the best idea of what it could mean to colonize the red planet, making it habitable. In short, don't expect to start playing and immediately start building roads and buildings. There's more to do first. Preparing Mars for humans As soon as the game starts we have to decide whether to dedicate ourselves to a quick game or whether to configure our colonization mission by choosing from different options. For example, we can select the profile of the commander to have different bonuses, choose the raw materials to take with us and the area of Mars where we will establish our colony. If desired, it is also possible to customize some secondary aspects, which have no influence on the game, such as the mission logo or the name of the rocket that will take us to our destination, but they are details. More relevant is the choice of sponsor, who will guarantee us a certain amount of initial funds. All these decisions will result in a greater or lesser difficulty of the mission. Once on Mars, we will have to choose where to land our first rocket, paying close attention to the surrounding area. Each selectable sector has a quadrant that has already been discovered and others that must be scanned to discover its resources. Choosing the landing site well is important for several reasons, the main one being the proximity of resources. But let's explain better. In the early stages of each game there are no humans to manage: the planet must be prepared by automated drones who must take care of making the area habitable, accumulating resources and making sure that water and oxygen are available when the sentient bipeds arrive. The problem with drones is that they have a limited range, tied to their control center, which can be a station, a self-propelled vehicle or a rocket itself. For this reason, landing too far from resources can make it difficult, if not impossible, to collect them. The resources belong to three macro categories: surface deposits, quarries and underground deposits, with the latter being able to be exploited only with the appropriate technologies and with the presence of humans. In addition to the accumulation of materials, there are other things to do before humans arrive: for example, an adequate amount of electricity must be produced, through solar panels, wind turbines or various generators, and the planet must be explored, examining its anomalies with an exploration vehicle (unlocking technologies and other bonuses). In addition to this, it is also necessary to start scientific studies, selecting them among five different branches (biotechnology, engineering, robotics, physics and social sciences). The research carried out mainly serves to make more efficient use of available resources and to unlock new structures. Specializing or balancing knowledge is up to the player. The settlers arrive The settlers, who arrive aboard passenger rockets (different from cargo rockets), enter the game when essential objectives have been achieved: in addition to producing water, food and oxygen, it is in fact necessary to build large domes, in which they can live. The domes must in turn be equipped with internal structures that guarantee survival and a dignified life for all. In addition to the housing modules, therefore, it is possible, for example, to create an infirmary, which is used to treat the sick, or a restaurant, where one can eat, or shops of various types or embellishments such as fountains and artificial lakes. Note that the domes offer limited construction space and, as the colony develops, it becomes essential to build new ones, to have all the structures necessary to defend against the dangers of Mars, such as sandstorms, meteorites and waves of frost. In addition to constructing buildings outside and inside the domes, Surviving Mars orIt also offers goals to achieve. Some are standard, such as having a certain number of settlers or accumulating a given amount of resources, while others are linked to the so-called ~Mysteries~, i.e. stories that form the background for managing the colony and which produce their effects especially in the advanced stages . Let's say that it is a way to better characterize the matches in the form of special events and which, while not upsetting the basic formula, helps to create if not unique, at least different situations. Some final considerations Technically Surviving Mars is in line with the standards of the genre, even if the quality of the buildings seemed slightly below that of titles such as Cities: Skylines. It is true that we are talking about two completely different planets, but a few more details would not have hurt. However the graphics engine turned out to be fluid and stable even in the presence of many inhabited domes on the map and, to be honest, some of the landscapes that arise from the fusion of Martian geography with the colonies are not bad at all and are magnified by the photo mode. which allows you to indulge yourself in capturing images. The transition from day to night is also pleasant which, in addition to causing problems in terms of colony management, makes some glimpses even more fascinating. For the rest, immediate support for mods is appreciated, which we imagine will not be long in coming (at the time of write the review of course there weren't any to try). If we want, the only real flaw of Surviving Mars is the lack of content, which manifests itself above all in the advanced stages of the game. It is true that when the problems with the settlers start to arise, we end up thinking mainly about how to handle the situation and we forget a little that we only have a handful of buildings available, but a greater variety, perhaps inside the domes, it wouldn't hurt. Our hypothesis is that, if successful, Haemimont Games will expand its game through a copious number of DLCs, as it did with the last two Tropicos. Since this is the policy adopted by Paradox itself for most of its titles, we do not believe this is a risky hypothesis. Let's just hope there are free additions as well.", "date": "2018-03-15", "grade": "8.5"}
