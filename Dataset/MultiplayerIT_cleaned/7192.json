In fact, calling this port ~rebirth~ is a bit of an exaggeration, but it certainly isn't for all players of the PlayStation 3 version who, by switching to the client for the new Sony console, will be able to say goodbye to the noticeable drops in frame rates. to the very long loads and unsatisfactory resolution that prevented them from fully enjoying the experience. Moreover, the launch of A Realm Reborn on PlayStation 4 is also significant for other reasons: firstly, it is still an MMORPG for consoles, a couple that has rarely gone hand in hand over the years, and secondly, it is the first MMORPG for consoles next gen, a real forerunner of a small revolution that will continue in the coming months with the multi-platform The Elder Scrolls Online. Not to mention that new players of Final Fantasy XIV will embark on an adventure that has greatly improved on the already excellent launch of last September, thanks to the two huge updates released during these six months. We therefore want to make a quick summary of the game, before examining the PlayStation 4 version: if you want to know much more, we invite you to read our very long and exhaustive original review, as well as the two specials dedicated to the same number of updates, entitled A Realm Awoken and Through the Maelstrom. Yoshida has kept his promise: Final Fantasy XIV for PlayStation 4 is just a great sight! Playstation 4 trophies Hats off if you decide to embark on the platinum race, unlockable after obtaining twenty bronze, fifteen silver and three gold trophies: some are obtained quite easily by completing certain missions or crafting some objects, but others will take you a long time with decidedly more demanding requirements. A thousand leverquests? A thousand picks? A hundred dungeon raids? Congratulations! The game Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, and this means that the player controls his own avatar in a world, that of Hydaelin, populated by NPCs, monsters and players just like him. There is of course a Final Fantasy-style plot that we will follow in our run to the level cap: it begins five years after the destruction caused by Bahamut, summoned by the same Garlean empire that we believed defeated and which is instead returning to haunt the continent of Eorzea where our adventures take place. In reality, the threat is even more sinister and also involves the elemental deities - the so-called Primals - and an ancient cult of beings with supernatural powers who plot in the shadows. They are opposed by a large cast of supporting actors, old and new acquaintances who will entrust us with tasks and reward us if necessary. The missions of the main plot, often characterized by fully voiced cinematic sequences, are accompanied by hundreds of secondary enterprises that will lead us to explore the game world: among them the FATE also stand out, public missions in which all players in the interested area can participate and which repeat cyclically in each map. After creating our alter ego with a fairly satisfactory editor, the adventure begins by practicing a particular profession among the various proposals being created. Don't worry, however, because the Armory system is already unlocked at level 10, which allows you to change class simply by equipping a different weapon: holding a pike you become a spearman, for example, while a nice bow will turn you into archers, and etc. Each class gives different skills, some of which - once learned - can also be used by other classes, giving a fair variety in terms of builds. Furthermore, at level 30, the classes can be ~evolved~ into the famous Jobs of the franchise, so that the spearman becomes Dragoon, the archer Bard and so on: each of them respects the classic archetypes of theme park MMORPGs, with some Jobs designed to heal, others to deal damage, and still others to take blows from enemies. The so-called role-playing ~trinity~ is the basis of a large progression based on dungeons and raids for four, eight or twenty-four players, increasingly difficult and profitable: the endgame, once level 50 is reached, is now made up of a number sensational of challenges and battles to be faced exclusively in company to improve one's equipment and continue the story. In case you don't know anyone with whom affrfter them, or you haven't joined any guild, in most cases you can use a convenient menu called Duty Finder which assembles the groups automatically or a special bulletin board, the Party Finder, which allows you to create, manage or consult the various events organized by the players. In short, there is no shortage of variety, but the endgame can prove to be a bit repetitive in accumulating points to buy new items or in crossing your fingers in the hope of winning the loot from the boss you just defeated. Fortunately, Final Fantasy XIV also offers a substantial array of secondary activities designed precisely to expand the content offer: among them the additions of the two major patches stand out, such as treasure hunts and an expensive as well as complete housing for the guilds. As a corollary, there is also one of the best crafting systems on the market, a game within a game in which each profession is a real class in its own right: crafting any object requires a lot of attention and the use of special skills and bonuses almost as if you were in a fight. Crafting is a component that is both expensive and profitable, which gives a lot of satisfaction when you finally manage to reach the highest levels and the market for precious objects. From this point of view, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn has pleasantly impressed us with the degree of autonomy it offers to the player. Most of the endgame content has to be tackled in a group, it is true, but solo players will still be able to have their say thanks to the smooth curve of difficulty and challenges that offers a wide variety of rewards for all tastes. As for the perplexities and problems reported in the review last September, for example the annoying one of the latency compensation, we have seen how Naoki Yoshida's team has worked hard to solve almost all of them between one patch and another. Some critical issues remain in terms of game design (the impossibility of growing a second or third class with the quests already completed, for example, or the PvP that definitely needs to be reviewed) but today A Realm Reborn is a very complete MMORPG rich in content , especially true to the spirit of the Final Fantasy franchise. In short, new players will literally embark on this adventure with an extra gear. Subscription yes, subscription no A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG with a monthly subscription: after the first thirty days of free trial, you will have to pay 12.99 a month (discounted in three- and six-month packages) to continue playing, without having to pay for the PlayStation Plus service Network. We don't want to go into the merits of the controversy, in our opinion quite sterile, about ~paying to play~, but it is something that PC gamers have been living with for years, especially in the field of MMORPGs, and we realize that for console users it can be somewhat traumatic news. It is worth clarifying, however: in the thirty-day free trial it is possible to easily reach the maximum level and complete the first part of the adventure, thus enjoying a Final Fantasy with all the trappings and with a quite satisfying ending . We are talking about an experience of at least thirty or forty hours of play, in line with what is offered by many other productions. Being an MMORPG, however, A Realm Reborn does not end there, and anyone who wants to embark on the so-called endgame will find that they have hundreds of hours of gameplay ahead of them, especially enhanced by a good group of friends to spend them with and further extended by more or less quarterly updates that add new items, features and challenges. From this point of view, even just paying the monthly fee to go back to playing with a new patch could be considered as a DLC, don't you think? With the small difference that a normal ten euro or so DLC offers a scant ten hours of gameplay, if you're lucky, while a month of A Realm Reborn allows virtually dozens of hours of gameplay to be exploited when and how you want. The PlayStation 4 version The PlayStation 3 incarnation of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn had made us turn up our noses mostly due to the limits that the last generation had imposed on Naoki Yoshida's inspiration. The exquisite art direction and attention to detail had been reproduced at the price of a highly unstable frame rate, especially in the frequent cases where numerous players gathered in the same spaces. Despite the patches and adjustments of the past months, some events - such as the most populated FATEs, King Behemoth and Odin in primis - have remained practically unplayable on PlayStation 3 and the length of the uploads has given rise to real~meme~ within the playing community. ~Did the tank go down?~, we sometimes read at the beginning of a dungeon, and even more often someone replied: ~it will be a PlayStation 3 player, LOL~. The lower resolution, on the other hand, had ended up ruining some beautiful glimpses of a world that the artists of Square Enix were committed to taking care of in detail, preventing PlayStation 3 users from fully appreciating the graphics of A Realm Reborn , certainly not avant-garde but still embellished with simply amazing stylistic choices and in terms of polygonal modeling. Therefore, once the PlayStation 4 client was installed and launched (which, we remind you, is free for those who make the irreversible transition from the PlayStation 3 version) we were impressed by the visual quality achieved by the game on the new console, very similar to that achieved by a good PC with maximum graphics settings. The 1080p image is naturally much more defined and the anti-aliasing gives a real sense of cleanliness that almost changes the cards on the table. Even the colors appeared noticeably more alive than the PlayStation 3 client, but maybe it was tears in the eyes. On the frame rate front, some uncertainty remains: in the most populated areas, such as for example the centers of aggregation such as the capitals or the small square of Revenant Toll, the game tends to trudge slightly, even if it does not reach worrying levels. We tested the Crystal Tower environment, with its twenty-four players and numerous enemies and the riot of visual effects, and we didn't find any annoying dips, except for some uncertainty in the really critical moments. As far as loading is concerned, the waiting time has been drastically reduced, but in some cases we had the feeling that it took a bit longer compared to the PC version, especially when moving to densely populated areas. A decidedly promoted port, therefore, even if the improvements proposed in terms of interface did not make us cry out for a miracle: the controls via joypad still require good practice but return a decidedly satisfying action game sensation in the case of ~combat~ classes. however, proving very impractical when it comes to changing targets or healing one's companions. Fortunately, it is possible to connect the mouse and keyboard to the console and play a bit like you would on a PC, also changing the style of the interface which, in the console version, appears a little more invasive. Without infamy or praise, however, the integration of the controls via touch pad of the DualShock 4, which allow you to move a pointer similar to that of a mouse on the screen: the small size of the touch pad makes pointer control rather imprecise, only useful in case you want to highlight something more precisely and in a moment of relative tranquility. On the other hand, the possibility of sharing photos and videos with the Share button is much more pleasant: MMORPGs are games capable of giving truly memorable moments, especially in the company of friends. For years, PC MMO players have loved recording their adventures or immortalizing the most significant moments and then posting them on forums and social networks, and the Share button allows you to do the exact same thing in a very few moments. For the record, all the photos accompanying this article were taken with our client and posted on Facebook! Finally, it is worth mentioning the support for remote play via PlayStation Vita: it works, and damn well too, although perhaps it relegates a little too many functions to the rear touch pad which, in itself, isn't exactly very comfortable. By setting the interface appropriately, however, it is perfectly possible to play on the small OLED screen, perhaps without getting bogged down with the more demanding content.", "date": "2014-04-14", "grade": "9.0"}
