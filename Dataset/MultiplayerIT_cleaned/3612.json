{"name": "Birth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/birth-recensione.html", "text": "Last year's Day of the Devs event presented several independent video games that aroused our interest, some of which have already been released and have pleasantly confirmed themselves as high quality products: for example, this is the case of A Little to the Left, a collection of puzzles all based on domestic tidying, in the name of a zen and relaxed atmosphere. Among the products presented to the public on that occasion was also Birth, developed by a single person. Madison Karrh, who is based in Chicago, has obtained the support of WINGS Interactive for Birth, a fund aimed at financing projects from female developers or those belonging to marginalized categories. After completing this very particular puzzle game, we can state that the WINGS committee is had seen far: Karrh confirms herself as the bearer of a very original artistic style - Birth is entirely hand drawn - which develops what has already been seen in her previous work, Landlord of the Woods, exponent of the same videogame genre and strong with a 97% of positive reviews on Steam. We appreciated the Birth theme and its light and never too complex puzzles, capable of transporting us to a surreal and gloomy world, painted however with a sweet and delicate touch. We tell you about this curious puzzle game in our review of Birth. Building a friend Birth's characters are macabre and surreal, but always maintain a great underlying sweetness and humanity ~Crowded cities fill me with loneliness.~ These are the very first words of Birth, with which Karrh introduces us to the main theme of the game: finding a way to fill the sense of emptiness given by contemporary cities, in which contact with one's neighbor is often essential until a few decades ago and still alive in the more modest-scale settlements, he is completely lost. We can define in the initial editor the aesthetics of the protagonist of Birth, a bird-like being with a skeletal head and empty eye sockets. As already mentioned, Madison Karrh's style, based on sober color tones and with backdrops and characters drawn by hand, is one that is remembered. Bars, museums, painting workshops are full of humanoids with exposed bones and organs, hybridized with animals of various kinds, engaged in normal human activities: admiring a painting, sipping a coffee, having a chat with a loved one. The protagonist of the story is looking for a way to be able to build a companion with whom to spend his time: here we are off to an all-urban adventure that will lead us to collect bones and organs to compose the friend of our dreams, crossing various environments and getting to know many characters with crazy aesthetics. Urban puzzles Birth celebrates the beauty of little things and creative work: herbs and flowers grow from an old typewriter Over the course of the two hours it takes to complete Birth, we find ourselves entering the buildings of an imaginary city to help its inhabitants solve problems big and small. We do this by tackling puzzles that are often connected to each other, always of short duration and of a different nature: sometimes we compose a puzzle; others we play dominoes, connecting tiles with the same symbols; still others we have to take tokens out of the arms of a character who is busy smoking a cigarette on the balcony of his house. The clues are always visual and often require the linking of objects and situations found in the same context, without the aid of texts. The situations in which we are placed by Karrh are frequently surreal, and this can occasionally leave us disoriented: ~ordinary~ logic does not always work to direct us towards the solution. Fortunately, a few attempts and a little reflection are always enough to get us out of any impasse. There is no shortage of optional sections, unlockable using tokens: sometimes they will lead us to admire new environments, while on other occasions they will activate the functioning of elements present in the scenario, such as a carousel made of skeletal horses. They're small things, sure, but Birth is a game made exactly to enhance the beauty of what usually goes unnoticed, whether it's insects, entrails or a handshake with a stranger. Thus, returning the vegetables to a skeletal greengrocer, helping a pharmacist fill a vase with mysterious pebbles, giving a scolopendra as a bracelet to a girl or helping a character to recompose his face will lead us to get what we are looking for: bones and organs to being able to create the friend of our dreams. Birth is essentially this: a sequence of puzzles aimed at achieving our goal, in which the real proThe protagonist of the scene is the surreal and macabre vision, but at the same time sweet and relaxing, brought into play by Madison Karrh. Too bad only for a final section (the one in which we will compose our partner) less successful than the puzzles of the first part of the game; moreover, in our opinion the basic message of Birth - the completely human need to have contacts and affections in dehumanizing contexts such as those of big cities - is not always in focus during the game, which does not present narrative developments and often does not it carries, within the enigmas, the thought that is at its basis. In Birth, even a seemingly ordinary post office hosts bizarre visions and situations, with the need to solve various puzzles connected to each other Part of the pleasantness of Birth comes from its soundtrack, tender and gentle, and in particular from the main theme music, made of melancholy and soft synthesizer tones. Although it is a small production, there is an Italian translation. In any case, the screen texts are very few and, as we have seen, the main focus of Birth is the resolution of puzzles based on visual, non-textual clues.", "date": "2023-02-16", "grade": "7.5"}
