{"name": "Pata Pata Pata Pon!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/patapon-2-recensione.html", "text": "All those who have played the first chapter of Patapon will certainly remember how subtly its elementary rhythms entered the brain to continue to resonate there as a sort of frenetic mantra. Now is the time to go back to playing the role of a God to escort our rhythmic eyes on their perilous journey towards Fineterra, to the rhythm of the well-known Pon Pon Pata Pon and similar. For those who have never played the first chapter of the successful series on PSP (as well as suggesting you fix it) let's briefly explain what we have in our hands: Patapon 2 is the sequel, both in terms of plot and game mechanics, of a rhythm game with strategic elements that leads us to move in horizontally scrolling 2D schemes of troops of men essentially made of eyes with arms and legs engaged in their journey towards the end of the world, where they will be able to see ~that thing~. We are their God, our communications with the Patapon people are mediated by the priestess Meden. But we are also the generals of our armies and to lead our troops into battle we will use precise rhythmic combinations to beat in time with the drums. Each of the four keys on the PSP represents a drum: the Pon, the Pata, the Chaka and the Don. In this way the ~Pata Pata Pata Pon~ (three pressures on the square button and one on the circle button) will be used to advance the troops, the ~Pon Pon Pata Pon~ to attack and so on. We salute the great being! After watching a short presentation film that bridges the events of the first chapter and the development of the plot of this second, we find ourselves carrying out the now familiar actions: give a name to our God and carry out the very short tutorial phase who teaches us to use the drums and to recover our first troops. The sensation of finding ourselves in a sort of Patapon 2.0 is immediate, an almost identical version of the formula that had decreed the success of the original chapter expanded by numerous additional options and modes. First we find the inclusion of three levels of difficulty and the possibility of importing the data saved by the first Patapon, for those who have kept them. We find a reconstructed Patapolis and the usual scheme of ~ribbon~ scrolling levels, the first of which (also acting as a tutorial) is the classic hunting level. The classes are the same as always, with the Hatapon standard-bearer, archers and spearmen and soldiers, very useful as ~tanks~. Among the advanced ones we find the knights and the ~pancioni~, the Dekapon. The Megapons, i.e. the flutists, also return to re-propose their presence. However, there are three new classes to give variety to the game: the Toripon, flying knights, the Mahopon, a sort of sorcerer, and the Robopon enhanced with fist weapons. However, the key to the success of this second chapter is inherent in the figure of the Patapon heroes: these are single units equipped with devastating special abilities that are activated with the well-known concept of ~Fever~, translated this time with ~Folle~ and can be equipped with more than one hundred hero masks. Insane mode is triggered if we beat the drums in sequence with precision, while a degree of semi-perfection triggers the ability of the hero who can be chosen, in each mission, among all the classes and levels developed by us in the game. The rhythm in the blood If in the first chapter maintaining the pace was essential for the success of the missions, thanks to the maintenance of the Insane mode which increases the attack and defense powers of the Patapons, in this sequel the development of the Patapons themselves also counts a lot, much more complex and rich of strategic elements of the original title. If in the latter, in fact, in addition to obviously equipping them with the weapons recovered in the levels, the Patapon could simply be increased in level using the materials found, in this sequel it becomes more complex. In fact, in Mater, that is the tree of life from which we generate troops, it is possible to evolve individual soldiers through a tree system which, in addition to the level, opens access to different types of Patapon. Each subclass has special characteristics in both resistances and special attacks. Each of these can be evolved up to the tenth level, in which it takes its final form. This opens up a truly vast series of game strategies and tactics and opens the door to the real sore point of the game: farming. In order to find the titanic number of elements needed to cope with such a large number of evolutions, it is in fact necessary to repeat the same levels infinitely. Fortunately however, although this is a really important part of the game, compared to the first chapter, the possible variants for finding dethe materials has been expanded, both by adding more neighbors to Patapolis and by inserting multiplayer modes. In the first case, that of the neighbors, these are musical mini-games in which we have to try our hand at playing the toes of a child stone giant like a sort of xylophone to get the stones, in making a bell dance in time, in forging metals or produce nutritious soups to take into battle, and so on. The minigames see, compared to the first chapter, the inclusion of levels of difficulty which, increasing from time to time, allow you to obtain better and better materials. In the Paraget temple, on the other hand, we access the new multiplayer modes present which mainly serve to recover masks to be worn by the heroes but are also useful for the collection of materials. In the Paraget temple you have access to four different game modes: one in solo, which is basically a single player with computer-guided characters who join us; one where we host multiplayer via Wi-Fi and one where we can join a game hosted by another player; finally a shared game mode locally. All modes support up to four players. However, only the mode in which we are hosts and carry the egg will allow us to access its content, i.e. the masks for the heroes. The eggs are basically unlockable for the various bosses that we find along the way in the story mode, the various bosses and the main monsters. By defeating them in story mode they will release the egg in question which will enrich the multiplayer catalog by making itself accessible. Each monster can only be attacked by a team of four heroes and will be killed in a certain amount of time. If we are successful we will access the next phase represented by a rhythmic mini-game of gradual difficulty. If we succeed in this one too, we will get our reward in masks and materials. More of the same, with strengths and weaknesses The game, for those who loved it in its first chapter, will certainly be a very welcome homecoming that will give us all the enthusiasm of the alchemy that made the experience of the first Patapon precious, enriched by a series of new elements that are presented but like a double-edged sword. In fact, if on the one hand the complexity of the game has been increased by managing to add variety both in the gameplay and in the farming methods, on the other hand the path of extreme immediacy that made the first chapter an excellent ~hit and run~ has been abandoned. The problem of excessive grinding, which can become tiring in the long run, has not been resolved: on the contrary, it has been chosen to feed it in order to support the truly enormous expenses necessary for the evolution of our troops. In parallel, however, the large number of possibilities for finding materials allows us not to fossilize on the same perennial unique and well-beaten hunting ground but to also try our hand at the most extreme farming in a series of challenges that do not make the experience tedious and frustrating. A balance that we feel we can espouse as the key to renewed success. A defect that instead has been chosen to inherit from the first chapter remains that of the absence of an indicator of the life points of the bosses we face. A detail that would have had a decidedly focal importance in certain clashes where a different set up of the troops, both in terms of training and equipment, could make the difference. On the other hand, never being aware of the percentage of completely reached in the attempts to kill the most difficult bosses or the impossibility of adopting different rhythm strategies depending on the same can be considered a limitation. In the technical realization, in the atmospheres, in the same playability and replayability we find ourselves on the other hand a little gem that is confirmed among the best titles in the Sony portable playground.", "date": "2009-03-30", "grade": "8.9"}
