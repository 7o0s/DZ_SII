The rally experience of the French developer, KT Racing, arrives on the market while the final stage of the world championship is staged in Japan. A year that has reserved some important news, above all the introduction of hybrid engines in the top category, the homonymous WRC. Consequently, the official game also had to introduce the same changes, something that forced the developers to take more time to introduce them into the consolidated annual development mechanism. WRC Generations, however, is not a revolution for the series, it is instead a summation of the last six chapters developed by KT Racing. The evolution from the old to the new in WRC Generations is linear and moderate on almost all aspects, also due to the strong technical link with the previous generation of consoles, which adds up to the other elements of continuity that we are going to discover with our WRC Generations review. The Career and the single player offer WRC Generations Single Player Activities After the tutorial that introduces the basic driving mechanics and those dedicated to the debut of hybrid engines, WRC Generations takes us straight to the career that immediately puts us to grips with a new season. In the first we take part in a minor circuit ~Junior~ or WRC2 given that the sponsors they will allow us to participate in the maximum category only after having ascertained our abilities. We can experience it in the role of a classic driver, without delving into team mechanics or instead exploring the managerial aspects, managing the calendar, economic and human resources, as well as deciding on the improvement path of the research and development department. We can proceed within an existing team, or create one from scratch depending on how far we want to embrace the management factor of WRC Generations. Rally Sweden is the new WRC Generations environment Built strictly according to the racing game creation manual, WRC Generations offers the usual game modes: career, challenges, competitive multiplayer and an aesthetic livery processing system, which has been made more complete and ~shared~ for the occasion . The new setting for Rally Sweden brings the length of the entire WRC Generations track park to 750km. Nothing particularly new for the WRC series, but over the years a rather complete and rewarding picture of activities has certainly been defined, despite being simple and not very varied. Climbing the leagues is a step-by-step endeavor The assiduous player of WRC Generations will find a lot of content on the multiplayer front Much broader is the multiplayer system, whose competitive front is divided into leagues, from Beginners to Legends, to allow all players to face opponents of the same skill. By playing and winning you climb in the rankings. At the end of each week that makes up a season, a synchronization phase is carried out in which category exchanges are carried out, effectively rebalancing all the leagues, making the deserving ones go up in rank and bringing down those who play at the bottom of the standings. Each week has events that correspond to the classic rallies. There are qualifying events, weekly events and daily events, which offer a different activity for virtually every login. Everyone can participate both individually and as a team, although in the last case all the dynamics of participation and competition are managed individually and in the end the results of all the participants in the team are added up. Always the usual KT Engine The Ford Puma Rally1 is one of the three models populating the 2022 WRC competitions On a technical level, WRC is a slight evolution compared to its predecessor. The simul-arcade game engine is pleasant, requires no special experience and gives both the steering wheel and the pad in the hand good feedback. In a short time you become familiar with the result of weight management, the effectiveness of hard or soft tires or suspension tuning. We see an improvement in the handling of collisions off the ~track~ with very few bugs left on corner cutting and collisions between car and environment. The novelty of the game system lies in the physics of the three hybrid racing cars of which the 2022 World Championship was the spokesperson: Ford Puma Rally1, Hyundai i20 N Rally1 and Toyota GR Yaris Rally1. WRC cars feature an additional hybrid engine that provides an electric boost. The battery recharges under braking and the accumulated power is then released under acceleration. The in-game rendering is well packagedionata, differing from that of fully endothermic engines. Noise is also appropriately repurposed. It's almost a shame that the high frequencies of the electrical circuits are anything but pleasant to listen to, so much so that the sound of the WRCs is a compromise to be accepted rather than a pleasant experience. There are three hybrid intervention modes that can be set to offer maximum cue, from one with maximum power but with a short duration to one with the softest but prolonged delivery. A ~Generational~ graphic State-of-the-art graphics are not WRC Generations' strong point The ~tested~ game engine also brings with it all the strengths and weaknesses of the past. The graphics are not expensive, but also far from captivating. There are no improvements of note compared to the previous chapters and the production maintains the standards of generation PS4 and Xbox One. Striking are always some bare scenarios, especially in countryside environments. The support for ultra-wide monitors is not convincing, in the face of good in-game camera management, there are few assets adapted for this resolution and many graphic elements are stretched incorrectly. In the racing field, monitors with a ratio greater than 21:9 are often used and for this reason greater attention should be paid. Beyond this problem, the work on the interface and menus is excellent, and although it is in line with that of the last few chapters, we can only appreciate it.", "date": "2022-11-10", "grade": "7.5"}
