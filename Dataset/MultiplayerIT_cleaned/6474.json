The complete series consists of five English-language episodes. The text is reasonably devoid of anticipations. Telltale's (interactive) animated cinema ranges from tragedy to comedy with ease, and almost always proves to have a remarkable familiarity with narrative tools. The only thing missing from the first episode of Tales from the Borderlands was the free popcorn to accompany the mix of comedy and action that from start to finish pressed the spectator-player up to the climax point introduction of the charismatic Zer0. Overall the characters had yet to find their strong place, but as the opening of the series it fell within the standard of Telltale, which has been following a precise formula for years now. So we shouldn't be surprised if this second episode, Atlas Mugged, drops a lot in tone. This too is part of Telltale's episodic tradition, suffering in the middle chapters then taking off again on the finale. After a feast of adrenaline we then have to participate in two hours of (almost) flat calm, with the feeling that the writers have done their best to stretch the story rather than push it forward. As for the structure, Fiona and Rhys continue to take turns in the story of past events, occasionally changing the events to put themselves in a good light. Within these flashbacks there are sections in which both are on the scene together with the inevitable supporting actors, Vaughn and Sasha, and other moments dedicated to the narrative line of each of them. Most likely this alternation of points of view will continue until the last episode, when we will see them both in action in the present and all the pieces will have been placed on the board. There is in fact a considerable amount of supporting characters, objects of desire and secondary plots that intersect with the main story and, if the writers manage to keep the ranks of this complicated skein, a more than decent story of action and redemption could emerge. So you see that there is no shortage of gears in motion behind the scenes; yet the best of the episode is all concentrated in the first ten minutes, when music and direction make the scene explode promising sparks. Sparks that unfortunately keep waiting in vain until the final turning point. Atlas Mugged starts with an intense animated cinematic moment, then slows down and loses power Waiting for the adventure to start again We said. After a start that nails you to your chair, the wind ceases and the story stalls, more or less. Taking advantage of the dilated times, new antagonists and supporting actors make their entrance on the scene, expanding an already very rich cast for a mini-series. There is also room for some introspective moments between Fiona and Sarah, but for the most part Atlas Mugged takes stock of the situation and tries to fix in the player's mind the fundamental points around which the whole story will revolve which, at least externally, is focus on finding a Vault Key. But what are the characters doing in the meantime? Apart from a few escapes, they pass the time exchanging jokes in bursts. In fact, humor is the main stylistic code of this series, and in the second episode there is practically no passage in which the writers have failed to insert at least a pinch of irony. Everyone has their own sense of humor, but we're sure many will get at least one laugh over the course of Atlas Mugged. And in any case the jokes have the grace and acumen necessary to make them a moment of levity that is always welcome. Thanks above all to the hilarious Handsome Jack, the ghost of a Borderlands character that only Rhys can see, and thanks to which the male protagonist of the series has gained the thickness that we believe he was missing. Unfortunately, the potential of this ally/antagonist is yet to be explored, and seems to be held in check. It could be a hurricane, but instead it just acts as a verbal counterpoint to Rhys' jokes. But the real flaw of Tales from the Borderlans is the absence of meaningful choices. If in other Telltale games you thought up to the last second before choosing a dialogue answer, here you end up clicking on the first one that comes under your eyes, so low is the stake. Even the moments of action have been reduced to very short passages, allowing us to visit a few more screens on the other hand. As for Rhys' cyber vision and Fiona's money, if anyone was expecting more depth they will be disappointed. Tellatatale had an excellent opportunity to expand the game system thanks to these characteristics of its personastoday, but it is evidently not yet the time for a change in the formula. The biggest joke in this sense is the inventory, which gradually fills up with objects to which we never have access, but which the characters will use on their own at the right time, perhaps in a later episode. If we postpone these aspects, now known, we still have an episode of connection without grit that reinforces the resolutions of those who prefer to wait for the season to be over before deciding whether to buy it or not in one fell swoop.", "date": "2015-03-19", "grade": "6.5"}
