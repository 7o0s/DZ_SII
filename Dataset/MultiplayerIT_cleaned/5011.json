Who would have thought that Konami, emblem of a questionable corporate evolution aimed at maintaining a positive operating index in what is only one of its many businesses, would have come back like this. This is a long-awaited return, desired by historical players orphaned by an iconic figure of the 80s and 90s but then disappeared from the radar in parallel with Hudson Soft, now part of Konami. The R in the title - according to Konami - stands for Returns, a bit like in 2010, when Donkey Kong Country returned to Wii. It is no coincidence that the reappearance of historical sagas on the market - with new chapters, not remakes - are taking place on Nintendo platforms: Switch represents the acme of offline multiplayer and Bomberman has cradled a slice of infant players who today keep an exceptional memory of it , so it's good that the two things now go hand in hand. The fact that Nintendo pushed to have a Bomberman on Switch day-one deserves a whole separate discussion that we will not do here, just know that what you will perhaps hold in your hands embodies the very heart of the thirty-year experience. Between explosions, multiplayer and a bit of story mode, Super Bomberman R packs a decent return Story shots Every episode of the self-respecting franchise has an identifiable story in the defeat of the villain of the moment and Super Bomberman R is no exception. Konami chooses a cartoon-style interlude scene management and a dubbing rather in line with the expectations - not high - that we had on this aspect. Apart from this detail, the advancement shakes off any vein of courage and offers game worlds with variable settings in which to advance level after level. Nothing surprising, yet the formula manages to give a few hours of adventure in singles - or in pairs - quite fun and challenging for those in withdrawal from the type of gameplay offered. The objectives are not always the same and vary from defeating all enemies to activating switches to collecting hidden keys here and there, with bosses that however prove to be more spectacular than really challenging. It is what we expected after seeing the trailers released: all in all, the different selectable difficulty levels and a more than sufficient level design make the aftertaste of this nostalgic journey pleasant. Advancing in the story will be one of the ways to accumulate coins that can be spent in-game, but more on that later. With friends... real or virtual! Needless to say, the focus of the experience is inevitably multiplayer. It's what we wanted to test right from the start, right from the first announcement, just to see if the historical formula still holds up. In the end, we would like to give you a positive answer, even if there is no doubt that it is necessary to spend some time getting used to an absolutely not immediate control and feedback system. It's logical, we didn't expect the response of 2D, but Konami could actually have refined it a little more. It doesn't work badly, mind you, but purists used to an immediate 1:1 ratio when pressing the key will find a learning curve wider than expected. And the price is paid in multiplayer sessions, not so much in local ones where up to 8 sentient players can collide on the screen or 4 Switches can connect locally, but those where the CPU is present. It takes absolute familiarity with the controls to even hope to beat the AI, and we're definitely not making that big. You can read it as a new approach to Bomberman, and in an optimistic vision you could even be right, but it lacks that flicker capable of making everyone happy ... and the frame rate anchored at 30 images per second reinforces the concept. Beyond these elements, there is no doubt that the product brings back a timeless and irreparably fun playful style played in the company of friends. The online, unfortunately, we prefer to leave it by the wayside, not for its qualitative demerit but for obvious problems of Konami in the creation of the net-code, affected by lag and problems. The company is aware of it and is working on it, so we await a resolution patch. Let's hope they hurry up more than anything else for anyone who likes to start taking their first steps in the ambitious league system present inside and destined to make the happiness of anyone who can't wait to taste some healthy global competition in a Bomberman. In the end, playing is the only real goal of this title, the primordial purpose; the more you play, the more coins you will get to spend in the shop, with characters, accessories and new areasavailable that - we hope - will be enriched over the next few months. Perhaps something more could have been asked from a technical point of view, it is true, not everyone will appreciate the style, but we are sure that this represents more of an attempt by Konami to revive a doomed brand with all the elements recognizable from the first instant. For now, we can be satisfied, but let's hope it's just a first step.", "date": "2017-03-08", "grade": "7.0"}
