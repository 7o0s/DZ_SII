In recent years, the capillary and immediate diffusion of this medium has given rise to real media campaigns of the ~viral~ type, ie with an incredible diffusion force exclusively based on word of mouth; therefore it happens that from real strokes of genius published at the right time incredible catchphrases are born, with millions of views and links shared on various social networks. The Truckers Delight video is decidedly emblematic in this sense: directed by Jrmie Prin, this multimedia work created in an 8-bit graphic style inspired by the historic Sega video games encapsulates the very essence of goliardia on the internet in just a few minutes: desecration, shamelessness , genius, grotesque vulgarity. The video, also shown on the American channel MTV2, contains numerous potential ideas to be used in a videogame sense and for this reason the derivative video game has been divided into episodes. The first of these, downloadable for 2.39 euros from the App Store, analyzes the more purely racing initial part. The kitsch festival An indispensable premise to start playing Truckers Delight is therefore the complete viewing of the video on Youtube: without the necessary knowledge of the events that led to the birth of the game, in fact, it will not be easy to fully understand the reason for what, at first sight, it may look like a nondescript arcade racing title. At this point, however, a small disclaimer must be made: the contents of the video, and consequently those of the game, are certainly fun and goliardic, but aimed exclusively at an adult and aware audience. In fact, the truck driver protagonist of the story embodies a whole series of stereotypes unjustly associated (only) with the category such as ignorance, rudeness, carelessness in driving and misogyny. As if that weren't enough, there are explicit references to sex, violence, coprophagia and gestural foul language; without false moralism, we are faced with a sui generis game, far from the classic schemes and decidedly not suitable for all those people who see videogames as the cause of all humanity's ills. After the meager initial menu we will therefore find ourselves driving a mighty truck impersonating the mustachioed and decidedly inelegant owner; the aim of the game will be to accumulate as many points as possible while avoiding vehicles and obstacles along the way. The only way to increase the game score will be to hit the red car of a buxom and enterprising girl several times, whose only fault is that she has not reacted politely to the attentions of the truck driver. The repeated and necessary rear-end collisions will alternate with vehicle dodging phases and even short battles with a sort of mini-boss, specifically a very aggressive motorcyclist and a police car; however, these battles will always be resolved in the same way, i.e. with vigorous swerves to throw unwary opponents off the road. During the journey then you will be able to encounter three types of power ups: a super turbo, which will literally make the truck a missile for a few seconds, a pair of huge buffalo horns, able to ram all the vehicles in the vicinity and finally an exhilarating power up for the truck driver's language, which will act as a multiplier for the points from rear-end collisions and whose use will be easily understood by those who have the original video in mind. It's just a pity that all this running leads nowhere: in fact, the game continues to the bitter end, until the time runs out, always colliding with the same car, with the same obstacles and with the same power ups: certainly not the best example of variety in gameplay. The controls, delegated to the accelerometer, are really precise and intuitive, while the only interaction with the fingers will take place by playing the noisy two-tone horns of the truck through the special bracket at the top right: a totally useless feature, but which integrates perfectly with the out-of-this-world style of Truckers Delight. Technically speaking, the retro taste given by the 8-bit pixelated look gives the title a pleasant artistic effect, deliberately exaggerated and aggressive; however, the speed of the vehicle is rendered quite well and the frame rate is very solid, without ever even a click. The background music is inspired by that of the video but reproduced in a continuous loop which can be tiring in the long run, while the audio effects are limited to the crackling of the truck engine and the sound of the horn. Unfortunately it is not presentno multiplayer mode, however the game integrates a worrying option to send e-mails to friends, automatically inviting them to purchase via a link to the App Store: we are in fact faced with a disguised spam function which could have been done fine for less.
