If you have played the previous one, you know more or less what to expect but for those who approach this game for the first time believing they will find an aesthetically nice (it is, indeed) and relaxing platform better get ready: Spelunky 2, exactly like the original, it is the Dark Souls of platformers, the one where dying is as commonplace as getting a new calendar for each game. Yet despite the poorly comforted premises, it is once again addictive and beautiful. Could it have been the turkeys, this time, that made us succumb to its charm? Or the constant challenge to ourselves to figure out how deep we can go without being killed by, well, anything and not necessarily breathing. We can even kill ourselves, miscalibrating the throw of a blunt object to see it bounce off our heads, or not calculating the side effects of a bomb explosion. There are as many reasons to fall in love with the game as there are to hate it, but the result is always the same: it's hard to let go once you start. Riding our trusty turkey, let's go and understand what Derek Yu offers us in this second, captivating chapter. Bigger and richer Most of the sequels have a familiar flavor and Spelunky 2 is no exception: its fundamentals are mostly the same: you start with four lives, four bombs and four climbing ropes, as well as a whip to defend against enemies. After a short tutorial, the game takes us along our path through randomly generated levels within which dangers of all kinds, environmental and otherwise, await us. Along the way we can find useful items, or buy them where there is a merchant and above all gold to spend, and whatever we get will follow us through levels and worlds on the terms of not dying. In that case you start all over again, or from a shortcut if you have had the opportunity to build it - to be more precise, to provide money and materials for someone else to do it for you but in short, the substance is always the same. The only ones who will never abandon you, in the sense that they will stop at the camp, are the different characters that you will unlock during the adventure. Some of them will be able to offer you support by fighting alongside you but the frenzy that drives them can be a boon as much as a curse, because it has happened more than once that they spoil our plans in some way. After all, Spelunky 2 should be seen as a set of meticulously crafted and positioned gears so that each has its own purpose. There really isn't anything wrong with the game, and the key is to find ways to overcome or alternatively work around it. Getting stuck is a mistake attributable only to us, just as in general the defeat depends on nothing but our distraction: of course, Spelunky 2 does nothing to make our work easier but it is not even there to obtuse us. After all, it has always been like this, since its debut twelve years ago: also in this case the goal of Spelunky 2 does not revolve around its completion but rather the understanding of the game world. We are faced with a constant challenge against ourselves, as we try to come to terms with each level, understand its structure and the use that can be made of objects and enemies (since nobody forbids us to use them as a weapon once stunned or killed). In an unstoppable merry-go-round where we die, die and die again, something of our involuntary sacrifice remains and helps us improve, become more reactive and Machiavellian in a world that does not give discounts. Again, every other ability outside of basic actions is at the mercy of the objects we find along the way, or animals for that matter: we can't stress enough that the turkey, in its simplicity, is an addition awesome - especially considering you have to tame him first, otherwise he won't obey any commands. Once we become best friends, we can use it to reach higher points than normal thanks to the double jump, glide to avoid long dangerous areas with lava or spikes, throw warheads instead of whiplash, but probably the most beautiful combination is to charge armed with rifles. The apotheosis of absurdity and together the most beautiful thing you could find in Spelunky 2. Of course, unfortunately not even he escapes the ruthless logic of the game but the beauty is also this, discovering to what extent a single element of the game can be exploited - for better or for worse. PJust like in the previous one, there is no better weapon than our ingenuity to survive: every new discovery brings with it a fair amount of frustration, whether it is due to a well-hidden bear trap or a mosquito that rockets out of nowhere into our direction to impale us. There is always a reason to get angry and to love Spelunky 2, even more so now that the levels are deeper, ready to hide a path within another path, like little nesting dolls: if at the beginning the idea left us a little skeptical, not so much for an additional difficulty as for the fear that it would add an unnecessary load to a basically simple game, going forward we realized the richness that instead they contribute to giving the entire game. It is an invitation to delve deeper, to take time and above all to take risks to nurture a constant sense of discovery. Although Spelunky 2 is largely similar to the previous one, there are some small additions in terms of objects but also characters: for example, in one level you could find the usual merchant ready to pocket your hard-earned gold, or a mysterious woman who invites you to take a challenge (upon payment, of course) to come out richer than before, or even the turkey farmer who will reward you if you can bring his beloved birds back to him alive - a more difficult undertaking than you think. These small additions offer new reasons to explore the game in every part, with all the advantages and problems that follow. Alone or in company The sweat, blood and tears that we will spend trying to reach the end of the adventure can be shared with friends thanks to the multiplayer mode, which allows us to cooperate with up to four players to be able to overcome the countless dangers. If, on the other hand, you are a competitive lover, Spelunky 2 also makes the Arena available to compete against other players in as many as forty maps and two game modes: deathmatch and capture the idol. In Smash Bros. style, the timer, the amount of victories, the lives, the number of bombs and initial strings, in short, everything and more to better customize your game is possible. Overall it's fun and although Spelunky 2 doesn't necessarily make you think of an experience where multiplayer is necessary, it's nice that there is a moment to relax away from the frustrating dangers of the main adventure. Almost perfect The only real flaws that can be attributed to Spelunky 2 are the artificial intelligence of the allies, which is a real mine gone crazy not always to our advantage, and some lethal elements of the environment that are all too difficult to identify which lead to a premature and unpredictable departure. For the rest, once again simplicity is the flagship of a game that is visually sharper than the previous HD version of the original Spelunky. To accompany it, a relaxing and unforgettable soundtrack, which for a few seconds manages to estrange us from the harsh reality of a constant and often inevitable death.", "date": "2020-09-19", "grade": "8.8"}
