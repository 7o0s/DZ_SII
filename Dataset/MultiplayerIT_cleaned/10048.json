Renamed The Passing, from the title of the new campaign, the add-on is automatically downloaded when you start Steam. After the massive download, spent throwing explosive darts at a poster of Bobby Kotick, we are ready to go. The first image of map number 1 immediately makes clear the particularity of the three new missions added, that is, it shows Zoey, a survivor of the first Left 4 Dead, who gives directions to the group. For those who were already excited and dreamed of being able to choose a character even among the protagonists of the first chapter, let's immediately forget it: the presence of the old survivors is essentially scenographic and, aside from the initial cameo, we will only see our heroes again in the third and last map of the campaign, where they will help new survivors by shooting zombies from a balcony. Those who expected a more important participation will probably be disappointed also because, apart from the sympathy aroused by the initiative, the gameplay is affected little or nothing by their presence. Xbox 360 version Unlike the PC version, which as pointed out in the article is completely free and installs automatically when Steam is started, the Xbox 360 version costs 560 Microsoft Points and can be purchased as a normal DLC. The contents of both versions are identical. The new campaign After the chat with Zoey, we leave for the usual action outing along the first of the new levels, alone with the companions controlled by artificial intelligence or with up to three other users. We find ourselves in an urban area made up of buildings undergoing renovation, sumptuous gazebos surrounded by white plastic chairs and billiard rooms complete with jukebox and alcohol counter. Of the two new weapons, only the golf club appears, which is very Scooby Doo and which is used like all other melee weapons. The game mechanics have not changed one iota compared to the other campaigns and it could only be like this. In short, it's the usual pile zombies, tear zombies and riddle zombies trying to survive. The level design is top-notch, with narrow passages alternating with larger areas and a clever use of dark areas that break the pace forcing you to slow down after quick sprints. The second map of Left 4 Dead 2: The Passing is equally well designed. The game areas are similar to the previous level, apart from the final section set under the sewers, which is also the most difficult to finish due to the continuous waves of zombies to face and the pitch darkness in which it is immersed. During the level it is possible to use the second and last of the new weapons, the M-60, which becomes unusable once the ammunition runs out. In the third level, that of escape, you have to collect petrol cans to fill a tank. Doing so will lower a drawbridge and Survivors will be able to flee in a car parked at the other end. As already mentioned, three of the old Survivors who will preside over the tank area will also be active in this area. In total, without ever dying, the campaign can be finished in less than an hour. The sad fate of Bill The title The Passing refers to Bill's ultimate sacrifice for the safety of his fellow survivors. The event will be told in an expansion expected soon for the first Left 4 Dead. No release date has been announced, and no details about the expansion's contents have been revealed. More news If your companions will let you, or if they don't run madly through the levels, you will notice some little gems that deserve a mention. In the first place, a new infected of the uncommon common type who, instead of fighting, will flee as soon as he sees you. Why tear it down? Well, simply because the timidone brings bonuses, for example medikits, defibrillators or others, which can come in handy in the most desperate cases. Unfortunately it will not be easy to take him down, especially at the more difficult levels or in case you have to face other infected at the same time. Out of curiosity, we point out the presence of some writings left by Otis and Frank West, the protagonists of Dead Rising, the zombie-themed game by Capcom. These are decidedly nice quotes given the common theme of the two games. Another notable addition, which concludes the novelties of the expansion is the new ~Mutations~ mode which adds two new competitive game conditions such as ~Realism Versus~ or ~Chainsaw Massacre~, in which each player has a chainsaw with unlimited fuel.", "date": "2010-04-26", "grade": "7.5"}
