If you have lived similar experiences with some friends, you will surely be able to remember how you used to transform ordinary places into cradles of adventurous and terrifying stories and events. I suffer from stress Who hasn't seen menacing shadows behind some broken window, or who hasn't heard the sound of footsteps emerging from a cellar that hasn't been used for years? Now you assume that there was nothing there, but in fact there was something: the image of the time. Looking at life dried up in a certain place, where the signs of what was still present, creates a powerful and irrepressible anguish, which we are forced to fight by exploring those remains with no return, transfiguring them in our minds. It's just another way to try to exorcise the unknown, giving it a function in line with our expectations. Before being explored, a dungeon always appears as an inextricable and very dangerous labyrinth, built in the depths of the earth or in places that only the bravest dare to explore to hunt for its treasures. Video games were born with dungeons in mind. Some allow you to create and manage them, such as Dungeon Keeper, but most of the titles are focused on their exploration (a random fantasy roguelike). Darkest Dungeon is fully part of the roguelike genre, thanks to its procedurally generated dungeons, random loot and high difficulty, but introduces a large number of innovations into the formula that have earned it the interest of gamers in the months in which it was available in Early Access on Steam. Now that the final version has arrived, the time has also come to draw conclusions. We reviewed Darkest Dungeon, a roguelike focused on party sanity What a stress In Darkest Dungeon you have to manage a group of heroes to be sent on a mission in some very dangerous places, to stop a dark threat. The plot is a mere pretext to introduce what is a real managerial one, in which it is not only about slipping into dungeons and raiding, but also managing resources and, above all, the sanity of the group. Yes, because the life of adventurers is really stressful and every mission they face leads them more and more to the brink of madness, so you have to make sure you don't drive them completely crazy. But let's go in order, because we will return to sanity in a dedicated paragraph. The gameplay is divided into two large sections: the village, where you can buy equipment, hire new heroes, reduce the stress of those who have just gone on a mission, heal them mentally, look at the graves of heroes who fell in battle and so on; and the actual dungeons, where the selected party must advance from room to room by carrying out the indicated mission. The entire game can be managed with the pressure of a few keys (the mouse is enough, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts) and the exploration itself is nothing more than progressing through long and gloomy corridors, lit only by torches of heroes that wear out over time, examining objects such as altars or piles of books, overcoming traps, camping as needed and fighting against enemies. Before entering a dungeon it is possible to buy consumables to carry around, essential to ensure the survival of the group. For example, it is very important to take food with you, to fight the inevitable hunger, or additional torches, so as not to force the group to move in the dark. It is not just a question of quirks, but of profound needs that heavily affect the aforementioned sanity. Sanity Darkest Dungeon's most original gameplay element is the heroes' sanity. As we mentioned above, when the heroes go on a mission they are subjected to more or less stressful events. Their psychological endurance is essential and is far more dangerous than the enemies themselves. The heroes are stressed by the dark, by blows in battle, by being walked into a trap, by bleeding wounds and by the babbling of their comrades. In short, every event is a potential source of stress. In this they look like fifteen-year-olds or twitstars, but let's not beat around the bush. What does all this translate into? When psychological stress exceeds a certain threshold, two things happen: the emergence of a mental disorder and exposure to the risk of a heart attack. Mental disorders are exactly what they appear to be and heavily affect gameplay. For example, it happened to find ourselves with auto characterslesionists who refuse all treatment, hoping to be killed by enemies, or with other paranoids who negatively affect the sanity of the entire group with their blabbering of conspiracies. These are often uncontrollable situations that end up affecting the tactics to be used in battle. The heart attack is instead a system that can cause heart attacks to characters subjected to too much stress. This is a very penalizing feature, which if left active makes the game much more difficult. Stress in all its forms can be fought in the village. For example, does your trusted priestess start to have visions? Send her to pray for a few hours and she will be as good as new. Has your favorite tamer turned masochistic? Send him to the mental hospital and they'll fix him for you. Is your warrior close to a nervous breakdown? A trip to the brothel and you will see that everything will pass. Fight until your heart bursts As already mentioned, the entire Darkest Dungeon gaming experience revolves around the sanity of the party, which is also its most relevant feature. The rest of the gameplay is fairly traditional, as you usually just go around accumulating as much experience and loot as possible. The exploration itself isn't even too exciting and you are limited to walking straight corridors that connect the rooms and fighting from time to time. Mind you that this is not an affordable title, in the sense that the difficulty is set upwards. Some may even find the sudden death of a cherished hero from a stress-induced heart attack frustrating. In fact, heart attacks are a little too frequent and sometimes they manage to mess up situations that until a few moments before you thought you had under control. Of course, when you master the game you manage to be more careful towards risky situations, but it is undeniable that some could be annoyed by the arbitrariness of the mechanics, which in the long run ends up being a cause for strong disenchantment. The combat system, on the other hand, is done really well, despite the conceptual simplicity. The party consists of up to four characters walking in single file occupying four slots. Each class has its preferred position, that is, the one that allows him to use more skills. For example, a priest can only heal if he is in the rear, while a warrior gives his best in the front lines, where he can face enemies face to face. However, you don't need too much study to figure out what the preferred position of a certain class is, which is clearly indicated on the character sheet. One of the difficulties offered by the game is represented precisely by maintaining positions. On some occasions, in fact, the characters will tend to swap places independently, making it more difficult to apply a certain strategy. For example, a warrior who suffers too many blows could panic and run to the rear, exposing a less resistant character with few skills to exploit in that position to direct confrontation. In short, it is a multi-faceted system that creates interesting moments, also by virtue of the developers' choice to focus on the challenge: each fight can thus prove to be more difficult than it might seem at first. The finishing work Finally, the more properly technical aspects of the game deserve a few words. In truth Darkest Dungeon had proved to be very stable since the first releases, with few bugs and problems. The final version therefore appears very solid and crash-proof, at least according to our road test during which we did not detect any bugs, let alone system blocks. Even from a visual point of view, what was previously noted is confirmed, with the gothic style, but at the same time tending to cartoon, which is the master and which makes it pleasant to enter the game even if only to admire it a little. Nothing technically monstrous or capable of putting any PC under pressure, as the system requirements also show, but certainly an excellently done work from an artistic point of view that also stands out on many triple A productions, more driven, but also more anonymous.", "date": "2016-01-19", "grade": "8.5"}
