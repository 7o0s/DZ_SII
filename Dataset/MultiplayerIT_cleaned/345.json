{"name": "Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devil-may-cry-3-special-edition.html", "text": "The years go by, Dante The programmers of the Japanese house wanted to change, with this re-edition, the main aspect of the discussion that has distanced many players from Devil May Cry 3; we are obviously referring to the level of difficulty, initially calibrated really upwards with the result of enhancing hardcore gamers but instead deeply frustrating less patient or skilled gamers. Therefore, in the Special Edition a new easy level appears, while medium and difficult make a ~shot down~ going to represent those that were previously easy and medium. A substantial difference, which accompanies the renewed continuous system; in fact, in DMC3, in addition to the real commitment necessary to continue the adventure, a covertly evil expedient had been adopted which forced the player to buy the very expensive yellow orbs in order to be able to continue from the last check point in case of premature death. No yellow orbs? Perfect, the entire level had to be covered all over again, most of the time only to get back to the boss and succumb to various curses and curses. In this case, however, the new golden orbs make their appearance which, if purchased, even allow you to start again from the exact point of your death; in the absence of the latter, the bite is still less bitter since everything is resolved in having to retrace only the stretch starting from the last check point. It is therefore easy to understand how these changes significantly affect the game mechanics of the Capcom production, which from a rewarding action game for hard-cores becomes a much more affordable and not particularly selective product. A positive choice from our point of view, which unlike many other reissues, really modifies the product by laying credible foundations for a possible second purchase, obviously especially for those who, while fascinated by the style of the charismatic protagonist and by the topics covered, have not succeeded to accept the difficulty level of the original. But Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition is not a product addressed only to the ~I would like but I can't~ users of the first edition, but also to those who have fallen in love with Dante's saga and want to deepen the story with a juicy extra. My brother This extra responds to the name of Vergil, or rather to the ability to use him as a playable character as an alternative to the protagonist. Unfortunately, this potentially exciting possibility was largely developed with little attention by the Capcom team, especially as regards the narrative aspect. In fact, speaking of pure and simple playability, controlling Dante's evil brother represents a more than sensitive variation, given that Vergil can count on different styles, weapons and skills compared to the protagonist of the game; stronger and with the Devil Trigger ability available from the start, playing with Vergil therefore proves to be a further step backwards in terms of overall difficulty, but no less intriguing for this. However, where this solution shows serious shortcomings is precisely in its insertion within the plot, or rather in its NOT insertion; yes because apart from a new introductory sequence, the adventure of Dante's brother is limited to slavishly treading the same levels and bosses of the blood relative, however without a narrative thread nor with at least a variation of the final battle, which on the contrary sees Vergil collide with himself. A pity, since greater attention would have allowed this extra to gain much greater importance and specific weight. Among the other innovations we should mention the theater mode, to enjoy all the sequences of the game, the turbo mode to increase the speed of the action by 20%, and the Bloody Palace, or a survival mode made up of 9999 levels (which can however also be skipped shots of 10 or 100 at a time). For the rest, the Capcom production has remained intact, both from a technical point of view - still appreciable today - and for the levels present. Comment Let's start from an assumption: Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition costs less than 30 euros. Based on this budget price, it's very easy to justify this re-release of the Capcom blockbuster from a year and a half ago, especially given the changes made to the difficulty level. Thanks to these changes, DMC3 is now a game that anyone can play without great awe, and which indeed could very well bring back to the series those who have been burned by the excessive demands of the original. On the other hand, the lightness with which the possibility of controlling Vergil was developed and the general lack of consistency of the other extras make this Special Edition a product that those who already have gread and appreciated the first edition may very well avoid buying. Pros A level of difficulty finally for everyone Fun and frenetic as always Very interesting budget price Cons Not very intriguing extras Almost useless for those who have the original Eight months after its release on the American market, an extremely substantial expectation since we are talking about an action game, the Special Edition of Devil May Cry 3 finally makes its appearance also on European territory, proposing and refreshing the Capcom blockbuster about a year and a half after its first appearance.", "date": "2006-10-10", "grade": null}
