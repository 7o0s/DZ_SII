{"name": "A Little to the Left", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/a-little-to-the-left-recensione.html", "text": "During the lockdowns caused by the pandemic we learned to know every corner of our homes, where we found ourselves spending much more time than usual. Habit and trite everyday life remove the glaze from what we see and use every day, and domestic objects become symbols of a sense of oppression and discomfort that we have experienced collectively, but each one closed in the privacy of his own home.A Little to the Left, developed precisely in these complicated years, tries to look at the domestic space with a different gaze. Annie MacMillan and Lukas Steinman started from home utensils and furnishings to create a brilliant and surprising puzzle game, capable of enhancing the hidden beauty of common objects and inducing us to think outside the box. We tell you about the excellent qualities of Max Inferno's video game in our review of A Little to the Left. From Canada with love A Little to the Left teaches us to seek the hidden harmony of things Annie MacMillan and Lukas Steinman are life and work partners and created their first video game at the 2020 GMTKJam. After deciding to leave their daily lives for their video game works, they embarked on the development of A Little to the Left and opened the doors of their Canadian home in the interesting trailer screened on the occasion of the Summer Game Fest 2022. It was immediately clear that A Little to the Left would have character to sell. MacMillan and Steinman compared the furnishings in their home to their virtual counterparts, showing their intention to tell the public about the importance and hidden magic of the objects we look at and use every day. All with an exceptional supporting character, the cat Rookie, destined to play an important role in A Little to the Left. There is an illustrious precedent in the field of home tidying video games: Unpacking, developed by Witch Beam and released last year. However, the direction chosen by Max Inferno is different, given that the objects to be rearranged are not placed in specific points of the house, and different phases of the life of their owners are not followed. Not for this A Little to the Left is less successful, as we will see in the continuation of our review. Order, but with imagination It is not always easy to find the solution to the puzzles of A Little to the Left The structure of A Little to the Left is really simple: in the context of five different chapters inspired by different rooms in the house, it will be necessary to solve puzzles related to rearranging pieces of furniture, cleaning and cataloging household objects. It's a pleasant and relaxing task, and the relaxed atmosphere created by Max Inferno is enhanced by the delicate piano chords of the game's excellent soundtrack. It won't take more than four hours to complete all available levels, and there are also different types of aids to continue. First of all, there is the possibility of skipping a puzzle by selecting the Let It Be option, when you intend to return later - perhaps with a fresher mind - to face the puzzle that has stumped us. You can then choose to have a little help: the clues for completing the level are contained in a sheet of paper full of scribbles, which can be erased at will with an eraser that can be controlled by the player, who can thus choose whether to reveal the mystery completely or give just a sneak peek at the solution. They are excellent ideas, also because, especially in the last levels of the game, the logic underlying the puzzles may not be very clear, and it is necessary to rack your brain a lot to trace the hidden harmonies of the objects and reach the ending. However, it should be specified that many puzzles can be resolved in more than one way: MacMillan and Steinman in fact have two different ways of seeing domestic reorganization, and the variety of possible paths reflects the inevitable differences that exist, even in a couple, in tracing the mysterious harmonies of things. Because A Little to the Left is above all this: a story of hidden chords, and a search for the secret rhythm and music of our daily lives. A mischievous kitty A Little to the Left is all about everyday objects Put like this, A Little to the Left feels very slow and quiet, almost monotonous in its succession of puzzles. This is not the case: although some recurring motifs can be traced (~look at the book covers and construct a figure by rearranging them correctly~ or ~arrange the objects in ascending order of height~, just to name a couple), Max Inferno manages to amaze by creating voriginal arias on the various themes, thus pushing the player to question what he has learned and seen so far to seek new and unconventional solutions. Not only that: there is an uncontrollable factor in the domestic equation of A Little to the Left. This is the cat who, from time to time, gets to mess everything up and make the resolution of puzzles more complex. Whether it's cleaning up its paw prints or escaping its desire to grab objects and throw them on the floor, A Little to the Left often turns into a hymn to the cat as the capricious divinity of the house, always ready to bring her its irrationality, but no less adorable for that. A good sense of observation is necessary to continue the adventure of Max Inferno The interesting playful picture is completed by the daily reorders, delivered to the players every twenty-four hours to prolong the experience created by Max Inferno and give a few minutes of relaxation even after the completion of A Little to the Left. Completing the puzzles leads to the victory of a trophy for every three, seven, one hundred and eighty, three hundred and sixty-five tidying up completed: in other words, there is still a year of very pleasant tidying up experiences to complete! We were also able to try these additional levels during the game review period, and we can say that the quality of the extra puzzles is completely in line with that of the base game. A Little to the Left has a very small amount of texts, but we still point out with satisfaction the presence of a localization in Italian. We did experience a small bug when completing a level - the game wouldn't want to continue, but a quick reset put things right. For the rest, A Little to the Left was impeccable from a technical point of view, and the always coherent art direction managed to enhance the hidden beauty of even the most common objects, through the skilful use of pastel colors and decidedly hit the spot.", "date": "2022-11-07", "grade": "8.0"}
