To demonstrate their power against each other, the United States and Russia went on for almost twenty years challenging each other with space missions, launching rockets and satellites into the air, as well as carrying out other collateral activities, up to the ultimate goal: to be the first to reach the moon, as happened on July 20, 1969, which marks the conclusion of the race between the two superpowers. Conspiracy theories aside, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin ~Buzz~ Aldrin set foot on the Earth's satellite, with the latter who, years later, also linked his name to the videogame industry. In fact, Aldrin offered his consultancy for the creation of Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space, for his friends BARIS, a video game developed in 1993 by Strategic Visions: inside it was reproduced the space race, putting the player at the helm of NASA or the program spacecraft to be the first to land on the moon. Twenty-one years after the release of BARIS, Slitherine Strategies has decided to return to the fray with Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager, for friends BASPM: foundations similar to the original title naturally accompanied by some new features, to the delight of all those who they didn't miss a single moment of the Rosetta mission. Have you followed Rosetta from 2004 to today? Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager is for you! The race begins As described in the preamble of this review, BASPM takes the player in the middle of the space race, starting from the mid-50s of the last century to follow the entire series of primary and secondary missions that led man to touch the lunar soil. To do this, we can choose to side with the forces of the United States or Russia, competing against the adversary to be the first to succeed in the final objective: depending on the role chosen, research programs that actually existed and were implemented will be available , such as the launch of Sputnik into space or the Apollo missions, supported by a series of projects that remained only on paper, or implemented only to end up in failure. In reality there is also a third fictitious faction: it is the GSA (Global Space Agency), by controlling which the gameplay changes radically. In fact, it is possible to access all the technologies developed by NASA and the Russian program, but having to respond to the objectives that the political forces at the head of the agency impose from time to time. In case you don't want to have the limitations of the competition, BASPM also provides a sandbox mode, within which you can indulge yourself in space exploration without having to submit to particular obligations. We also point out the presence of a multiplayer mode of the play-by-email type, where therefore it is not necessary to be online at the same time as one's opponent: once the turn is over, in fact, the ball is passed to the other player, who he is free to make his move when it suits him best before handing over the turn to us again. A solution that for a title that offers a turn system like that of BASPM works above all from a technical point of view, but which in our opinion goes to break the pace of the game excessively, on its own already not very high. We have Liftoff! Those who loved BARIS at the time will probably also know the board game Liftoff!, of which the 1993 title represents the video game transposition. A similar fate therefore falls to BASPM, which however expands on what was seen in the game developed by Strategic Visions, without altering the basic concepts. Regardless of the chosen faction, the player's task is to create all the conditions to allow his nation to arrive first on the Moon: success in the various approach steps is what feeds the total prestige level, based on to which the additional budget made available to us is then defined from time to time. The choices are numerous, and offer the possibility of ranging from a ~classic~ sequence which involves the launch of probes alternated with that of human beings, to the use of more particular missions capable, however, of providing a high level of of prestige, to then naturally be reinvested in the race towards the moon landing. In addition to the choice of programs, in BASPM a fundamental role is played by the various types of personnel that need to be employed within the agency: each individual offers particular skills in specific fields, such as for example the skilled scientistin rocket design rather than probe design. Each person hired can undergo additional training to improve their skills, thus offering interesting alternatives from a strategic point of view: is it better to focus immediately on the development and launch of missions, or to rely on highly qualified personnel? A nice dilemma, especially when you see the opposing faction forfeit its first successes. Speaking of missions, at the end of each round the probability of success is displayed in the summary screen of each open program, then choosing in the following quarter whether to start one or not: if so, it is possible to immediately jump to the final outcome or follow the step I go through all the steps, which of course we highly recommend you do. Through the mission mode it is in fact possible to experience that characteristic pathos of space launches, and indeed we must say that in the role of Slitherine we would have extended the various procedures even further, thus adding further tension until the moment of completion. The single mission is made up of several phases, for which BASPM adopts the dice system of its predecessor: reduced in a nutshell, the value of each roll is compared with that which identifies the possibility of success of the single step, to establish whether it is it successful or not. In the latter case, it may be a minor problem, which can be solved by the staff, up to errors capable of leading to tragic consequences for human lives, and consequently also for the prestige of our agency. Like twenty one years ago The essence of BASPM has remained that of 1993 also from a graphic point of view, given that the new title offers few updates in what overall remains the style of the old game. Thanks to the absence of a tutorial, the player is therefore immediately catapulted between menus and options, in some cases risking getting lost among the numerous information offered by BASPM: in this regard we open a small parenthesis concerning the so-called Buzz-opedia, a mine of 'historical information for those who might be interested in studying the real space race while continuing to play. However, after a couple of running-in games, the interface appears clearer, while the feeling that something is missing in the single mission monitoring screen remains, even if the development team has put together a series of new animations with which to follow its developments. As for the audio, each of the factions present offers a different soundtrack: nothing worth getting excited about, but it certainly does the job assigned to it.", "date": "2014-12-09", "grade": "7.5"}
