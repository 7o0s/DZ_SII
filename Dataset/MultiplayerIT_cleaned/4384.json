But with the enormous success that Nintendo Switch is having, which leads it to sometimes welcome even embarrassing productions, it would have been almost a sacrilege not to re-propose one of the best psychological horrors of recent years. That's right: maybe you've never heard of it, but if you are a fan of the genre and haven't tried Layears of Fear yet, you should run and retrieve it. You have missed a very deserving exponent of the genre, not free from defects, but full of valid ideas. Layers of Fear: Legacy arrives exclusively on Nintendo Switch, with a set of content capable of justifying the price. The paintings of madness Layers of Fear catapults us into a universe of desperation, madness and art. We experience it firsthand, through the eyes of a protagonist now mentally devastated by a series of unfortunate events, as well as his passion for whiskey bottles. Our alter ego is an artist obsessed with his creation: he must complete it at all costs, and it cannot simply be beautiful, it must be perfect. Ambition becomes an obsession, his life a nightmare. Little by little, in the handful of hours it takes to complete the narrative, we will learn important details about the background of the story. What happened to his wife? Why has his Victorian-style house turned into an inexhaustible source of horrors? Where has her daughter gone? What creatures lurk around every corner, in every room? Theyear of Fear means (roughly) ~the layers of fear~. It is not a title that really manages to scare, excluding some rare scare jumps capable of taking the younger ones by the nose. It does something much more professional, however: it makes every gamer's life a mix of anxiety and tension until the end. Without even a moment of respite. As for the settings, everything takes place inside the home of the protagonist. But the masterpieces of cinema have taught us that the deepest horrors lurk in everyday life: a house is enough and more, with its rooms and its doors, to intimidate. Above all, it is human beings who are frightening: and our artist is immediately presented as an unstable individual, with his little nagging obsessions. Until the conclusion (we do not anticipate anything) it is impossible to get a really convincing idea of what happened. We can put forward hypotheses, collect documents that make us understand certain things, but we can never write the final word once and for all. The final scene itself is illuminating, and closes the entire cycle of events told in an almond shape. After all, the whole context and the way of telling the story is very important in Layers of Fear. Because in the game mechanics, except for rare ingenious inventions, it remains a walking simulator with minimal environmental interaction. You walk, above all you observe, you listen (a wonderful soundtrack), but that's it. Apart from the two analogs with which to move and turn our gaze, we can only interact with objects and sometimes move them, for example to open doors. But the real strong point of the production is in the direction, everything else is a set of repetitive and obvious mechanics, in a genre that is rarely open to innovations. Among other things, the title is also extremely driven, and lends itself very little to replay value. There have only been a handful of instances where we've been left wondering what the heck we have to do to move forward. The proposed puzzles are then another side that is not exactly positive: few and not even good, most of the time they are either incredibly simple, or they simply have to be solved with a little luck, by trying and trying again. There is no taste, no satisfaction, rather a sense of frustration at having been interrupted at the climax of the narrative. Keep this in mind: Legacy of Fear is a story of fear, of unease. The video game serves to tell it, but the protagonist is not the gameplay. Fear at hand The Nintendo Switch edition is called Layers of Fear: Legacy, and it has its strengths and weaknesses, in an unstable balance. First of all, it's an excellent title to take with you: in the mountains, perhaps in front of the fireplace, with a pair of headphones, it's probably something sublime. The developers then carefully dedicated themselves to implementing the possibilities of the hybrid console. This means that in portable mode you can use the touch controls, or that the feedback given by the Rumble HD allows (if possible) an even more complete identification, even tactile, compared to the other versions on the market. Of course, the Rumble function is available both when playing with the Joy-Condetached from the console (in TV or tabletop mode) or connected to it. Lastly, this is a definitive edition: it also includes the Inheritance DLC, which tells the story of the protagonist's daughter. It doesn't last long, but it allows us to have a complete package on everything related to the Bloober Team title. All this justifies the price on Nintendo Switch, of around twenty euros. However, it is not all rosy, with the main defect of the conversion which are certainly the slowdowns. Layers of Fear: Legacy is never really fluid and responsive as we would like: in certain points, turning the view or turning the corner, there are noticeable frame rate problems. It barely lasts a second: too short to consider the version plagued by serious problems, but enough for them to be annoying. We are sure that with a couple more months of revision, Nintendo Switch would have been able to ~run~ the title to its full potential. Isn't it that the rush to publish everything at once, while the golden period of Nintendo Switch lasts, is making developers more and more hasty? There is also something not convincing in the use of the Joy-Con Motion Control. To open the doors it is possible to press the right back button and then move the remote control, precisely performing the gesture of opening a door. These movements are very rarely as responsive as they should be: most of the time the door stays half open, or even closes again. The same goes for turning a lever, and any such action in general. However, this does not happen with a traditional command system, which combines the pressure of the button with that of the left analogue. Moral of the story: here too we could have worked better. All this is a pity, because we repeat: Layears of Fear is a truly deserving exponent of its genre. The writer would have gladly awarded it a full 8, perhaps even more considering the efforts to work better also on the possibilities offered on Nintendo Switch, in addition to the extremely immersive narration itself. Instead, we have to reconfirm the vote of the PlayStation 4 version, because the optimization on the portable console has obvious problems, and not all the features of the Nintendo Switch have been exploited adequately.", "date": "2018-02-28", "grade": "7.5"}
