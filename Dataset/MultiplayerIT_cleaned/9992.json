{"name": "Derapate", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77460-modnation-racers-derapate-kart-e-pupazzi.html", "text": "Versions tested: PlayStation 3 and PSP It hasn't been long since the developers of United Front Games released the multiplayer beta of their ModNation Racers, yet there are numerous technical improvements made to the gaming experience. What immediately catches the eye is the optimization work carried out to make the frame rate stable and constant during the races: if there were noticeable drops in the beta, in the final version these phenomena have really been reduced to the bone. The same cannot be said of the ~pauses~ between one race and another within the ModSpot, which unfortunately cannot be it is free from ~clicks~. And then there's the age-old issue of uploads, really long and frequent, which after a while you get used to and which fortunately should be filed by a patch they seem to be already working on. Too many details all at once? Ok, then let's proceed with a minimum order: for the uninitiated, ModNation Racers is a racing game (belonging to the kart racer subset) characterized by the classic arcade approach with boosts, stunts and weapons on the track, but above all by the possibility to edit or create characters, vehicles and tracks from scratch and then share them with other users. The single mode offers us the story of Tag, a young and rebellious driver who, thanks to the sponsorship of a small paint shop, realizes his dream of taking part in the ModNation Racers Championship (MRC). The boy is assisted by a very special chief mechanic, who abandoned competition years earlier following a terrible accident but is still determined to prove his worth, also and above all against the perfidious Italian driver (well yes) who rammed him by sending him off road. As soon as things start to mesh, however, a rich and wicked uncle shows up in Tag's box with the intention of signing him at all costs. The story is very reminiscent of the classic ~Mach 5 Go! Go! Go!~, with the family business that finds itself competing against a large unscrupulous multinational and the pilot who doesn't know which side to take, and in the case of ModNation Racers is told with great humour, through a series of animated sequences marked by excellent dubbing in Italian. Depraved drift The ~career~ mode is divided into five stages, each consisting of a variable number of races of increasing difficulty. Sometimes he offers us useful tutorials to understand how our kart works, as well as the many resources at our disposal to achieve success on the track. Starting off is one of the most important moments, because it is possible to obtain an additional boost if the accelerator and the boost button are pressed at the instant when the traffic lights turn green (it is no coincidence that the lighting time of the lights is changed at each race): our kart will leap forward, overtaking most of the opponents, unless they have been equally skilled. Leading a race is an extremely delicate task, because the other pilots can shoot at everything and we must try to keep the boost bar always full to be able to activate an energy shield when necessary, or hope to pick up the right weapons for that type of situation (mines, in this case). The only energy bar we will have to deal with is precisely that of the boost, which is filled by making drifts as long as possible as well as performing stunts and rotations during jumps. We can consume it using the shield, as already mentioned, by ramming the opponents or, of course, by activating the boost. As for the weapons, we can collect them by passing through certain areas of the track and decide to use them immediately or to upgrade them (collecting them again) up to three times for a result that is as spectacular as it is effective. In this way the homing missile, for example, multiplies until it becomes a carpet bombing which leaves little chance for the unfortunate person on duty to continue the race unscathed. Or the electric shock becomes a real lightning that falls from the sky and hits whatever the position of the target. Or the limited range ~physical~ attack shockwave turns into a ~tunnel~ that affects anyone within its range. There are several weapons, all equally valid, and in more advanced races it is not uncommon to go from first to last place two corners from the finish because the opponents have been waiting for that moment to throw everything they have in store at us. These are certainly difficult moments to digest, especiallywhen you need to arrive among the top three or even first on the podium in order to unlock the next event: unfortunately the episodes of frustration linked to these dynamics are intrinsic to the genre to which ModNation Racers belongs, and therefore memorize each circuit perfectly and try to manage best weapons and highly recommended. However, we noticed situations that could instead have been managed better, such as the presence of obstacles that ~block~ our kart when we collide with it, really irritating. The creation according to United Front Games Although the story mode is quite full-bodied and challenging, it is clear that the prominent elements of the game reside above all in the editor and in the exuberant online component. We can access the first at any time from ModSpot, choosing whether to dedicate ourselves to creating new characters, new karts or new tracks. The creation of the character immediately appears as the one with the greatest possibilities and facets, so much so that with a little imagination and commitment it is possible to obtain results beyond all expectations (as witnessed by the amazing creations made available by the community of players already in the days of the beta, you see the various Mario Bros rather than Sonic or Dragon Ball characters). It is not possible to change the size or proportions of your pilot, but otherwise we have carte blanche: from the color of the skin (which can also be covered with a texture) to the shape of the eyes, nose, mouth and ears, from the clothes to the ~ stickers~, passing through accessories, we can really do everything. During the test we spent a few minutes with the editor, trying to create a double for Automan, the protagonist of an old 90s TV show: parted blond hair, white skin, solid color electric blue dress accompanied by numerous geometric shapes dark to delimit the muscle bands. The result didn't fully satisfy us, but it shows how easy it is to create any type of character by combining the various objects available and above all the very important ~stickers~. By dedicating time and patience to this practice, there really are no limits to what can be achieved. The matter relating to the creation of karts is different, the shape of which is subject to the available objects and cannot be changed. The point isn't the amount of different bodies available, because there are so many, but the fact that you can't modify them to create something truly unique, except in the paint and colors. The editor for creating the tracks from this point of view is much more permissive: after selecting the type of scenario among the four possible, we can draw the track as we like, without any limitation, and then dedicate ourselves to the modifications that concern the construction of ascents and descents, the creation of mountains and ditches, the distribution of the buildings and trees as well as the ~power-ups~ on the track. If we are short on time and we are mainly interested in the shape of the track, we can also leave the automatic composition of everything else to the game. Since it is a combination of known elements, then, the tracks can be downloaded in very few moments and this makes the impromptu challenges between players in the ModSpot a truly successful element. Therefore, if we have just created a track based on cornering ability and we want to use it to measure ourselves against someone, we can do it in complete freedom and without waiting due to download times. Playstation 3 trophies ModNation Racers contains a total of forty-eight trophies, divided as follows: thirty-six bronze, eight silver, three gold and of course one platinum. Bronze trophies are obtained by completing very simple objectives: the first race won, the first character created, the first time the boost bar is completely filled, etc. The hidden bronze trophies require a little more effort and revolve around completing tournaments in career mode. As for the silver trophies, we can unlock them by completing the career mode, collecting all available tokens, winning one hundred online races and so on. The three gold trophies are obtained by finishing first in all career mode races, earning 250,000 crafting points and reaching level 30, while the platinum trophy comes once all the others have been earned, as always. All together passionately Inside the ModSpot you can meet, you can talk and you can challenge each other, we have clarified that. However, you need to get to the Race Station, and in particular to the online section of the same, to be able to try your hand (among other things) with random or experience-based multiplayer races (XP races). The latter can be single events or series (tournaments, basically) for up to twelve players and a minimum of four, without bots. The organization of the races appears simple and immediate, and the final score (which leads us to change our character's class) as well as the order of arrival is based on factors such as speed, acrobatics and combat. The presence of the beta of the game has led to the emergence of a large number of really skilled players, who clearly in the final version of ModNation Racers reap the fruits of their ~training~ and take home the most important prizes. Both in solo mode and in XP races, these are made up of objects that add to our collection and multiply our possibilities for customizing characters, karts and tracks, closing a circle always based on modding. We have never noticed lag problems since the servers are online: the races develop in a fluid and exciting way, without problems or uncertainties that go beyond the voluntary disconnection of a particularly frustrated competitor. On some occasions the servers have crashed, but it is in all likelihood a problem of youth, which in fact seems to repeat itself less and less frequently with the passing of the days and the ~running in~ of the systems. What we really didn't like was the implementation of voice chat. We know that PlayStation 3 is still behind from this point of view, but in some games we had seen important improvements and we hoped that we could start from these results to get even more. At the moment, communicating with other players results in monstrous hiss and poor broadcast quality, accompanied by delays and loopbacks. Also the ingame chat is absent. Together with the already mentioned loading times, it is on balance the only technical lack of a truly well-finished product, characterized by a recognizable style and spot-on technical solutions. Some tracks in the story mode are truly exceptional and in principle there are no tracks with a mediocre design, so the quality remains quite stable and that is no small thing. The music performs its task in a functional way, without standing out, while the effects sometimes appear too little incisive compared to what occurs on the screen. The PSP version In its portable version, ModNation Racers clearly doesn't offer the same things seen on PS3, even if the attempts to do so by the developers are commendable. The story mode is practically unchanged, in the first place, and it doesn't matter if the real-time cutscenes have been replaced by CG sequences. The tracks are practically the same, even if the management of the weapons is different (there is no possibility of upgrading them on several levels) and the glance is hopelessly poorer, with the small size of the kart also putting us in difficulty when managing drifts, visually represented in a much less spectacular way. From the point of view of the editor, we still have a large number of possible objects and customizations, even if the important detail adjustments have been eliminated, while the ModSpot has been replaced by a simple graphical interface that allows us to take part in the various races or try our hand at editors. Given the differences between the Dual Shock 3 analog stick and the one supplied with the PSP, inevitably the feeling of the game is different and you need to do a little practice to get some results. The simplification of the polygonal models and a generally duller color palette unfortunately remove a good part of the ~cartoony~ character from the United Front Games product, which in any case presents itself as a purchase that is anything but evil, fun and full of interesting features .
