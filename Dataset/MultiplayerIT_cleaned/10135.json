In addition to the robust offer of options and modes present in the package, the EA Sports team already starting last year with Fifa 09 has created a further solution called Ultimate Team, offered through DLC and capable of proposing a new, intriguing approach to your own virtual sports journey. Given the excellent sales results and the enthusiasm of the community, an encore entitled very predictably Fifa 10 Ultimate Team, recently available on the online services of Xbox 360 and Ps3, was therefore taken for granted. Long live the figurines The first positive aspect of Fifa 10 Ultimate Team can be identified right away, when you are preparing to buy the DLC: the price has in fact been halved compared to last year's offer, and now set at 400 Microsoft Points or 4 99 euros on PSN. A more than honest figure in the face of the rich content of the package: Ultimate Team is in fact not an impromptu addition on which to waste a few hours, but a very robust mode capable of capturing anyone who manages to get into its ropes. For those who missed last year's debut, let's make a brief summary; Ultimate Team is a sort of mix between Fifa 10 and a Magic-type card game: players, technical staff, stadiums, uniforms, balls are all represented by cards, which form decks to expand and strengthen by purchasing packs from the store. This step can be performed both with ~real~ money and with the painstakingly collected virtual currency thanks to one's sports performance on the field. The packs and cards are divided into 3 categories - bronze, silver and gold - which very intuitively distinguish the value and quality of the cards. Also interesting is the possibility of participating in auctions and creating exchanges with other users, a social function that adds an important aspect in the development of one's deck. But getting good cards isn't enough to build a top team; the starting players must in fact be positioned on a table that represents the field, paying attention to ~where~ they are placed. In fact, natural roles must obviously be respected, without launching into improbable experiments like Messi in central defense, for example; but the aptitude of each player for the form adopted, and also the affinity relationships with teammates are also an important factor. For example, two athletes of the same nationality or belonging to the same club team will have a greater harmony, which will thus help create a compact formation capable of ~playing together~ in a profitable way. This factor will also be influenced by the staff, consisting not only of the coach but also of his collaborators; and as if that weren't enough, special cards must also be taken into account, with which to guarantee players bonuses of various kinds and types. All this effort to finally move on to playing football; and here too the offer is very varied, with a whole series of competitions, tournaments and trophies to be faced both in single offline and in online multiplayer. So a lot of irons in the fire, and a general rebalancing of the product in a less arcade key than last year; shame about an improvement menu organization that makes some passages uncomfortable and too cumbersome, but in principle Fifa 10 Ultimate Team confirms itself as a valid, interesting product that deserves to be taken into consideration. Last note for the timing of the release, which in the face of the months of ~seniority~ of Fifa 10 and with the upcoming World Cup version could put the product in the shade a bit.", "date": "2010-03-19", "grade": "8.0"}
