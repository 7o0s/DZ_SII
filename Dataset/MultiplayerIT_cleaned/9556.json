Probably not, but This Is The President, a new management software with a marked narrative component, published by THQ Nordic and due out on December 6th on PC, intends to propose a slightly distorted point of view compared to what similar titles have accustomed us to in the past . Proposing a crazy story, but not so much as to be improbable, we see the path taken by the game in this review of This Is The President. Our American history? This Is The President: A still shot from the game's first cutscene This Is The President immediately makes its intentions clear: the narrative is as important as its managerial nature. In fact, unlike many other superficially approachable titles, the game developed by SuperPAC already offers a strongly set plot from the beginning, complete with cutscenes and past events that cannot be changed. We impersonate the new President of the United States, a man who appears distinguished and honest, but who in reality hides a dark past, so much so that he ran as candidate (on the advice of his wife) only for the possibility of having Congress approve a ratification of the 28th Amendment, so as to provide immunity for life to any elected president and escape a mysterious charge, which would otherwise make him rot in jail for the rest of his life. Our goal is to succeed, in the four years of presidential term, in convincing not only the Congress of the legitimacy of our intentions, but also the American people, so as to prevent that, in the future, that effort will be undermined by another review. Even if you intend to follow the line of common sense, the absolutely and unconditionally self-centered goal that the game sets must always be taken into consideration. In short, it is not one of those management where you can build your story from top to bottom. There are stakes and they are also quite immovable, but you will still have the opportunity to carve your way to freedom. Uncontrolled gameplay This Is The President: we can choose how to run our administration While we have found ourselves having to choose the lesser evil during our years in office, we have often felt that our choices were, in fact, ~driven~ by the narrative. The game is divided into monthly sections: every month we have the opportunity to carry out actions and delegate others to our personal staff, which we can expand or thin out as we please, taking into consideration both the available budget and the reliability or usefulness of individual collaborators. The tasks we carry out reward or penalize us depending on the path we decide to take: something closer to public opinion will increase the consensus of the American people, but could undermine diplomatic relations or affect our personal resources , while decisions that are convenient only for our benefit will put us in a bad light, causing us to lose popularity and supporters. In other words, we find the unfailing search for balance that characterizes the management genre. This Is The President: the effects of a decision are often unpredictable However, we have noticed a certain randomness in the consequences of the choices made. Often, we have made a decision thinking we will achieve a certain result, but achieving the exact opposite only because the narrative had to follow a certain path. We understand the desire to exalt how even the most noble actions can be seen in a bad way by public opinion, but in this case he has perhaps gone too far on this rhetoric. Also because the pressing narrative pigeonholing is also found when one's collaborators have to be employed to complete a certain task. In short, some ~missions~ can only be carried out with the help of specific figures of one's staff, obviously adequate to complete the job. Through these, various ways can be selected to achieve the final goal, which does not ensure unconditional victory. Indeed, the initial choice of who to make available for the assignment is fundamental and one must be very careful in choosing the right people. However, despite having scrupulously selected the collaborators, we often found ourselves with unwanted results, far from the descriptions reported. Which penalizes the player, given that each staff member has a level of stress that must not be exceeded, under penalty of possible abandonment of the presidential cause. This makes the game slightly more frustrating, given that perhaps a strategy was builtwinner and, for a single misinterpreted word, you see your house of cards collapsing in no time at all. This Is The President: To prevent employees from becoming overly stressed, we can send them on vacation, which makes them unreachable for a month In general, we felt a little too directed during the choices, so much so that we even came to understand which initiatives to support and which to boycott to achieve our goal. Which is a real shame, given that the activities, the unexpected and the dialogues are built very well, so much so as to push you to want to continue your game to reveal the background and the intrigues pigeonholed into the grand design of this fairly stereotypical vision of America , but with criteria and knowledge of the current global situation. More current than the current This Is The President: the game takes full advantage of current events The main thing that amazes about This Is The President is its geopolitical and sociocultural accuracy. The minds behind the game, despite having exaggerated the most grotesque features of the American government institution, certainly have a clear understanding of the contemporary world scene. The game starts right from the 2020 presidential elections, where we find a rough and overbearing outgoing president years, it only succeeded in damaging the great power image chiseled by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the post-World War II era. Between public bickering and childish whims, the passing of the baton turns out to be tougher than expected, complete with riots during the inauguration of the new president in the White House. Then we have social and cultural movements, riots in big capitals, migratory flows, mass shootings, international quarrels that flow from the military to that of social media. This Is The President: the coincidence with events that occurred after our test of the game is of great concern Sometimes, the game even takes on prophetic traits, such as when a reference is made to a school shooting in Michigan at the hands of a fifteen-year-old (an event that actually happened just a few days ago). It's probably a pure coincidence (or, perhaps, a cunning update, even if a little too quick and certainly inelegant), but the game is full of all these little references to real or at least plausible events which, if on the one hand amaze , on the other hand they also lead to a reflective process, which pushes us to approach the title with a slightly different tone, less playful and more serious, as if the fate of the world actually weighed on our shoulders. A minestrone of styles This Is The President: This is the screen where most of the action takes place Leaving out of everything concerning the narrative and interactive side, This Is The President is certainly capable of striking at first glance. However, just like many government figures, he hides dark sides once you look a little closer. The watchword seems to be ~miscellaneous~. The game is not particularly complex from a technical point of view. In fact, we are faced with a single screen with various tabs and subcategories, all characterized by some dynamic effects that make the whole a little less static. In the background, a planisphere, initially focused on the US territory, but expandable as we progress through the main story. Visually it resembles post-war World's Fair or theme park maps, with points of interest magnified to stand out within the vast world area. However, this caricatured style seems to ~die there~ in the background. In fact, the images that accompany the texts, although created in a captivating way, almost like a conceptual sketch, completely change their appearance, proposing more dramatic tones, almost like a reportage. Which changes again in the icons of the characters, in full management style, but also in the interlude scenes, closer to the shores of interactive comics; not to mention the ornamental elements, which go back to the lines of art deco. The lack of stylistic coherence seemed clear to us. A real shame, also because, if taken individually, the various artistic inserts are made with care and knowledge of the facts (for the most part). This Is The President: many styles, but little defined visual coherence What, however, just did not convince us is the soundtrack. Here too we have a mix of influences and genres, ranging from jazz to the vulgarest rock, in a substantially non-stop succession of discordant sounds with an ~economic~ flavour. Personally, we have reached such a point of wear that we have decided to remove the music (both hererelevant to the narrative are reproduced in any case). After all the effort placed on the visual front (although we were unable to find a stylistic glue), we would have expected the same attention also for the soundtrack, especially in a game where the textual element is so preponderant, with only some sporadic dialogue dubbed. We also want to inform you that the game is completely in English, which is not a huge problem if you know the language. However, it can be difficult to follow some events even for the most trained, given the many terms coming from the US legislative and bureaucratic language.", "date": "2021-12-03", "grade": "6.8"}
