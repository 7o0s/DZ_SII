Yet, Kraine, protagonist of Act of Fury for iPhone and iPod Touch, seems to think differently. The incipit of the new DarkWave Games game seems to be that of a classic comic of the superhero genre: a laboratory guinea pig for a series of terrifying experiments in a secret military base, any guy gets the power to generate a storm capable of devastating an entire army. But Kraine is not Captain America, and now his only purpose in life is to use his new talent to destroy the entire base and take revenge on those who, playing God, reduced him to that state. The Milanese development team behind the brainy Master of Alchemy changes its genre and thus tries to offer a seemingly classic shoot 'em up on the App Store, but which stands out thanks to some particularly original ideas. Kraine for Vendetta A variation of vertically scrolling top-down shooters, Act of Fury differs from classic shooters on iOS devices in that it's impossible to shoot. After all, what to do with a shotgun when you have a giant vortex at your disposal? Kraine is in fact surrounded by a whirlwind capable of damaging the enemies he comes into contact with, and the entire game is thus based on the need to bring the protagonist closer to tanks, helicopters and turrets while trying to avoid incoming bullets. The fact that the enemies under attack remain paralyzed and are unable to attack greatly simplifies the player's life, although it is clear that in the most agitated moments the level of challenge still grows clearly. The impossibility of shooting makes the first moments of the game unsettling, but after a bit of practice you get involved in the frenzy of the title and its subtle strategic component: in certain moments, for example, the ideal would be to wait for two tanks have gotten close enough to each other to hit them simultaneously with the vortex, blocking both projectiles and earning more points. The only real obstacle is of a visual nature and, paradoxically, it is represented precisely by the whirlwind that constantly envelops the protagonist and which makes it difficult to clearly distinguish the bullets to avoid. A pity, because together with the lack of support for Retina Display it is the only drawback of a well-finished and coherent graphic component, made up of excellent sprites and pleasant graphic effects, as well as a series of illustrations in the menus so pleasant as to make us regret the lack of cartoons interlude to narrate the plot of the game. While the initial nine levels are already characterized by an above average difficulty, players looking for a considerable challenge will be able to tackle each scenario in its Hell Mode, a significantly more complex variant in which enemies continue to attack Kraine even when in contact with the vortex. In addition to increasing the level of difficulty, this idea forces you to take a completely different approach, to move continuously and to carefully decide which enemy to attack first, also considering that chain effects can eliminate multiple opponents in a single blow. To add a sense of progression to the experience, and obviously to lend a hand to the player, there is a system of unlockable power-ups for the protagonist: in this way it is possible to increase the number of lives available, the resistance or the strength of attack, giving the vortex elemental properties such as fire, water, and lightning. To obtain these skills it is necessary to use the stars received on the basis of the level score, a ploy that not only stimulates you to replay the previous scenarios several times, but which pushes you to complete the normal mode in the best possible way to be powerful enough before launching into Hell Mode. There is no shortage of power-ups to collect between one map and another and which allow, for example, to momentarily stop time, destroy all enemies on the screen or drag boulders capable of defending the player from incoming blows. Too bad that all this variety is a little less in the fights with the bosses, all too similar to each other, not only in terms of aesthetics but above all in the strategy required to be defeated.
