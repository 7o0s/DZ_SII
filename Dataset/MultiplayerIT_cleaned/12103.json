{"name": "Zendoku - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zendoku-recensione.html", "text": "Zen and Sudoku, a possible merger? More than anything else, it is legitimate to ask whether it is a useful fusion... Let's see why: Zoonami packs this product without ignoring the typical needs of the oriental public, Zendoku draws fully from the tradition of Japanese rebus games, but enriches Sudoku with a typically graphic interface cartoonish and lively, together with a revised and corrected mechanics in this sense. In reality, the changes are quite small. As in Sudoku we will have to fill in the table, the main difference will be that we will find ourselves operating with the use of typically oriental-style symbols (to give trivial examples, a long snake, a sumo wrestler, but also more classic images such as a heart or a sword). To all this is added the symbolism of a clash between two wrestlers which in reality is little more than a frame for the actual game. By completing the rows and columns we will launch an attack on our opponent: he will be represented by a graphical interaction of various types; breaking a brick with one punch, throwing a log, but also totally irrelevant actions such as unrolling a parchment. Our speed will be decisive in order to win the battle, as the faster we complete the pattern and the more attacks we can launch towards our opponent. It is precisely in these bizarre interactions that some limits of Zendoku are noticed. The game, for the uninitiated, is cross-platform and also available for Nintendo DS, and it seems futile to underline how the PSP version lacks immediate interaction in these attack mini-games, more suitable for using a touch screen than a set of buttons. Pressing a key to blow out some candles is obviously not the same thing as using the microphone on the Nintendo laptop. Inconsistency, an evil without remedy If PSP does not seem the right platform for Zendoku, it must be said that the Zoonami title has far more serious structural flaws that make it a rather mediocre title overall. The very captivating graphics full of bright colors can't hide the attempt at a rather useless innovation: the exploitation of symbols in the game board. They represent more a confusion than a diversion, and one wonders why a player should prefer, in terms of playability, a title like Zendoku rather than a simple Sudoku where the number proves to be an unavoidable, practical, essential component. Finally, to return to the attack mini-games, they also prove to be a rather unrelated component to the rest of the game, they are never really fun and the player ends up suffering them, almost in the throes of frustration. If we add the fact that when we start the console we can choose between Zendoku and classic Sudoku, the conclusion to these considerations becomes quite embarrassing: the latter is clearly preferable, tested, and immediate. Comment Zendoku tries hard to innovate a classic oriental-style puzzle without succeeding. The result is a hodgepodge that is more aesthetic than substantial, while when the content brings actual novelties they turn out to be incoherent, poorly studied, sometimes even frustrating. The presence of various game modes and a well-structured tutorial after all do not save a situation that defining tragic could be interpreted as a compliment. And that wouldn't be right. Silence probably best describes our state of mind. Pros Very colorful and lively graphics Cons The laughable novelties make the gameplay worse Icons instead of numbers make the approach more confusing Mini-games in the rather boring attack phases Zendoku is available for PSP and DS. The reviewed version is the one for PSP. The puzzle game is considered by many to be the essence of portable gaming, probably not wrongly, given the setting of this kind of title, their indisputable propensity for pure entertainment games, ideal while in line at the post office or for any appointment. The Japanese, a living emblem of this lifestyle (we know something about queues, they have no rivals), are not a little inclined to this way of playing. It must have been for this reason that a game like Sudoku had simply stratospheric success in the lands of the Rising Sun, then managing to collect a large following also in the rest of the planet. For those unfamiliar with it, Sudoku puts us in front of a square table of 81 boxes, grouped into six sections larger than 9 tiles each. The aim of the game was to put numbers ranging from 1 to 9 into the boxes without repeating any of them in the same section, column or row.", "date": "2007-07-25", "grade": null}
