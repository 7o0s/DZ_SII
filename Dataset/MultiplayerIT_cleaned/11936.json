{"name": "Blazing Angels 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blazing-angels-2-recensione.html", "text": "Secret missions and mysterious weapons Rather than offering a realistic glimpse of what was the second world war, Blazing Angels borrows weapons, settings and various historical elements mixing them within a plot that, beyond the main historical nodes, has very little realistic and a lot of romance. This second chapter, in particular, deals with decidedly particular themes, which rarely appeared in other similar games (even if not absent from the panorama): the secrets and experimental weapons of the German army. In command of an imaginary patrol of aces of the sky, part (obviously) of the allied troops, we will therefore find ourselves facing top secret missions trying to thwart the growing threat posed by the power of the Nazi army. The vastness and large number of battlefronts of the Second World War provide a correspondingly high number of different and extremely varied environments: ranging from the North Pole to Egypt, for example, and from the quiet English countryside to the most inflamed central Europe. The variety of situations is also ensured by the diversity of objectives for each mission and by the large amount of aircraft made available, each specialized in specific operations to be learned from time to time. It will not therefore be a question of launching into air patrols and simply shooting down enemy aircraft in industrial quantities, instead there will be a need to continuously extricate oneself in situations that are quite different from each other. In general, the missions are structured on the basis of some main objectives, the achievement of which is necessary for the continuation of the story, and in other secondary objectives, the completion of which involves the earning of ~prestige points~, with which it is possible to purchase numerous upgrades for planes. In principle, the objectives involve the shooting down or the approach to targets on the ground, or air combat, with all the variants of the case inside: the first category, for example, includes the bombardments of enemy artillery, the torpedoing of ships or the approach to specific points of interest, while in the second, which represents the heart of the game, the situations are multiple, from the clash with enemy planes to the shooting down of targets in flight. In some cases the game puts us in front of real bosses, with appropriate enormous dimensions and weak points to unhinge: for example, the attack on a gigantic Zeppelin airship, scenically satisfying, is remarkable. Arcade simulation Blazing Angels 2, like the first chapter, is quite far from the typical structure of flight simulators: the commands are quite simple and intuitive, well distributed on the console controller. Essentially, with the left analog stick you control the direction of the plane, with the right one you control the speed, with the right trigger you shoot, with the left you ~lock~ the main opponent, while the other keys are entrusted with various functions depending on the context. Although Ubisoft Romania has tried to make the flight of these planes from half a century ago somewhat realistic, it is clear that the game belongs to the genre of arcade shooters, with the possibility of performing maneuvers at the limit of the laws of physics without any limitations whatsoever , assisting the maneuvers in order to make the flight as dynamic and intuitive as possible, leaving the player only the task of following his target and avoiding being hit or, at least, crashing to the ground. It is clear that those looking for a simulation will turn up their noses at the simplification of the game structure, but in fact it is not the intent of Blazing Angels to provide a realistic reconstruction of the flight dynamics on World War II planes, but rather to bring the classic shooter structure in the context of aerial combat. Where the first episode failed, i.e. in the heart of the action, the dogfight itself, decisive steps forward have been made in this second chapter: the artificial intelligence of companions and characters has been improved, and dogfights have become challenges satisfactory. On more than one occasion we will find ourselves trying to shake a tenacious enemy from his tail with high-impact evasive maneuvers, while trying to stay behind and knock down enemies has become more difficult, although there are still cases where target shooting it is disarmingly easy, especially in the first levels. The game offers a very wide range of aircraft to be used, making sure to use the most specifically suitable means for each type of mission (fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and experimental vehicles), and also offers an approfondita possibility to modify the characteristics of the aircraft. In fact, with the ~prestige points~ accumulated during the missions, we can buy various upgrades that will improve the aircraft's performance: aerodynamics, armor, weapons, maneuverability, rate of fire, etc. Just like in the first episode, the introduction of the patrol to manage appears rather unrealistic: there are essentially two commands (attack and defend), and the problem is that the companions are practically invulnerable, which flattens the strategy to a simple, continuous order to attack sure that no member of the team will be able to harm themselves. Multiplayer As its predecessor already boasted, Blazing Angels 2 contains a well-structured and satisfying multiplayer mode, both online via Live and offline via System Link or split screen. It is possible to launch a campaign with a human teammate (which a minimum increases the pathos of keeping the patrol alive), through the cooperative mode, or organize one-on-one or team aerial skirmishes. Everything is managed optimally by the Live support, and the multiplayer represents a big incentive to keep the attention high for the game even after the single player campaign is over. Threatening skies It is noted from the first impact that the game was built on a reworked version of the graphics engine at the base of the first episode: with due proportions, and contextualizing the title in the current Xbox 360 software offer, it must be said that the technical sector does not it's definitely crying out for a miracle, especially when compared to Namco's upcoming Ace Combat 6. It is however characterized by discreet graphics, which demonstrate its best in the creation of the sky (dramatically full of clouds and reddish reflections at sunset, or leaden in morning patrols or still cloaked in a rich starry vault in night missions) and of the planes. The light effects and the reflections on the clouds and on the water surface are beautiful, while the elements on the ground, although present in large quantities, are generally rather rough, just enough to make a good effect at high altitudes, but falling short in quality with the 'to approach the ground. The animations of the planes are a little uncertain in some cases, while those of the elements on the ground are rather poor, complete with gross errors in the contacts between the polygons, while the framerate stands at good levels with some uncertainties in moments of greater excitement, occasionally the classic tearing appears to disturb the image. The audio sector does its part well as regards the sound effects, with the predictable rumbles of the propeller engines, the shots of the machine guns and the explosions rendered in a credible way, together with a large amount of dialogue in English between the protagonists of the story . The music, for their part, underlines the pregnant moments with the classic epic gait of the soundtracks of war-type action games, even if they do not represent anything particularly exciting. Goals 360 There are 50 unlockable achievements within the game, for the classic total of 1000 points to add to your Gamerscore. The achievements are distributed in a rather logical way, partly reachable within the single player campaign, and partly unlockable by playing multiplayer. Their placement follows the classic thread of this genre of games, with points distributed at the end of each of the 18 game missions, plus various awards for particular performances and achievements obtained in battle. Collecting them all is a challenge, but certainly not impossible. Comment Blazing Angels 2 represents a classic ~more of the same~ than the original episode. Without expanding the concept of the first towards any new level, this second chapter limits itself to smoothing out its defects and enhancing its positive aspects, earning an extra point but without deviating too much from the judgment of the previous chapter. The missions are now much more varied and the situations in which you find yourself do everything to move the gameplay away from the monotony that the genre can easily suffer from. Aerial combat is more exciting, thanks to a new artificial intelligence that forces more dynamic and unpredictable attack or evasive maneuvers. The multiplayer mode gives life to the game, increasing its longevity and adding that vitality that only the challenge with human opponents can offer, and perhaps in this aspect the game shows its best. And yet, something is still missing to get the game off the ground definitively, something that is perhaps difficult to find within the genre itself, which can hardly break free from clichs and a mbasic honour that also rages despite the precautions taken by the developers. It remains a title suitable for fans of the genre, who also cannot count on many other alternatives, while others may not be able to get caught up in the somewhat repetitive gameplay. Pros: Varied missions and situations Fast and intuitive arcade gameplay Good multiplayer support Cons : A bit repetitive Technically not excellent Little bite to complete it Blazing Angels 2: Secret Missions of World War II is available for PC and Xbox 360, and from November for PlayStation 3. The tested version is the one for Xbox 360. The rediscovery of the bloody scenarios of the Second World War has now become a trend for the videogame market, with a truly disproportionate number of titles inspired by the most tragic conflict in recent European history. Fashion seems to have already crossed its peak, and taken the path of decline, a fact demonstrated by the developers' choice to set Call of Duty, the flag of historical reconstruction in FPS, in the contemporary period. Within all this anthology of games on the Second World War, the scarcity, at least in the console field, of titles dedicated to the fascinating world of vintage aviation stands out, a lack that Ubisoft has tried to remedy with its Blazing series Angels. In fact, the choice entails a double result: on the one hand, to exploit the wake of the success that the Second World War seems to continue to collect among the public of gamers, on the other, to try to apply the most classic formula of the aerial shooter to a sort of simulation in the modern sense. In fact, arcade flight simulations with a contemporary setting often suffer from the excessive technological rate syndrome: with modern weapons, aerial combat in a video game is reduced to detecting dots on the screen (approaching enemies) and automatically shooting them down as soon as they appear the writing Lock on, except in special cases. The choice to use vintage aircraft, armed with short-range machine guns, sounds like a return to the origins of the shooter, with enemies clearly visible and present at a short distance, to be chased and shot down with whirling and daring maneuvers. This is the true strength of Blazing Angels, the rediscovery of the purest ~dogfight~, in an undoubtedly fascinating setting.", "date": "2007-10-15", "grade": null}
