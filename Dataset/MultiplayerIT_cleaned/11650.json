{"name": "Chi vuol essere Milionario? - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chi-vuol-essere-milionario-recensione_a.html", "text": "Il Milionario is a hugely successful television quiz show, whose rules are widely known by many Italians; for anyone who doesn't know them, we do our best to explain them. Unlike other similar programmes, in Millionaire only one competitor plays at a time: to separate him from winning the million there are fifteen general knowledge questions, of increasing difficulty, some of which constitute a sort of check-point which, once passed, guarantees at least the gain of the amount just conquered. In player aid there are three aids, which we will cover in more detail in the course of the review. Playing from the sofa The quiz has received excellent ratings on television not only for the structure, which is quite classic, but also for the context in which the game takes place. The communication between the contestant and the conductor was essential for the success of the program, and this element was inevitably lost in the videogame transposition. The same could be said for the tension generated by the television quiz show, which offers a lot of money: this feature not only involves the viewer more, but also balances the competitor's game, undoubtedly making it slower and more weighted than those of the video game. Gerry Scotti's voice has also been lost, replaced by that of an anonymous commentator who, unfortunately, does not read the questions but limits himself to conversing and communicating the outcome of the answers. Regarding this last aspect, the choice made must be criticized, as some sentences have been associated with a single result (positive or negative), so you will soon be able to understand, before it is made official, if your answer is the correct one. The control system isn't without problems either, although the Wiimote is great for this kind of game. To answer a question you will have to highlight one of the four answers located at the bottom of the screen and press A, but it is not necessary to do it simultaneously, as would have been logical, because the game remembers the last option you touched with the cursor: in this way , once one of the four has been selected, just press A, regardless of the position of the pointer, to confirm the answer. Such a process inevitably leads, on some occasions, to answer - and make mistakes - involuntarily, also assisted by the commenter's voice, which sometimes prevents you from moving the cursor, fixing it on option ~A~. The mode that doesn't exist As previously mentioned, to help the player in the ~climb to the million~ there are three aids: that of the public, that from home and that of the computer (the switch, introduced in the latest television edition, was not included in the videogame version), each of them usable only once in each game. The first is quite useful in the original quiz, and consists in testing the opinion of the audience present in the studio; however, it is fundamental in the video game, as, rather than the question itself, the position of the question within the fifteen total is taken into account: you could thus find yourself incredibly cultured spectators, provided they are asked in the first moments of the game. The second, the phone call to an acquaintance, is extremely advantageous in the original game, because it allows, in addition to relying on the knowledge of the person called, to make him look up the meaning of a word in any dictionary; for obvious reasons it was not possible to translate this last prerogative into the video game, so the phone call has lost much of its value. In this version you will thus have to limit yourself to calling one character among four proposed by the CPU, hoping that there is at least one expert in the desired subject (you will not be able to check beforehand): in most cases you will not be lucky, so you will find yourself more often exclude the suggested option than to select it. The last help, which eliminates 50% of the answers, is the only one that enjoys the same prestige in the two versions of the quiz. The Millionaire suffers from other problems, mainly in the management and in the number of questions, two fundamental discriminating factors for a game of this type. From the very first games you will find yourself answering the same questions, which will return identical or with reverse formulation, and you will immediately notice that the order in which they appear has been set ingenuously: the first question could come up with a decidedly more complex argument than the sixth or to the seventh, an almost impossible eventuality in the television quiz show, but unfortunately quite frequent in the version discussed here. These are the flaws that afflict the parts included in the game, but it would be hypocritical not to mention those that undermine its quality because they are absent: you can't create personal profiles, there are no statistics, there is no online mode to download additional questions or compare yourself with other players. The only factor capable of increasing longevity is multiplayer, in which up to two competitors take turns answering questions. There is also a small mini-game, not available in singles, which consists of finding an order to a series of words... a challenge that you will complete in no more than ten seconds: due to the short duration, as well as the lack of bite, he won't be able to entertain you for long. Comment The Millionaire is a simple game, but too many details have been overlooked for us to be satisfied: imprecise controls, questions that repeat themselves from the very first games, poorly calibrated difficulty, totally absent online modes and statistics, poorly balanced aids. The original structure is still valid, and thanks to the fame of the quiz it remains a good gift for a certain part of the Wii user, even if a budget price would certainly have made it more attractive.Pros It's always a good quiz... ... Capable of engaging many player types Cons Several flaws in the control system Few questions and poorly ordered No sub-modes", "date": "2008-01-29", "grade": null}
