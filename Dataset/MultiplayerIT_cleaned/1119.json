{"name": "Hamtaro Rainbow Rescue", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hamtaro-rainbow-rescue.html", "text": "The indigo colored mayor The story behind the game unfolds according to the typical plot of many episodes of the animated series: Hamtaro and his companions, in short the Ham-Hams, being nothing but cute little animals, some more some domestic and not having the thousands of commitments that instead they hang over the heads of all poor mortals, they enjoy life from morning to night, inside their Club House or, when possible, in the open air. It is precisely in one of these moments that Bijou, the little hamster loved by Boss but who seems to have eyes only for Hamtaro (ah, these hamsters!), after a rainy morning, while enjoying the fresh air, realizes always a very fascinating sight, the rainbow. Unfortunately, the time to go and call friends and the rainbow, as often happens, has already disappeared... Arcolino crashes to Earth, and to be precise exactly on Boss's head The indigo colored mayor The obvious disappointment of the Ham-Hams, however, is not the most serious consequence of the rapid disappearance: that rainbow had actually been created by Prince Arcolino, the most famous hamster of Arcobalandia, as a way for an important journey, one of those trips to which a hamster of similar caliber just cannot escape. By now devoid of any support against the force of gravity, Arcolino falls to Earth, and to be precise exactly on Boss's head; once the confusion has calmed down and the problem has been explained, the Ham-Hams offer to help their unfortunate new friend as usual: their task is to reconstitute the rainbow, finding seven ~ingredients~ of the right color and passing them on to the prince, who thanks his magical umbrella will do the rest. The indigo colored mayor Rainbow Rescue presents the typical structure of a Japanese adventure, almost completely devoid of fights and elements of violence that are not exposed in an extremely comical and harmless key. The Club House acts as a ~hub~ for the seven different areas of the game, each of which hides an ingredient, in which the hamsters will almost always move in a more or less numerous group, under the banner of that ~Unity makes strength which is a bit the founding message of the game as well as of the cartoon. In fact, in addition to the typical activities of the genre, exploration and dialogue with NPCs (which for the uninitiated stands for Not Playing Hamsters. Ehm...), the game confronts numerous situations that require the presence of more Ham-Hams. Typical examples: there is a particular object to move, perhaps because it can serve as a passage from one part of the level to another, but the object weighs and a few hamsters alone are unable to move it; or again, suspended at a certain height there is a rope on which to climb, and only by hoisting themselves on each other's shoulders can the rodent friends reach it. the hamsters will almost always move in a more or less numerous group, under the banner of that ~Unity is strength~ which is in a way the founding message of the game as well as of the cartoon The indigo colored mayor The game is full of such cases but, apart from finding your companions in case you haven't already done so, they do not present any particular challenges. The true ~playable heart~ of Rainbow Rescue is represented by the numerous mini-games, some necessary to advance, others optional, of which it is stuffed. They range from pure and simple skill tests with the pad, to memory and observation tests, from reductions of famous board games to parodies of the Pokmon-style combat system, from rather simplistic rhythmin' games even to flight sections made with a convincing Mode 7. Even for minigames the concept of group is fundamental, although each one is faced by only one hamster at a time: in fact, only one of the Ham-Hams is suitable for a specific type of minigame, and if it is not one of your right moment, you will have nothing to do but go and look for it. Forbidden to majors? Many mini-games can be played multiple times to improve your scores, and also don't forget to visit each level even after completing it, because it's likely you'll unlock new areas and new challenges. The reward for the hamsters' efforts is not only the sought-after ingredient, which they will in fact be able to collect, scattered around the playing area or in special shops (the currency of the hamster world is the sunflower seed, stock up on it!), drawings to color and numerous backgrounds on which to stick hundreds and hundreds of stickers, representing the Ham-Hams and the most varied objects imaginable. Finally, backgrounds, stickers and drawings can be exchanged between two owners of the game, and indeed, it is only by taking advantage of this feature that the rarest stickers are obtained. Rainbow Rescue presents no difficulty particular being dedicated to an audience of very young people Forbidden to majors? Intuitively Rainbow Rescue does not present particular difficulties being dedicated to an audience of very young people, but nevertheless the mini-games are all well thought out and able to lavish fun with both hands. Furthermore, the difficulty is well calibrated and represents an ideal approach for the youngest to the world of video games: the little players will have to work hard to get the last two or three ingredients. Even some older players, in truth, may have to repeat a test more than a couple of times... The non-linearity of the levels contrasts with this state of affairs: the succession of events is practically immutable, but the geography of the worlds, moreover, rather extensive, sometimes it takes on labyrinthine conformations in which even an experienced adventurer could find it difficult to move. Forbidden to majors? It is not so much non-linearity as the way in which this is managed that represents the most evident defect of HRR: there is no detailed map of the stage, and within this the graphical reference points with which to mark the difference in mind between one route and another there are few; this is a defect also present in Alphadream's most famous game, that Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga which however was only slightly undermined, and also in this case the damage is low. Another defect is a somewhat ~irrascible~ management of some collisions, where the hamster who leads the group will be positioned precisely without any tolerance, but they are really goat's wool issues. Longevity is ensured by the extension of the levels and the high dose of replayability; moreover, whoever wants to unlock everything that can be unlocked will have something to do. some [faces] are truly anthology and will make even those who are long past the age to look at Hamtaro tip over in their seat. Forbidden to majors? The graphics have the only flaw, already mentioned, of a slight monotony of the levels, but for the rest we stand at levels of excellence: the sprites are large and beautifully designed, and the game screen can even host more than one dozen all in motion without the fluidity being affected in the slightest. The backdrops are quite simple, but effective, and colored with very pleasant pastel shades which however, to tell the truth, do not fully convey the spirit of the cartoon. This is the only limitation to a task that otherwise the game performs perfectly, and that is to recreate the atmospheres of the animated series on the small screen of the GBA (and perhaps on those slightly larger than the DS for the first lucky ones). Above all, the animations amaze, full of frames, always fluid and above all very funny, and in particular the wonderful faces that the hamsters are able to make, both as sprites and as ~figurines~ that appear in the dialogues: some are truly anthology and will to tip over even those who are long past the age to look at Hamtaro. Comedy on the verge of insane that is often found even in the dialogues and more generally in all game situations (after playing HRR the chicks will no longer seem so cute...), and which in the end represents the real point strong of the title at least from the point of view of an adult, but always accompanied by the right dose of assorted sweetness, as well as a healthy didactic and pedagogical touch. The picture closes with a sound that, as happens too often, does its homework and goes no further. Comment It may not be entirely safe to entrust the judgment of Hamtaro Rainbow Rescue to an adult and vaccinated player, given the target to which the game is aimed. But in the end if we all play video games it is because even those who are no longer registered at the registry office keep their nature as a child in their hearts, and then it is no longer so difficult to affirm that the present title here, in addition to constituting an ideal approach for a kid in the world of video games, fully captures the spirit of the cartoon from which it is based, and therefore represents a purchase, or a gift, perfect for any fan of Hamtaro. Little ones and big ones. Pros Fun mini-games suitable for the target Fully captures the spirit of the cartoon Excellent graphics Cons Levels a bit dispersive Sound? Does anyone think about sound? If there's one thing that years and years of movies, cartoons, comics, books and video games have taught us, it's that there are mysteries in the world that would be better left as such, and the process in which the creation of one of the notorious acronyms is articulated by Cristina d'Avena and socio-male-whose-name-I-can't-remember-absolutely is just one of these: humbly, therefore, we withdraw and give up on understanding what relevance the paraphrased verse has in the'introduction with the rest of the acronym of Hamtaro, the nice and cute little hamster now in his fourth playful appearance. Here, let's get serious and talk about this Rainbow Rescue.", "date": "2004-11-29", "grade": null}
