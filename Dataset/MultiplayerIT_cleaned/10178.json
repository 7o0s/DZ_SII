However, the idea of the work done by Gas Powered does not stop at just the list of projects of this team, embodied in a long-awaited sequel by lovers of the first chapter and of strategy in general: after having had the opportunity in recent months to follow the development of this game, let's finally find out what the developers have in store for us. The drama of war The passage of the Supreme Commander brand from the THQ shores to those of Square Enix represented a clear turning point from a narrative point of view, making the story of the game in the campaign mode no longer a simple pretext to slay one's enemies, but a prominent component which will not fail to excite, while not particularly shining in originality. We are twenty-five years after the events told in the Forged Alliance expansion, with an increasingly unstable peace between the three UEF forces, Illuminati and Cibrani, old acquaintances modernized for the occasion. The balance is soon broken by the assassination of the new President which is followed by a series of attacks between the enemy sides: at the center of the story a protagonist for each of them, starting with a UEF captain, then moving on to lead an army of Illuminati and concluding with the Cibrani. The eighteen missions are equally divided into six for each of the forces and run off in a quite enjoyable way, without boredom and downtime but on the contrary alternating the objectives in a varied and engaging way, binding the player even emotionally to the three main characters who in turn guide history. The main criticisms made by many to the first chapter by analyzing its game mechanics concerned the excessive size of the maps created at the time combined with the amount of forces put on the battlefield. Which in reality for just as many people was more of an advantage than a defect, given that it guaranteed the possibility of feeling in command of a real army to be led correctly on several fronts to achieve success, offering a good level of challenge to counterbalance the inevitable moments of greater calm. Be that as it may, even for GPG this must have been a point to be reviewed, given that the various scenarios where the battles take place are now decidedly smaller than those seen previously, eliminating the dead times that partially characterized the first Supreme Commander and dropping the player into the heart of the action practically immediately. The result is a gameplay in which you never have time to get bored, both for the variety of objectives and for the possibility of facing enemies while always discovering new parts of your army, such as the large assault robots or the Noah cannon , a particular structure capable of firing units from one point on the map to another, penetrating behind enemy lines. In the single campaign, the difficulty level set to normal proves to be a little too simple for the more experienced, who are therefore advised to directly select the maximum one to have a challenge at the level of their abilities. Things improve a bit in the Skirmish mode, where it is possible to configure the behavior of the enemies controlled by the artificial intelligence with some extra parameters, in itself however quite good as regards the adaptation of the various units to the situations that arise, except some unfortunate episode in the pathfinding phase that leads them to literally stop forcing the player to guide them in several moves to unravel the situation. Research is everything While mass and energy continue to play a fundamental role in the creation of structures and units, research is what allows our army to specialize in a certain direction, accumulating points as the game progresses that can be used to upgrade one or more several parts of the array. Depending on the type of battle we are experiencing, for example, it may be necessary to develop a certain skill for land units, which is greater firepower for existing ones or the creation of one of the fearsome assault robots, to be unlocked through a tree of upgrades ranging from increased ~life~ energy to the availability of new units and structuresure. The branches in which it is possible to specialize the army are land, sea, air and structure, plus a section specifically dedicated to the command units, the center of activity in the base together with the engineers. Engineers compared to whom, for example, the ACU offer greater speed in completing the assigned tasks, as well as having a fair amount of fire on board to fight aircraft and ground vehicles. The game scheme falls within the classic paper, scissors, stone with some due variations to which we are used to by strategists, so we need to pay close attention to which units you put against the various types of opponents. Matter of zoom Long feared by many, Supreme Commander 2's engine isn't as heavy as its predecessor, although it still doesn't reach the level of scalability and fluidity that could have been hoped for, given that in some rare stages it showed some uncertainty even on the test configuration even at 1280x1024. As far as detail is concerned, however, the impression is that the chosen compromise was to lower the level a little, something noticeable more than anything else when zooming in on a unit in particular, even if it must be said that for the purposes of the game itself it is decidedly rare that you find yourself doing it. The maps, as we said earlier, now smaller, show evident attention to detail, appearing well made and usable to the fullest thanks to the game command view, which allows you to have the minimum zoom level (with a simple turn of the mouse then) a general picture of the forces present on the field, making it easy to read the type and number of units deployed in battle. The sound consists of music perfectly suited to the purpose for which they were created, adapting perfectly to the more or less excited game phases and changing from time to time; close the picture of sound effects as tradition dictates and a good quality English-language dubbing with Italian subtitles, among which occasionally a few too many small translation errors are visible. Not just single player Supreme Commander 2's multiplayer consists of three main modes through which you can compete with other users. Assassination requires the destruction of the other's supreme commander, while Supremacy to raze the base and the entire enemy force and Infinite War to clash without continuity or victory condition, so you can freely experience the growth of your army and the more daring tactics. In total there will be 21 maps, some of which taken from the first chapter, playable by a total of eight people on PC - strictly via Steam - and four on Xbox 360. Finally, there are a series of options to adjust parameters such as the presence of factions controlled by AI, the fog of war, some spawn points, and so on. Overall, it appeared to be of good significance, as always in the review, the competitive component is difficult to evaluate, leaving the task to the feedback arriving after the game is released.", "date": "2010-02-25", "grade": "8.5"}
