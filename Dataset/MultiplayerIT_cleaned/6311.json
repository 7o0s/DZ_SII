We are used to seeing the reverse process, with conversions, spin-offs or adaptations of successful console games into titles for smartphones and tablets, which is practically a given in the current market. But if a game born for mobile devices is transferred to real gaming machines, it usually means that it has achieved two main objectives: it has achieved truly extraordinary success and is characterized by a structure and technical realization that would not disfigure on notoriously more performing machines, in front of a certainly more demanding public. This last point is particularly important, because the use of a title with the controller in hand and in front of the TV is necessarily different from what one usually has with a smartphone or tablet and only experiences of a certain level and of a certain depth they can withstand the expert player's test. Badland had what it takes to take the big step and this Game of the Year Edition proves that Frogmind's little creature has strong enough wings to fly even in much more difficult and selective territories than the App Store. The game therefore returns, a couple of years after its first appearance on mobile devices, in this form as a digital title for PC and console, thanks to a new edition also including the substantial expansions released after the original launch, i.e. Day II, Daydream, Doomsday and a cooperative and competitive local multiplayer sector, as well as a series of subtle but effective adjustments applied to the control system and consequently to the level design to make the game fit on the controller and on the new context of home consoles . Clony returns in a vitaminized version on consoles and PC with Badland: Game of the Year Edition A strange story Badland's narration is barely hinted at among its enigmatic levels, unfolding hermetically between the lights and shadows that characterize its graphic style, creating a fascinating aura of mystery and magic around the wandering of the strange winged creature that we find ourselves making flutter awkwardly among a thousand dangers. It is not difficult to see suggestions from Limbo inside, referring to that line of games that mix melancholy and properly disturbing tones in bizarre and cynical interactive fairy tales. All we need to know is that the creature, called Clony, must fly between many obstacles to save his world, apparently threatened by strange machines that can be glimpsed moving in the background, with a perceptible progression as you progress through the levels as the day fades into night and the tones become increasingly dark, hand in hand with an increase in the difficulty and danger that constantly surrounds the bizarre volatile protagonist. What happens must therefore above all be intuited, while the succession of levels within the four macro-areas made up of the various phases of the day is clear, starting in the morning, continuing in the middle of the day and then concluding at dusk and finally reaching night, in a crescendo of difficulty and gloom that gives a good idea of approaching the final stages of the challenge. The original version of Badland certainly didn't stand out for a great longevity and even in this case the main Campaign doesn't require a large number of hours to complete, but the Game of the Year Edition has undergone a significant injection of content with the integration of the expansions released later on the mobile platforms and a rather rich multiplayer sector, even if usable exclusively locally for up to four players. In total, according to reports from Frogmind, about fifteen hours are required to complete all one hundred levels available for single player, in addition to one hundred levels in cooperative multiplayer and twenty-seven arenas for competitive multiplayer. A close flight The concept behind Badland is extremely simple, but its implementation on the screen is enriched by a series of variables that a simple textual explanation cannot do justice to, as befits a well-made puzzle game. It is a complex mechanism whose gears are studied to the millimeter in order to function properly, and the result is a balanced and profound game, despite its basic simplicity. Within forced scrolling levels, the aim is to reach the conclusion of each section trying to avoid traps and obstacles. Clony is controlled by simply pressing a key (one of the ffront or one of the triggers, at your choice) which makes the creature's wings flap, according to the setting directly borrowed from the original on the touch screen. The transposition has inevitably lost that tactile synergy between the movement of the fingers on the screen and the flight of the protagonist that characterizes the mobile version, but in this reduction something has been gained in the introduction of control through the analog stick. Unlike the original, in this one it is possible to give a direction to the flight of the creature, albeit in a only hinted way, which has led to a slight but decisive general reorganization of the levels to accommodate this greater possibility of control. The first difficulty is represented by the need to learn how to control Clony's flight, which is actually rather awkward, which requires a precise dosage of the pressure on the key (for this reason it is preferable to use the trigger, which allows a certain ~play ~ on its run) to avoid obstacles and not lag behind scrolling. However, the control system is enriched and complicated exponentially with the addition of the various power-ups present capable of modifying the behavior of the creature: speeding up, slowing down, amplifying the movements or guaranteeing a continuous rotation in contact with the walls or still allowing it to adhere to surfaces. There are also the size modifiers, which make Clony bigger or smaller and finally the fundamental possibility of creating different clones of the protagonist with which to increase the chances of survival within particularly difficult passages or to be divided on various paths for activate switches and ensure the passage and survival of at least a single creature. The cynicism we were talking about becomes evident in these situations, since the sacrifice of even a large number of clones is inevitable, when not really necessary, in order to keep even one creature going until the end of the level, although the game obviously rewards the ability to get as many clones to safety as possible. Xbox One goals Badland: Game of the Year Edition has a really large amount of unlockable achievements, that is 77 out of the usual total of 1000 points for the Gamerscore. As a result, each achievement carries a fairly small amount of points, and they're all spread out along a large path that requires you to achieve various performances. The simple progress between the levels guarantees only a small part of the loot, which for the complete conquest pushes you to explore each game mode and try to behave in an extremely correct or even somewhat incorrect way. Lights and shadows The use of chiaroscuro, as already mentioned, immediately brings to mind Limbo and similar titles (NightSky by Nifflas could be another case in point), but the contrast between the dark silhouettes in the foreground of the protagonist and the sensitive elements of the scenario with the colorful and bright background creates a very special effect. Following the game's tacit non-narrative, observing the colorful elements of the scenery it is possible to guess what is happening in the bizarre world of Clony, as the light fades from the soothing tones of the morning to the eerie darkness of a night full of mysteries. The Game of the Year Edition has undergone a further enrichment of the graphics sector with a complete remastering at 1080p but the backbone of the entire graphics sector is the particular style adopted by the team to represent the magical world of Badland. Without particularly important technological solutions, the game immerses us in its world thanks to the hand-drawn drawings and the strength of those dominant colors in the background which create a violent contrast with the dark figures on which we are forced to focus attention. The mobile matrix is evident in the relative simplicity of the technical sector, but the artistic direction, for once, frees the game from the narrow perimeter of smartphone production to distinguish it from the mass of titles also in the console and PC fields. Forgetting about polygons, pixels and frame rates, the game captures us in its bizarre world without frills or verbose presentations and although certain graphic solutions are not entirely original, it is evocative and memorable even in the midst of thicker productions. The audio sector contributes to the creation of the dreamlike and alien climate with the accompaniment of only sound effects during the game phases and some rare music in the interlude phases.", "date": "2015-05-26", "grade": "8.7"}
