It is not an X-style title, with a universe to explore, but a son of Wing Commander who offers us, through a series of missions held together by a narrative thread, all classic situations of this once crowded but silent sub-genre for several years. And here we are, without too much surprise, defending transports, eliminating waves of enemies, intercepting torpedoes and pursuing specific targets amidst volleys, explosions and large spaceships. All topped off with a perk system that allows you to upgrade your vehicles and the peculiar possibility of choosing, instead of a classic space fighter, a Strike Suit Zero, a powerful vessel which, in full Macross style, is capable of rapidly transforming itself into a anthropomorphic mech. This is the formula, exclusively single player, which has arrived from the PC to the new generation consoles even if, thanks to a Director's Cut re-edition, also arriving on PC, there are some new features including a restructuring of the first three missions of the campaign and five wide-ranging scenarios dedicated to the Colonial War. We return to space with the new edition, also for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, of Strike Suit Zero The balancing dilemma The five additional scenarios don't offer particularly different situations compared to those of the campaign already present in the original PC version, but they enjoy greater care and are more engaging, effectively adding something to the experience. The first three missions of the campaign, on the other hand, have been reformulated to act as a tutorial but there are practically no changes on the plot side and this remains an obvious weakness for a title entirely focused on the single player. Furthermore, the news does not even include the much-needed balance of an experience characterized by sudden and difficult to understand changes in difficulty, inappropriately fueled by poorly positioned automatic saves. In some ways, let it be clear, the high mortality is the factor that keeps an otherwise rather short and skinny experience alive but it is a real pity that the difficulty does not correspond to a gameplay capable of enhancing the player's skill. And to say that the controls respond well and the physical model is Newtonian and therefore allows you to exploit inertia to give an extra gear to sudden braking, transformations and accelerations. But the weight of physics on the vehicle is low and the sensation is that, unpleasant, of piloting toys. Furthermore, the game situations hardly allow us to exploit the imperfect but still valid control system. Brakes and boosters allow us to displace the specific enemy who is in the queue but in the midst of chaotic battles we are still targeted, thanks to the low intelligence of the allies, by almost every opponent present on the map and, also due to shots that are difficult to avoid , it is difficult to carry out sensible evasive maneuvers. It is therefore not surprising that in dogfight situations homing missiles are to be preferred, to be used as soon as possible to thin out the opponents perhaps in combination with the transformation into a mech which, after spending a few points in talents, becomes decidedly more powerful than the hunting, at least in terms of firepower, and ends up being, as soon as the relative energy bar is filled, an almost obligatory choice. Xbox One goals Most of the thousand points linked to the objectives can be obtained easily by completing the campaign and the new missions which alone give 100 points. But there are a couple of secrets and some skill challenges, such as victory in less than seven minutes in the final mission, which, although they can also be completed in easy mode, require a bit of application. This, however, is always rewarded with very high amounts of points for almost every goal achieved. Missed opportunity? Despite the doubts, Strike Suit Zero is still a rich title in relation to the modest nature of the production. The vehicles can be customized and the perks, obtainable by pursuing the secondary objectives of the missions, significantly modify the gameplay. But in the face of a new edition the defects, many of which are unchanged, acquire a far greater weight than they had in the original version. The result, however, is not to be despised, not even from a technical point of view. There are some uncertainties around the frame rate but they don't appear to be actual stutter due to performance flaws so much as image latency issues which should be easily correctable. For the rest they are offered to useffective lighting, weapons capable of spewing tons of shots and convincing explosions enliven a space populated by means of vaguely Japanese inspiration, not particularly complex or detailed but nevertheless rendered pleasant by the numerous lights and the voluminous trails of light produced by the thrusters. The result is pleasant and even if looking at the single graphic effect the typical defects of a modest production emerge, the glance can become almost spectacular in the midst of the biggest battles. Furthermore, to this we must add the soundtrack, already valid from the start, and the welcome replacement of some voice actors, with an all too amateurish performance, which however fails to distract from the lack of inspiration of the interlude scenes, too limited, both technically and structurally, to be able to get involved. If we add to this the general sense of impotence in the middle of the action and the lack of multiplayer what we are left with is a strong title of a formula that is not abused and pleasant to watch but which cannot shake off the shadow of the occasion missed.", "date": "2014-04-05", "grade": "7.0"}
