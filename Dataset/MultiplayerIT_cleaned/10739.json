{"name": "Un piacevole ritorno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/secret-files-2-puritas-cordis-recensione.html", "text": "With Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis, Fusionsphere Systems fills the void left by Broken Sword, and takes a rightful place in the planetary meeting room of all graphic adventure developers - a room which, of course, does not exist; the game must have gotten the hang of it, a good sign. Before praising or criticizing, let's do a quick summary anyway: Max Gruber is Nina Kalenkov's boyfriend, even if in the second chapter we discover that the two have separated, and with her he lived the Siberian adventure of Secret Files: Tunguska. The two of them are the main protagonists, but ready to support them they will find another couple of reckless: Sam, the archaeologist or anthropologist - we couldn't figure it out - and the vicar David Korell. Their actions will intertwine during the adventure, where the threat is represented by the sect known as Puritas Cordis, which refers to the apocalyptic prophecies of a certain Zandona. In short, the world, despite the attempts of the G12, is about to be annihilated by the forces of nature, and there may be something suspicious underneath. We don't tell you how it will end, but along the way someone will risk ending up in the funeral home of characters who died in the course of playing a video game. Amarcord, but also not Let's get to the point. Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis, as well as its predecessor, takes place on the basis of a script that is detailed and cared for in every step. Everything happens sensibly and without holes in the narrative. However, the omnipresent light-hearted tone does not allow real tension to be created, and it is therefore in humor and in the taste for adventure that we must seek the pleasure of playing it. A small note out of place concerns the two shoulders of the protagonists, who are much less outlined than Nina and Max, especially in their past, so that they appear and disappear and are soon forgotten. Beyond this, the story is exciting and well documented, with many animated sequences of sure impact. The story of the Apocalypse with a lot of sect in tow can however discourage those who are looking for new ideas; but then it's all about seeing how an already used idea is treated, and in this case Fusionsphere Systems has done a decent job. Instead, let's talk about the puzzles: almost all the puzzles in the game are based on the interaction between objects in the inventory or between them and the hotspots on the screen. Fortunately, the mouse-shaped pointer tells us which areas we can interact with with other objects, saving us an infinite series of tests, and above all leaving us an empirical way to try something in case we get stuck without remedy. In fact, the puzzles grow gradually, but in some cases they become decidedly difficult. One wonders why if the puzzles are logical and the game comes towards us to avoid a frantic click, Secret Files 2 is so difficult at times, keeping us busy between 15 and 20 hours. The answer is simple: the puzzles are indeed based on common sense, but brought to a level where an exaggerated faith in objects is necessary. You will have to believe that Nina, with simple materials, succeeds where not even specialized engineers would have succeeded. This leads to situations that, although they follow reasoning, end up bordering on the absurd. In any case, Secret Files 2 does an excellent job of distributing the puzzles, even teasing itself about the idiosyncrasies of graphic adventures, such as the fact that it takes fifty objects to light a fire, and on the other hand, if you're at all narrow, there's a park aid system to get you back on track. Beyond this, the global evaluation has benefited from the only real innovation for the series, which concerns the collaboration between two characters at a time. Indeed, in certain sequences of the game, we will be able to switch from Nina to Max for example, making them collaborate to both get out of the mess they've gotten themselves into. It is a nice idea that would indeed have deserved more space and some additional mechanics, but which we welcome nonetheless. If nothing else, it limits the sense of dj vu caused by point-and-click. The Wii version In its Wii incarnation, Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis obviously differs only in terms of visual impact and control system. The first aspect is not particularly exciting, especially thanks to the proverbial low resolution of the Wii which makes the backdrops poorly defined and which degrades the CG sequences and the polygonal models of the characters. The control via Remote, unchanged compared to the prequel, instead confirms its validity, proving to be sufficiently precise and easy to assimilate, even if the inventory management has remained a bit too machinosa. What is certain is that, in the long run, continuously moving your arm is much more tiring than moving a mouse. A parade of landscapes We were impressed to see how much the visuals of the game have improved since the latest previews: the locations are numerous and varied, ranging from abandoned beaches in France to a view of the Eiffel Tower, not to mention the Indonesian jungle or the boat from cruise. The color change becomes evident whenever the game detaches from one character to follow another, so that you never get bored of the places visited. However, it is the animated elements, such as the sky, the sea or the waterways that give life to the screens, on which the three-dimensional characters move, well modeled but rigid in the animations, which at least are present in large numbers. Also noteworthy is the excellent Italian adaptation of the texts, of which only one error catches the eye, which in any case does not affect the gaming experience. Too bad only for the soundtrack, so evocative that we want to hear it more often and accompanied by other melodies, while instead it is absent for almost the entire game. Fortunately, the sound effects and the voices of the protagonists are more than fair. Ultimately, it is the attention to detail, the jokes that wink at the player and the love placed in packaging the title that make Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis a great adventure, mature and with solid shoulders. The courage to dare some new mechanics would undoubtedly have earned him first place on the podium, but there will be time, we hope, for a third chapter.
