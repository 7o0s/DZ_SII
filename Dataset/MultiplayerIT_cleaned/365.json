Take something mysterious or little known, especially if controversial, embroider a more or less articulated conspiracy around it and you will have obtained a story that will surely catch on. This is the system with which many plots have been created in recent years, and it is also the same one that one of the most famous writers of recent years uses (I won't tell you who he is, but you can easily guess). The Tunguska event (also known as ~the great Siberian explosion~) is a full part of this set of events still without a definitive explanation that have been racking the minds of scientists and conspiracy theorists from half the planet for almost a century. On June 30, 1908, at 7:17 in the morning, a terrifying explosion occurred near the Podkamennaya Tunguska, a river in central Siberia. The energy of the explosion was later estimated at between 10 and 15 megatons, 2000 times more powerful than the Hiroshima atomic bomb and comparable to the most powerful ever detonated by the United States. It was so powerful that it was identified by all seismic stations throughout Eurasia, and some American observers noted a reduction in the transparency of the atmosphere which lasted for several months. As Nina, the young protagonist, would say: a big ka-boom (a idea rather fixed and rooted in our heroine, who seems to have the hobby of leaving behind a long trail of destruction...). <i>A huge ka-boom</i> This girl definitely has some issues (edited to avoid spoilers)... Where does the mystery come from? When, almost twenty years later, the first scientific expedition arrived on site, it was faced with a devastating spectacle: within a radius of 50 km all the trees had been crushed by an impressive force, some in the central area (the so-called ~ground zero~) were still upright, but stripped of branches and bark, which appeared to have been stripped away. Subsequent aerial reconnaissance showed that the event had downed trees in an area shaped like a giant butterfly. Despite the impressive devastation, there was no sign of any crater. We spare you all the subsequent technical analyses, which revealed the presence of minerals (nickel and iridium) present in large quantities in the meteorites, thus indicating an extraterrestrial origin of the event. The most accredited hypothesis is that of the air explosion of a meteorite (demonstrated through different models) which would have overheated to the point of exploding, leaving no noteworthy trace of itself and discharging all its energy in one fell swoop in the form of a shock wave and heat. Ok, science class over, now let's move on to the fun part. In fact, in addition to the hypothesis of a meteorite airburst, there are dozens of other theories. For example, some include: the collision with a nano black hole (a black hole the size of a few nanometers), the one with a block of antimatter, the thermonuclear reaction of a comet with a high concentration of deuterium, an electromagnetic storm and, obviously , the inevitable UFO. Try to guess which of these hypotheses the plot of the game revolves around... Intriguing, but not convincing Here it all begins, from this gigantic explosion that shook half the planet a century ago. Then, after a pleasant Harry Potter-style introduction, with the titles waving in and out in green liquid, the real story begins. Together with the protagonist, Nina Kalenkov, Russian by origin, but who has lived almost all her life in Germany, we go to see her father at the museum where he works, and we find the office completely ransacked, turned upside down, and no trace of he. Intriguing, but not convincing From here begins the long journey in search of her missing father, which will take the protagonist and a colleague of her father, Max, around three quarters of the planet. In these travels, Nina (and in a couple of cases also Max) will have to piece together her father's past and the expeditions in which he took part to discover the mystery of Tunguska, a mystery that some want to keep secret, however, and others exploit to their advantage. The basic idea in itself is good, not particularly innovative, but intriguing, above all thanks to the continuous specter of the Tunguska explosion that pushes the player to want to go on to find out more. The development of the plot, on the contrary, is shaky and in some points inconsistent, so much so that in the end, summing up the conspiracy in which we have been involved, it is natural to ask why the ~bad guys~ (if we want to label them that way) acted in a certain way and not in another way that would have caused them much less problems and risks. With thehindsight, in fact, the entire second quarter of the story, the part set in Russia, is completely useless, not to mention conflicting with their objectives (unfortunately I can't go into more detail so as not to spoil the story, so you have to believe me on the word...). the development of the plot, on the contrary, is shaky and, in hindsight, in some situations not well motivated. Intriguing, but not convincing Furthermore, there are far too many forcings, the classic situations, the death of any self-respecting story, in which the right event takes place in the right place and at the right time to complicate our lives or resolve the situation. Look, there are at least six, when one would already be too much. In the same way as the plot, the game economy does not satisfy: the balance between actual gameplay and dialogues or animated sequences is strongly unbalanced. The meddling of the dialogues is absolutely excessive, almost 80% of all game time, and the player spends more time staring at the screen than acting, which is exactly what he would like to do. To give you an estimate, by cutting everything that can be cut you are finished in less than two hours. Apart from the eyestrain and mental exhaustion that reading such a mass of English subtitles causes (the version we tested is the English one, but an Italian localization should be available), you still get stuck 10, 12, 15 consecutive minutes between one chapter and another to receive the whole package of information discovered, put up with the dialogue between the characters and/or the reflections that they generate and the subsequent beginning of the following story, composed most of the time of another film and a subsequent dialogue becomes exhausting after a couple of times even if you limit yourself to listening to everything in your own language. The immortal point and click When, a few years ago, some software houses believed that the era of point and click was over, they made the biggest mistake in their history and paid dearly for it. I just think of poor Monkey Island, devastated by the gameplay of the fourth episode and which never had a further sequel. Secret Files: Tunguska, on the other hand, wisely stays traditional, simplifying the game interface, perhaps even excessively. The pointer offers only two possibilities: observe and act (which also includes speaking). When you pass over any hot spot, it changes shape, assuming that of a mouse whose keys are colored green according to the actions that can be performed: action with the left, accompanied by the icon of a small hand; observe, put away objects and skip dialogues and cutscenes with the right hand. Unfortunately, the pointer only shows what is actually possible to do, therefore, if we suspect that we need to use an object, we just need to select it and scroll quickly on the inventory and on the hot spots of the area: if the action hand appears we will be able to do something , or nothing. This incredibly speeds up the game, resurrecting and also giving enormous strength to the old ~try everything with everything~ trick that was used in the past when you just didn't know which way to turn. With such a rapid system, more often than not, it's easier to go by trial and error rather than use your head. Secret Files: Tunguska wisely stays traditional, simplifying the game interface, perhaps even excessively The immortal point and click If at least the puzzles were linearly logical, one could also pass over them, but this is not the case. It is almost always possible to carry out actions without knowing why, anticipating the triggering event that tells us what to do. And it's a real shame, because it would have been enough to activate some particular hot spots or unlock the opportunity to make certain moves once a certain trigger is activated and insert some reflections from the protagonists to make everything more linear, logical and, consequently, satisfying. Combining these two aspects, it is more than natural, after a while, to go almost exclusively by trial and error. One of the rare puzzle games present. It resolves itself in a couple of minutes. From this picture we should understand what to do... by infused science... An example of using the hot spot detector. The immortal point and click Unfortunately, the same also happens for the dialogues, in fact the characters almost never hesitate to provide Nina with all the information, even secret, that she may need. Ok, she's a nice girl, but seeing characters who quite naturally spill confidential information to the first comer is absurd, especially if this happens in Russia, and the information concerns the army and the secret services. Instead, it is very interestingyou the help system, which can be disabled in any case, which allows you to highlight all the hot spots available in the area, avoiding the ~pixel hunt~ which on at least a couple of occasions, thanks to the darkness, becomes a bit annoying. As in all adventure games of recent years, there are also some puzzle games, but their number is limited and closely linked to the places where their presence makes sense, usually locks with a combination or password. They are all extremely easy and quick to execute, but those who have problems can always find help in the diary page dedicated to suggestions where they will be able to find some useful additional advice. The only one that escapes this rule is the last one, for which the player does not receive any real clues, but must necessarily make use of a trick that is external to the normal game (here too, you will understand when you get there). Post-it with legs Secret Files: Tunguska combines, as is now customary, 3D characters and pre-rendered two-dimensional backdrops, some of which are really well done, evocative and very rich in detail. Post-it with legs Too bad the mix doesn't work as you would expect. The interaction between 2D and 3D is minimal, and boils down to 3-4 safes opening, an elevator and a few doors. The rest is completely damned static and, in some cases, the characters, especially the supporting actors, seem stuck on the backdrops like post-it notes. When Nina or Max have to pick up an object, they simply extend their hand (or bend over, or stretch, depending on the situation) and it simply disappears while, if they have to put it down, it magically reappears. Not to mention the Guybrush Threepwood-style pockets in which they stuff two-metre boards, fishing rods, one-square-metre metal plates, boulders and lit torches as if nothing had happened. If you decide to mix styles it is good to know how to do it properly, otherwise it is better to stay on 2D. the interaction between 2D and 3D is minimal, and is reduced to 3-4 safes that open, an elevator and a few doors. The rest is completely damned static and, in some cases, the characters, especially the supporting actors, seem stuck on the backdrops like post-its Post-it with legs The films are pleasant, but, apart from the introductory one, all extremely short (only one exceeds a minute), and above all the concluding ones are very little compared to what one would like to be able to enjoy at the end of a game. The music does not stand out in a particular way, except during the movies, where they merely highlight the tension of the moment. The dubbing, however little indicative being in English, disappoints. It seems to have been made one sentence at a time, in a disorderly way and with different instruments: within the same dialogue the volume of the voice changes or an annoying echo effect takes over. The English translation itself is not up to par and is distinguished by some grammatical errors, such as the failure to invert the subject-verb in some interrogative sentences. Let's hope that the Italian localization doesn't have the same flaws. Final comment Secret Files: Tunguska is a good idea, but it would have needed more in-depth analysis of the plot, less long and intrusive dialogues and more careful management of event triggers. And it's a shame, because the potential is all there. The game itself isn't bad, but it's frustrating to find yourself without even realizing it wondering what you're doing and why, or to stand helpless for fifteen minutes to watch consecutive dialogues. The film-style setting is appreciable, but the realization certainly had to be better. As often happens, this is a title that depends a lot on the expectations of the players. It's cute and it's practically impossible to get stuck for more than half an hour, great for those looking for a temporary break, but don't have the time or way to keep their head focused on the actions they need to perform. If, on the other hand, you want another Syberia, or a Runaway, and you're not really suffering from withdrawal symptoms, well, the review already speaks for itself... Pros Good basic idea Suggestive backdrops rich in details Convenient hot spot detector (can be deactivated ) Cons Plot not entirely convincing Interludes too long and heavy Almost total lack of logical triggers for actions Lack of interaction between characters and backdrops Needless to say, lately Siberia is getting more and more crowded. It seems to be trendy...", "date": "2006-09-21", "grade": null}
