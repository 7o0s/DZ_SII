{"name": "Breath of Fire V: Dragon Quarter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/breath-of-fire-v-dragon-quarter-2.html", "text": "Last of all he will be able to see the sun.. The beginning of Dragon Quarter, even for non-fans of the series, will be quite traumatic. As it is easy to imagine, the protagonist Ryu also in this case will possess the powers of the dragon, but there is a small change: every time this power is used, a counter will begin to rise, and if it reaches 100 the game is over. . For this you need a certain parsimony in using it, and during the exploration it will not be easy. Indeed, the capcom title is structured like a dungeon crawling, with many small areas full of enemies to defeat, which fortunately we will be able to see on the screen. Once the combat begins, we will be faced with a game system that can be defined as a cross between Vagrant Story (because each character has its own range) and any strategy ala Final Fantasy Tactics, since the characters move according to a certain criterion and with the use of ability points. As usual, the special attacks are the ones that take away the most points, but fortunately the player is able to equip those that are more useful to the situation, and given the very meager presence of shops and money, don't waste too many resources during the fight proves to be fundamental, moreover not only to finish the game. This is where one of the most innovative features of the new breath of fire chapter comes into play, namely the ability to replay the same game with previously acquired skills. This possibility is given even without having to finish the game, from the first save. In fact, every time you start again, new cut-scenes, new items, or new skills may already be unlocked, this depending on your D-ratio, which will improve with every well-done game. This aspect certainly plays in favor of longevity, which would otherwise be limited by the time necessary to complete the game, the duration of which does not exceed twenty hours, but which does not allow all secrets to be revealed until after having finished the game at least a couple of times. title. ...And not mere reflections of him in the water The austerity of the plot is also readily reflected in the technical realization, which affects the overall evaluation more than it might appear at first sight. There is in general a deep feeling of claustrophobia, with underground or in any case indoors settings, specially recreated with few colors and sparse textures but which render an effect of desolation, of a world that seems to be in constant decay, also given the scarcity of inhabited places . It seems to be like this in a huge dungeon, only occasionally interspersed with save points or natural locations such as caves. A truly remarkable change, considering that the previous episodes were mainly conceived outdoors. The character design in cel shading is certainly particular, which although it is less ~kawaii~ than past episodes, partially mitigates the atmosphere of a story with adult tones and strong contrasts. Added to this is that the characters are quite stylized, as are the polygonal models of the enemies, but still retain a good level of detail. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is not very incisive, which despite boasting an exceptional guest star like Mitsuda, has very little memorable and is limited to accompanying the action without annoying or exalting too much. Comment With the fifth chapter, Capcom also seems to want to enter that modern role-playing game, with serious features and sophisticated and dark settings, contemplating only, more for the usual desire for self-quotation than anything else, memories of a remote past with character design and some gameplay aspects. In reality Breath Of Fire preserves the internal microstructure of all its predecessors, composed of a thin but well-told plot, and a deeper gameplay than it may appear at first glance, simply renewing it to today's standards that want strong contrasts and an o however an iconography in the foreground. In this sense, the rigid structure focused on replayability, but also, partly involuntarily, the atmosphere and the various locations, can be defined as among the best seen on the Sony console, and at the same time not indifferent limits that will hold back its consensus even among the most passionate of the genre. Final note for the Pal version, in Italian and with the very welcome presence of the 60 HZ selector. Pros: Original atmosphere Excellent long-lived battle system Cons: Long-lived yes, but also repetitive Technically not exciting Not for everyone In the early 90s, Capcom was at the peak of popularity thanks toie to a fighting game that had revolutionized the genre: Street Fighter. Strengthened by this broad consensus also at home, the Japanese software decided to create a series of rpg along the lines of the famous sagas of enix and squaresoft, or Breath of fire. The name was quite epic and referred to the fantasy tradition, but the first chapter of the new RPG proved to be a disappointment from several points of view, a bland imitation of the Japanese masterpieces of the genre. However, Capcom did not give up, and promptly created a sequel, which proved to be much superior to the first chapter, although it failed to reach the heights of the greatest of that period. The saga continued in the following years on Psx with mixed results, but always maintaining a non-serious attitude, and thus representing a hilarious alternative to the increasingly profound epics of the other publishers. All this until breath of fire finally landed on Playstation 2, apparently distorting its appearance and entering the new millennium. Will it really be like this or is it all appearance?", "date": "2004-01-15", "grade": null}
