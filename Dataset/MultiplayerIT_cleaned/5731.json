Niche titles, in short, which however have tickled the imagination of many players; over the years the saga then evolved, and especially with the fourth episode - the first on Nintendo 3DS - the progress made towards less hardcore enthusiasts was evident without however ever losing sight of its original nature. It is the same philosophy that underlies the Untolds, remakes of the first iterations: a few months ago The Millennium Girl, a remake of the very first Etrian Odyssey, was released in Europe, and now it is the turn of the second one, Heroes of Lagaard which takes on the name of The Fafnir Knight. In addition to the various feats that the guys from Atlus have included in this operation, which we will see shortly, before leaving there is an important detail to remember: Heroes of Lagaard, unlike the first episode, never landed in Europe via official, and The Fafnir Knight therefore has among its merits also that of filling this gap. Here comes Etrian Odyssey Untold 2: The Fafnir Knight, a new great remake in the excellent saga of Atlus! A story never told The main novelty of the Untold is the introduction of a Story Mode next to the Classic. The Midgard Library returns, the main conglomerate of knowledge in the world of Etria, which sends its explorers and scholars to collect all the most useful and interesting news and finds from around the world. The anonymous protagonist, the only mute character of the whole cast, has the task together with his childhood friend and talented archer Flavio to explore the Yggdrasil Labyrinth of the city of High Lagaard, and at the same time to escort the young Ariadne, princess of Caledonia , in the ruins of the Ginnungagap temple (!) where the poor girl has to perform, as a duty of birth, an ancient ritual. Soon two other characters join the three, the sorceress Chloe and her squire Bertrand, intending to explore the Labyrinth for initially mysterious reasons: the story that starts from here will not win any prizes for originality, but it is still pleasant and above all, more than the plot itself, some characters are interesting (Chloe and Bertrand above all) and the way we are given to gradually get to know them, taking advantage of certain occasions such as a meal or meeting all together at the inn before sleeping. In this way a remarkable sense of immersion is created and one feels somehow connected to the not unheard-of events of the characters, to whom one becomes pleasantly attached. If in the Story Mode the plot is a very welcome addition which however does not change the substance, its two other characteristics are more incisive, namely the new and exclusive ~parallel~ dungeon of Ginnungagap, and the fact that the five protagonists have predetermined classes (among other non-existent in the Classic Mode, in which, however, once the story is finished it is possible to import the heroes) that can be changed, but only at the price of losing five experience levels. This whole operation was clearly designed to present Etrian Odyssey even to a less savvy audience, and if it is perfectly successful from a scenographic point of view, it seems a little less from a gameplay point of view: the party thought up by the programmers is balanced and varied, but precisely for this reason it will develop quite slowly in the first hours of the game; the total freedom guaranteed in the classic mode is certainly less immediate to manage, but with a little effort and good management of the various classes it also allows faster progress. More effective from this point of view are the presence of more save slots and three different difficulty levels that really meet the needs of every type of player, but it is clear that those who want to experience Etrian Odyssey must at least start from the second, only in this way can you savor all the masochistic sensation of challenge of this saga. Saga that, we realize, we have not yet addressed in its conceptual pillars, preferring to expose the news first: it's time to tell them to the newbies and give the more experienced the opportunity to review them.The 3D effect In addition to giving the usual boost to immersion, the stereoscopic depth in Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold also remedies a technical defect of the game, which mainly due to not well defined textures tends not to separate the various polygonal elements of the game very well from each other. landscape. With 3D activated this unpleasant sensation disappears: nothing that can make a real difference in terms of gameplay, but definitely useful for the purposes of atmosphere and immersion, strengths of The Fafnir Knight that would have been a real shame to see ruined by a technical realization not always up to par. So many floors of roughness The main purpose of Etrian Odyssey is the complete exploration of a single, huge dungeon which, however, is divided into different levels. As already mentioned, in the Classic Mode the composition of the party is entrusted to the player, who creates his own characters by choosing from the over ten available classes, which range from the more traditional ones to others that are quite sui generis, but all useful for dealing effectively with this or that particular part of the adventure. Your guild can be made up of a total of 25 elements, of which, however, only five can take the field at the same time, arranged in two rows. The former will be more exposed to enemy attacks but conversely will make better use of their offensive potential: it goes without saying that there are classes, such as those equipped with ranged weapons or spells, which should never be moved from the latter, and more warlike classes they give their best only in the first one. All this management work is done in the city, which acts as a hub: here you can accept main and secondary missions, sleep and save at the inn, buy equipment and chat with non-player characters. There is also, among the novelties, a restaurant that will give you the task of finding the ingredients for its dishes, which can guarantee the party bonuses and special upgrades valid for an entire exploration; once you reach a certain point of this peculiar secondary mission, you have access to a real management minigame in which you can devote yourself to developing the areas of High Lagaard, fun in itself but above all useful for obtaining additional resources to make the party always more fierce. Resources that you will really need because, you will have understood, the game is difficult: the clashes, except for the first level of difficulty, are challenging right from the start, but let's go in order. The dungeon is divided into boxes, between which you move in a first-person view a-la Wizardry. Essential feature is the drawing of the map, through a complete editor on the lower screen; there is also an automap function, but it takes away a good part of the attraction and engagement. The fights are apparently random, in reality managed according to a precise routine complete with an indicator that approaches red when you are about to encounter an enemy. And then there are the FOEs, very dangerous bosses to avoid at first; fortunately they are marked on the map and you can go around them and even trap them, but the satisfaction you feel once you are able to beat them is priceless. An interesting feature of the battle are the Force Skills, which for three rounds give the fighter special powers and the possibility of exploiting the Force Breaks, devastating attacks or spells which however make it necessary to return to the city if you want to use them again. Enemies release materials, which can also be collected in special areas, to be resold to make money and have access to new equipment, whose updating is absolutely necessary; however, since money is scarce, you have to resort to grinding, which is always an essential part of the dungeon crawler experience. Finally, at each level gained, you can spend a point in the skill tree: it's up to you to decide whether to focus on developing a few skills or have a more varied hero, but the Grimoire Stones come to meet this, which can both add skills, and to strengthen those already present. This is the extreme synthesis of a very deep, demanding and surprisingly addictive concept, albeit with all the sweetening of the case. Sweetening that we also see in the presentation. Not so much for the technical side in and of itself: The Fafnir Knight takes advantage of the superior capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS but the result is not that spectacular, especially the textures are dirty and sometimes confused (in this regard stereoscopy helps a lot , as you read in the appropriate box), although the view is very wide and certain effects are able to create the right atmosphere. What leaves you pleasantly surprised is the aesthetics, with drawings in an excellent anime style, an introductionand really well done animated and sung, well written dialogue and, when dubbed, very well acted; above all, however, the music, by maestro Yuzo Koshiro, is enchanting in quality and variety, and proposed both in the original version and in a delightful orchestrated edition. All of this goodness is only available in English, which unfortunately for some will constitute a much more formidable barrier to entry than the considerable difficulty.", "date": "2016-02-03", "grade": "9.0"}
