{"name": "Samurai Shodown", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/samurai-shodown.html", "text": "Samurai Shodown was the first 2D fighting game to feature encounters where the characters were equipped with edged weapons. Set in feudal Japan, the game was made in 1993 by SNK and was incredibly successful both in theaters and in the form of the cartridge, the best-selling ever for the Neo Geo console. Inspired by the titles made previously, the developers have introduced a series of spectacular elements to make the game action as frenetic as it is full of depth: constant zooms, super moves and even a sort of ~fatality~, through which you could finish a defeated opponent. Samurai Shodown has given birth to six sequels and an unknown number of imitations, providing the starting point for the birth of series such as Soul Calibur after the introduction of polygonal graphics. This mobile reduction offers us two game modes: the story and the survival. In the first case we will have to select one of the four characters available among Haohmaru, Gen-An, Charlotte and Nakoruru, and then face the others in sequence until the clash with one of their evil clones. The survival mode, on the other hand, is nothing more than an endurance race: equipped with a single energy bar, we will have to be able to defeat the largest number of consecutive enemies. Already the presence of only four samurai and, consequently, of only four locations makes it clear what the tone of this transposition is: despite the enormous progress made by mobile gaming, the developers who have taken care of bringing an important title like Samurai Shodown on mobile they thought it appropriate to make heavy cuts in the original structure, probably to make the product usable on all terminals with support for Java applications. Available offensive maneuvers have been drastically reduced, making characters only able to attack in a couple of different ways, possibly resorting to special moves that are rather difficult to execute. There is still the possibility of disarming the opponent if the latter parries too many blows, but it is very little compared to what has been lost along the way. And speaking of things ~lost along the way~, we can mention the animations. The original version of the game had an exceptional quality and quantity of animations, which in this conversion have been reduced to the bare bones or even less. Although the sprites are basically those, with due proportions, the frames that make up their animations can be counted on the fingers of one hand. And if it is not pleasant to look at, it is even less to play: such jerky and unconvincing movements make it difficult to manage the fights. To this we must add that the version of the game with QVGA resolution, absurdly, turns out to be the least well-finished one, with sprites that are too small and a ~cropped~ view above and below. The scenarios are discreetly made, with a good use of colors and some animated elements, while the music refers to the original version and is therefore pleasant to listen to. Finally, the control system is afflicted by a slow response to inputs, far from instantaneous, which together with the layout of the keys makes the gaming experience frustrating and far from fun. PRO Well done scenarios Beautiful musics The sprites are the original ones... AGAINST ...the animations definitely not Slow response to commands Simplistic and frustrating", "date": "2008-04-23", "grade": "S.V."}
