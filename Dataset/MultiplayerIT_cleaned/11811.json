Just like the war to which the series has always referred, the multiplayer incarnation of Bethesda's post-apocalyptic RPG has also changed, it has shed its skin, it has sought its place in the world up to that Wastelanders which brought almost all. Todd Howard and his companions have not stopped however and, cyclically, return to stuff their creature with new adjustments and new contents, as it was with the expansion Steel Dawn, which arrived last November and which reintroduced a of the most iconic factions in the world of Fallout: the Brotherhood of Steel. Several months later comes the conclusion of that same narrative arc, with five new missions dedicated to the militarized group and the fate of Appalachia, far from decided. In this review of Fallout 76: Steel Reign we try to understand how much this new content - free as always - has left its mark. History and epilogue of the Brotherhood Knight of the Brotherhood Daniel Shin in armour Anyone who has already played through the last expansion knows more or less what to expect. The diatribe within the Brotherhood is reaching unexpected peaks and the tension is palpable. As per tradition, it will be up to us to decide in which direction to tip the bar, giving the faction a future shaped by our choices and the relationships we will establish. When we reviewed Steel Dawn we focused on the thickness that Bethesda had managed to donate to the Brotherhood. Although not very long, the first part of the plot dedicated to it had more than convinced us, net of a few trimmings. same cap we would say. Reign of Steel does not last long, a handful of hours that run away like nothing and even if the narration and dialogues remain on the good levels that Fallout 76 has given us in this last year and a half, they fail to hit the mark as they would like. Making an important decision, which should put the player against the wall, instead goes smoothly without too many hitches, among other things, in our opinion, even in a fairly obvious way given the characters. A Stars and Stripes armor in Reign of Steel It is therefore a pity that the conclusion of an excellent arc that began months ago is unable to remain so even in its final bars. However, this must in no way exclude the goodness of the experience. On the other hand, we have been praising a title mistreated by the masses for years, often even just by hearsay, when then the hard core of enthusiasts continues to grind hundreds of hours and also convince a good number of novices to get lost in Appalachia. Speaking of the map: we are faced with one of the best design expressions of Bethesda Game Studios. Appalachia has always been huge, beautiful, and damned varied. With Reign of Steel it is enriched with another handful of points of interest, waiting to find out how the future of the game will evolve once The Pitt raids arrive soon. C.A.M.P. and seasonal rewards The Brotherhood symbol painted on Power Armor in Kingdom of Steel Reign of steel does not mean only Brotherhood, and for the occasion Bethesda has retraced its steps to add a few more details to this expansion. In addition to a whole series of small tweaks to the system, such as the ability to carry more caps and gold bars with you, it was thought well to increase the limit of C.A.M.P. personnel and endowments, bringing them respectively to five and fifteen. This increase was anticipated from their initial inclusion, but it's nice to see that we're finally there. Both elements will still have to be purchased with Atoms, the real currency of the Fallout 76 world. Of course, a new season is also coming with its own specific board, to the delight of all lovers of rewards based on how much you grind in the game. Also in this case Bethesda has changed something compared to the past. In fact, now the levels are potentially infinite and, even once the hundred levels of the board have been completed, it will be possible to continue to acquire talent cards, resources and even Atoms. There is also a new merchant in the city: it is Minerva, to whom you can give Pawn your gold bars to take home items that rotate constantly. Legendary creation Fallout 76: Steel Reign: The difficult need to take sides But what really matters in the Fallout 76 ecosystem is the legendary creation. It is a system designed to transform normal objects into legendary ones, thus being able to assign specific perks and increase or decrease themire the equipment stars. The new component inserted for the occasion is the legendary core, which can also be obtained through events and daily missions. Once in possession of the right resources, you can go to the first available workbench and apply all the desired changes to your objects so as to make them unique. This system has also been implemented for what concerns the atomic armor. It will be possible to increase or decrease the rank of each of the pieces that compose it, as well as the respective legendary perks. We won't hide from you that we've felt a fair amount of satisfaction with our upgrades, although perhaps we would have liked to see more variety in the choices.", "date": "2021-08-15", "grade": "7.5"}
