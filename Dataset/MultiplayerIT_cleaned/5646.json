PlayRaven has therefore seen fit to create an experience in which the action takes place within the confines of the display, which is displayed in portrait mode, trying to simplify the gameplay as much as possible to offer mobile device owners a game capable of combining immediacy, simplicity and fun. Set on nine different planets, Robocide will see us manage a robotic swarm with the aim of destroying enemy positions, while defending our base from attacks by hostile troops. The first missions clearly act as a tutorial, proposing mechanisms so basic as to appear trivial: by touching the screen we indicate to the units to move in that direction, automatically attacking any enemy. It is precisely a skimpy gameplay, which fortunately is greatly enriched by the introduction of mechs: there are several, all to be unlocked and upgraded through the addition of components and special abilities, and when we launch them in the scenario they will move by themselves , but we will at least be able to direct its extra attack maneuvers. The progression system focuses on obtaining new robots and upgrades, both through the completion of the levels that make up the single player campaign, and by engaging in a demanding ~reward~ survival mode and with asynchronous multiplayer challenges. Robocide is a very simple RTS, lacking the depth of other titles of the genre but capable of entertaining Robocide There are aspects of Robocide that leave us a little perplexed, and which concern in particular the essentiality of the approach chosen for the occasion by PlayRaven. It is in fact possible to assign a single command to the entire swarm, which means that we will not be able to manage the troops separately, perhaps to defend two sides that are being attacked, and this will often lead to artificially dilating the times of a mission due to the need to proceed very gradually towards the goal, without ever revealing oneself. As mentioned, the mechs add a lot of depth to the experience, but even here their complete autonomy represents a limit, and sometimes it will happen to see them explode simply because we could not order them to take an alternative route or to fall back. Then there are the freemium aspects of the game, represented by the now traditional ~energy of action~, which allows you to play seven missions in a row before waiting for a recharge, and by the possibility of obtaining the components for upgrades faster by purchasing packages with real money. We are talking about factors that prevent Robocide from expressing its full potential and really shine in the panorama of mobile RTS, but which in any case do not undermine its general enjoyment: inventing an effective strategy, even and above all with these constraints, can give great satisfaction , as well as unleashing a mech in the middle of enemy ranks and seeing hostile units explode on impact. Furthermore, the presence of secondary modes increases the variety and duration of the game, which does its best in terms of technical realization, albeit penalized by the small size of the interface.", "date": "2016-03-19", "grade": "7.0"}
