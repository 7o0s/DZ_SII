{"name": "Double Dragon II: The Revenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/double-dragon-ii-the-revenge.html", "text": "Made in 1987 by Technos, building on the experience made with Renegade (much less known), Double Dragon is a title of great importance, a classic that laid the foundations for the ~scrolling fighting game~ genre. Equipped with a ~violent~ urban setting, which gave a nod to films such as Mad Max and The Warriors, the game showed off a picturesque and fascinating character design, especially as regards the large number of enemies to fight. All this was seasoned with a series of attack maneuvers (including a still immature version of the holds) and with sound effects that managed to perfectly convey the impact sensation of the blows. Double Dragon II: The Revenge, released the following year, did nothing but ride the wave of success of the first episode, presenting an identical setting and almost no innovations except a decidedly more crude and sad plot: in the first bars, in fact , Marian is killed with machine gun shots and the Lee brothers embark on a punitive expedition that has little to do with peace or hope. For this reduction of the game, the developers of the Qubic team had to inevitably cut the cooperative multiplayer mode, concentrating their efforts on the creation of the numerous original sprites as well as the locations that we will explore in an attempt to vanquish the criminal gangs. Although it is not the first scrolling fighting game available for mobile phones, Double Dragon II: The Revenge offers a control system that is in some ways innovative (thanks to the customization possibilities), in others decidedly limited. It is not clear why, in fact, the attack buttons should be two and depend on the context: one for the ~front~ shot, another for the ~rear~ one, with no possibility of modifications unless you want to use the FIRE button. This means that we will have to act on a different key depending on the position of the character: not exactly a comfortable and immediate solution, which will often end up causing us problems. The joystick is responsible for movement, while everything else is located by default in the lower part of the numeric keyboard, with the 8 key for jumping and the * and 0 keys respectively for hitting left and right. At first, the impression is that the holds have been brutally eliminated... whereas they are still there, even if putting them into practice becomes more a matter of luck than anything else. What is most striking (literally) about this conversion, however, is the degree of difficulty: the opponents are very cunning and cunning, they tend to duck when we perform flying kicks and promptly attack as soon as we are within range. Moreover, it is difficult to entrust one's strategy to the depth of the stages, perhaps waiting for the enemy to align with our position while we are already dispensing empty punches. Continuing in the stages gives a certain number of lives, this is true, but it is not possible to continue: if you run into game over, you will have to start all over again, almost a taboo nowadays. Moving on to the technical implementation, unfortunately we are not faced with a perfect conversion, far from it: the sprites are very small and have mediocre animations, while the scenarios don't shine for detail and use of colors. Probably the best thing about the graphics lies in the variety of enemies, definitely above the average for mobile gaming, while the sound sector consists only of a handful of discrete MIDI music but nothing more.
