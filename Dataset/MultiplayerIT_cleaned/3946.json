{"name": "Sid Meier's Civilization 6", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sid-meiers-civilization-6-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "It seems that Aspyr Media wants to convince turn-based strategy players that Civilization 6 is the perfect title to keep in your pocket or backpack: after an excellent launch in 2016, in fact, the latest episode of the series was ported last month to the iPad and iPhone and these days it's also up to Nintendo Switch. An important signal for the category, of course: if Civilization 6 lands on Nintendo Switch immediately after smartphones, what will prevent it from reaching PlayStation 4 and Xbox One soon? Even considering the fact that we are dealing with an almost flawless port, as you are about to read in our review. Are you ready to found your new civilization, and take it to the stars with sacrifices, sweat of the brow, diplomacy and wars? Gameplay and game mechanics Civilization 6 is not a title for everyone and above all it is not an easy title: to be able to explain in detail the subtle balance that holds all the game mechanics together, making them the highest point reached so far within its genre, it would take perhaps ten articles. There is a reason why the latest production by Firaxis Games has carved out a niche for itself in 4x strategic video games, or rather of that very particular type that mixes game turns with real-time progression focusing on the sacred four X: explore, expand, exlpoit and exterminate. Namely: explore, expand, exploit and exterminate, four types of actions that will always, constantly be watched at the same time. The basic concept of Civilization 6 is the same as the previous titles in the series: you start from a tiny city center and lay the foundations for an entire civilization. Naturally it will be up to us players to ensure that it can prosper, strengthen, expand, maintain trade relations with neighboring peoples or declare war on them, shape the rest of the world as we please until we get to dominate it. Sounds like an easy task, but Civilization 6's deep, complex, initially intricate structure will bring you back down to earth right away. We'll tell you more: it will even risk discouraging newbies and leading them to abandon what could be their most satisfying title ever after the first half hour of play. Because with Civilization 6 you have to get acquainted little by little to move from the initial phase of skepticism and dizziness to that of full domination of its potential in the gameplay; this is what the various game tutorials made available by the developers are for, which now also include the one dedicated to the Nintendo Switch version with the new control systems. Returning to the mechanics and objectives of Civilization 6, we illustrate at least the main points without claiming to be exhaustive: the game is marked by a certain number of rounds, in which it will not only be us who make their moves but also the opponents on the game map (i.e. the other civilizations present). The map is selected at the beginning of the game according to the historical period of reference: it will be possible to really choose among the majority of historical periods and more or less known empires of ancient and recent history; our first two games were conducted on the borders between Persia and the Shiite empire leading King Cyrus, and then in Queen Victoria's fierce England, not a small time jump. We start with very few resources available, a city center and a handful of gold and troops, and soon we will already have to make very important decisions because the first rounds of the game are fundamental. During each turn, each of our units can only move a few boxes, thus proceeding with the partial unveiling of the game map (initially similar to an ancient geographical map). Each game is different from the other, and you never know what we will encounter during exploration: we could meet useful natural resources, powerful enemies, new empires with which to form alliances, potentially it will be possible to trace any path in the progression of your empire . But turn after turn we will always have to constantly keep in mind a series of parameters that are easy to overlook: even the new mechanics of the city divided into districts wants your attention, otherwise the population will not grow or will be unhappy. Religion, diplomacy, technology, scientific discoveries, all these parameters are equally (if not more) important than mere military strength: in Civilization 6 you get nowhere by focusing on just one parameter of all those present. Nintendo Switch: the conversion If until a few months ago someone had told us that Civilization 6 would have been taken dweight and transported to Nintendo Switch we probably would have laughed or taken him for crazy. Firaxis's title performs so well on PC, where its genre has always proliferated so far, that playing it elsewhere could almost seem like a sacrilege. But after ten minutes grappling with Ciro's empire on the Nintendo hybrid console, we had already changed our minds: the conversion is almost excellent. Civilization 6 can of course be played in both TV and portable modes, but it is in the latter game mode that it gives its best, and not only because it is currently the only existing way to be able to carry the Fireaxis title with you. as we travel or leave the house, to look after our civilization wherever we wish. It is the implementation of the touch screen control systems that proves to be successful across the board: a quick, light pressure anywhere on the game map and we can select troops, main city, natural resources and enemies, to investigate their various parameters. Do we want to check the two side menus of the title? A swipe on the left to open the bar of technologies, diplomacy, government policies and all other progressive indicators to be upgraded turn after turn; a swipe to the right to instantly call up information relating to our empire and the main rivals and allies of neighboring ones. On the other hand, moving troops on the game map board or issuing attack orders is a little more complicated: a slight selection of the troops and then dragging them towards the enemy box does not always prove to be reliable, as if the movement of the finger was not always recognized correctly by the Nintendo Switch. However, the possibility of exerting pressure on any point or indicator on the screen to quickly recall the explanatory caption is very useful: especially for newcomers, each turn will prove to be a mix of ~touch here, then touch there~ to discover and study all the possible before making your move. After all, this is exactly how Civilization 6 should be played, even by veterans: the games can last several hours before ending with the victory or defeat of a civilization. And here comes a sore point: Civilization 6 leads to the rapid depletion of the Nintendo Switch battery, which is discharged with an almost disarming speed. Unfortunately, your games away from home won't last more than a couple of hours to be generous, so make sure that the journey is relatively short or that your destination has a charging dock for the console. However, this aspect amazes us up to a certain point, because the fluidity and technical rendering of Civilization 6 on Nintendo Switch are excellent: the cartoonish graphics go perfectly with the small screen of the console, while the game map, graphic details and polygonal models maintain excellent levels in both TV and tabletop mode. In portable mode the loading times to start a new game still take a full minute, and the AI takes a good handful of seconds to complete its move, but it's really nothing too much of a hassle even if you want to keep the version as a point of reference Title PC. Too bad for the almost inexplicable absence of the Rise and Fall expansion: will it come for a fee later?", "date": "2018-11-19", "grade": "9.2"}
