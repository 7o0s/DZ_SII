{"name": "NHL 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-2009.html", "text": "Skates, stick and technique The 2004 version of the EA hockey title is certainly one of the most complete ever, thousands of statistics and real players, obviously all based on the official license of the National Hockey League. From the first game, one immediately realizes that the approach given by the developers, having abandoned the arcade parenthesis of 2003, is purely simulation. This certainly has a significant influence on playability, of course fun is guaranteed, but the learning curve is not exactly immediate. We will have to learn to control the puck and the body of our player at all times, in attack and defense, our team will have to move in unison and form a single body, using football terms we would say that it is necessary to keep the departments close to each other. Our actions in the first matches, rarely, except in the easy level, will lead to many achievements and the points scored will be mostly the result of chance, precisely following an A.I. of our opponents decidedly fierce and accustomed to constant pressure throughout the match. Fortunately, the well-studied control system will give us a lot of satisfaction once mastered. In addition to the normal controls based on the pressure of the analog keys, in the use of which the regular player of the saga will immediately find himself, the freestyle mode was already introduced in the 2003 title which allows us to control the puck with the right stick, in completely independent from the control of the player's body, managed instead with the left stick. This allows us countless moves both in attack, hiding the puck from defenders, and in defense, trying to steal the puck simply by swinging the club. A further novelty has been made to the controls and we are talking about a particular type of pass, the saucer pass, which allows us to bypass the defenders by passing the puck immediately over their pucks. It goes without saying that the perfect mastery of this technique will offer us considerable possibilities to bring home a few more points. Vioulence and the American Dream One of the reasons that make us love this sport is certainly the courage shown by the athletes who, like modern gladiators, challenge each other in arenas closed by protective barriers. The adrenaline runs high and it is almost natural that it leads to something more than simple competitive frenzy. In fact, fights are the order of the day and are not prohibited by the regulation, unless pucks are used as weapons. In NHL 2004 they could not miss. Following a particular frustration, perhaps given by a too high negative score or by prolonged stress, some players may want to unload their ~torments~ on their opponents. We just have to press the right button and we will be catapulted into the arena, being able to command our athlete both in attack and defense shots. The encounters are decidedly interesting, moreover giving us the impression of having entered a small sub-game in its own right and decidedly well done. Another peculiar aspect of the EA title is certainly the Dynasty Mode, in which we will play the manager of one of the franchises we have chosen for 20 years. We will have the opportunity to hire staff, manage players and the transfer market, up to entering the hall of fame of the sport. From nothing to success, passing through many sacrifices and shrewd strategies. We will even be able to choose how to manage the days between the various matches during the year and, if we decide to have the team train constantly, we will receive in return a stronger team, but tired in the long run. Instead, by giving a few days off from time to time, we will allow our athletes to recharge their batteries and return to play with unchanged fighting spirit. This mode, which certainly makes the title very long-lived, could have been given immortality simply by enabling the online service via Xbox Live, but we know that to date there is no agreement between Microsoft and EA on it. Hi-tech NHL 2004 looks great, the menus are graphically beautiful and the games are just as good. The players are beautifully detailed and closely resemble their real-life counterparts, the arenas, as well as looking exactly like the models they are inspired by, are full of fans made with polygonal models who actively participate in the unfolding of the match. The game engine is completely reliable and never crashes, making the title fluid and frenetic. The camera also always does its job wellEven if, in the end, the possibility of choosing the best view does not fully meet us, given that it is either a little too far away or too close. The sound is pretty good, officially licensed by bands like Deftones, Alien Ant Farm and Ataris. Equally positive is the judgment on the sound effects that perfectly reproduce the noises of cheering and clashes. The only flaw is the commentary, actually good, which is however only present in English, like all the game menus. Comment The new EA hockey title is certainly a good product, able to offer everything that a lover of the genre could wish for: a deep playability, a good longevity guaranteed by the Dynasty mode, excellent graphics and thousands of statistics. This is indeed an advantage for enthusiasts, but it is perhaps a limitation for the average user who might find a more user-friendly approach to this sport preferable. It is also fair to remember that NHL 2004 will find itself dueling with two decidedly fierce opponents: Sega's ESPN NHL Hockey and Microsoft's NHL Rivals 2004 who will take full advantage of Xbox Live, unlike the Electronic Arts title. The battle has therefore only just begun. Pros: Deep playability and good longevity Thousands of stats Technically excellent Cons: Lack of adaptation in Italian Not so immediate learning curve Not playable online Hockey this unknown. The average Italian player is certainly unaware of the depth and complexity of this game, he knows it as a sport on ice with skates and a stick and above all as a discipline famous for its violent clashes. There are few real experts, even if they are decidedly seasoned. NHL 2004, the new title of the Electronic Arts autumn lineup, arrives precisely to satisfy both of these two types of subjects. For the expert who can't wait to use the puck and for the novice who really wants to frenzy and get his hands on it. To make them happy, even if we were Santa's helpers, we delved into the title developed by the Canadian studios of EA, testing it thoroughly. Result? Having definitely abandoned the 2003 version, much more arcade oriented, we have returned to the right and more interesting tracks of the simulation, giving us a title of considerable depth.", "date": "2003-11-24", "grade": null}
