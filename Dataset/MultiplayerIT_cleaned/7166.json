In the case of the writer, let's say that half of the responsibilities are attributable to the comics published in Italy by Editoriale Corno, often and willingly found in those improbable surprise envelopes because the provincial newsagents did not enjoy a widespread distribution like today; for the other half to the 1981 cartoon, the one with the drawings that made the verse of John Romita and the unforgettable theme song sung by Shuki Levy. A nostalgic relationship, in short, which has led to enthusiastic acceptance of the film adaptations directed by Sam Raimi (in particular the first one) due to their relevance to the original spirit of the comic strip, and in the same way to despise the recent (and all too much premature) reboot operated by Marc Webb. Well liked or not, ~The Amazing Spider-Man 2~ is arriving in cinemas just these days and here is the mobile tie-in made by Gameloft, which starts from the work done with the first episode to deliver us, if possible, a experience not only richer but also and above all devoid of the same defects, such as the evident drops in frame rate and problematic management of the view. Goal achieved? Let's say halfway. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 improves on many aspects of the first installment, but some uncertainty remains There is no enemy that saves you The starting point of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 remains a nice urban sandbox, with the city of Manhattan freely explorable and a large number of short missions in which it is possible to participate, moving from one building to another thanks to the cobweb. The movement mechanism, as for the first episode, is based on the pressure of a single button and is really excellent, perfectly making the swinging with the canvas and the jumps from one hold to the next, maneuvers made more spectacular by a certain care in the protagonist animations. The quests are divided into main (blue) and secondary (red), and are indicated both on the strategic map and in the in-game graphics, using the ~vertical lights~ expedient. To access it you simply need to reach the highlighted area, and then face a fight with low-ranking criminals or a quick time event-based challenge, or even real bosses in which we will have to face villains such as Electro, Kraven, the Goblin and Venom . The secondary missions tend to repeat themselves and this translates into a certain monotony of the action, especially when the character growth system (rather rich and multifaceted) refers to the enhancement of certain skills, an operation which involves the investment of credits which that point we will have to get by doing a little grinding. Fortunately this is the only drawback of a formula that provides for the inevitable in-app purchases only for the purchase of extra costumes, completely irrelevant for the experience. Higher, higher It is precisely in the fights that we notice a substantial improvement compared to the first The Amazing Spider-Man, or the lack of those collapses in the frame rate that made the animations jerky and increased the confusion dramatically. In this sequel, the action always remains fluid, which allows you to enjoy the clashes and even the counter-move system ~inspired~ by Rocksteady's Batman. This solution is particularly successful because it ignores the view and puts us in a position to fight without worrying about moving the camera. In fact, this remains the weak point of the game: Spider-Man can hover from one skyscraper to another and defeat the criminals by showing off spectacular acrobatic moves, but moving the view in the ~up~ operations proves to be very complicated and frustrating. It's a pity, because in the end it would have been enough to avoid ~precision~ targets to avoid this inconvenience or, better, automatically ~lock~ on sensitive targets in the vicinity. Beyond this limit, there is very little to complain about: the shots still lack a little ~impact~ for the clashes to be fun, it is true, but there has been an enhancement of the technical sector and flying around Manhattan it turns out to be a very pleasant practice, moreover without the pop-up effects that characterized the previous episode, with a good level of general detail, some touches of class (see the reflections on the windows of the skyscrapers) and a respectable drawing distance. Only some elements are rendered overly simplistic, such as the character landing from great heights, privo of any consequence. The sound accompaniment also seemed good to us, thanks to the discreet English dubbing and an engaging soundtrack, with a cinematic flavor.", "date": "2014-04-24", "grade": "7.3"}
