{"name": "Nintendo Labo Kit Veicoli", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nintendo-labo-kit-veicoli-recensione.html", "text": "Nintendo Labo was a hit. Sure, the first two Switch kits didn't push console sales towards the Wii numbers as perhaps some expected, but with 1.39 million units placed worldwide, in just over two months the cardboard toys produced by the house of Kyoto have managed to win the hearts of a large number of people. On the other hand, the idea of combining digital and manual in a single product immediately found the approval of parents and children, who saw in Labo respectively a return to the past and a way to exploit the Japanese hybrid console in an original way. It is therefore not surprising that, just over four months after the release of the Assorted Kit and the Robot Kit, a completely new set, the Vehicle Kit, arrives on the market on 14 September 2018. A set made up of three main means of transport which, while maintaining the consolidated setting, brings several interesting and, we already anticipate it, damned fun innovations. Create and play: a more structured experience From the box up to the first tutorials, the Nintendo Labo Vehicle Kit has the same characteristics already described in the Assorted Kit review: ~hardware~ side, a series of cardboard sheets of different colors, from which the Toy-Con pieces they are easily removable; on the software side, detailed interactive tutorials with attention to the smallest details, which guide the creation of the various games step by step. In the Create section we then proceed to the construction of four different vehicle control systems: we start from a pedal set to dose the acceleration and then move on to a steering wheel to maneuver the four wheels, a command bar to control the flight and a mechanical steering system to direct the propellers of a submarine. Unlike the Assorted Kit, however, this time the Play phase does not offer separate experiences for each Toy-Con. The fulcrum is in fact represented by an Adventure mode where you can use all the Toy-Con created with the kit. Here you can move freely within a rather large open map divided into thematic sections, which include deserts, mountain ranges, lakes and much more. Each area then offers different activities, which encourage you to explore not only the scenario, but also the abilities of the vehicles. The Toy-Con submarine, for example, has a harpoon anchor to attach to hidden objects; the plane fires homing missiles and allows you to parachute from great heights; the car, a 4x4 capable of climbing any surface like the horses of Skyrim, is instead equipped with a horn, radio, windshield wipers, a pair of circular saws, a pair of bomb-throwing arms and a hose for refueling in special areas of stopover. Just the gas stations are essential within the game, since they allow you to unlock the map of the area and give access to a handful of missions in the area. The quests are repeatable and, while obviously not representing a revolution in terms of structure and mechanics, in most cases they are nice and provide a valid excuse to face dunes and prairies, before having access to a series of collectibles that allow you to earn additional bonuses . As is now known, each Toy-Con needs a Joy-Con inside to work. A ~limitation~ that could have led to some headaches within the Adventure mode, given that one of its most particular features is precisely the possibility of exploring the area freely by land, by air or by sea (a bit like in The Crew 2). To avoid manipulating too much the mechanisms of toys that still remain made of cardboard, the developers (engineers?) Nintendo came up with a solution that is as simple as it is brilliant and nice: to create a key, obviously made of cardboard, which can house the Joy -Con right and take advantage of its infrared camera to switch from one means of transport to another on the fly. The idea works perfectly, even if it is mainly designed for enjoying the game on your home television. In portable mode, in fact, only the Toy-Con Auto is equipped with a special stand, a ~dashboard~ that allows you to look at the Nintendo Switch screen while holding the steering wheel on your lap. Thanks to a new update of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, it is also possible to take advantage of the Car and the Pedal to challenge your friends, perhaps using the Motorcycle from the Assorted Kit for the more classic challenge between four and two wheels. Sofia's Trial Just like for the Assorted Kit, Sofia's skills were fundamental for the review of the new Vehicle set. Although this time the start of the school year and fifth grade homework prevented her from participating in the construction phase, Sofia was pleasantly impressed by the new Toy-Con, spending the evening facing the many small challenges offered by the Adventure mode. She enjoyed it very much, and when asked to describe the new game in a nutshell, she said it was ~laboringly fun.~ A quote better than any other I've ever given birth to in my career as a reviewer and which I therefore could not fail to recycle in the title of the piece as well. Discover: between news and welcome returns The Discover section of the Nintendo Labo Vehicle Kit is also confirmed in the name of continuity. In fact, the team made up of Tina, Gi and Professor de Aggeggis returns to explain the various commands and mechanics behind the functioning of the Toy-Con, so as to fully exploit every element offered by Labo. Some accompanying little arcade experiences also return, such as a sort of track for radio-controlled cars to be controlled with only the accelerator pedal, track races to be tackled with the Toy-Con Auto, a checkpoint Rally mode that can be tackled with any vehicles and Battle mode, where the cars face off with Arms-style extendable arms. Finally, the color study mode transforms the right Joy-Con into a spray can with which to color every element of the vehicles, including the pilot. Once again there is the Garage Toy-Con, where you can create original toys such as our Poltergust 5000, now enriched with an extra section called ~I command~. Command io offers an additional level of customization of the gaming experience, opening the door to local multiplayer without the requirement of having multiple Toy-Cons or two full pairs of Joy-Cons. In fact, here it is possible to customize the controls within the various modes of the Play area: in this way, for example, you can challenge yourself in Battle using the Joy-Con horizontally; or totally new Toy-Cons can be created to take advantage of particular movement systems, such as piloting an airplane using a magic wand.", "date": "2018-09-13", "grade": "S.V."}
