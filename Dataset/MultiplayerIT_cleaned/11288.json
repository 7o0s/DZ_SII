Because the work done in collaboration between Intelligent Systems and Nintendo, directed by the veteran Goro Abe, is far from trivial: in the realization, but above all in the game design choices. We retraced the history of the character, and consequently of the WarioWare series, a few days ago: when the first chapter was released it was 2003, and the dominant console in the portable market was the Game Boy Advance. The game had been developed internally (by SPD, ex R&D1) as a kind of gamble: a secondary mode of Mario Artist: Polygon Studio was taken for 64DD (itself a secondary game), with the intention of making it a complete work and sold separately. This title offered a series of essential and fast-paced mini-games: simple tasks, based on the speed of understanding and execution. The project proved to be a success and from then on the saga would appear on any Nintendo console, pocket or otherwise. Commercially, and also qualitatively, WarioWare reached its peak on the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS. Perfect consoles to enhance its simplicity and versatility: it is no coincidence that WarioWare: Smooth Moves accompanied the launch of the Nintendo Wii, and showed the potential of the Wiimote like few others. In summary, we could say that the trajectory of WarioWare has been opposite to that of the video game industry. At the time of the first release, his approach was experimental and courageous: it would even prove to be anticipatory compared to casual gaming (and a certain type of hit and run mobile gaming). The two trajectories came together in the Wii and DS era, to then leave WarioWare groping in the dark: its fast and instinctive identity, its vocation for casual gaming, has by now been explored by many other companies and now reigns on platforms other than the Nintendo ones (mobile devices, in fact). WarioWare's main challenge: Get It Together! is precisely this: how is it possible today, in 2021, to create a game that is faithful to the key concepts of the series and which, at the same time, can be interesting for casual and non-casual players? Let's find out how Nintendo has addressed the issue, and if it has managed to find a solution to this puzzle, in our review; reminding you that the game will be available on Nintendo Switch, for 49.99 Euros, from 10 September. Characters and commands WarioWare: Get It Together!: The main artwork for the game. There are two ways that Nintendo has come up with to make WarioWare: Get It Together! a revealing game in current events. The first is to radically detach the amount of content from the essentiality and frenzy of the experience: if in the past WarioWare's menu and modes had indulged the nature of microgames, Get It Together! offers a large, very large amount of secondary challenges and objectives: without exaggerating, and in relation to the budget used, it is a sort of Super Smash Bros. of the saga (in terms of menus, modes and statistics). Much more interesting, however, is the choice of game design implemented to ~adapt to the contemporary~. In the past WarioWare was based on a fast series of microgames, lasting a few seconds, which became gradually more frenetic in case of repeated success: you had to figure out what to do in a few moments and put it into practice through the buttons. Now that's not the case anymore. And the choice made by Nintendo is as intriguing on the one hand as it is questionable - in our opinion - on the other. Basically, now you no longer command a variable element of the scenario, but a character; and each character has different skills. There are similar, but also radically different (sometimes too different). WarioWare: Get It Together!: Two players attempt to push a cart forward. This approach has the undoubted advantage of multiplying the number of microgames. Basically, if in the past the trials changed only based on the difficulty or the time available, now everything is filtered by the selected character: some teleport, some glide, others skate. Some shoot vertically, others horizontally; still others shoot everywhere, but stand still. In short, classical mechanics now has one more variable: you have to understand what to do, understand how to do it based on the protagonist, and finally make the intent concrete. The negative consequence of this approach, you hadn't already guessed, is that it greatly complicates things. Hugely not in an absolute sense, but in reference to casual gamers: whocomplete the whole story, he has time to gradually deepen the characters, even through a special (and mandatory) tutorial. Those who face the experience for the first time with characters and stages already unlocked, on the contrary, often find themselves helpless and confused; but more on that later. As for the control system, it is precise and functional to the game structure. Only the Control Stick and A Button are used (plus ~plus~ and ~minus~ for options) - a sensible and simple approach, which makes the game not only adaptable, but perfect to be experienced with a single Joy-Con . Perfect, in fact, to share the offline experience. Story and single-player WarioWare: Get It Together!: some of the characters from the game, in the introductory movie. The main mode of the game, the one that no one can avoid and which serves to learn the fundamental mechanics of the work, is History. Again, and always with due proportions, the Story has a value similar to that of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate: it illustrates the basics of the work to the players and at the same time allows you to unlock the characters and levels to be explored later . The plot is quite extravagant, consistent with the aesthetics of the production: Wario and his (bullied) company have created a new video game. When they are about to start it, even though it is considered complete, it turns out to be so full of bugs that it sucks them in: in essence, you control the characters of a video game that have ended up inside a video game themselves. And they have to eradicate the various bugs, which in the meantime have kidnapped many members of the company, passing thematic tests (culinary, cultural, sporting, Nintendo-centric and so on). The story is not particularly long to finish, let's talk about a few hours, but as mentioned it is functional to master all the mechanics of the title and, at the same time, to unlock most of the hidden contents. WarioWare: Get It Together!: here you have to team up to not drop the ice cream! Once the story is over, there is still a lot to play. There are missions (on PlayStation they would be called Trophies) to complete, which seem to drive obsessive and completionist players crazy (you have to maximize the level of each character, for example, by spending the coins you earn to give them gifts). There is the Wariopedia, in which it is possible to face every single microgame unlocked during the story, thus appreciating the many mutations based on difficulty and character. Finally there is the Great Variety mode, mainly devoted to multiplayer, and - above all - the Wario Cup: a section that, from week to week, will offer new challenges (according to the only one currently present, rather complicated challenges). Because after all WarioWare is this: once you become familiar with the title, and this time it will take much longer than usual, it's fun to keep playing to improve your records. So as not to make mistakes, with any character, at ever faster pace. The Wario Cup is playable by anyone with an internet connection, but participating in the online ranking will require a Nintendo Switch Online membership. Multiplayer, accessibility and appearance WarioWare: Get It Together!: Little Witch Ashley looks suspiciously at singing robot Mike. The game has a strong focus on multiplayer, especially sharing the offline experience. As we said before, WarioWare: Get It Together! only uses - during microgames - the Control Stick and the A button. An extremely simple and intuitive control system, perfect for playing with two single Joy-Cons. The entire Story, and consequently the entire Wariopedia, can be played in two-player multiplayer; in some cases they will be able to rely on only one character each, in others they will have to compose teams of three to five elements. The Great Variety is a mode inserted above all for multiplayer: it contains various mini-games, or collections of micro-games to be played in competition (in this case, up to four users). Some are extensions of challenges encountered throughout history, for example the dribble microgame, which continues - let's assume, we've reached a hundred - until the ball falls to the ground. Others present particular ways of tackling the microgames themselves: for example, a potentially endless series of challenges that ends only on the stroke of five errors. WarioWare: Get It Together!: Sometimes radically different graphic styles coexist. In each of the many circumstances described in this paragraph, the question of characters must always be kept in mind: we talked about it at the beginning of the article, we will reiterate it now. On the one hand the many protagonists, and thetheir different powers, expand the variables of experience, making it more multifaceted and complete; on the other, they inevitably complicate it a lot. Accessibility is undermined, as much as its complexity is enhanced. Even an expert player who hasn't faced the Story, and who doesn't know the characters and their skills, will need some time to become familiar with the game system; understandably, a casual player will find himself literally lost. Bewildered by the speed of the challenges, by their frenzy, but above all by the illusory sense of impotence: in a title based on rhythm, insert another variable between ~figuring out what to do~ and ~doing it~, namely ~figuring out how to do it based on the character~, is a big change in terms of game design. Indeed, a very big change. WarioWare: Get It Together!: There is perhaps no better image to convey how kitschy this game is. The look, as always, is blatantly kitsch. And we suspect that, at least in the Wii / DS era, the visual style of the game prevented it from deflagrating commercially. It doesn't matter, because it is one of the key features of the work and, more importantly, it is in keeping with the wacky and frenetic nature of game design. WarioWare: Get It Together!, faithfully to its predecessors, combines enormously different graphic styles without any shame, in a conscious and decisive way. Soft characters made in vector graphics, realistic illustrations on the background, polygonal game elements; faithful reproductions of classic Nintendo, believable statues in sensible proportions, deformed characters badly drawn, temples, pieces of garlic, realistic toothpastes, cartoon basins and we could go on for another ten lines. The overall effect is characteristic and well done with respect to the intentions. The sound faithfully accompanies the visual aspect and the pace of the game, offering a mix of ingredients that are anything but relaxing; as, indeed, is not relaxing WarioWare: Get It Together!. The dubbing in Italian should be mentioned, not at all obvious in such a production: each character has his own voice, and it is undoubtedly a note of merit, capable of fascinating anyone, from the enthusiast to the child who approaches the saga for the first time . It turns out to be more appreciable in the exclamations than in the videos that segment the story, but we certainly can't complain.", "date": "2021-09-08", "grade": "8.0"}
