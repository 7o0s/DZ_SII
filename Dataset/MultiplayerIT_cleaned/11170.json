{"name": "Robot Battle Tactics", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/robot-battle-tactics.html", "text": "Mobile gaming and the strategist vein have few things in common: on the one hand there is the need for immediate and fast products, which can entertain even if only for a few minutes, in an extemporaneous manner; on the other, there are ~reflexive~ titles, characterized by slow and reasoned gameplay, in which the games can last even a very long time. An uncomfortable marriage, therefore, which has nevertheless been celebrated on more than one occasion and almost always with surprising results. Sure, the ~casual gamer~ who plays mobile games occasionally can take a turn-based strategy game and be traumatic, but there are a large number of experienced and savvy users out there who use their terminal like any portable console, and are used to dedicating all the necessary time to this type of entertainment. Not for this Robot Battle Tactics can be classified as a ~hard and pure~ strategic one, one of those in which the stages get longer and more complicated as you progress: while having a multifaceted and rich gameplay, the last fatigue of LemonQuest makes an effort not to take itself too seriously, and offers a series of levels that are never too long and slow, in which perhaps it is the initial approach that decides the fate of the battle. As mentioned, we will find ourselves leading a small group of mercenaries who work for some powerful corporations, but who at a certain point realize that they are at the service of the ~bad guys~ and must pay the consequences. The game mechanics is the classic one of the genre, with shifts within which we can move our mechs and possibly make them attack the enemies. Each model has very specific characteristics, which concern the range of movement, resistance, offensive power and type of attack: some can only fight at close range, but they are lethal; others have weapons that only work at range, but can move faster. There are a total of four or five types of mechs, which include the inevitable support unit (the one capable of repairing the damage of its companions but which is often defenseless in front of the opponents) as well as the armored vehicles equipped with a long-range cannon . Between one stage and another, we will be able to spend the money earned to upgrade our equipment and to add new characters to the group, according to the principle that sees numerical superiority as an undoubted advantage, within turn-based strategy games. The control system is based on the movement of a pointer that flows from one unit to another, controlled via the d-pad, and on the 5 key, which is used to select a mech and to determine its movement as well as any offensive phase . Unlike the recent Transformers G1: Awakening, in Robot Battle Tactics we will have more than a single attack available, in this case we will be able to opt for a direct hit, for a melee attack (which affects several adjacent targets) or for a special attack, if we have accumulated enough energy. In the latter case, the game starts a short but spectacular sequence very similar to those seen in the various Super Robot Wars, in which our mech produces its own attack against the enemy. Unfortunately, so much variety is not available even in the defensive phase: we will only be able to suffer the blow, hoping that the armor will hold up enough to allow us to counterattack. The technical realization of the game is good, with rather detailed graphics for the mechs, which are well differentiated according to the model. Unfortunately the use of colors is a bit limited, and the locations all end up looking alike. Furthermore, the internships are far from enormous, therefore they are limited to being the setting for battles without the slightest exploratory ambitions. The cutscenes that can be seen during the special attacks are well done, but can not be skipped. The sound consists of some fairly good quality MIDI music, which accompanies the action without disturbing but fails to thrill too much. PRO Substantive gameplay Great upgrade system Interesting plot AGAINST A little too linear Questionable use of colors Sometimes cumbersome", "date": "2008-09-25", "grade": "S.V."}
