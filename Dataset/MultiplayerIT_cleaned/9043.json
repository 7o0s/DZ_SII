And all this not only because there is little space available to describe every detail of the product in detail, which inevitably leads the editor to sacrifice some information during the drafting of the piece in favor of other aspects considered a little more important. But also because, of course, there is always the risk, in expressing judgments, of dissatisfying someone between those who consider a complex title as the non plus ultra of videogame entertainment, and those who instead think differently, convinced that a playability excessively difficult can undermine any form of entertainment. But anyhow, we will see, as always, to maintain a certain balance as much as possible. Many of those who are reading this review will surely be familiar with Demon's Soul, one of the happy videogame surprises of recent years. This action-RPG with typically dungeon crawling elements, in which souls were explored, fought, killed and absorbed, had some new characteristics for the genre that made it unique, elevating it from the crowd, starting with the particular use and in some ways innovative that was online. Precisely for this reason, as well as for its complexity and very good gameplay, despite having come out a little muted and little publicized, it had managed to conquer a good share of the public. We ourselves, grant us a little self-applause, we had given it, among the few, a very positive vote, grasping its qualities, appreciating it and defining it as one of the best exclusive titles for PlayStation 3 since its first release outside the European borders. A couple of years after the original, the developers of From Software are back with a new multiplatform project, very similar in concept to the one just mentioned and entitled Dark Souls, which we can consider the natural evolution and a sort of sequel spirit of their previous work. The two products, in fact, are similar in almost all aspects, even if this new project is bigger, darker, claustrophobic, more complete and better realized. And we tell you right away, more difficult: if you have already suffered the so-called pains of Hell to finish Demon's Souls, then get ready to experience even worse moments. Avatars and dragons In a distant era, in a world devastated by an ancient war between the Lords, glorious fighters and military guides of various armies, and the dragons, which ended with the fall of the gigantic reptiles thanks to the betrayal of the dragon Seath in favor of the other races, it seemed all ended with the beginning of an apparent period of peace and prosperity, the so-called Age of Fire. But when the flames faded and darkness took over, it was chaos again. In this context, the player plays a prisoner in the cell of a remote castle, from where a long and difficult adventure will begin. In order not to spoil the surprise, we leave the reader the joy of discovering for himself why and how the protagonist is involved in certain situations, and the rest of the plot. At the beginning of the game, the player must create his own avatar, just like in Demon's Souls. Only this time he has a greater number of options available, both as regards the personalization of the physical appearance of his virtual alter ego - as for example in the case of choosing the shape and color of the hair, that of the skin, the type of physique or gender - both as regards the classes to which they belong. And with obvious differences between them in titles and skills, often also linked to the types of weapons and accessories that they will be able to use in the game, but without distorting what has already been seen previously. Each of these classes, which reflect those typical of the genre from the canonical thief to the beefy warrior passing through wizards, hunters, knights, pyromancers, bandits and so on, only minimally affect the initial part of the story, given that it evolves in the same way for all characters. In addition to a greater number of classes available, the game introduces the possibility of starting the adventure with an object of your choice taken from a list of different types: for example, you can decide to have with you a particular ointment useful for healing wounds, or another that worksfrom bomb to be thrown at enemies. It is also possible to equip and use two weapons at the same time. The first, however, most important novelty is represented by the typically free roaming structure of the product. Contrary to what happened in the past, in fact, the map is fully explorable and three times larger than in the previous game. Furthermore, to access each area it is not necessary to start from a specific central point, but simply by reaching the various settings at any time. Prepare to die Traps, ambushes, ambushes, hostile enemies and so on and so forth. These are the ingredients that season the world of Dark Souls from time to time. In short, the player must immediately approach the adventure in a fairly reasoned way, that is, without throwing himself headlong into battles like a madman if he wants to have a minimal chance of survival. And this right from the start, with the exception of the short initial tutorial. In this sense, the title is not very different from Demon's Souls, providing for fights with white weapons and magic blows, and a virtually identical control system also in the configuration of the keys, with the presence of parrying and dodging, the health bar and that of resistance which is consumed with each completed action, to the point of leaving one's alter ego vulnerable. The seemingly simplest moments last the space of a second: then immediately danger, fear, difficulty, awake and shrewd opponents, huge and powerful bosses, and threats that lurk around every corner, without ever allowing a breather. Even in those moments in which there seems to be a bit of tranquility, perhaps in front of an inviting chest that promises treasures of all kinds: there is always the possibility that an enemy will suddenly manifest itself at any moment. Maybe like a monster enclosed in the aforementioned casket, which suddenly emerges and begins to chase the player moving quickly thanks to the legs that come out of the lower part of the coffer itself. It is precisely when one least expects it that a suspicious noise can suggest the involuntary activation of a trap or the emergence of a big troll, throwing the user into a hopeless panic. The game, you may have already guessed at this point, is much more difficult than its predecessor, and not only due to the presence of even more difficult opponents to face due to their more developed artificial intelligence than ever, but also due to the structure of the adventure in itself, which provides precisely in these situations to make the most of every single moment, every slightest favorable situation in order to win the battle. Also developing, when necessary, real tactics. Indeed, in Dark Souls it becomes vital to be able to get around the enemies, especially if they are present in a specific area in a group, to eliminate them stealthily one by one and in an intelligent way, finding increasingly effective systems to reduce their number before perhaps slinging on the last ones left. You can decide to hit them from behind rather than lure them into a narrow corridor or act stealthily to escape their threat, but be careful not to get noticed because otherwise they will follow the user-controlled character to the ends of the world to get him out. The risk of seeing them coming from behind while perhaps you have just come across another group of creatures is not pleasant and therefore the approach to the clash is never linear. Playstation 3 trophies Dark Souls offers forty-one achievements to unlock, some of which are secret: 18 Bronze, 20 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum. These rewards are initially obtained by arriving in a certain place, performing some specific action or defeating a particular enemy, at least for the simplest ones. Instead, by recovering certain objects, such as for example all the rarest weapons, miracles or sorceries, or by eliminating some bosses, you will be able to obtain the increasingly precious ones up to the coveted Platinum, which can only be reached after having conquered and unlocked all the others. Souls, pacts and humanity The system of souls largely takes up what was seen in Demon's Souls and without making particular changes, thus allowing the player to recover them by defeating enemies, and thanks to them, level up, upgrade weapons, etc., but also buy extra spaces for stamina, Flasks of Estus (the flasks where the energy liquid is contained) and spells. The latter possibility should not be underestimated since spells are more complicated to use and very expensive, in fact there is no mana bar and each type of magic is therefore available a certain number of times before running out. The only way to 'recharge~ is to go to a camp, but in this case all previously defeated enemies will resurrect on the battlefield, always on the altar of making the game more difficult and with more tension. Fortunately, the camps also serve as ~checkpoints~ of adventure, but as you have seen their abuse increases the danger of the environment together. In the event of a premature death, your character loses all the souls he has conquered up to then, but instead of in ghost form, this time he will walk around as an undead, weaker and without the so-called Humanity. The latter, a sort of condition, has, among other things, various functions also linked to the improvement of some equipment, even if it mainly serves to maintain or regain the human form (which is more resistant and boasts greater skills). It can be obtained by buying it from specific merchants, from the bodies of big bosses, by killing evil spirits and invading players, or by stealing it from other users by entering their games as a ~black ghost~. In any case, to recover what was lost, namely mainly the souls, it is necessary to return to the exact point where the departure occurred, touching the blood stain left on the ground. Otherwise, or if you are killed again, you lose all loot. Dark Souls reintroduces the excellent online mode already seen in its predecessor, but perhaps never as in this game does it assume a fundamental role to fully enjoy the product and survive. In fact, there is the possibility of getting help from other gamers: and this, at times, is the best way to overcome certain obstacles, or rather, certain bosses that are really very difficult to eliminate. This does not mean that alone you cannot live a good experience, but the title encourages cooperation to the point of allowing in certain situations those who play offline to summon a large Black Knight managed by the CPU to their aid. And it seems, further on, someone else too. Cooperation is everything Returning to the discussion related to the aforementioned online system, as mentioned, it is practically identical to the one admired in Demon's Soul, just a little more ~refined~ and with some modifications here and there really not bad. For those unfamiliar with it, this innovative option allowed, and allows, to enjoy a single player campaign constantly open to the web. In this way it is possible to play both cooperatively and against other players from all over the world, or almost (depending on the console) interacting with them in many possible and imaginable ways. In fact, during the exploration phases, a user finds traces of all the players who, at that moment or in other situations, cross the same area in which he is at that precise moment, leaving an imprint of their presence. This imprint can consist of a simple text message abandoned on a path, which perhaps warns of the presence of a monster shortly thereafter, sometimes suggesting the best strategy to shoot it down, a trap or a hidden treasure. In the latter case, to avoid nasty surprises and jokes by some good-natured or particularly ~bad~ player, a feedback system has been implemented, which is, among other things, slightly improved, which allows you to authenticate or not the veracity of the message. However, another way to perceive the presence of human players is then simply to observe them in the form of white figures, while they fight an enemy or refresh themselves around a fire. If desired, they can be recalled using special objects to collaborate with the host player, who must be in human form. It is also possible to invade the world of another user in the form of a ~ghost~, to help him in some battle and obtain succulent rewards in exchange, or do it as a predator to plunder it directly. In Dark Souls everything is better regulated and it is possible, for example, to report the name of the one who murdered us in a special book accessible to all. Fortunately users with levels higher than the others by at least ten points cannot intervene in the games of the latter. In this regard: even if during our test we did not have the misfortune / luck to meet them, it seems that there are abilities available to users to transform themselves into objects such as chests and therefore to surprise the unfortunate person on duty. For the rest, still remaining in the context of online-related situations, we point out that although there are no old World Tendency and Character Tendency, there is now a new system that is conceptually similar, but structured differently. In practice, in Dark Souls you can form league factions", "date": "2011-10-03", "grade": "9.0"}
