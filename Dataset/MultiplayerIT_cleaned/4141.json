{"name": "Mars or Die!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mars-or-die-recensione.html", "text": "The atmosphere of Mars or Die! recalls without too many mysteries 'Fascisti su Marte', a series of sketches by Corrado Guzzanti made for the television program 'The Scafroglia case' (2002) by Serena Dandini, from which, a few years later, a film was also born. The goal is practically identical (so to speak): in the role of two improbable space colonizers, who arrived on Mars thanks to the Fortitvdo VIII Interplanetary Vessel supplied by the leader on duty, we must be able to colonize the Martian soil, exterminating the local population formed by large one-eyed creatures. All this translates into a campaign made up of nine missions in which we must first bring together and then make the two characters work together to reach our final goal. the game view is fixed Gameplay Mars or Die! is focused on a handful of mechanics that form the entire gameplay. The control system is essentially that of a twin-stick shooter, with our two unlikely heroes differing from each other in a single ability: one has a firearm, the other a shield. For the rest, the actions they can perform are essentially identical: explore, transport crates and build structures using the resources scattered around the maps. This is where the hybrid nature of Mars or Die appears with all its strength!, which wants to be a bit of an action, a bit of a roguelike and a bit of a tower defense, but evidently without too much conviction in any specific field. We try to explain ourselves better. The entire gameplay is centered around exploring the maps in search of crystals to recover. To do this, you need to build extractors near any deposit (or dig by hand, in the most desperate cases), supporting them with solar panels. After a few minutes the machine will have exhausted the deposit and, if in the meantime we have not found others, we will soon find ourselves without crystals and, therefore, without the possibility of building other structures... and this is the whole resource management part. His exploration is limited by two factors: the presence of enemies, which aim to destroy us and our buildings and which for this reason must be eliminated, and the oxygen in the characters' respirators, which must occasionally be refilled in special dispensers. This, if you will, is the whole survival part, which translates into building oxygen stations in strategic points so that you can continue to explore and kill roaming enemies. So don't expect anything from Rust or Conan Exiles. The other structures that can be built are: banners, which reduce oxygen consumption in their areas of influence; the research station, which allows you to upgrade weapons and structures using the crates scattered around the maps; the armory, which allows for the construction of turrets; and the turrets themselves, which serve to defend against enemies. In total there are two types of turrets, light and heavy, while the enemies that form the waves that attack our bases are four, with the weakest charging in melee and the strongest firing energy projectiles. In the defensive phases it is obviously possible, depending on the situation, to act directly both by fighting and by repairing the turrets that are damaged. And that's the whole tower defense phase. Contents As we said Mars or Die! consists of a campaign consisting of nine missions and an endless mode that is unlocked once the campaign itself is over. The infinite mode is, in no uncertain terms, the core of the whole experience, since it asks us to apply all the knowledge obtained during the campaign, which in itself we can consider as a kind of long tutorial, to defend ourselves against waves of progressive force aliens (if we want this is the roguelike part). The problem is that Mars or Die! it ends here: it's nice, technically it was made with great intelligence, making good use of the not many resources available and focusing everything on a simple style, as recognizable as it is light-hearted, but it reveals its cards within a couple of hours and begins to lose breath after the third, when the lack of things to do becomes apparent. Take the campaign missions for example: the only incentive to replay them is to unlock the secondary objectives, which in any case, satisfaction aside, don't yield much in terms of bonuses. Endless Mode itself is essentially self-contained, with no online leaderboards to compare your scores with other players. The individual aspects of which the game is composed are also extremely superficial. For example, the tower defense part, which should be central, is ultimately really poor, because, as there are only two tipsi of turrets and four types of enemies, it soon becomes clear that all you need to do to win is build as many as possible using all the resources available. Overall it is very little, also considering that the only strategic difficulties, if we want to call them that, are given by the positioning of the base, which can force different defensive configurations, also depending on the amplitude of the enemy waves (this is all the more true in last missions of the campaign and in the endless mode), and from the search for the chests, whose upgrades are essential to be able to survive as long as possible. In short, Mars or Die! the little it does is good for you, but we don't think it's enough, also given the fierce competition that is now crowding the market.", "date": "2018-07-19", "grade": "5.8"}
