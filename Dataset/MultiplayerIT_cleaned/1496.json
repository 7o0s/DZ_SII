{"name": "F-Zero GX", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f-zero-gx_a.html", "text": "Second Opinion There are no half terms, F-Zero is a real experience, much more than a game. The visuals are definitely top-notch, and the speedy feel of holding the joypad is beyond any other futuristic driving game. Too bad that in the four-player challenges, in order to keep the frame-rate identical to the single player, many graphic aspects have been sacrificed, perhaps too many: in many tracks almost only the track of the track remains, taking away tunnels, barriers and elements of the background. A very high price to pay to see the game run at 2000 kmh, and which takes away from the more experienced players many points of reference for correct driving, but which does not affect the overall enjoyment, thanks also to a precise and effective control system. But the pinnacle is reached with the countless game and customization modes, which will satisfy even the most demanding palates: quite difficult in single player at the most advanced levels and excellently balanced in multiplayer, it represents a challenge for everyone, from the racing fanatic to the ~Sunday driver~. Taking into account all the bonuses to be unlocked (tracks, cars, spare parts, ghost cars, remixed music, etc.) both by competing in the Cups and by facing the Story Mode, you understand well that it is a title destined to last a very long time. [Philip Ferrari] The fastest race on earth Before starting any analysis of the game, it seems to me a duty for a historic series like this (first majestic appearance on super nintendo under the name of F-Zero and encore granted on 64bit with F-Zero X) to explain what a zero formula is. Since its first release F-Zero was characterized as a futuristic racing game that based its fortune on the track design and the supersonic pace of play that was imposed on the player, little time to breathe even less time to think you had to become one with the car, feel it in your hands and know how to anticipate the curves to beat your opponents. Precisely from this first chapter some cornerstones of the series were born which will be reused for subsequent versions, the settings are re-proposed with the due technological evolution (big blue and mute city above all) not so much for lack of ideas from the programmers but for a sort identification process of the game.. F-Zero becomes a game inextricably linked to its icons, whether they are music tracks or characters. In this case a formula zero is nothing more than a sort of car race set in an unspecified future where thirty pilots drive strange flying vehicles along tracks that defy every law of gravity, dotted with jumps, loops and twists all above of absolutely hi-tech backdrops. Small clarification on the whole, the zero formula is not made up of sponsored teams, it is not physically for everyone, people from different social backgrounds can participate but with reflections far above the average and vehicles derived from their economic possibilities which determine square shapes and rough edges, scuffs and corners where paint often fails. Gentlemen, start your engine The main menu introduces us to a disproportionate amount of options where customize, story mode and driver profiles are added to the classic grand prix, versus, time attack and practice. Going into more detail about the game, the first mode that the menu allows us to choose is the grand prix, four different types of challenges based on the difficulty (novice, standard, expert and master, the choice of these weighs directly on the speed, competitiveness and the AI of the opponents) introduce us to the four cups (each of which consists of 5 circuits): ruby, sapphire, emerald and diamond, arranged in order of difficulty and complexity of the tracks. Immediately after having chosen the league, we will be catapulted into the character selection screen (initially the 5 historians of the first f-zero, subsequently up to 30) each equipped with an original vehicle that differs from the others in terms of design, boost, body and grip statistics on a scale of values ranging from A to E, once our choice has been made, the shuttle will be further modifiable as regards the colors and the acceleration/maximum speed ratio. For each race we will find ourselves competing with 29 other opponents and at the end of the league, depending on our position in the standings, we will be rewarded with a certain number of credits, useful for the purchase of cars in the shop, construction elements for fzero or missions. The game mechanics are always the same, A allows you to accelerate, B to brake, the ffunction of the triggers has been slightly modified compared to F-zero X and now allows you to perform the most complicated curves in a much more intuitive way, Z and X have been assigned the functions of offense, pressing the first transforms our car into a mad spinning top while the second is limited to the much more useful side door, finally Y is used to exploit the boost, available from the second lap, the use of which damages the energy bar of our fireball (recoverable through the usual multicolored stripes that we will find scattered for the track). You got Boosters! What represents the novelty of this chapter of F-Zero are the customize option and the story mode, in the first we will have the possibility to build our vehicle (after purchasing the right pieces in the shop) and to customize it later by applying it on the body textures already present in the game or that we can create using a pattern editor very similar to the one already seen for Animal Crossing. The shop is divided into three parts, the first concerns the f-zero shop where we will be able to complete our carnet of characters and cars that can be used during the game, the second concerns the purchase of elements for the construction of our half wheel by doing well attention to calibrate the usual stats of weight, grip, boost and body; the third and final section of the shop concerns the purchase of missions that can be used in story mode. Precisely in story mode, we will find ourselves playing the role of Captain Falcon who will find himself performing a certain number of tests, divided into chapters and introduced by FMV scenes that will have the function of keeping the thread of the story together. Don't expect to find yourself faced with a mere and easy tutorial, F-Zero is a difficult game and as such the story mode has the task of preparing you for the pitfalls that the higher classes will hide, so there will be proof that forces us to take every boost sown along the track to recover capsules or we will find ourselves in the middle of the desert in a mad race against samurai goroh, avoiding the falling rocks to our left. Another cornerstone of F-Zero is certainly the versus mode, which also in this version does not disappoint, the only defect found is that while the two-player split does not make the game miss a beat in terms of frame rate and 'graphic appeal, the four-player versus sacrifices the furthest details of the tracks and many object animations to keep the speed and fluidity of the game intact; however don't worry, given the speed in some parts of the game the only thing you won't have time to notice is the backdrops. From a graphic point of view, F-Zero is in fact unassailable, each track is studied and painstakingly cared for, with moving objects perfectly visible even from the furthest point of the track, reflections and colors are the masters on the Vegas Palace tracks, tube twists and transparencies are the order of the day in the Green Plants and the gloomy atmosphere full of lightning will accompany us on the Lightning grids; nothing is left to chance and an engine is grafted onto the futuristic design of the game that never misses a beat even in the most confusing situations (imagine thirty cars in tight hairpin bends firing repeating boosts) giving great impetus to the Gamecube's graphic capabilities. Unfortunately, another matter for the section relating to the music which, apart from the historical reprise of mute city, settles on mediocre and monotonous levels. COMMENT Ultimately, all that remains is to recommend the title packaged by Amusement Vision, an excellent game that lays solid foundations for the development of the saga in the future, without ever forgetting what marked the fortune of F-zero. An aesthetic component never seen before, an impeccable graphics engine on which is grafted an almost infinite playability especially in multiplayer: playing F-Zero is like taking a ride on a crazy roller coaster. The cube was reproached for the lack of racing game, well THE racing game is back. Pros: Incredible visual experience Tons of extras to unlock Virtually infinite in multiplayer Cons: Music not always up to par Really tough on the hardest levels Lots of graphics cuts when playing in four When two years ago Nintendo announced that it would leave the development of one of its most popular brands to Sega, many fans and purists of the series had turned up their noses, especially considering the situation in which the Osaka-based software house found itself, which had just come out of a crisis that had sentenced the morpremature launch of its latest console, the Dreamcast Two years have passed, Nintendo's bizarre market strategies (until now, I would add always successful) have now become a habit and it's time for the debut in all the arcades of the world of F -Zero AX, new creature of Amusement Vision which through a futuristic cabinet that mounts the Triforce arcade board (made in collaboration with Nintendo and Namco) brings us back to experience the unbridled emotions of the zero formula. To understand that we are probably facing the umpteenth jewel from Sega and signed by Nintendo, people take very little and are eagerly awaiting the home version that will arrive shortly, renamed GX in favor of the console that hosts it.", "date": "2003-11-10", "grade": null}
