{"name": "Mario Party 7", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-party-13.html", "text": "The frame of the story Like any good self-respecting Nintendo title, Mario Party has a brief hint of history that gives the incipit to start playing. In this seventh chapter, Mario wants to take a vacation and to do so, he books a ship cruise with all his friends, Luigi and Peach. Strangely, he also invites Wario and Waluigi but not Bowser, who will then do anything to ruin the party for everyone else. Traditionally, the cut scenes are well constructed, fun and rigorously in real time. Mario Party is the classic game that serves all rainy winter evenings, when we are at home in the company of some good friends. Mario Party is a board game, an atmosphere game, a game of aggregation and friendship. For two to eight players The new settings are six, and include the pagoda, Wario's hell, the Grand Canal and the Pyramids. Excellent scenarios, very varied and well done in their construction. In addition to these, you will be happy to know that there are 86 mini-games, all new and unpublished. It makes us wonder how Hudson (it is the software house commissioned by Nintendo for the development of the game) has managed to always invent new and original ones, given that there are now hundreds and hundreds of them in the whole series. The difficulty of the minigames is well calibrated, set to be accessible to everyone but at the same time be fun and not frustrating. The style is similar to that of the games in Wario Ware, fast, fun and simple to understand. The difficulty of the minigames is well calibrated, set to be accessible to everyone For two to eight players Most will use just one key, or just the analog, at most a combination of the two. Other times the microphone will be used. They range from very simple games where you have to fight everyone against everyone, to others where the challenge is one against the other, while still others will pit two players against two others. The real innovation of this year is the possibility of being able to play eight people at the same time. Multitap on GameCube? Not even for a dream: each pad will be divided between two players, one will use the analog and left trigger, while the other the right trigger and one or more keys. Bowser is badder than ever! As previously mentioned, Bowser will not be present among the ~on vacation~ characters and therefore will not be available. It will still be there, somehow. During each four-player session, an indicator will be displayed which slowly, with each turn rotation, will fill up to the limit when Bowser will pop out with some of his wickedness. For example, he can steal coins, send some players back to the start or skip rounds. This ~Bowser factor~, similar to all intents and purposes to a ~pass the bomb~, the typical beach game to be played with the water balloon clockwork, gives a lot of spice to the game. Technically Mario Party 7 has extremely colorful and pleasant graphics, with numerous goodies and effects but extremely simple and devoted to functionality Bowser is badder than ever! Technically Mario Party 7 has extremely colorful and pleasant graphics, with numerous goodies and effects but extremely simple and devoted to functionality, far from overflowing with polygons. As it should be, on the other hand. The characters are very accurate, both in animation and in modeling. From the sound point of view, the game has all the typically ~Nintendo~ effects, remixed music from the previous episodes and some unpublished themes. All the tunes are very catchy and are designed to be listened to for many hours consecutively, resulting cheerful but not disturbing or cacophonous. However, the tunes are very simple, perhaps precisely so as not to be redundant given that the type of game is designed to give long games even many consecutive hours At this point it is necessary to make a distinction. Between those who have never played any episode of Mario Party, and those approaching this important Nintendo franchise for the first time. For the first category of gamers, the appeal unleashed by this seventh episode will be very low. Despite this it is clear that Mario Party enjoys a hard core of enthusiasts who every year and every release decree its constant commercial success. Those who have played the previous chapters will know very well what awaits them, without many surprises. For the second category of users, a title absolutely to be taken into consideration. Due to its particular nature, Mario Party is naturally to be played in multiplayer, the ~single~ component is tenuous and absolutely does not justify its purchase. Pros: Simple and fun minigames in multi 86 nnew games and 6 environments Opportunity to play in eight Cons: The format now lacks originality Boring and slow single game Very, too similar to 6 Party Time! Now in its seventh year, the Mario Party franchise has reached a cadence now worthy of any sports title. The formula is always the same, that of the Monopoly-style board game, to be played together with as many friends as possible. What differentiates each Mario Party release are the collections of minigames enclosed in the title, some slight differences in setting and the settings of the stages. Since last year it is also possible to use the Nintendo microphone as a peripheral, which gives originality and freshness to the series. However, the differences between the predecessor are minimal, and by now the feeling is that only a ~different~ console like Revolution will be able to rejuvenate and diversify a game that is now too stagnant like Mario Party.", "date": "2006-02-10", "grade": null}
