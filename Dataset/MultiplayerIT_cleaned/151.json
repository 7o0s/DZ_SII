{"name": "Tom and Jerry Tales", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-and-jerry-tales.html", "text": "I thought I saw a cat Ok, the cartoon is different, but the canvas remains the same: Tom & Jerry, Tweety & Sylvester, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote In all these very lucky stars and stripes cartoons there is a very cunning and mortally obnoxious prey and an inept and loser predator, who should be the bad guy of the situation but for whom we end up siding every blessed episode. Tales starts badly right away by putting us in the shoes not of the big cat Tom, making sure that Jerry finally catches us would certainly have a better mind towards the game, but of his rodent counterpart: the player's task will, predictably, be to go around the house looking for spasmodic of cheese (ah, a warning by the way: playing T&JT will make you hungry, that mouse eats like an elephant!) avoiding the thousand traps that Tom's poor feline intelligence will put in your way, and maybe turn his same ~diabolical~ plans; at the end of the game (that is, an hour and a half after its beginning, so to speak) the house will be in such a disastrous condition that the owners, returning from some errand, cannot help but blame the poor cat and kick him out of the house. And so, once again, injustice will be done The Eidos title is yet another to exploit the license of the famous cartoon I thought I saw a cat You will guide the evil mouse through basically three phases of the game. We could define the first one ~exploratory~, in quotation marks because if it is true that you can move at will in the six rooms in which the mansion is divided (but at the beginning you will only have access to the kitchen), this is rendered useless by the fact that the path from one event to another is clearly marked by a trail of pieces of cheese worthy of Tom Thumb... These phantom events are nothing more than the remaining two phases of the game, the minigames and the platform phases. The former are the triumph of the ~quotation~, always wanting to be generous, providing for various typologies borrowed here and there mercilessly from the various exponents of the genre. This wouldn't be the problem either, at least not as much as the bad realization which provides very slow responses to the controls, busted explanations, disarming simplicity, pachydermic rhythms and nevertheless a latent frustration due to the collisions almost completely far-fetched that will often and willingly to die despite being rightly convinced that you have placed kilometers of space between you and the obstacle. The platform phases instead provide, in addition to the usual problems of controls and collisions and related curses to the whole family tree of Hanna & Barbera, a completely flat and inconsistent level design, which as the levels go by, while it should become gradually more complex and interesting, in reality it just becomes convoluted and unnecessarily huge We have to call the animal protection! From Oscars! Leaving the field of video games, Tom & Jerry's career is rightly full of successes and accolades. Among these five Academy Awards, the so-called Oscars. Four are for the short films Yankee Doole Mouse from 1943, The Cat Concerto from 1946, The Little Orphan from 1948 and Johann Mouse from 1952. The fifth Oscar even rewards them for their participation in a live film, the musical Canta che ti Skip to 1945 where the two characters, directed by George Sidney prove to be skilled dancers alongside none other than Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra! WWF The only vaguely positive news comes from the technical sector: the static graphics, that is to say the drawings both in the cut scenes and in the actual game, are even very good, with colorful characters and backdrops that fully reflect the style of the cartoon. Too bad that as soon as everything starts to move, except for a few animations of the mouse, it returns to rather low levels, with an annoyingly ~muddy~ scrolling and jerky and badly connected animations ... The same goes for the sound, which offers us not even bad jingles which, however, turn out to be very few, very short and which consequently repeat themselves endlessly Not to mention the effects, badly made and annoying too. Longevity, as we mentioned earlier, is around an hour and a half for a seasoned player, but it would be even less if it weren't for the unexplained deaths that will punctuate the experience; being the game intended for an audience of children, it is foreseeable that the little ones will take a little longer, but we are of the opinion then that with the simplicity of the scheme, which is all there and is sacrosanct given the target, they do not marry all the defects found such as lack of immediacy in understanding what to do in some subgames, slow response to commands, frustration and level design unable toi grab attention even for a few seconds. Completely ditch the archaic password system used for saving, and the picture is complete. The fact that Tom & Jerry Tales is a game intended for under 10s does not justify it in any of its shortcomings. Indeed, we are convinced that a novice player should face such a simple challenge, but always well calibrated and never frustrating. It should be guided by the hand in the early stages of the game and then be left free once the mechanics have been learned, it should be welcomed by an inspired and engaging design, it should understand why it made a mistake in that particular passage All things that Tales not only does not ago, but who even undertakes to achieve the opposite effect. The technical shortcomings only confirm the very little effort made by the programmers, for what is increasingly proving to be a sad reality in the video game scene: the combination of a licensed game and a game for children is lethal! And it's a real shame Pros Good cute jingle designs Cons Trivial and flat Simplistic and frustrating, but how did they do it? Even technically mediocre And there are even passwords! Sure, it could. Too bad, and let's clear the field right away, that this isn't the case... The Eidos title is the umpteenth to exploit the license of the famous cartoon, and not even on purpose, the umpteenth that desperately tries to capitalize on the fame that the blue cat and the orange mouse attract from the public, especially that of the younger ones, without making even a clear effort to propose something we are not saying new, we are too adults and vaccinated to expect novelty from any Tom & Jerry, but not even well done or at least built according to the rules Not at all: we managed to get very little blood out of this turnip, and what follows is the detailed account of such a sad experience", "date": "2007-01-26", "grade": null}
