A title designed exclusively for a certain type of ~game player~, in short, in which everything (from volleyball matches to minigames, from shopping to card games) is nothing more than a mere side dish with respect to the absolute protagonist of the Tecmo product: the female body . And there are ten girls on Zack's new Island, all from the Dead or Alive fighting game series: Kasumi, a lover of the color pink, four-leaf clovers and sushi; Hitomi, who prefers sky blue, loves chocolate and the sound of the violin; Leifang, lover of yellow, leather bags and ice cream; Christie, adorer of black, pizza and darts; Kokoro, who likes orange, fried chicken and watermelons (which we like a lot too); Helena, lover of white, iced tea and old watches; Tina, lover of sapphire blue, bananas (of course) and iced coffee; Lisa, who prefers the color red, newspapers and has a passion for telescopes; Ayane, lover of the night and of the purple color, of grapes and the sound of the ocarina; Rio, who has a passion for bright pink, ginger ale and cherries. The Young Man's Handbook I... um, marmots As you may have guessed, every girl in Dead or Alive Paradise has certain tastes in colors, clothes, food and gifts. After having selected our beauty among those available, we must therefore earn the sympathy, affection and collaboration of the others by making use of all our generosity, buying and sending gifts between one volleyball match and another. We start with a generous sum of money and a ~playmate~ who will follow us as long as we can reward her efforts with gifts and kind thoughts. It is difficult to imagine such a context in real life, in which an almost Sapphic friendship is formed solely for interest, if not as an extremely squalid thing. Luckily it's just a video game, so it's better to make the best of a bad situation and inform us about the preferences of our girlfriends before buying the wrong gift, otherwise we will inevitably leave and search for a new partner. During the day we can visit one of the available locations, talk to the other girls and try our hand at volleyball matches (which however are not structured as a real tournament, so they leave the time they find), or go to the shopping center to buy new costumes and gifts of various kinds. We can also use a camera to immortalize our partner in the most obscene poses that come to mind, creating personalized albums. When night falls, we can choose whether to retire to our hotel room and sleep until the next day, or go to the casino. It is here that the funniest activities (sigh!) of the game take place, including slot machines, games of poker and black jack. Putting aside the first ones, in which you win only by a stroke of luck, we can actually multiply our savings by hitting a few hands in poker or blackjack. With any money earned we will be able to repeat our shopping sessions... until we have bought everything the island offers and earned the sympathy of all the other girls. Mim and the volleyball girls Anyone who approaches Dead or Alive Paradise thinking of a good volleyball game, in which the female forms are more of a pleasant extra, will unfortunately be very disappointed. We have already clarified above that all the activities that can be carried out on Zack Island play a marginal role compared to the visual impact of big bouncing breasts, dizzying thongs and tapered legs, and this is precisely the reality: the Tecmo product presents itself as pure ~fan service~, without delving into the playful aspect in any way and proposing game sessions in the name of boredom and excessive simplification. Impossible to consider the minigames that take place in the pool, based solely on pressing a sequence of buttons indicated on the screen, worthy of note, nor are the volleyball games able to involve that much due to a rather limited AI. The biggest problem is that even the technical sector is nothing special, going to undermine what were the initial intentions of the project. You see and it is clear that all the resources of the graphics engine have been used to render the modelsthe most detailed polygons possible, and in fact from this point of view we have very little to complain about: the curves are quite regular, you don't notice edges (and anyone who has a little experience with PSP games knows well how much this is a phenomenon widespread) and the animation is of a good standard. The problem is everything that revolves around girls, which translates into really poor locations, at times even unwatchable and even limited in number.", "date": "2010-04-16", "grade": "4.0"}
