{"name": "Dead Head Fred - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-head-fred-recensione.html", "text": "Fred Neuman is undoubtedly a dutiful person who does not hold back even in the face of risky situations. And that's why one day he finds himself decapitated, his body abandoned in a swamp infested with radioactive discharges that have changed the face of Hope Falls. A little gift from Ulysses Pitt, a prominent character who manages all the city's trade behind a respectable facade and can count on a small army of monsters and mutants. For Fred it's not over yet, however: a decidedly mad scientist brings him back to life to allow him to take his revenge ... the only problem is that our hero will have to do without his head, replaced by a crystal container in which he wallows happy his brain. There's no need to lose your head... The dismay soon gives way to logic: although it is difficult for him at the moment to go shopping in a mall without attracting other people's eyes, Fred can go in search of his head relying on a truly interesting ability: that of ripping the skulls of opponents and ~mount~ it on your neck, gaining new powers each time. We are talking about a total of nine heads, which we will find within the numerous locations to explore throughout the game. And it's not just the face that will change: the character will move differently and acquire specific characteristics depending on the head selected. The stone face, for example, will make us very heavy but able to resist underwater without breathing, and will also give us exceptional strength. The zombie face, on the other hand, will allow us to absorb a series of substances and then shoot them out when needed, perhaps to put out a fire or water dry plants. Furthermore, to communicate with normal people without making them run away, we will be able to mount a mannequin head... Dead Head Fred bases the variety of its gameplay precisely on the possibility of modifying the character in many different ways, also providing us with the possibility of enhancing each head at our disposal to gain new skills. Heads or tails? Although the early stages may suggest a pure action game setting, the new Vicious Cycle title soon reveals itself to be much, much deeper. We will often find closed doors and blocked passages, and from time to time we will have to solve puzzles to continue exploring the stages. In any case, one of our heads will provide us with the solution to the puzzle and we will hardly be faced with dead ends, as the game will show us the way forward quite clearly. We must not forget about the enemies, however, who infest any area to be explored for better or worse and which we can eliminate using a combat system that is fairly full of alternatives. Fred can deliver blows by pressing the Square button, and create long combos by alternating pressing the X button (which is normally used to jump). The moment the opponent is stunned, we can finish him off in a spectacular way by pressing the Triangle button. It is clear that the zombies and monsters that we will face will not stand by while we slaughter them, therefore we will have the possibility to parry their blows by holding down the backbone R, which also acts as an extra for attacks as well as an activator for managing the view (holding R and moving the analog stick). Finally, with the Circle button you can use the special ability of the head we wear, regulated by a bar that recharges over time. The interaction with the environment, beyond the puzzles, is rather limited and we will have to be satisfied with destroying some boxes, possibly collecting objects such as the useful vials of red liquid, which restore our vital energy (the objects of the inventory can be activated using the d-pad). Technical realization The graphics of Dead Head Fred are really good, especially as regards the realization of the characters. Fred alone already boasts a really large animation park, given that each head modifies its appearance and movements, but in general all the enemies and friends we will meet on our way boast a good level of detail and convincing polygonal models. It is true that there are no huge scrums, but the engine manages to manage every phase of the action without missing a beat, disappointing a little only for the presence of rapid but very frequent loading, which characterizes the passage towards each new zone of the internship. It must also be said that the view is not managed very well, and that we will almost always have to adjust it to be able to move more easily. The sound sector is also distinguished by a grande quality, above all because of the well-made speech but also for a series of atmospheric music, never annoying, which manages to accompany the action in the best way without being noticed. Comment The need was felt for a product like Dead Head Fred on PSP, a game that doesn't limit itself to enriching the trend of simple action games but introduces a series of innovations that make the action much more complex and varied than one might think . Overcoming each stage means activating switches, unlocking doors and, in general, solving more or less simple puzzles that often have to do with one of the heads we can wear. The idea of the face change, which also modifies the characteristics of the character, is really good and gives life to some original and engaging situations. Despite a not exactly exciting combat system and mediocre visual management, therefore, we are faced with a playable and long-lived title, which stands as a thicker alternative to classic action games. Pros: Great graphics and sound Varied gameplay Lots of puzzles, but it's hard to get stuck Cons: Combat system needs to be overhauled Mediocre camera handling Could have been more action", "date": "2007-12-20", "grade": null}
