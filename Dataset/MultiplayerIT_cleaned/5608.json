Even in the world of video games, where there is certainly no shortage of catastrophic alternatives linked to different genres, with an offer that ranges between The Walking Dead, Fallout and so on and so forth. Including Fallout Shelter, spin-off of the last of the two titles just mentioned. We name it because in many ways it resembles Sheltered, a game already spotted in mid-2015 while it was still in Early Access on Steam. For the record, it must however be said that although the Bethesda-branded management system arrived first on the market, the survival of the independent Unicube team was announced in advance, successfully passing on Kickstarter already in 2014. We have already talked about the campaign on the occasion of the tried precedent of Sheltered, and also archived the Early Access we just have to find out what this interesting title has in store for us. The final version of Sheltered only partly fulfills its promises, but it's still a good game Fluke Imagine wandering aimlessly in a radiation-ravaged world, only to suddenly find yourself in front of an underground shelter. As if that weren't enough, this is fully functional and able to guarantee life to those who live there. We don't know why but the place is also deserted, so without asking yourself too many questions you slip in together with the rest of your family to become its new owners. It begins more or less like this, with a blow to the back of the Sheltered genre, within which we are called to make sure that a family is able to survive while outside the catastrophe continues to rage. The first step consists in deciding the appearance and characteristics of the inhabitants of the refuge, a total of four: two adults, not necessarily of different sexes, and two children. We can do this thanks to an initial character editor, in which to choose elements such as hairstyle, skin color and clothes, but above all the skills that each of the family members will bring with them during the adventure. In fact, for example, there are those who are more skilled in building things or those who manage to exert their charisma on others, while the personality traits add interesting variations, which are really appreciable during the game. For example, a sleepy head will take more time to rest, while a courageous type will face dangerous situations better. In all of this, those who don't want to waste too much time can count on a random generation tool, through which it is also possible to obtain amusing twists in the creation of the characters: for days and days our main explorer was a child endowed with brute force, indispensable to defend themselves with hatchet blows from a world intending to kill us. Physiological needs Once settled in the refuge, the protagonists of Sheltered are forced to take care of the various aspects of their lives, starting from the primary needs such as breathing, drinking and eating. Luckily, an already functioning air filter takes care of the first one, so the only thing to do is to keep it in good condition. For other needs, however, there is a need to do more: from this point of view, the game seemed a little more tender than its Early Access version, giving the player the possibility of being able to count on a few more rains to fill containers with filtered water (to be built to have sufficient supplies) and to find food more effectively. However, all this is only the beginning, because the members of the quartet will also have to sleep when they are tired or go to the bathroom when it's time, remembering The Sims very closely from this point of view. It is no coincidence that, like the Maxis title, the main risk is that of letting oneself be overwhelmed by the management of the characters' needs without being able to do anything else, even if fortunately it is possible to count on a setting that automates the management of the primary needs within of the shelter. The downside is that sometimes he doesn't do it as we would like, for example letting someone else steal the last supply of water from someone who is really dying of thirst. What we have talked about so far is actually only one of the two main aspects of Sheltered, given that the guys from Unicube also invite us to expand the shelter to build new objects and make improvements to existing ones. To do this, we can count on an excellent crafting system, on which all the interventions on the new house revolve. Do you want to equip yourself with a well-made toilet, instead of an improvised bucket where you can collect your needs? Make sure you have the rightta amount of wood, bits of metal, buckets and nails, otherwise you won't go anywhere. The same goes for anything else you want to build or upgrade, for which the player is forced to get out of the shelter to find the parts he needs. In search of the lost nail The idea of going around looking for items works quite well, at least until there starts to be a need to collect a component that we really need a lot. In fact, everything is left to the benevolence of artificial intelligence, given that to start an expedition all you have to do is mark some reference points on a map, and then send some members of the group to visit them. They will then radio us, asking us what to do when they see an interesting building or find other people in their way. While giving us the opportunity to count on some obvious associations (if you need anti-radiation pills, go to a pharmacy), in reality Sheltered finds its Achilles heel in this aspect, often forcing the player to set up more shipments to find a single piece that is missing. The main cause of all this is that the materials found around are random, as well as those that are offered to us by other survivors willing to exchange. We do not deny that finally being able to find the long-sought object is quite exciting, but the dynamics that lead us to find it are decidedly biased towards frustration. Imagine being on your third or fourth unsuccessful expedition, finding yourself in the situation of not being able to build anything and having to devote yourself to physiological needs and repairs, before being able to immediately organize a new expedition. Until now we have not talked about the fights, because unfortunately they have remained rather similar to those seen in Early Access: the turn-based management is very unclear in its functioning, which is why one is driven to avoid them unless one is forced to face an enemy. In the same way, recruiting other people to your group is a choice to consider very well, because blowing up the balance is a matter of a moment. However, the absence of interaction between the characters does not lead to welcoming other inhabitants into the shelter. We conclude briefly with the technical aspect, where Sheltered features pixel art graphics: the more accurate the details of the shelter, the less those of the characters and external environments. In this final version, support for the Italian language in the texts is welcome.", "date": "2016-04-03", "grade": "7.0"}
