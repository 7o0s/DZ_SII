{"name": "Mystic Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mystic-heroes.html", "text": "Tears of the dragon The plot has its roots far back in time, precisely when the fearsome emperor-sorcerer Kang and his trusted companion Sheva, a witch, dominated the world by subjugating it thanks to their magical powers. From the oppressed people emerged two mystical heroes, Tai and Naja, who, thanks to their powers, managed to defeat the tyranny by defeating the two sorcerers at the helm of an army. Obviously this is only the prelude to a rather trivial story, the background of which often turns out to be obvious. As evidence of this, here comes the son of the two sorcerers, Cyrus, in an attempt to bring his parents back to life thanks to the power intrinsic in the stone of the Dragon, capable of destroying the barriers that isolated the spirits of Kang and followers to bring them back to our world. Destiny is therefore again in the hands of Tai and Naja, this time no longer alone thanks to the advent of two other heroes: Shiga and Lani. Gotta slash'em all The first pleasant surprise comes from the initial menu, where it will be possible to select between four game modes: story, survival, mission and multiplayer. The story mode is nothing more than the main adventure, in which the events of Mystic Heroes take shape where, between one battle and another, the not very intricate plot unravels. Linked to it is the survival mode, in which three different paths will be selectable by setting and difficulty level which will be divided into four missions each, without however the possibility of saving between each of them. The mission is certainly the mode that most of all deviates from the philosophy of the game, slash'em all to be clear, offering the player missions of various kinds. The most appetizing of these secondary modes is certainly the multiplayer mode, which will allow up to four players to play in split screen simultaneously, if equipped with multitap. The title, as already mentioned, is a scrolling fighting game with a pinch of regard for the strategic component; in fact it will not be a simple one against all battle, also in consideration of the fact that you will have a mini army at your side to protect. To do this, the Yokohama developers have implemented written and sound indicators to attract the player's attention, in order to be able to change the process where necessary. The action will take place freely within the battlefield, the key points of which will be the tracking down of enemies and the consequent head-on attack, which can generally be solved by repeatedly pressing the same key in order to perform as many combos as possible possible. They will also have at their disposal mystical powers dictated by runes, capable of performing elemental magic of various types. Before each battle it will be necessary to perform a setup of your runes, since among the over 70 present in the game only four will be selectable, in order to produce four different types of magical attacks. Unfortunately the main game is the victim of a game concept that leaves too little room for variations of any kind, soon ending up in a boredom that can only be broken by changing game modes or, better yet, with a few multiplayer sessions. Technical side Technically, the Koei title makes a journey without infamy and without praise, dragged by an almost granite frame rate in single player, also by virtue of the fact that the screen will often be crammed with enemies. Even the four main characters are partially worthy of praise, boasting a rather inspired design and an overall good polygonal construction; the same thing cannot be said of the creation of the enemies, lacking both in terms of polygonal and variety. Very good and intuitive is the realization of the camera, which offers the classic positioning behind the shoulders thanks to the left lats as well as the possibility of correcting it freely using the right stick. The result of the game settings is decidedly subdued, victims of a flat design, which offer a horizon constantly limited by fogging in addition to the low level of detail. The sound of this Mystic Heroes certainly cannot be defined as driving, limiting itself to a few shy and accent-free background motifs in the most charismatic situations, and to a rather repetitive and careless range of sound effects. Final comment Mystic Heroes is part of qhe category of titles that ~could have but didn't~, leaving a certain bitterness in the mouth. In fact, the game concept, if properly amplified, could really have made the Koei title a must buy. But this did not happen. Victim of an anonymous technical realization and a repetitive game action, Mystic Heroes remains to be recommended to true fans of the genre, who will certainly also appreciate the various game modes. Pros: Lots of game modes Good camera handling Cons: Dated graphics Repetitive From the same manufacturer of the famous Kessen and Dynasty Warriors brands, here comes Mystic Heroes, a scrolling fighting game with a look vaguely inspired by the style of oriental role-playing games. Originally released for GameCube under the name of Hoshin Battle in the land of the Rising Sun, this KOEI title also arrives on PS2, bringing with it all the hopes that derive from such a famous software house.", "date": "2003-07-14", "grade": null}
