{"name": "Breve", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/99896-journey-breve-fantastico-immaginifico-viaggio.html", "text": "We like good videogame stories a lot, like the one involving thatgamecompany, a software house founded in May 2006 that came to light with Flow and led Sony to the decision to support it while ensuring the publications of its products exclusively on the PlayStation Network. It was then the turn of Flower, which further raised the qualitative bar, while Journey represents the third game in order of time and if we want the one with greater ambitions. The philosophy of this small developer made up of 10 people to date has always remained the same, to touch some videogame ~cords~ different from the classic ones, based more on an emotional level than on any other type. Unlike those titles where the protagonist is endowed with powers that allow him an advantage over the surrounding environment, in Journey none of this happens, and one is constantly immersed in a sense of extreme solitude which is the focal point of the production. Your alter ego wakes up in a desert with strong yellow and stylized hues, without knowing where it is and what to do, except for a single point of reference to reach represented by a mountain in the distance. No screen interface or ability to communicate, just that of emitting a sort of sound call, as well as obviously moving and looking around with the motion sensor of the sixaxis (and the right analog). The meaning of life In reality, the world of Journey represents a metaphor for something different, a sort of introspection that the player can experience by continuing in what is still an adventure on a narrative and visual level off the screens. The protagonist himself is not human but literally made up of clothes, has a cloak and can take advantage of wind breezes to cover greater distances. It is able to give life to more or less large shreds of fabric thanks to the aforementioned call and to the simple touch, in order to use them as platforms to jump or chain them together to reach otherwise inaccessible places. A sort of vitality instilled by and in the main protagonist, who has a scarf that can be extended by collecting glittering spheres scattered around the game scenario. It is not our intention to spoil the features of this journey more than necessary, but for example it is necessary to ~activate~ various pieces of fabric to form a bridge, or still to free others that accompany the player for a piece of scenery, transporting him like a carpet steering wheel. Sand, wind, atmospheric agents in general and their interaction with the player represent another predominant element, as well as exploration, completely optional but an integral and recommended part of the experience. In fact, within the game world it will be possible to occasionally come across some cave paintings that can be activated to discover the secrets of the title at 100%. Also because the visual impact with Journey is something unforgettable and original. The glimpses that leave you speechless are not rare, where the bright and cartoony colors hit the player in the chest and where the absence of any element on the screen increases these extraordinary sensations. The shots that in some cases recall those of Shadows of the Colossus do the rest, but it is precisely the aesthetic system that is sensationally beautiful, when the sun reflects on the sand, the wind and the snow challenge the main protagonist, the contrast between colors and what happens on the screen surprises and fascinates continuously. The stroke used for the realization is peculiar and together with the absence of aliasing it makes the whole environment ~soft~ and clean; the light sources follow this philosophy and contribute to creating a ~courtly~ atmosphere accompanied by that sense of solitude which represents one of the fundamental cornerstones of the title. Playstation 3 trophies Journey offers 14 trophies related to the discovery of the secrets present within the game, to the cave paintings and to the interaction with other online players. Few but good nonetheless, certainly a good incentive to replay the title to appreciate all its facets. The gameplay at the service of the experience To give a single specific example, a section that we really liked saw us face a crossing on the sand guided by the wind and by our cloth mates (pass us the term): at a certain point, at sunset, we crossed a building with open arches crossed by the sun's rays, for a result that as an impact (we repeat impact, we are not interested here in making disquisitions of a purely technical nature) did not disfigure those seenti in a random title: Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. In Journey therefore, if you still haven't understood it, the gameplay is at the service of the visual and emotional experience, as mentioned, there are environmental puzzles or other sections where, for example, you have to take shelter to avoid gusts of wind or some blows (not we tell you launched by what or who), the level of challenge, however, is never punitive and it is all aimed at continuing through the various sections and towards the final goal. The title of thatgamecompany also has an online configuration, if we want conceptually similar to Demon's Soul and its sequel: the game is in fact (if you want) always connected to the network and it may happen that you meet, one at a time, other players. No interaction is allowed (apart from the call), other than to decide autonomously to continue the adventure together, exploring and solving the environmental puzzles, or to continue on one's own path after this brief encounter. It happened to us in various situations to meet someone and the result was certainly positive, especially during the first trip as we discovered unpublished things and wondered who the other player was and what he wanted to do. However, since we are inside a video game site, we need to go down to Earth for a moment because, unfortunately, all that glitters is not gold. Our first journey with Journey ended in just over two hours, a really short duration also in relation to its price, above all because we felt ~stuck~ at the most beautiful moment. Two hours and go beautiful, exciting, entrancing and different from the usual, but still two hours, and even if the title is replayable to relive them again or perfect the exploration, it is undeniable that the magic of the ~first time~ is no longer repeated.", "date": "2012-03-01", "grade": "9.0"}
