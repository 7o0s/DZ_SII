{"name": "City of Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/city-of-heroes-2.html", "text": "The super technique From a purely technical point of view, even several months after its first release, CoH still presents itself in a decidedly dignified way. The graphic aspect appears quite accurate, just as the game animations are always varied and very fluid. From the moment you create the hero you're going to play once you set foot on the sidewalks of Paragon City, you'll be able to appreciate the great level of customization and flexibility offered by the game engine. The graphic feeling is very spot on, with the right mix between ~cartoonish~ and ~probable~ which gives the title a characterization as personal as it is fascinating. Even on a no longer latest generation system, we were able to play at a high level of detail without ever seeing any worthy slowdowns. As far as the performance of the Net-Code is concerned, apart from some sporadic cases, CoH has always proved to be up to the task. Even on overseas servers. Group photo: Heroes greet you. Wave hello On the sound side, the music always adapts very well to the circumstances of the game and changes, as has become tradition, both according to the ~neighborhood~ in which we find ourselves and according to the action we are undertaking. In short, technically the game has good credentials, at least in the context of this kind of title. Now, however, we have to move on to the heart of CoH and, we regret to say it, we anticipate that the situation seems decidedly less rosy to us. At least for the most experienced MMORPG players. Plug&Play? After installing the game, as a sad tradition of this genre of games, we move on to updates. Depending on the version in your possession and the purchase period, the waiting time can also be long, very long. In the meantime, prepare your credit card on your desk, because once you have registered your account, as is now customary, you will NOT have any right to access the game servers until you have provided your credit card details . Only after this operation, you will finally have access to the first free trial month. Spawn of a hero After not even a whit of presentation (perhaps Blizzard has accustomed us too well) and then having entered our username and password set during installation, we can finally enter the character creation screen. This section is almost a game within a game. There are so many and such are the customization possibilities - physical and otherwise - that, in addition to taking away a lot of time, even walking through the streets of the city of heroes it will be really difficult to find other characters that are the same or at least even vaguely similar to ours. Here, perhaps someone will have the opportunity to complain about the absence of any cloak. Do not despair: once you reach the 20th level you will have the right to this very special Status Symbol, moreover, always advancing in level, during the game you will be able to find very personal ~stylists of the heroes~ (~The incredibles~ have already made school it seems) that in exchange for some service they will be able to change your external appearance. But a superhero, however beautiful, extravagant or, to say the least, repugnant, goes far beyond his physical appearance. Very soon therefore, before choosing the color of our heroine's latex onesie, we will be called to decide its origins and the type of archetype. Going into more detail, we will have to choose our origins from the following. Mutant: our parents took a bath in the atoll in Polynesia or had lunch in Chernobyl on April 26, 1986. In short, our DNA is quite messed up and this has given us particular powers. Scientific: this time it was us who took a bath with heavy water. Technological: some of our limbs and/or organs have been replaced with the best technology can offer. Natural: our powers don't have a mysterious origin, we were just born that way. Truly privileged. Magic: courage a little intuition... The archetype turns out to be even more significant for the purposes of the style of play that we will follow during our honest adventures. We could decide to be a Blaster: as ruthless from range as painful in melee. It adapts well to solo adventures, provided you manage not to get too close to our enemies. The Controller is instead a super hero able to take possession of weak minds. At higher levels it can easily lead any foe to reckless actions. If you want to interpret what in classic fantasy games is represented by the cleric on duty, then the Defender is for you yet simply calling him a nurse could be an understatement. If you are passionate about martial arts, the Scrapper could be for you: extremely skilled in hand-to-hand combat, he is the Bruce Lee of the situation. If you don't like to socialize too much, or just don't have the time, then this is the kind of hero for you. We conclude with the Tanker which, as the name can easily guess even to the less English-speaking, can be summed up in a single word: Pungi Ball. Very useful to throw into the fray while a couple of blasters target from a distance, they have excellent defense qualities, leaving a little to be desired from the point of view of the actual attack. Spawn of a hero Having decided on the origin and archetype, it will finally be possible to move on to the choice of any initial equipment of weapons and the actual creation of our Alter Ego. As already written, you can literally get lost in the myriad of customization possibilities: height, build, face, clothes, glasses, bandages, tattoos and anything else that will make your hero literally unique. Once your genesis is finished, you will finally be ready to enter the city section used for the complete and very useful game tutorial. The combat mode will immediately catch your eye: with the left mouse button it is possible to select a target, select the unfortunate one to eradicate from the face of the earth, and let's move on to action! At the bottom right you will find the Power Tray containing dots. These indicate the possible actions available to your character. Also in this section there are also the selectable attacks. Each attack gesture can be undertaken by pressing the number key associated with it. The bar, as well as much of the excellent game interface is completely (re)configurable. Discworld Any narrative outline in CoH is practically absent or at least too simplistic, despite the timid attempt to hint at a plot, on the occasion of the various dynamically generated quests, everything appears rather dull and flat. And the recent introduction into the game world of the attempted invasion by a self-styled and cruel alien race (?) is of little use. Don't try to stop the hordes of heroes scurrying through the streets, they won't respond Discworld In CoH all the characters are necessarily good-natured, after all speaking of a super hero it could not be otherwise. Furthermore, the background of each of these on balance is irrelevant for the purposes of the game. Unlike what happens in the ~reality~ of the comics, the heroes of Paragon City do not have a corresponding alter ego. Sin. Because - as Tarantino teaches us - if for every Superman there is a shy Clark Kent, and behind every Spiderman there is a clumsy Peter Parker, in CoH we will always and only know the same and monotonous side of the coin. For purely practical purposes, this means that the game does not include any type of skill not attributable to combat, after all, in the city of heroes nobody needs to work, but only to get involved. In the same way there is not even a hint of game economy: super heroes do not need to buy anything, at most they will be equipped completely automatically with some particular weapon or contraption useful for completing some game mission. The only exception, the different medals that will be awarded on the occasion of certain valiant actions such as the killing of a particularly powerful enemy or the exploration of a certain area of the city. Collecting a certain type of medals could be a new game stimulus for someone. One of the latest free additions to the game is the Fighting Arena. Within these arenas, players will finally be able to see a first hint of PvP gameplay (Player vs Player), giving life to a series of duels that are purely for their own sake, but at least capable of adding some spice to the game. After all, where there is PvP, or in any case competition against another human being, there is generally more fun: always fighting against NPCs (Non-Playing Characters) can become tedious and limiting in the long run. To renew once again the spirit of the game, with experiences very similar to the famous wars between kingdoms introduced at the time by Dark Age of Camelot and then followed by other titles such as the announced Best Seller World of Warcraft, we look forward to the forthcoming City Of Villans , evil counterpart of CoH, where instead of being spotless heroes we will finally be able to embody even the most classic of the anti-hero. The two titles will in fact be completely interoperable with each other. And the game world? Wide, very wide. Enoughto think that there is an elevated monorail to access the different areas of the city. The different districts, although not very large, guarantee a certain level of variety of setting. There is also city traffic, as well as a certain number of passers-by who, sadly, continually put their lives at risk. The exceptional feat is being normal Don't try to stop the hordes of heroes scurrying through the streets, they won't respond to chat anyway. The reasons are two. One: too complicated and boring to write for the majority. Two: the heroes often run very fast, the luckier ones fly... and nobody wastes time reading what you write. What the hell! You will therefore have to be patient and try to find an available person. In fact, if you find someone of a high level, through the sidekick you can try your hand as a couple. Just like Batman and Robin: the latter is not powerful enough on his own, but place him next to his mentor and surprises will not be lacking! And that's exactly how it works. The sidekick can raise the rookie's level and make him fight as a much more dangerous hero. Maybe it will be difficult to join a super hero right away, but don't despair. Start by saving the citizens from the criminals and slowly you will find your mentor to pair up with! The sidekick is however only an addition to group play. Only after the tenth level will it be possible to create or join the so-called ~supergroups~, which are nothing more than normal guilds called in different ways. Always to meet the so-called ~casual players~, initially the death of the hero does not involve absolutely any penalty, only after the twentieth level does death become something really annoying. The game then offers different methods to create groups of heroes on the fly (excuse the pun), joining other characters quickly and directly in search of immediate and fast fun. but the combination of Enhancement and Inspiration, together with the character archetype, gives rise to a flood of possible playstyles The exceptional feat is being normal The plot is essentially woven on the multiple quests automatically generated by the game. The quests are based on your level of play. The more you level up, the more complicated the adventures get. An adventure in which you will find yourself trying your hand at the beginning is the ~disinfestation~ of particular areas. In our experience, for example, we found ourselves freeing the sewers from the undead (a flashback!!). Whenever you undertake missions you will find all the key information in the navigation bar. The place where you will have to go is always marked by a prominent arrow: ~you have to fight... move!~ Some quests lead to other chained ones, giving life to a real campaign. Be careful though, some missions are timed. Don't take any if you intend to disconnect soon. Under penalty of losing Influence points. Influence points are those that will allow you to buy Inspiration or Enhancements. Inspirations are used to improve the characteristics of your Hero. These are for consumption. There are various types. There are those that can restore hit points, increase your defensive capacity, your damage, your accuracy and resistance. However, these effects are temporary. Each Inspiration is divided into three levels. The higher the Inspiration level, the better the boosts will be. Ehnancements are real advancements: it is possible to find improvements for attacks, reload time, speed in restoring Hit Points during rest and so on. In practice, there is no characteristic of yours that you cannot increase with the application of an Enhancement. As you level up, you will have the ability to increase the slots for applying these upgrades. Furthermore, each of these is characterized by a level indicated by a numerical value. There are essentially three levels: fifth, tenth and fifteenth. But don't despair, you can combine them with others of the same type, obtaining bonuses that can be found with ~+~ or ~++~ applied next to the number. Enhancements and Inspirations can also be earned as well as purchased. Every time you get a victory over an enemy, or a group, you will be granted a random one. Trivial to say, but the combination of Enhancement and Inspiration, together with the archetype of the character, gives life to a flood of possible styles of play. This, if on the one hand it greatly favors team play, encouraging the combination of different heroes all characterized by certain strengths, on the other it also allows", "date": "2005-04-21", "grade": null}
