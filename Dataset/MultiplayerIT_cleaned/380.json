{"name": "Hitman: Blood Money", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hitman-blood-money.html", "text": "poster Ave Maria... The main menu opens with Schubert's Ave Maria, in a melancholy version that is perfectly suited to the game. Note on the audio sector, which as a tradition enjoys various exceptional audio tracks, by the now expert Jesper Kyd, composer of the music for the whole series. This time the artist offers us the best soundtrack of the saga, with some truly exceptional pieces. The sound does its job very well, especially if you rely on Creative's EAX libraries and a good 5.1 system. Unfortunately it should be noted that the Italian dubbing is very subdued compared to the original, with some absolutely ridiculous voices and that of 47 changing for the umpteenth time (still remaining inferior to the English dubber). Some gross errors also in the written texts, but all in all in the norm. For 47 to give death is; his life Goodbye Santa Sucker! Ave Maria... Multiplayer... Once again there is no multiplayer component, which is not missed much, given the good longevity. Certainly challenging other ~professionals~ in a competition of crimes could prove interesting, but for this we will have to wait for the next episode (perhaps...). Cross-platform Hitman 4 does not present particular differences between the different versions: a praise to the one for play2, fairly fluid and able to run the same dozens of characters on the screen without too many problems. The one for Xbox obviously appears cleaner while the PC and 360 versions are the best. The latter could have been more optimized, but benefits from high definition. Killing me softly... Blood Money is the fourth installment in the saga of the perfect killer, Agent 47, ruthless assassin for hire born and ~designed~ with the sole purpose of killing. Needless to tell the controversy that unleashed at the time, and the consequent success of sales and proliferation of sequels. After the previous game which turned out to be a half-fiasco, Eidos offers us a brand new system, in which we return to the glories of the stealth genre. And this new title is taken literally: the most striking novelty is the notoriety system, which changes the difficulty of the game depending on how many mistakes we make. Basically every time a murder or, worse, a massacre is committed, the police will investigate. It is essential not to leave witnesses and carry out indiscriminate massacres, otherwise the level of suspicion will increase in subsequent missions. At each completion you will be able to read the newspaper articles in which we will talk about our ~work~ (with detailed explanations of the facts) and if we have left more or less traces: this gives a new dimension to the concept of action, as our choices will determine the increase in skill of the AI. On this it must be said that it behaves quite well, even if sometimes there are gross drops in tone. In fact, it may happen that the killing of a guard does not give the slightest suspicion to the companion who was next to him, or vice versa in some cases one is discovered without knowing why. Overall, the level of challenge remains high, and continues for about fifteen interesting missions. This time then we will be able to give free rein to our macabre imagination; in addition to the classic firearms (present in industrial quantities), we find a lot of objects to eliminate enemies: ranging from trigger bombs, through knives (they can also be thrown!), rockers, clubs, syringes, and the icing on the pie, the ability to perform some melee moves! Of course, there are the usual dozens of disguises, some really crazy! the most striking novelty is the notoriety system, which changes the difficulty of the game depending on how many mistakes we make. This sucker is; dirty! The important thing is; to clean! GLACIER ENGINE Another peculiar feature of this Hitman 4 is the brand new graphics engine: we can't properly define it as next-generation but it is certainly current. The ~Glacier~ manages to move dozens of characters on the screen, performing well even on mid-range machines, without having to sacrifice too many details. Everything is seasoned with some of the latest graphics: HDR and pixel shaders are the masters, both indoors and outdoors. There is a good variety of these, ranging from Las Vegas to New Orleans, passing through abandoned forests and amusement parks. The level design looks sublime, with maps that allow different ways to reach the goal. In addition, numerous hiding places have been added, from the classic wardrobe in which to lock oneself, to the chests where to hide the corpses. However, the mass presence of civilians has a price: we note a cNPCs sharp angularity, sometimes a bit too boxy. 47 instead appears well modeled, even if it may seem ~polygonally~ slightly higher than its previous incarnations. Finally, new moves have been added, which make him more agile and more ~professional~. All of this is offered to us with a good variety of animations. A note of merit also to the excellent interlude films: a mixture of computer graphics and polygonal elements, which go well with the stylistic choices of the title. 47 is came back more icy than ever! The amount of of people on screen is the number of people on screen. impressive Comment Hitman: Blood Money brings a breath of fresh air to the stealth genre. And it does so by giving us a series of intelligent and well-studied missions that also offer the replayability factor, given the great variety of environments and situations. Everything comes with a respectable graphic and sound package, which, despite not being exactly next-generation, can be pleasantly admired. The character is always spot on and has a macabre humor that plays down the most violent situations. The notoriety system works great and, beyond a few bugs, always offers a challenge that is up to par. A game that lovers of shooters can avoid, while those who enjoyed Metal Gear and Spinter Cell can get it with their eyes closed! Pros Graphically decent Great game variety Longevity guaranteed Cons Single game only Some bugs in the AI Poor Italian voice acting 47 in Hollywood... There has been talk of a film adaptation of Hitman for some time, and this time it seems that we are here: the clothes of the bald assassin will be dressed by the charismatic Vin Diesel, who with his latest films has shown that he is not only a muscular actor born for action movies. The reviews of the screenplay are already promising, and it is certain that the .47 of the film will use the classic ~choke~ rope and the legendary .45 Hardballer! Let's hope for an interpretation that doesn't distort the character of Hitman, an inscrutable killer with cold eyes (and heart)!
