{"name": "Beach Spikers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beach-spikers-2.html", "text": "How to play Beach Spikers Playing Beach Spikers is very simple, just use 2 keys on the pad and the analog stick to be able to perform all the useful moves: serve, receive, lift, dribble, block and dunk. During the serve and the dunk, a power indicator will appear on the screen which, based on our timing, indicates the power of the shot. The indicator is very reminiscent of the one already seen in the Virtua Tennis series and, if for the serve it is only a question of pressing the key at the right time with a little luck but without haste, in the dunking phase things get slightly complicated, given that we will have very little time available to be able to strike at maximum power. The shot can then be directed with the left analog stick. On the other hand, during the reception phase, a red circular indicator appears on the sand to signal the exact point where the ball will fall. The closer we are to the circle, the more precise our passage will be. The A key is obviously the main one that we will use most often to receive and to dunk, the B key instead is assigned the ~softer~ functions, i.e. the slower serve to take fewer risks and the fake lob under the net. The combination of the two keys (which is also obtained by simply pressing the X key) can instead be used to carry out deadly two-man attacks, or in the receiving phase, instead of performing three touches, our girls will attempt a quick dunk to surprise their opponents . Everything is learned in a short time and after the first few games, in which we will inevitably make our volleyball players look bad, you will already have good confidence with the control system. Mode From the initial menu you can access different modes. Despite the great ease with which you become familiar with the commands, it is advisable to start immediately from the ~Tutorial~ mode, which will help us understand the mechanisms and rules of the game. Once we have learned the skills of our athletes we can choose 3 different game modes, Arcade, VS Mode and World Tour. By selecting the Arcade Mode, we will have to choose a couple of girls from the 16 available, all of different nationalities, to then challenge the CPU in a series of knockout matches during which we will have control of both chosen girls. In practice, the CPU automatically assigns us control of the player closest to the ball and then passes the commands to the other. That said, there's not much more to add on the Arcade mode, which is basically the same as the bar version. Instead, a very different and broader discussion can be made for the multiplayer and World Tour modes. The latter is the main novelty of the home version of the game. Once the mode has been selected, we will enter a sort of edit mode in which we can create our 2 athletes by choosing the name, the nationality, change the cut and color of the hair, the color of the skin, the degree of tanning, equip them with sunglasses and choose from a huge range of bikinis. The main feature of the World Tour, which will take us around the world to participate in different tournaments, is that we will have control of only one player, while our teammate will be totally managed by the CPU. Initially, the girl is really poor and will lead us to badly lose the first matches, this is because her values such as serve, dribble, reception, attack and so on are at a minimum, i.e. zero out of a maximum of 20. It will be up to us to make go up these values, in fact after each game, we will be assigned points to distribute to our partner, which will be greater in case of victory. After just a few games, her skills will increase dramatically, until she becomes a true champion at the end of the 8 World Tour tournaments. Once the first round is over, you can start over from the beginning. Unfortunately, the World Tour is all here and those who expected a mode full of options and which marked a clear difference between the room version and the home one will inevitably be disappointed. Multiplayer what a passion! At this point the applause can start for what is certainly one of the best multiplayer modes for a sports game. Beach Spikers played with friends is practically infinite and in 4 it is the classic game that will keep you glued for hours screaming in front of the TV like children. So if you don't have them yet, equip yourself with three more joypads and invite at least 3 friends home to spend hours and hours of pure fun. THEVS Mode gives you the ability to play up to 4 players simultaneously, each of which is assigned the command of a girl. So we organize ourselves into teams of 2 and I let you imagine the shouts and curses that can come out against your teammates or opponents in case of a mistake or a point in favor. For the hard to please, AM2 has also included some mini-games: the first involves challenging 3 players in the race for the flag. Quickly pressing the A key will make our girl run, obviously the fastest one wins. The second minigame is instead a normal game of beach volleyball where, however, the ball is replaced by a kind of time bomb; a sort of timer marks the time until the explosion and it will be good to get rid of the bomb quickly and deliver it to the opponent before the bang. The third and last minigame is instead a sort of penalty shootout in a beach volleyball version; we will have to alternate with the computer or with a friend in making dunks, if the opponent manages to hit the ball the penalty has failed. Technically speaking Graphically, Beach Spikers is the best you could wish for. The settings are really well done, as is the realization of the crowded grandstands with a totally animated audience. The sand is made of fully deformable polygons as the player passes by and it's great to see the mark left by a girl after taking a dip. The final effect therefore, in addition to being extremely realistic, is also very suggestive. The girls are beautiful: made with a large amount of polygons, they are animated perfectly and it is jaw-dropping to watch the hair move according to the movements with truly incredible realism. Also noteworthy are the shadows that are reflected on the uneven sand. All of this, as if that weren't enough, runs with an always constant fluidity. The sound department, on the other hand, does not stand out too much: the music will not remain impressed, while the voice of the commentator, also present among the various passages in the menus, you will hate it after a few minutes of play. For the rest, the screams of the girls during a game and the sound of the blows are quite well made. Some problems, on the other hand, can be generated by the game view, which is unique and cannot be changed. In practice, the camera moves continuously from the shoulders of the players to a horizontal position based on the game action: from behind when hitting or crushing, horizontal during the other sequences. The effect, despite being very nice to see, can create a lot of confusion, especially initially and in some cases it becomes difficult to get in the right spot, especially when there is an enemy attack to block. Conclusions Beach Spikers is a deeply arcade title and for this reason it is very simple, immediate and fun. In single mode, perhaps it does not completely hit the target, resulting in a shallow one, but the World Tour mode can still guarantee a fair number of hours of play. There is no doubt that it is a title strongly devoted to multiplayer, a mode in which it is practically infinite. Impeccable technical realization and essentially identical to the arcade version, pity for some problems due to the management of the camera, which is not always precise. Otherwise the game is very fun and the purchase is undoubtedly recommended. Pros: Stunning graphics. Great multiplayer. Simple and fun gameplay. Cons: Poor camera. Underdeveloped world tour Here comes Beach Volleyball Enough with these muscular men who run like mad after a ball, kick it, climb baskets, dress up in armor and helmets giving each other incredible blows and above all enough with these hairy legs! Finally someone has listened to our prayers and brought to the console a sports game featuring charming female athletes, tanned from head to toe and above all in bikinis!! Naturally we are talking about Beach Spikers, a GameCube conversion of the splendid arcade game developed by Sega's internal team, AM2. Jokes aside, beach volleyball is certainly a less followed and practiced discipline than others, but in the videogame field it certainly brings a breath of fresh air being, for now, the only one of its kind. Beach Spikers, in perfect AM2 style and having originally been born as a coin-op, is a purely arcade title, which has only the graphic aspect of a simulation. Just FrFor this reason, the end result is a very easy and immediate game, with a very low learning curve, but which guarantees truly enviable fun and playability.", "date": "2002-10-28", "grade": null}
