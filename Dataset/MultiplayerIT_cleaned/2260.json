{"name": "Carrera Grand Prix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/carrera-grand-prix.html", "text": "Virtual worlds and real games Driving a fighter jet or a Formula One car, crossing fantastic worlds or engaging in a duel in outer space are things normally, if not totally, inaccessible to most of us. Video games, like other means of entertainment, therefore serve to bring us inside these inaccessible ~realities~. The reason for this speech is easy to say: what's the point of making a game that allows us to drive the toy cars on electric tracks? After all, even the latter are an attempt to reproduce a reality. Virtual worlds and real games In practice, a video game on a ~video game~. Well let's find out by reading this review on Carrera Grand Prix. A simple game? ... maybe too much. Technically Carrera Grand Prix is a poor game. No video options, only volumes for audio and you can't customize the controls. The resolution is fixed at 800x600 and the graphics are in elementary 3D. I must say that despite the poverty of the view, the engine clicks every now and then. There are two game modes: Classic and Arcade. In the first you only use the accelerator command, while in the second you can also use the track change command, this mode is completed by the power ups scattered around the track. In Multiplayer we can challenge a human opponent using a split screen, while in Single mode we have the possibility to challenge the CPU in single combat or for the entire duration of a championship. A simple game? ... maybe too much. We have a couple of cars at our disposal and they differ in terms of speed, acceleration and grip. These three parameters are in turn influenced by the gear ratio and the VMS. In practice we choose our car based on the circuit and then on this we find the points where we have to brake. That's all. In the unfortunate event that we end up off the track, we magically reappear in the middle of the track. The rest is to keep the accelerator control button pressed all the time. There is also a fairly simple and easy to use path editor. Perhaps the best thing about the whole game, because it is possible to create, with a couple of clicks, the track of your dreams. That's all? Unfortunately. Carrera Grand Prix is a simple title, suitable for those who want to spend a few hours with an easy and immediate game and ideal for challenging friends in fun and undemanding races. Personally I find that a race on a real electric track is better than a video game and therefore the game, which is advertised by Carrera, a well-known company in the sector, serves precisely to make us want to buy a real electric track. In support of this hypothesis there is also the cost of the game which is very competitive. Who else to recommend the game to? Well I know a well-known virtual racer who might be comfortable with the basic controls of Carrera Grand Prix and that is why perhaps the next game in the series will be called TUZZO Grand Prix. Virtual worlds and real games Classifying video games with a single term is an undertaking that has become impossible due to their unpredictable evolution. In any case, I'm not wrong if I say that video games serve to make a reality that is closed to many usable.", "date": "2002-01-28", "grade": null}
