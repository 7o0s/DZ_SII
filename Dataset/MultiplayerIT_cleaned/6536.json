The latter, as you will remember, was a great success with critics and audiences on Nintendo 3DS, and an extremely interesting product, albeit not without some flaws, in its transposition for PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii U. For its sequel, Capcom has decided to use a particular formula in terms of structure and distribution. Instead of coming out in a single solution, in fact, Resident Evil: Revelations 2 was thought of as a mini-series of four episodes released on a weekly basis at a cost of around 6 euros each. An at least atypical choice by the Japanese developer, who justified it with the desire to imitate the serial schedule of TV series such as The Walking Dead, but also a little risky, given that if the first episodes do not convince the user, the purchases of subsequent ones would drop irreparably. In any case, for the sake of completeness we add that at a later time all the episodes that make up the title will be collected in a single edition distributed both in digital and disc format. In the meantime, we have played the first chapter on PlayStation 4 (and we will do so in the coming weeks), and what you will read in the next few lines is our report. Revelations, the spin-off of Resident Evil, focuses on an episodic structure and the old atmospheres The island of horrors The plot of this episode, divided into two parts, does not shine much for its originality even if, as was logical to expect given the nature of the project, it deliberately leaves many questions open which will inevitably be answered in subsequent episodes. It all begins when the revived Claire Redfield and her colleague Moira Burton, operatives within the organization against bioterrorism Terra Save, are kidnapped at a party by some armed men who take them away and imprison them in a penal colony on a remote island. When Chris Redfield's sister wakes up in a damp cell with a bracelet on her wrists apparently linked to some human initiative/experimentation, which changes color in relation to the moods of the wearer, and the iron door that locks it in opens by itself allowing her to go out and free her friend, for the gamer an adventure begins with a total duration of about two hours or so, depending on the gait of the player and the level of difficulty chosen to tackle the chapter. In the end, however, since you unlock extra options for the main campaign, you can play it all over again in a different way if you want. In any case, without revealing too much of the story, at a certain point in the episode Moira manages to launch an alarm signal complete with satellite coordinates, which are promptly intercepted by her father, who, like all parents, what does he do? He gets angry, takes up his rifle and leaves for the island from where he received the signal. Or so it does if his name is Barry Burton, an old acquaintance as well as a much loved figure by fans of the old Resident Evil. Once landed on the island, the former member of S.T.A.R.S. kicks off the second part of the episode. The man meets a strange girl named Natalia who wanders aimlessly, and obviously decides not to abandon her and therefore take her with him to protect her. After various vicissitudes, the episode, as we mentioned before, ends with the classic twist, one of those that, as in the best tradition of successful TV series, arouse curiosity for the next one, like the previews and questions that players will inevitably begin to ask themselves. After the credits: Who and why kidnapped Claire and Moira? What are the bracelets on their wrists and what are they for? Why doesn't Moira like firearms and seems to resent her father? Who is Natalia and where do her powers come from? Couple games Resident Evil: Revelations 2 is a game focused on the cooperation between the characters, therefore a good part of the gameplay revolves around the alternation of the protagonists (the change of character is rather fast and intuitive, and sometimes happens automatically depending on the situation) or on their interaction, with that of support, if not playing local co-op in split-screen with a friend, which is handled quite well by the CPU. In the latter case, however, much of the effectiveness of the function depends on the protagonist duo. In this sense, the best matched couple seemed to us the one formed by Claire and Moira, with the first skilled with firearms and with a knife,and the second more inclined to find useful objects, but still able to defend itself and make a real contribution even in clashes. Using a flashlight, the same one she uses to highlight the most interesting material to collect, Barry's daughter can blind enemies making them momentarily more vulnerable, or can bring them down with crowbar blows. In fact, the girl is reluctant to use weapons due to a particular event that the user will discover by playing the next episodes. The one instead composed by Barry and Natalia, protagonists of the second act of the first episode, seemed to us at the moment the least complementary. The little girl can smash the skull of a weaker creature or throw bricks to distract them, a bit like Ellie did in The Last of Us, a game which seems to inspire some of the mechanics of the chapter in which she is the protagonist with Barry. It also has a particular power that allows it to perceive the presence of the creatures that inhabit the island, sometimes proving to be useful for discovering a threat before it manifests itself in front of her and the former STARS. to crawl into an opening, or sneak into a small grate to retrieve, for example, some useful object or to unlock a closed door on the other side. But what in some ways are its strength are also its weakness. Natalia is in fact very weak to the attacks of the monsters, who often target her, and since the girl is not very reactive in fleeing, it is often necessary to jump through hoops to save her from certain death, which leads Barry to involuntarily make himself in turn vulnerable to assault, or wasting more lead. Considering that the creatures of the game are not always tops, but they prove to be difficult to eliminate since they still have good attack patterns depending on the type of monster (there are those similar to zombies, slow, and others faster or armed with pipes and objects, more than the bugs and a couple of mini-bosses) or when they are in a group, it can sometimes be quite annoying. The Roots of Fear As for the more general gameplay, the title maintains what are the classic dictates of horror adventures with a third-person view, re-proposing most of the mechanics already seen in other similar productions, past and present. In this sense, perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of this Resident Evil: Revelations 2 is that of apparently wanting to make an effort to maintain a certain conceptual link with the origins of survival horror, without however closing the doors to the modern, updating but not distorting , where possible, the gameplay compared to the predecessor. The need to rationalize the use of weapons, which can be upgraded by collecting special kits and using a bench for modification, and the attention to be paid to one's own health and that of the companions (the life level drops quickly if hit), given that ammunition and medikits are available in not exaggerated quantities, they can only bring to mind the old titles in the series. Ditto the areas to explore, especially inside the prison or in the bush at night, with their gloomy and sometimes distressing atmospheres, where it almost seems to perceive a threat around every corner. Certainly also thanks to the good use of the sound effects, which literally accompany the protagonists in their progress towards their destination with sinister and sudden noises, moans and other surrounding elements, in fact forcing the user to often strain his ears for fear of see some monster pounce on you. On the other hand you break the crates to collect the bullets or the healing herbs, you can do a little crafting with gauze and bottles, you shoot medallions hanging in the most unthinkable places, you earn points to spend at the end of the level to unlock new abilities for the individual character or for the team, and you have a more responsive and modern command set. In some cases the action becomes more lively, but never overly action, and even old Barry often adopts more careful moves, taking enemies from behind and then killing them by thrusting a knife into their heads. Raid mode and technical sector To increase the longevity of the product, and also to offer a diversion from the mechanics of the main campaign, from which it is completely unrelated, there is the Raid mode. Characterized by fast and frenetic rhythms, each of the missions to be faced are able to engage players for hours, provided they are obviously fans of scores, unlockables and statistics. In each episode, in fact, the mode gives access to a certain number of raids (here there are about fifty), each of which can be faced with one of the available characters, alone or in company via the local cooperative option. In each stage the user has to make a certain score by killing as many enemies and completing some secondary objectives, to get the best possible result, to unlock the next areas or the exit. Some levels are in fact structured in stages, so you have to move and move to reach the end of an area, while others are designed only for the slaughter of enemies until ~the end word appears~. At the end of each mission the player is rewarded with costumes to unlock and coins to spend to buy new weapons, upgrades or skills to be exploited on the next round, to get even higher scores than the previous ones and get your hands on other prizes. Closed the large parenthesis dedicated to the part played, let's analyze the technological one. From this point of view it must be said that the title shows its cross-gen nature, and therefore does not offer real qualitative peaks from an aesthetic point of view. While on the one hand the production offers 1080p graphics, well-characterized polygonal models of the protagonists and some particularly evocative locations from the point of view of the atmosphere, on the other it lends itself to a certain poverty of detail in the textures that cover the characters , environments and creatures (although the latter present at least a fair variety in design and behavior), poor implementation of particle and volumetric effects, and ~strange~ frame rate drops in some rare moments. Strange because, as mentioned, the graphics of the game are certainly not the non plus ultra of this generation. On the other hand, the speech is different as regards the sound part. Here, in addition to the good dubbing in Italian (swear words included), as we mentioned elsewhere in our article, the audio effects stand out such as the gurgling of the monsters, the noises of the metal that writhes due to rust and degradation, the ambient sounds and the soundtrack that accompanies the various phases of the adventure like in a horror film, emphasizing at the right moment the more agitated phases compared to the apparently quieter ones.", "date": "2015-02-26", "grade": "7.3"}
