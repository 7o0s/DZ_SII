{"name": "WWE 2K19", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-2k19-recensione.html", "text": "WWE 2K19 is the latest episode of a controversial franchise, which unfortunately has been dragging on for several years without introducing substantial innovations, giving users the feeling of being faced with mere updates of a formula that today appears particularly tired and weighed down. There is no doubt that the guys at Yuke's, who have been dealing with the series for almost twenty years now, are moved by a great passion for the world of wrestling and its facets, literally obsessed with representing as realistically as possible the features and movements of an increasing number of wrestlers, as well as by providing players with as many options as possible to shape the experience differently according to tastes and needs. The problem lies in the fulcrum of the gameplay, in the stubbornness of pursuing a simulation approach that is less and less attractive to our eyes, linked to slow and woody mechanisms that have little to do with the idea of a dynamic and spectacular show, born to entertain and excite the audience. How does the new edition try to shake off this heavy legacy? And what does it actually do to enrich a structure that had also recently lost its most representative contents? Let's find out together. Mode The first impact with WWE 2K19 is positive: the developers have redesigned the menu interface, using modern and captivating solutions, capable of literally filling the screen. The only thing we didn't like was the scrolling list for character selection - the game boasts a huge roster and it's a pain to have to go through all the names time and time again to get to the one we want to select . In short, the old board worked much better from this point of view. Speaking of rosters, relegating two major superstars such as Ronda Rousey and Rey Mysterio to preorder bonuses unfortunately represents a questionable choice for anyone who decides to buy the title after launch, with all the calm that such a full October requires. However, let's continue with the positive aspects, because on the content front there is no shortage. In fact, the Showcase mode has been reintroduced, the story mode that in this episode will see us retrace the tormented career of Daniel Bryan: an atypical superstar, who had to face a thousand obstacles and gain experience in the indies before being able to prove his worth in the WWE , up to conquering the world title, having to retire following an injury and finally returning in recent times with the approval of the doctors. Accompanied by Bryan's commentary, often irreverent towards certain situations, we will have to grapple with his most important matches and therefore follow the not always positive trend of what presents itself as a real epic. The only problem, which is not insignificant, is that to overcome the various stages you must not simply win the matches, but complete a series of specific objectives that tend to repeat themselves (~damage the opponent~, ~perform a headlock~ , ~perform a frontal hit~, etc.) and that really leave a big bad taste in the mouth: if the developers had made these actions optional, as an extra to get more credits, it would have been infinitely better. Sin. Career mode has undergone an interesting narrative overhaul: instead of starting from the usual center of Orlando, we will find ourselves playing the role of a penniless wrestler, who lives in an old van and fights in front of a few people for a federation on the verge of bankruptcy . One day, however, he manages to get an audition for a developmental contract with WWE, and he will have to do his best to win the trust of Triple H and the company. The story is interesting, the dialogues manage to involve and there is a spartan growth system triggered by the experience points earned on the field. This turns a blind eye to the decidedly old-gen creation of many assets, but unfortunately here too the mandatory objectives have been included which leave little freedom of action during the matches and indeed force you to take quite a few risks in an attempt to put to hit this or that specific manoeuvre. Finally, the brand new Towers mode has been added, with a series of thematic mini-campaigns of increasing difficulty, and the entire package can now count on an Italian localization of the texts (it is no coincidence that the Showcase has become ~Presentation~ ...). Naturally, the traditional contents of the series are not lacking: a very complete editor for creating characters, moves, entrances and so on (also with the possibility of sharing one's creations with thecommunity and download custom superstars), Universe mode, local or online multiplayer (complete with a league and special events) and any type of match for exhibitions: from one-on-one matches to the Royal Rumble, passing through infinite variations with different rules, including a new version of Hell in a Cell. The game includes the well-established system of credits which are earned by winning matches and which can be used to unlock past stars such as Ultimate Warrior, Mr. Perfect, ~Macho Man~ Randy Savage, Big Boss Man, Lex Luger, The Rock, Bret ~Hitman~ Hart, Goldberg and several others. There are also prize chests with extra customizations for use with the editor, unlockable in-game or purchasable for real money. Gameplay The element that makes the WWE 2K19 experience controversial, as mentioned at the beginning, undoubtedly remains the simulation vocation of the franchise, which clearly distances itself from the arcade approach which also made some classics of the past unforgettable. In a nutshell, this translates into an experience completely based on the timing of the reversals: when they fail, executed too early or too late, you find yourself glued to the mat for a long time waiting for the opponent to make a reversal. another move, maybe a pin that condemns us to an undeserved defeat. The assignment of such an important and delicate maneuver to the triggers is another aspect that we have never understood and which is proposed again in the new episode, together with some important innovations concerning the size and organization of the controls. The feeling of frustrating helplessness that the series notoriously produces when you find yourself controlling an athlete, perhaps a highflyer, who however moves like a tank and requires complicated key combinations to perform even trivial actions, has fortunately been smoothed out in his sharper edges. While moving in the wake of the previous chapters, the new system therefore turns out to be simpler and more immediate, especially in contextual actions, while maintaining the same amount of moves and attacks that can be launched during a match. Let's be clear: the road is still very long and it is difficult to define WWE 2K19 as a fun title even for users who do not appreciate its simulation vein, but at least some steps have been taken in the right direction. Speaking of progress, one can only appreciate the introduction of paybacks: these are special skills that allow you to get an energy boost, an extra finisher, instant recovery or even perform a painful low blow against your opponent, hoping that at that moment the referee is not looking. Each wrestler has two specific paybacks, which however can be edited before the match and which are loaded by fighting, giving us the possibility to immediately exploit the less effective of the two or to hold on and be patient to use the more powerful skill and overturn the fate of the encounter: an interesting tactical element, which undoubtedly adds something to the experience. Playstation 4 trophies The forty-seven WWE 2K19 Trophies can be obtained by using all Payback skills, performing spectacular actions during certain matches (breaking the cage roof in Hell in a Cell, collecting the Money in the Bank), completing all Career chapters and other single player mode. Graphics and sound WWE 2K19 continues to make great progress on the technical realization front, with almost all efforts concentrated on making the greatest number of superstars on the roster as realistic as possible. Also in this edition some exceptions stand out: if on the one hand the most famous wrestlers seem to come directly from an episode of Raw or Smackdown, on the other there are also quite sensational examples of characters created in a more hasty and superficial way, using in all probability the same editor that the authors make available to users for their creations. In any case, we are talking about the episode with the highest number of ~premium athletes~ seen so far, and considering the total number of usable wrestlers, it is no small matter. The audience has also improved, and now at least it doesn't move as a single entity, and the scenarios for matches that take place backstage or outside have been expanded. It is almost superfluous to talk about the entrances: it is one of the most cared for aspects of the series by far, and in this edition it is also possible to appreciate an improvement in the effects, see for example the ~puffs~ of Triple H or the smoke in general. As for the sound sector, the aforementioned public appears to be quite involved and there are environments recreated invery faithful way, such as the NXT arena with its limited spectators and the frequent ~silence~ between one action and another in the ring. The commentary by the team chaired by Michael Cole was not particularly brilliant, with only a few new sentences and a certain inability to excite.", "date": "2018-10-09", "grade": "7.5"}
