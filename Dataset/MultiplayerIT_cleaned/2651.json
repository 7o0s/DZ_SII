{"name": "AeroWings2: Air Strike", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/aerowings2-air-strike.html", "text": "The basics of the experienced Tom Cruise! The first thing we are asked, after seeing the usual presentation in fmv without infamy and without praise, is to choose between 2 different game styles, a ~lighter~ one (with fewer parameters and functions to keep an eye on) and one for the true fanatic of simulations, it being understood that even in the first case things will be far from easy; let's start by saying, for those unfamiliar with the prequel, that the complexity is certainly not that of a PC aircraft simulator, both because a joypad does not allow what a joystick with force feedback or the winning keyboard-mouse combination can do and above all the public to which it is addressed is decidedly different. However, we are very far from the Ace Combat saga, just to name the top on the subject on consoles. As in the first episode, you'll have to start with the basics: learn to take off, turn 180 degrees while maintaining the same height throughout the maneuver, loop the loop, land and many various little things that, as already happened in the prequel, you'll also have to do in training! As you continue, you will also have to deal with increasingly sophisticated means, but luckily the well-trained instructor who will take care of the briefings before each single test will never leave you alone, thanks also to his excellent (and also very fussy ) debriefing! It should be emphasized that at the end of each test you will have an evaluation out of 100 and only with a minimum score of 60/100 will you be allowed to continue with the increasingly difficult tests! Obviously nothing prevents you from redoing the same test several times to get to the perfect score of 100/100, greatly increasing longevity (and sometimes even frustration). The commands available vary depending on which style of play you choose at the beginning of each game, obviously at the highest difficulty level, in addition to always keeping an eye on important factors such as altitude and G-factor, you will also have to worry, other, to remove the wheels from your aircraft before landing! This time it's pain! Listen to the criticisms for the lack of some healthy blasting (or more likely after seeing the sales figures) here comes the panacea for all those who also wanted to launch a few missiles here and there in the form of the Tactical Challenges mode! In fact, in addition to the 30 training missions (which are unlocked one at a time, so you won't be able to see new ones if you don't complete the previous ones!), the training mode (which I advise anyone to try for a while, just to have a better familiarity with the game) and the free flight option (borrowed from the prequel), you will have 15 missions in which you will have to, as per the script, carry out the tasks that will be assigned to you and obviously there will be many enemy vehicles between you and the completion of the assigned mission ! Take my breath awaaaaay! Aero Dancing featured impeccably crafted aircraft, an unrivaled smoothness anchored at 30 fps (in the NTSC version, of course), a feeling of flying that only the underrated Nights for Saturn (made by Sonic Team!!) could deliver. Obviously, after all this time, great things were expected from the second release of the saga something must have gone wrong from this point of view or perhaps the suffix F had been prominently displayed on the Japanese package to indicate a mere upgrade and not a sequel to the Cri title, given that graphically it is almost identical to the previous one!! The graphics engine is certainly the same as well as some aeromezzi and to feed my previous doubts, unless I'm crazy (er..), we also have portions of the soundtrack and some digitized voices taken verbatim from the progenitor! Now, if all this indicated a very smooth game (60 fps, like most of the latest 128 bit Sega releases), with houses, buildings, airstrips detailed as it should be, I would also have been happy but, it pains me to say (alas), 30 fps and well-detailed planes are no longer enough in the new millennium if almost all the rest of the creation, good at the time, is poised between mediocrity and sufficiency! Surely it is a unique experience to do a high-altitude loop-the-loop ranging from the different views available to us. It is incredibly gratifying to rotate on yourself while maintaining altitude in formation with our coach but it is not enough to make AeroWing2: Air Strike go to the Olympus of killer applications. Speaking of the audio side we have a mix of beautiful music, really galvanizing and some quite insipid, a decent digitized speech and efsound effects fully in the norm of this kind of productions. Conclusions AeroWings2 is really a wasted opportunity: first of all, the owners of the first episode will hardly spend a hundred to redo the same training missions, to review the same graphics, hear the same sound again in exchange for about fifteen missions from real total war! It is also true that those who bought AeroWings at the time either loved the game precisely for its spectacular (and peaceful) vein or were disappointed precisely by the atypical setting of the Cri title. Who then would you recommend AeroWings2 to? To those who don't have the first episode of the series or to those who have managed to sell it to be able to grab this sequel, to those who love Top Gun madly and to those who are looking for something (really) different from the usual and are ready to turn a blind eye to a graphic and a sound not in line with the latest releases for this wonderful and unfortunate console. [photo taken from www.ignition.com] Let's go back in time In the first months of 1999, 4-5 months after the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast, Aero Dancing, developed by Cri, was placed on the market. The game in question, of very good workmanship, was not an emulator of Ace Combat, the well-known ~top gunnian~ trilogy (could I have invented this new terminology?) by Namco, due to the completely different (and peaceful) setting of the game ; this is not about devastating bases, planes and tanks; no sir, but starting from the basics of air flight, learning to take off, do loops, twists and turns up to doing all these nice little things even in formation! To top it all off there was an excellent graphic design, the replay option (a great Vms devourer!!!) and the possibility of playing with 3 other friends (needless to say that you really could see all sorts of in which only one member of the team was a wimp!). Aero Dancing, brought to the West under the name of AeroWings, remained a niche title, both for those who preferred the war approach of this genre of games, and for the excessive difficulty of some tests to be supported, but the minority (including me annovero) loved the superb technical realization, the beautifully reproduced flight sensation and, after much practice and many disasters, the multiplayer mode! Some time ago the sequel was released in Japan, Aero Dancing F, renamed in the USA AeroWings 2 and ready, thanks to Ubisoft, to arrive here in the land of pasta!", "date": "2001-01-10", "grade": null}
