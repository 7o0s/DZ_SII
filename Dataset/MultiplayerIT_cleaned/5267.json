Those who choose to jump into this world usually do so because of an immoderate passion for the medium, yet even the most patient and enthusiastic developers are forced to live with awareness that is difficult to circumvent, such as the almost absolute certainty that many of the original ideas behind a project will be cut now of its conclusion, or the practical need to limit one's ambitions to ensure the release of a more stable product (or even just closer to the fashions of the moment). The fact that many developers tend to ~hold back~ during development is especially true when dealing with highly regarded series, constantly afloat between the desires of often too conservative fans and the need to evolve just enough to justify the increase in number next to the title: in these cases many teams follow the unwritten rule of ~always keeping something for the next chapter~, so as not to completely consume their crucible of inventiveness, and to ensure growth of the brand without rushing big risks. So what happens when a software house decides to completely overthrow the crucible in the mix, and to create a sequel with everything, really everything, that goes through its creators' heads? What can go wrong in the creation of a game where, at a certain point, the developers choose to give a damn about safety and take off on their motorbikes soaring towards the horizon, amidst fireworks, confetti and design solutions that any sane director would you discard regardless? Well, the answer is simple: there's a good 90% chance that everything will blow up badly, in a riot of gargantuan oversights and exaggerations. sometimes the planets align, and some talented teams manage almost miraculously to fit everything in the best possible way, resulting in truly memorable titles. Today, with great joy, we will deal with one of these video games: that Bayonetta 3 to which many looked at with a mixture of hope and terror, due to the rather dark interlude experienced by PlatinumGames in recent years. And, it must be said, this unpredictable Japanese team has always had the inspiration for a coup like this ... simply few were willing to bet on them after years without valuable projects and the devastating tumble known as Babylon's Fall. However, Platinum did not spend those years simply regrouping and licking their wounds, because playing the last chapter of their popular action saga a specific truth appeared more obvious than ever: it is impossible to create a similar title without consuming all resources, you find them and the time at your disposal. Today, of course, we will try to explain in detail why the new adventures of the witch with glasses are an absolute must for any lover of the genre, despite their excesses have led to some ~fireworks~ too many. Find out everything you need to know in our Bayonetta 3 review. Fiction: Bayonetta's multiverse of madness In Bayonetta 3 many of the protagonist's movements will also have changed, but don't think that she has lost the tendency to pose while exterminating enemies Bayonetta are certainly not games that are usually bought because of the plot, but if nothing else, Platinum has always tried to maintain a sort of underlying coherence in the paradoxical events of the series, even managing to give shape to fairly exciting events now of the end of the second chapter (we tried to summarize the story of Bayonetta in this special). Taking all this into account, we believed that this third title would start from very similar foundations to its direct predecessor, despite the fact that the trailers hinted at several upheavals. Therefore, imagine our surprise when waiting for us we found a narrative completely at the service of the gameplay, in which the founding principle of the entire campaign seems to be the simple will of the developers to break through the wall of excess continuously, until reaching peaks that are difficult to achieve. conceivable by the human mind.Be careful, this is notit means that the story completely lacks meaning; the PlatinumGames have only candidly chosen to simplify things, fielding the usual stereotyped global threat to defeat. This bad guy named Singularity, however, this time represents a danger not only for the planet of our Bayonetta, but for an entire multiverse, and as you can well imagine this choice gives rise to a whole series of incredible absurdities, carefully selected to offer the player situations that are as outsized and fun to deal with as possible. Moreover, the fact that a plot linked to a multiverse is in some ways essential demonstrates even more its secondary nature compared to the other elements of the game: much of what happens is ~explained~ more by the descriptions of the characters than by the videos, and by advancing you'll be more interested in what new crazy things each chapter has to offer than the actual conclusion. A Godzilla-like demon pirouetting very gracefully between falling skyscrapers. Would you believe us when we tell you that Bayonetta 3 is the lowest level of absurdity you will ever see? Our point of view? The decision to take itself even less seriously than usual and to press the accelerator further on the spectacular is very appropriate and, instead of astonishing us, it literally glued us to the screen with an expression perpetually halfway between stunned and exalted. To be honest, we don't even want to go into further detail about the story: it would really be a crime to anticipate what happens in Bayonetta 3, because this is more than ever an action whose surprises shouldn't be spoiled. Clearly, the goodies that the game offers are not only very well thought-out cutscenes; as previously mentioned, PlatinumGames has put its soul into this production and we have not casually underlined the subjection of the narrative to the gameplay. The third Bayonetta, in fact, beyond its predictably excellent combat system, brings into play a number of mechanical variations sincerely superior to any of our expectations, which in some ways seems to mimic what the team achieved with Nier Automata, albeit to a much higher level. However, we will go into more detail about the choices made (always trying to reveal as little as possible, of course) by talking about the battles, and the many systems that form the skeleton of the experience. Gameplay: a true witch's arsenal The Succubus Demon mechanic isn't just a stylistic addition. In Bayonetta 3 you will have to use it cleverly to dominate the clashes The real soul of Bayonetta 3 is undoubtedly the combat system, curiously also the most difficult aspect ever to manage for PlatinumGames despite the very robust foundations of its predecessors. The fundamentals of the very first Bayonetta are, in fact, still today among the best ever seen in an action, but with the second chapter (the one with Hashimoto at the reins) some of the more technical elements were made more accessible and simple, despite a significant increase in variety in weapons and a noticeable improvement in every other aspect of the game. Platinum could have continued along this path, commonly thought to broaden its target audience well beyond the usual consolidated niche of expert players, instead the choice was almost the opposite, complete with additional mechanics capable of complicating and varying sensitive way the approach to battles. However, before getting to the heart of the already known demonic evocations and various transformations, we believe it is appropriate to take into consideration precisely the fundamental ones just mentioned, because they remain the cornerstones of the fights, and we believe it is important to put their characteristics on paper The core of Bayonetta 3's battles is once again an exceptionally fluid choreography of attacks and dodges, beautifully supported by a central mechanic called dodge offset. To explain it in a nutshell, it is the ability to memorize the moves of a combo performed up to that moment by holding down the attack key while dodging, so as to be able to maintain the power of one's offensive unchanged even if one defends oneself from attacks enemies (the most devastating blows are, after all, always at the end of the combinations). The mechanic can obviously also be used for other expedients - even just maintaining a charged shot during rapid movement, for example - but in general it is an element perfectly integrated with battles, which goes divinely with Bayonetta's ability to slow down time if she avoids attacks moments before being hit. Also inBayonetta 3 there is a complex progression of moves. And wait to see how many weapons you will have at your disposal Now, the second chapter greatly facilitated this violent ballet, with extremely wide windows of invulnerability of defensive maneuvers, less aggressive enemies on average, rather easier encounter design (less variety of opponents and their abilities during battles), and various gigantic bosses where the importance of movement and positioning pretty much went down the drain in favor of simple dodges and burst counterattacks. This was not the case with the very first Bayonetta, which tended to be much more ~mean~ in case of poorly calculated dodges - a rather awkward timing of a dodge leads in the series to slow down time only for a few moments, instead of gaining whole seconds of advantage - and brutal in calculating the final scores of each fight, an absolutely iconic factor in the so-called ~stylish action~ such as Bayonetta and Devil May Cry, and much loved by perfectionists. The third chapter? Markedly closer to the first in terms of timing, but with quite a few not negligible differences. Here, for example, Bayonetta can equip various weapons as usual - and as in the previous chapters, she maintains two different configurations, as well as the ability to immediately switch from one to the other even in the middle of combos - with the difference however, that she cannot plus equip different tools at the feet and hands. It might seem like a step backwards, but it is counterbalanced by two factors: the weapons have more specific moves and combinations, they are much more numerous, and calculated to be extremely unique, so as to completely change the fighting style of the protagonist. Of course, even in the past they were diversified and equipped with special mechanics, but in Bayonetta 2 many of them had similar times of use, or in any case a dry ~magnetism~ that made it really difficult to hit empty, even when you focused on much slower choices of the average. Here, in Bayonetta 3 these automatisms are still present in some of the faster weapons, yet the same cannot be said of the heavier ones, which usually require a bit of healthy study and training to be used effectively. To give you an example, where the unmistakable initial guns of the protagonist have short-range moves that often connect perfectly and launch projectiles with limited damage useful for increasing the range of shots, the big hammer called Pillar G cannot already be used with equal carelessness, due to various explosive attacks that knock lighter foes a long way and perhaps even too much composure on normal hits (a clumsiness offset by devastating damage). Just think, even rather rapid death tools such as the fiery yo-yos that are unlocked relatively early in the campaign, although apparently similar to the chainsaws of the second chapter, actually have precise attack areas, which make them mainly useful against opponents of huge tonnage or require you to make the most of the sudden movements of certain attacks. In short, if you think you can press keys at random in this game, you would do well to recalculate your priorities: each weapon has a balance to be respected and requires a minimum of tactics to be used at its best, even the apparently more ~natural~ ones. To all this, then, you must also add a sharply increased enemy combativity, necessary to justify all the new mechanics that we will discuss shortly... New Systems: Demon Hierarchy The Demonic Camouflage is also often activated at the end of certain combos in Bayonetta 3, and further increases the spectacularity PlatinumGames is certainly not a conservative team and, as mentioned in the introduction to this article, with Bayonetta 3 it has decided to play all possible cards, even going so far as to revolutionize the renowned combat system we have just discussed. An operation of this type is normally very risky, because it takes very little to throw off a very fine balance, especially when a series of potentially powerful mechanics are inserted into the equation; except that, when you go deeper into what the Japanese team has done, you realize how the novelties of this third chapter are actually more calculated than first impressions might suggest. The first big change is called Succubus Demon, and it is nothing else than a replacement technique of the ~final moves~ of the previous chapters, in turn exploiting the magical power of the protagonist. When activated, this ability summons a huge demonic creature that can be controlled actively, with the reverse of", "date": "2022-10-25", "grade": "9.3"}
