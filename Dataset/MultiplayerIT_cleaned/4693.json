Set in a dystopian world where the forces of good have, essentially, lost, this recent Obsidian project has attempted to undermine the classic topoi of Western RPGs, putting the player at the service of a very powerful dictatorial figure and partially eliminating the ~climbing in power~ typical of the genre; all in the service of a layered narrative whose purpose was to play on the gray scales of morality, and not on the typical division between black and white. The mission failed 100%, unfortunately: Tyranny turned out to be a contained RPG, well written and with various interesting gimmicks, but failed to develop its ambitions in the best possible way due to a simplification of its themes in the final phase and of a sudden closure. Perhaps this is also why the sales of the title have not reached the considerable figures of Pillars, yet Obsidian has not abandoned its child and has indeed decided to expand it with an expansion called Bastard's Wound, which arrives in conjunction with a free upgrade to the base game. We obviously played it, and today we're here to tell you if Tyranny has managed to make a leap in quality, or if this addition is nothing more than an uninspired ~more of the same~. Underground city Bastard's Wound the usual card of the ~new zone~ is played, reachable after reading a message conveniently placed in the player's inventory. Once the contents of the letter have been revealed, you will have a new region available, where the main attraction is none other than a section of the ~Oldwalls~ - ancient ruins closely connected to the towers scattered around the game world - where a community made up of various factions has settled to escape the attentions of the dark lord, Kyros. You, as Kyros' own agent, will have the thankless task of carrying out an investigation on the spot and deciding the future of its inhabitants. Ordinary administration, except that the expansion follows the same structure as the base game: nothing is as it seems, the benevolent characters in the world of Tyranny are very few, and you will soon be forced to make hard choices that will forever change the balance of the ~Wound~, as you try to solve its mysteries. It is no small matter, of course, because the new adventure is designed to be an advanced area: you will therefore find high-level equipment, and an elaborate dungeon that follows the structure already seen in some underground areas of the base game, but with greater complexity related to altars with multiple keys and platforms for teleportation. Thankfully, it's nothing revolutionary, but it's still a clever solution to offer an interesting mix of dialogue, unexpected situations and combat, capable of keeping the pace of progress at the same level as the advanced stages of the main campaign (which, we also specified in the review, they represent the culmination of the game, before the sudden interruption). In short, we are talking about a very well studied area in general, which does not offer big steps forward to the formula, but does its job worthily by giving a few more healthy hours of play. The strongest element of Bastard's Wound after all is the interweaving of events and characters, which can once again be resolved in multiple ways, provided you have high enough stats to dominate conversations (which is actually quite easy if you face the whole when the game is practically over) and to search for every possible solution while wandering through the tunnels of the main dungeon. The community that inhabits the new area is diversified, full of prominent figures and plagued by internal problems that are not easy to solve: in other words, there is all the strength of Tyranny concentrated in a single series of quests, even if it is the case of specify that the peaks of some of the choices made in the base game are never reached. On the other hand, no improvement from a technical or mechanical point of view; these are extra contents, which as we have already said have very little evolutionary charge.", "date": "2017-09-07", "grade": "7.5"}
