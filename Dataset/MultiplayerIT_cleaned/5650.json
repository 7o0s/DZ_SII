{"name": "Grim Dawn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/165069-grim-dawn-finche-ce-bottino-ce-vita.html", "text": "In Grim Dawn, enemies don't just die: they explode into pieces, fly through the air, leave gruesome pools of blood and fluorescent moods. Advancing in the midst of the horde of monsters that besiege us like mosquitoes is a muscular effort, like mowing the wheat, made very well by the game's physics and visual effects. Shots and abilities produce explosions, flashes of colored light, flickering marks, blasts of electricity, bursts of fire, and other frightening audio-visual effects. Does all of this matter? Yes a lot. In a game genre where you only have to repeatedly press the left mouse button interspersing clicks with the 1, 2, 3, 4 keys (but also 5, 6, 7 if you love a bar full of skills) the feeling that you test by killing enemies is crucial. Also because the massacre continues for about 30 hours (and we're only talking about the first round). Therefore, from the point of view of the emotions you feel fighting, mission successful. Crate Entertainment has spent the long years in which Grim Dawn remained in early access well, working on the models of the monsters, on the visual intensity of the clashes and on the evocative force of the environments. The result is a huge world, sometimes too articulated, to be explored without interruption, full of crossroads, alternative paths, randomly generated caves and dungeons, not to mention the large portions of the map whose existence it is good to note somewhere for return to explore them when the character is ready, or even during a second playthrough. Grim Dawn compensates for the almost total absence of innovative elements with the abundance of content, but considering that the genre is still dominated by Diablo 3 and Path of Exiles, the originality of the game system is not a prerequisite: do well or do better what has already been done is still enough. However, the developers have tried to make some small steps forward, especially from the point of view of the setting. The world is as always plagued by an otherworldly and destructive evil, but fantasy gives way to steampunk (more or less). So no knights in armor, but rather a mixture of eighteenth-century clothes, breastplates and shoulder pads with Mad Max-style spikes, arquebuses, sticks of dynamite and good old swords. The enemies themselves, in addition to the classic roundup of zombies, chelates and wraiths, include sects of cultists who wield a grimoire on one side and a pistol on the other. Too bad that these new elements are limited. We could have insisted more on the possibilities of the new setting, especially from the point of view of enemies and clothing, which still allows a lot of space for medieval elements, but is still a step in the right direction. The monsters, then, are anything but original, although full of pleasant details (still hordes of wasps and spiders?). Beyond the ups and downs in the catalog of enemies and clothing, the real novelty is the system of moral choices included in the dialogues and in many quests. Don't expect who knows what narrative complexity, but the possibility of making some decisions that give a minimum of depth to the characters is already positive in an action RPG. There's also a nice reputation system and the ability to take one side or the other of two major orders, thus increasing the replay value of the title. Before launching yourself into the cooperative game, which supports up to four players, we therefore advise you to finish it at least once alone to enjoy the story and the narrative crossroads (provided that English doesn't scare you). We would still have something to say about the game world, but we will do it in the next paragraph, otherwise this becomes a torrent of sentences worse than the zombie siege of the first act of the game. Grim Dawn doesn't change the world of action RPGs, but it certainly makes it better Infinite paths We were talking about the setting. The world consists of a unique map with artificial limits, for example a collapsed bridge, which we can only pass after meeting certain requirements. However, there are no clear breaks, and both the monsters and the ecosystem change progressively. Considering that the world of Grim Dawn includes marshy swamps, impervious mountains, wheat fields and assorted ruins, the variety is assured, but perhaps the excessive search for an all too gloomy world has limited the creativity of the developers, which escapes here and there there to the harsh discipline to dye the screens in bright colors that are anything but depressing. Either way, Grim Dawn manages to build its own personality, and that's what counts. Let's recap, then: fights, okay; setting, okay; only the other half of the heart, loot and customization is missing. Let's start with the loot, which is the motivo so that these games are played over and over again from start to finish. Nothing shocking, items have their degree of rarity determined by the color of the name, with legendary only appearing beyond a certain level of the character. The presence of firearms, enchanted skulls and ghostly blades are nice touches, but we are still within the limits of the genre, even if we have to praise the majesty of the rarer objects. So expect an inventory that quickly fills with items to sell and endless curses for the amount of armor and weapons unsuitable for our character development. The only consolation is the chest in which to accumulate items for the other characters, even if not everyone has the time and desire to do more classes. At the moment, however, this is the state of the genre and we have to be patient. As far as customization goes, Grim Dawn knows how to keep us busy. In fact, there are six classes that can be combined in pairs, and therefore two branches of skills on which to spend our points (always resettable), a quantity of microscopic upgrades to be associated with weapons, hundreds of objects to forge, and the immense system of devotions . As if the skills weren't enough, you can in fact enrich the character with astral paths called devotions, which are unlocked by purifying sanctuaries throughout the game. With all these possibilities, we challenge you to find two similar builds. The only flaw, and we have always noticed it in the course of the previous tests, is that almost all the combinations translate into an almost identical gaming experience, even between classes that shoot from afar and melee fighters. Think that some skills have been included almost only for their visual effectiveness rather than for the real difference they make in the game. But Grim Dawn is also this, a world where you can take an anonymous character and create him a background made up of magic, special shots and spectacular summons. Grim Dawn is vast, with attention to detail, packed with content and satisfying even for those who want to finish it once and that's it. With new worlds and missions on the way, we expect it to remain among the best action RPGs for a long time to come.", "date": "2016-03-14", "grade": "8.5"}
