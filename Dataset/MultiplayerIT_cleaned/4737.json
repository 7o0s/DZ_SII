{"name": "Sine Mora EX", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/186889-sine-mora-ex-sine-mora-ex-il-tempo-di-sparare.html", "text": "Officially announced in April, after a series of rumors, Sine Mora EX marks the debut of the shoot'em-up from Digital Reality and Grasshopper Manufacture on current generation platforms. We are talking about a remaster, therefore, which runs at real 4K and sixty frames per second on PlayStation 4 Pro, thus emphasizing the quality of a design that still today appears convincing and at times evocative, thanks to the excellent work done by the Hungarian team in collaboration with Suda51. The surprisingly deep and interesting story behind the game is told through simple text screens and short cutscenes (which can be fast-forwarded if desired), and sees a group of rebel airmen take on the army of the Layil Empire with the goal of liberating the kingdom of Seol. Our team isn't made up of ordinary soldiers, however: beyond their being anthropomorphic animals, the characters we're going to control during the game's campaign all have a peculiar ability: they manage to control the passage of time. The Eternal War The events of Sine Mora EX develop through seven increasingly complex levels, although for this remaster the developers have made the starting difficulty level more accessible than in the original version. The plot will lead us to take on the role of different characters, each aboard their own plane, and to face the armies of the Layil Empire, deployed in their entirety, within the most disparate scenarios: from the clouds to the subsoil, flying over cities or inside caves, in the huge hangars of secret bases or in the depths of the sea, confronting us with a total of thirteen huge bosses. The rules of the game draw on the classics of the genre, while not disdaining some insight into the dynamics of bullet hell, so much so that in certain situations it will be frankly impossible to avoid the myriads of bullets that will hit us. Luckily we won't have to worry about a vital energy bar, but about the timer visible in the center, at the top of the screen: when we suffer damage we lose precious seconds, which can be recovered by destroying enemies. However, if time runs out, it will be game over and we will be asked to choose whether to return to the main menu or take advantage of one of the ~continues~ available, in greater or lesser numbers depending on the degree of difficulty. To successfully complete our mission we will be able to count on main and secondary weapons that change according to the plane we fly, assisted by the special ability to slow down time, which can be activated by holding down the R2 backbone. If the latter and the special weapon depend on the relative indicators and can be recharged using blue and green orbs, the primary fire can instead be upgraded by collecting red orbs. In this way we pass from the single bullet to the multiple shot, multiplying the effectiveness of our offensive with the risk, however, of losing everything as soon as we suffer a blow: the orbs will abandon our plane and we will have to be quick enough to recover them, if not most of all, to avoid finding ourselves facing advanced stages of the levels without the necessary firepower. Playstation 4 trophies Among the twelve Trophies of Sine Mora EX there is one that is obtained by running into the game over already in the prologue, while on the contrary another achievement is unlocked by overcoming that phase without suffering any damage. All the other Trophies depend on the degree of skill that we will gradually be able to reach, making us ~promote~ until we reach the highest levels. EXtra content The variety of weapons, the excellent balance of difficulty (however seen from a hardcore point of view, where you have to learn from your mistakes in order to continue successfully) and the interesting narrative outline still make Sine Mora EX a slap-up shooter today. characterized by splendid and well-differentiated bosses, composed of elements that must be destroyed separately, which sell dearly and have maneuvers that can displace us at first, leaving us very little chance of surviving: from the mechanical octopus to the iron giant, from the armored train to the flying ships, we will see some really good ones. Completed in just over a couple of hours the campaign, still a significant limitation today, the core of the experience actually turns out to be the arcade mode, which allows you to replay all levels in any order, but selecting at will plane and pilot (unlockable gradually together with alternative colors), so as to exploit their weapons and abilities on a fixed basis, as well as special abilities other than ~bullet time~, in this case the possibility of activating a shield that reflects enemy projectiles or restartturn the time to avoid, for example, a damage suffered. Also present here is a practice mode in which to study the various bosses and their attack and movement patterns, as well as the ~Point Attack~ mode for those looking for a truly consistent challenge, but there is no shortage of exclusive content from the EX edition . The remaster produced by THQ Nordic not only increases the resolution of the original assets to bring everything, as mentioned, to real 4K and sixty frames per second on PlayStation 4 Pro (1080p on standard PlayStation 4), but also introduces new, interesting extras: firstly a two-player local co-op, using the shared energy gimmick; but also three small versus modes in which you have to take turns facing enemy troops or play a sort of dodgeball game; and finally a very difficult challenge mode with stages that are unlocked only when we have successfully passed the previous ones. Speaking of changes, the dialogues of the characters are now spoken by default in English, but from the options it is possible to restore the original Hungarian audio, which made the narrated sequences very particular.", "date": "2017-08-07", "grade": "8.5"}
