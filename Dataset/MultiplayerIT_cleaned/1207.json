{"name": "Megaman Battle Network 4 Red Sun & Blue Moon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/megaman-battle-network-4-red-sun-blue-moon.html", "text": "Red Sun, Blue Moon As already explained, Battle Network 4 is inspired by some events elaborated for the television show: in this case, to characterize the evanescent plot of the video game are three tournaments (the last ones called, in fact, Blue Moon or Red Sun depending on the version) which they scan it in various stages. Between one battle and another, the young Lan, protagonist of the series and owner of the Navi Megaman.exe, will have to deal with the problems of his opponents (which change from version to version) before finally facing them in the tournament matches. For those agnostic of this bizarre universe, let's remember that in this hypothetical future the virtual network constitutes a real parallel world, populated by Navis, sentient avatars connected to Pets (electronic devices very similar to palmtop computers) of the vast majority of the population. Obviously, a main narrative line also develops in Battle Network 4 which stages the usual global threat organized by the mad criminal of the moment (after the WWW and Gospel underworld organizations, it is the turn of the Nebula) and the ~exe~ version of a historical character of the Megaman universe, Duo (this time in the unusual role of ~villain~): the problem is that while this aspect of the plot is ultimately convincing, it is too fragmented and unfriendly, merely bursting onto the scene too late to be able to excite the player to the story. Worth mentioning, however, is the forced intrusion of the Solar Boy Django, protagonist of Konami's Boktai, as bizarre as it is inappropriate... Soul Unison, Dark Chip and more The game system of this episode does not differ practically at all from that already seen in the three prequels, but in turn presents some novelties so well studied as to completely modify the strategies of the most experienced players. For those who have forgotten, Battle Network is played and ~explored~ like a normal RPG, both as Lan in the real world and as Megaman in the virtual world, but when entering combat mode the player is to move Megaman directly on half of an area divided into eighteen squares, opposite to the one in which the enemies move. A bar will mark the rounds and once filled it will be possible to call up a menu to select special abilities, the Chips, which mimic Magic cards, such as those gathered in special decks (or Folders). There are a few simple rules that determine the selection of the Chips and the possibility of using or combining them to obtain the so-called Program Advances, but in general the enormous variety of Chips, including those for attacking, healing and tampering with the area gameplay, offers incredible variety and strategic customization. The real novelties therefore consist of the Soul Unison and the Dark Chips. As far as Soul Unison is concerned, it is a particular modality that allows you to sacrifice a Chip to recall the power of a certain Navi who will merge with Megaman, changing his battle set-up and capabilities: the various Souls are obtained by progressing in history and each version offers six different ones, obtainable by beating the game several times. Dark Chips, on the other hand, become usable when a special indicator signals our hero's propensity for ~evil~: when this happens, it is possible to have these Chips with unparalleled destructive power, but at the price of Soul Unison, which becomes unusable. These new options certainly don't upset an already well-tested battle system, but they enrich it and offer an incentive to play this new episode even for those who already know the prequels by heart. On the other hand, unfortunately, many elements have already been seen, such as the Navi Customizer, which allows you to customize Megaman's performances through a sort of mini puzzle-game. News on the technical front or almost From a graphic point of view, Battle Network 4 presents some interesting innovations, while remaining substantially identical to its predecessors: in particular, Capcom has well thought of devising a system to soften the edges of the sprites, too angular and geometric in the prequels. The result is an isometric perspective that mimics three-dimensionality, made more convincing by the detail and the meticulous realization of the various sprites, indoors and outdoors (although one wonders how it is possible that, from one episode to the next, the location of the buildings in ACDC Town has been totally distorted), which enjoy a truly impeccable variety and characterization. The design of the new Ships and virtual labyrinths is a little more bland, decidedly uninspired. On the sound front, nothing new under the sun: the usual, discreet but catchy jingle accomthey pay exploration and battles without ever annoying, providing an average musical accompaniment. Predictably, the effect of the animated series on the programming of the fourth episode of Megaman Battle Network had two effects, one positive and the other negative: on the one hand, it introduced original and intriguing elements such as the Soul Unison and the Dark Chips; on the other, it has trivialized the storyline by transforming the narrative progression into a continuous succession of clashes with very little plot to give them meaning. Fortunately, from a playful point of view, Battle Network 4 is undoubtedly the best episode of the saga, so full of quests, secrets and bonuses to unlock that it needs to be completed three times to really see everything, especially if you have of that dose of patience necessary to overcome the difficulty, sometimes truly unsettling, of the more advanced clashes. Recommended for fans and those who have never approached the virtual universe of Megaman. Pros: Original and intriguing news. Very accurate graphics and sound. Very long-lived. Cons: Trivial and confusing storyline Unbalanced difficulty We have already reached the fourth episode of the new parallel series dedicated to the Capcom android (excluding the good action-game Megaman Network Transmission for GameCube and the mediocre Megaman Battle Network Chip Challenge for GBA). However, this chapter deserves a necessary premise: in the wake of the success achieved by this bizarre RPG version of the adventures of Megaman (or Rockman, as it is called in Japan) Capcom financed the Xebec studio for the production of an animated series for children that reworked the video game series. The cartoon has in turn achieved excellent public and critical success (despite the weakness of some narrative arcs) and has generated, as always happens, the production of gadgets, manga and obviously various television seasons: after the first three series, it has recently changed its title to Rockman.exe Axess, taking a new and independent path with respect to the video game. Not for long, though: Megaman Battle Network 4 in fact takes up some themes and narrative inventions of the Axess animated series such as Soul Unison or elimination tournaments. As always happens in these cases, however, not all donuts come out with a hole...", "date": "2004-09-24", "grade": null}
