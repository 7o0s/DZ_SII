In the case of Storm in a Teacup, we are right in front of a mix of the genre, a strongly arcade title in the setting which however hides an unsuspected thickness; and which, above all, allows us to enjoy the experience at different levels according to our needs. A small example: the forty stages that make up the main game mode can be completed very quickly, after all it is enough for the character we control to reach the ~finish line~ at the end of the scenario. However, this is an ephemeral conquest, because true completion is achieved only when all the objects present in the location are collected, objects that we can sometimes only identify after a series of trials and errors. On the one hand, therefore, the title developed by Cobra Mobile avoids the frustration of missions that are too difficult to complete on the first try, guaranteeing the unlocking of the next level based on any stage of completion and thus giving us the opportunity to explore all the maps available, possibly choosing which ones we want to ~beat~ by obtaining 100% of the objects and which ones we consider too complicated, postponing the comparison until we feel more inspired. A points system would perhaps have lengthened the longevity of the product, for example ensuring access to subsequent levels only after the completion of at least part of those already passed. But Storm in a Teacup is a game that costs 79 cents, and therefore there is that it does not necessarily have to offer us a disproportionate level of challenge. Clouds and sheets But in short, how does the new Chillingo production work? As mentioned at the beginning, it is a very simple and immediate platformer, whose touch controls are based on just three buttons (left, right, jump). The character we control is sitting in a huge teacup which, for who knows why, manages to lift itself into the air, even if for a few moments. The gameplay therefore takes gravity into great consideration and, in general, the inertial system that regulates our movements. Very often you have to accompany the jump with a ~run up~ to reach the desired platform, while a quick double press of the same button produces a small ~boost~ capable of pushing us up with a little more force. The protagonist's abilities are not enriched with the passing of the levels, and it is therefore the latter that propose elements of detachment, to vary the action by adding particular mechanisms, traps, moving objects and so on. The end result is decidedly pleasant from a level design point of view, there are checkpoints that prevent the occurrence of episodes of frustration after a sudden death and at any time it is possible to restart the stage from scratch, perhaps because we have missed a particular objective but we know that it is within our reach. In short, only lights and no shadows for Storm in a Teacup? Unfortunately not. As mentioned, the control system can count on a very convincing inertial context, which fascinates and stimulates us to play again and again, to retry that particular level to see if we are able to collect all the objects. The problem is that the commands themselves are not very reliable, and indeed in some cases their accuracy leaves something to be desired. The solution of the two diverging arrows instead of the classic d-pad does not reward the intentions of the developers, because too often the left thumb ends up not pressing the right icon, perhaps at a crucial moment. For the rest, nothing to say: the graphics are really nice, with a good use of colors and a strong characterization of the various ~zones~ that host the levels.
