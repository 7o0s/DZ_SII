With Need for Speed, which in any case has been proposing more than pleasant episodes for smartphone editions for some years now, the American giant wanted to bet big by entrusting the last chapter to Firemonkeys, a very talented Australian team recently acquired and within which there they are those Firemint authors of the wonderful Real Racing 2. A combination destined, at least on paper, to literally make the fireworks explode; but did things actually go like this? The wind in your hair Overturning the custom of the dulcis in fundo, let's start talking about Need for Speed: Most Wanted from the best aspect of the package packaged by EA, or rather the technical component that is nothing short of excellent; on the other hand, with a Real Racing 3 coming out of the same studios by the end of the year and which seems destined to set new graphic standards, it is not surprising to discover in this product a serious contender for the most beautiful (must see) racing game title available on App Store and Google Play. On the retina display of the iPhone 5, thanks to the capabilities of a high-end processor, Need for Speed: Most Wanted is really not too far from the graphic quality of a ~living room~ console; the level of detail and the lighting are in fact very good, and the modeling of the cars returns faithful replicas of the real counterparts. EA's arcade is therefore a pleasure for the eyes, to the point that it would be almost excessive to find equal quality also in the gameplay component; and in fact the effort of Firemonkeys unfortunately runs into some more or less serious imperfections to the point of discovering its entire value reduced and its great potential reduced. The absence of the free roaming component that distinguishes the equivalent for home consoles, developed by Criterion, is actually not a big concern; on a platform that favors and prefers game sessions for a few minutes it would have been more of a problem than anything else, to be honest. The races can therefore be accessed simply by touching one of the different locations, scattered on the Fairhaven map, which contain the different events that are unlocked as you progress in the main mode (which is actually also the only one). The challenges don't necessarily always imply having to face other riders trying to finish first, but they also introduce different solutions based on checkpoints to be reached within a set time or entire routes to be completed before the stopwatch exceeds a certain limit, with the aggravating factor of the police cars always ready to throw a spoke in the works. However, the dish prepared with commitment by Firemonkeys lacks a little spice, the quid capable of keeping the attention high even after the enthusiasm for the graphics; and in fact the events follow one after the other with a certain avarice of emotions, thanks to a trivial and monotonous track design, except for a certain frustration that reveals itself rather unexpectedly on the occasion of some specific races. In fact, for some reason Need for Speed: Most Wanted is characterized by an inconsistency in the level of difficulty that is annoying; you can overcome a challenge almost with your arm metaphorically out the window, to find yourself in the next one having to sweat the hell out of it with the obligation to go and boost your car with those power ups that last only one race and cost a bit hard-earned money. It's an imperfect formula that annoys, especially when you find yourself with a crying wallet and only a few taps away from the purchase of virtual currency in exchange for the real one; the in-app purchases, tolerable in formulas of free games (or around there), clash instead in a 6 euro premium title which should not require further disbursements from the player, even less if they are so unintelligently mixed and integrated with the natural progression . Of course, you can repeat the races you have already faced to flesh out your nest egg, but it is a very unmodern solution as well as not at all exciting. The control system is good, rather precise in the steering linked to the accelerometer and which allows you to manage drifts and nitro in an intelligent way. Finally, sorry for the total absence of any multiplayer component, with the only competitive element linked to the comparison of times with one's friends.", "date": "2012-11-07", "grade": "7.5"}
