{"name": "Lotus Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lotus-challenge-4.html", "text": "The gameplay Probably the intention of the creators of LC was to create the right balance between arcade and simulation, in such a way as to guarantee an essential gameplay and at the same time able to make the driving experience realistic. A path traveled, lately by many, and which has borne and bears fruit, given the success of titles such as Gran Turismo and Sega GT. The fundamental problem is that, in our case, the result obtained is not the most exciting, given that both the driving model and the vehicle control system are approximate. What is surprising is the difficulty in interpreting and predicting the car's behavior not only when braking and cornering, but also on a straight line, where small steering corrections can cause sudden and uncontrollable skidding. Only after several hours of play and adjustments on the sensitivity of the analog stick will it be possible to manage the machine satisfactorily, but doubts and perplexities about its behavior will always remain. This is found, unfortunately, with any car model, on the contrary, what constitutes a disconcerting aspect is the lack of a real difference in the dynamics of the various vehicles present, so that when driving a vintage car or a concept car one does not they feel substantial changes, if not only in acceleration and speed. The technical realization Some steps forward compared to what was seen for PS2 have been made. The car models are better thanks to a higher number of polygons and a better quality of the textures that cover them. The circuits are still dull, characterized by few polygons and poor textures, such as those used to represent the asphalt. The complete absence of bump mapping and reflections on the cars denote the immature knowledge of the Xbox hardware or the lack of desire to improve. Comment Perhaps, due to the limited time available or the lack of knowledge of the platform for which it was developed, Lotus Challenge fails to be a noteworthy game. A wasted opportunity as the basic idea is good and deserves to be exploited better. Recommended only for fans of driving games and those of one of the best known and most loved manufacturers of sports cars. Pros: 38 Lotus branded cars Addictive ~challenge~ mode Cons: Poor technical execution Frustrating gameplay About a year after its appearance on PS2, Kuju Entertainment re-proposes Lotus Challenge on Xbox with the declared intention of filling the structural gaps that this title clearly showed in its first version. A dynamic and quite engaging game structure was contrasted by a really dull graphic design and an ~arcade~ playability that was too essential, unable to offer the depth that is now required in a driving game. At this point the question is obvious: will a decidedly more powerful hardware and an extra year of experience have been enough to obtain a more attractive game? The importance of ~Know-how~ The design and creation of a video game currently requires an increasingly consistent and planned use of financial and human resources. In particular, it is essential to have a development team that has the necessary technical knowledge to be able to deal with a specific concept, knowledge that is often acquired only after years of matured experience. For this reason, the most precious resource is often represented by the so-called ~know-how~ that one possesses, and this also explains why it is always the usual well-known software houses that churn out successful titles. This is especially true for certain genres, such as driving, in which the knowledge acquired in the field of physical modeling, graphics and artificial intelligence represent a considerable advantage, difficult to fill by those who start from scratch or almost, and which, moreover, he has to contend with limited budgets and ever shorter development times. Only in this way is it possible to explain why Lotus Challenge fails to be a flagship title of its kind, despite presenting an interesting concept. Based on the exploitation of the well-known car brand, in this game you have the opportunity to drive as many as 38 different models of Lotus, starting from the first models of historic cars up to F1 cars, such as the 1979 JPS Ford, and modern concepts car. It is possible to test these cars in different game modes, passing from the single race or event, to the championship divided by classes, to the challenge mode which represents the real fulcrum of the game. Starting from the role of simple tester you will have toface challenges of increasing difficulty based on time trials, races and various stunts, which will take place both in closed circuits and in normal busy streets. Only by continuing in this mode will it be possible to unlock cars and circuits that can then be used in the other modes present. The game, therefore, has the necessary bite that pushes the gamer to move forward, but, unfortunately, to ruin this purpose there is a gameplay that is not compelling and a graphic design which, although improved compared to that seen in the PS2 version, is not up to the hardware made available by Microsoft.", "date": "2003-01-10", "grade": null}
