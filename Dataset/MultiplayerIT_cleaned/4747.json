{"name": "PPKP: Kick", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/186771-ppkp-ppkp-kick-punch-its-all-in-the-mind.html", "text": "There is an evident fascination for fists (in the hands) that hovers in the world of mobile video games, just think of planetary successes such as Punch Club and Punch Quest, rather simple and immediate games like a good old man straight in the face, something to make Chuck Norris cry. In this case we are also dealing with kicks, because PPKP is not the acronym of a party affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers, but the acronym of Punch Punch Kick Punch, which are the fundamental elements of this bizarre title. With a great capacity for synthesis, the name already reveals a good part of the game mechanics, which is entirely based on turn-based encounters in which we find ourselves alternating between kicks, punches and parries against an infinite number of enemies of various types. We have previously seen games with a certain narrative hermeticism, but PPKP reaches new heights of abstraction: our protagonist wakes up with a start because a taxi has broken through the roof of his house, and he realizes how the city around him has undergone various devastation due to a sort of unidentified cataclysm. Probably related to this strange phenomenon, the other disturbing fact is that the streets are full of anthropomorphic monsters belonging to the Monster Corp group, all apparently quite trained in martial arts. Our hero wastes no time and immediately launches into cleaning the streets with kicks and punches, at the same time also trying to help the carpenters in the reconstruction of the semi-destroyed city. All of this is illustrated simply by the game screens, with no dialogue or explanatory text, which at first makes it quite difficult to understand exactly what is happening, what we should do and why. It's not that subsequently things take on a great meaning, but after a few minutes you learn the basic mechanics and you understand more or less what there is to do, which isn't much: punching and kicking and rebuilding buildings. All represented in a pixelated style of better workmanship than usual, which appears as a tribute to 8-bit beat'em ups (Double Dragon, Kunio-Kun) much more genuine than seen on many other occasions. Constructive destruction There are distinct phases in PPKP's mechanics: there's the street fight and the part that could be defined as ~management~, based on the continuous evolution of the main character and the surrounding world. The aim of the game is to rebuild the destroyed city and eliminate the monsters, two goals that conveniently meet in the same practice of punching and kicking. The turn-based combat system is extremely simple, with a button dedicated to punches and one to kicks which, if necessary, allow defensive maneuvers for which timing in the pressure is essential, because with a single blow immediately you end up out of action. The structure is obviously super simplified, but it is not without a certain tacticalism, between the choice of times for parries and counterattacks and the continuous progression of the protagonist's skills. The latter fall within the ~management~ sphere of PPKP, which immediately reveals a good grind rate applied to its game mechanics, given that everything is based on the coins earned after each fight which can be spent on increasing the protagonist's skills and in learning new and powerful moves. Another fundamental element is the collection of components for the reconstruction of the buildings, which takes place by taking part in sessions very similar to the old Street Fighter II bonus stage: after a certain amount of street battles, the possibility of accessing the wreckers is unlocked, where we can collect materials useful for reconstruction by beating the machines like madmen. Restoring the various buildings of the city allows further possibilities for evolution and enhancement for the protagonist in a continuous increase in statistics that is typical of grind-based games. As planned, PPKP is a free-to-play game that is often interspersed with ads and has waiting bars that can be eliminated by purchasing tokens with real money, and sadly, there doesn't appear to be an in-app purchase at this time. remove the whole mechanism making it a Premium game to all intents and purposes, so those who don't like microtransactions already know what they could get into.", "date": "2017-08-03", "grade": "7.0"}
