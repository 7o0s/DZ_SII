That is, there is no scheme or strict rules, it's not all black and white... it's not even in video games! In fact, the dinosaurs of Velocirapture are not black and white, but green and red: the former said their prayers, they did not desire the dinosaur of others nor did they question the uniqueness of their god, so they deserved to finish in heaven; the latter were bad, they often played with From Software titles and cursed the impossible, they stole the proverbial lollipop from the children and did much more than want the neighbor's dinosaur, going to the streets. Well, the gates of hell will open wide for them. The only problem that the god-dinosaur poses is: how to implement the necessary subdivision? Simply said: it will be enough to reveal oneself on the ground with a scaly big hand and to give sockets and lightning in turn, performing opposite movements on the touch screen of our iOS device. PikPok's latest effort for Adult Swim Games, Velocirapture once again offers a very particular humor and puts us in front of a prize structure that sees the unlocking of new locations, new modes and new powers based on our results. In fact, the experience starts with the survival mode and a short tutorial in which we are explained what to do, then the score we obtain makes the story mode accessible and allows us to tackle increasingly complex and multifaceted levels. The hand of god The gameplay of Velocirapture is really simple: the big hand of our ~dionosaurus~ appears in the upper part of the screen, while in the lower part green and red dinosaurs walk by, increasingly numerous, belonging to various types that get rich along the way and put different behaviors are taking place. The green reptiles must be saved, therefore we must touch them with a finger and ~throw~ them towards the hand, which will project their soul into paradise; the red reptiles, on the other hand, should be roasted with a good bolt of lightning, in which case the movement will be opposite: we must drag our finger from the big hand towards the evil dinosaur for a powerful bolt to be fired. This maneuver can also be performed for multiple eliminations, continuing the drag after touching the first target and locking onto others. For both the green and red dinosaurs, the combo rule applies, i.e. the more hits are scored correctly, the more, at a certain point, we will see an indicator rise that will allow us, from time to time, to unleash the divine fury and use some sort of celestial ~smart bomb~ capable of cleaning up the scenery. Furthermore, in the more advanced scenarios, the simple ~throw~ and ~shoot~ mechanics are accompanied by bonus movements, such as those to intercept the souls of freshly roasted dinosaurs. But how do we get ~hurt~ and how does game over occur? It is easy to say: our energy bar can empty, even quite significantly, when we take the wrong target, for example by electrocuting a green dinosaur or letting an evil red dinosaur arrive in front of us and launch towards the light. In any case, just pay a little attention and it is possible to complete the various stages without major difficulties, which is one of the problems of the PikPok title. Nothing to say, however, about the technical sector: the graphics have a nice and spot-on design, the reptiles are very fun to look at and the colors have been used really well. The precision of the controls appears similar on both the iPhone and the iPad, although in the latter case the larger screen size allows us to select characters better.", "date": "2012-07-13", "grade": "7.7"}
