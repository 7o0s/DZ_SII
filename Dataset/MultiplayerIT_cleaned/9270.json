One of the accusations made mainly by users of the console of the Kyoto house concerns precisely the small and fragile launch line up, without any real ~piece of 90~ within the choice made available to gamers. Trying to resolve the situation is LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean, a Disney title developed by TT Fusion that will allow us to relive, in the form of LEGO bricks, all 4 adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow and associates. The title in question draws heavily from its counterpart on the home console, sharing almost all the game levels and the locations in which they are set. We will then have the opportunity to fight against the Kraken, visit the famous Tortuga and the colonized citadel of Port Royal until arriving in London, the starting point of the last cinematic chapter. The story is told by some shorter versions of the videos present in the home console version, obviously leaving intact the now usual ironic and engaging style with which the whole LEGO world has always been impregnated. Without going too far on the story since, as mentioned, it follows in all respects the one narrated by the feature films, let's go directly to the gameplay, which offers some discrete novelties. Duels between bricks Anyone who has ever played at least one LEGO title in their life, right from the start of the game, will certainly find themselves at ease noting that the playability of the title follows the stylistic features of the series. Each level will in fact be full of bricks to collect, destroy and combine with each other to solve simple puzzles useful for completing the level. In principle, although similar in all versions, for the 3DS many of these puzzle sections are re-proposed in a ~light~ sauce since most of the time we will only have to limit ourselves to changing the character by finding the right one for the action we have to do perform, without therefore having the need to have more than one collaborate at the same time. This last statement leads us to expose the only real limit of this version, given by the extreme simplicity of the game, which, however well packaged, could discourage lovers of more demanding challenges and project the title in an extremely casual perspective. The big news of the portable version we find instead in the ~duels~: in certain sections of the game - particularly in the presence of boss fights - instead of the classic clash there will be choreographic duels with white weapons in the form of quick time events. The latter have proved to be absolutely fun and satisfying both from a playful and visual point of view, managing to fit perfectly within the now tested game system that the series offers. Obviously, being a LEGO title, the game is imbued with a very high replayability factor, being able to count on a large number of elements to unlock such as additional characters and the free mode, which allows you to retrace your steps with a re-edited team of characters in order to thus unlocking all the classic collectibles in previously inaccessible areas of the level. The contents, being a portable version, are of absolute substance and contribute to the substantial increase in the longevity of the game. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect with which the title is endowed is, on balance, not a simple tinsel put to justify the conversion for the Nintendo console; thanks to the depth given to the LEGO bricks, it appears absolutely functional in terms of gameplay, giving even more sense and space to the various game platforms on which we will have to jump, thus making up for the usual camera problems that often dwell in titles of this genre. Something more could be dared, but for the moment this is already sufficient to promote the work done by TT Fusion, demonstrating how 3D can be combined perfectly with platform and adventure games. Ahr Ahr Ahr From a purely technical point of view, the title carries out its job more than honestly. To a graphic detail and a polygonal modeling that certainly do not disfigure in front of the HD versions, there is added a masterful level design adapted and reprogrammed to meet the technical characteristics of the Nintendo hardware and above all useful for taking full advantage of the qualities of each character. Nothing to report negatively even in terms of audio thanks to the main themes of the feature films, proposed here, which help to further immerse the player in the adventures of Jack Sparrow and his associates. The title does not offer any multiplayer component, but takes advantage of the s function in a nice way3DS tree pass. In fact, we will have the possibility to create our very personal pirate, editable in any part, and subsequently choose which types of attack to make him use in the 3 rounds of combat: high, medium or low. We will have to do the same for the defense, which is also high, medium or low. Once everything is set, when we meet another owner of Pirates of the Caribbean, the duel will start, with the outcome being sanctioned by the two combinations of attack and defense chosen by us and by the opponent. Each victory obtained will give the possibility to unlock and use accessories for our pirate.", "date": "2011-05-20", "grade": "7.3"}
