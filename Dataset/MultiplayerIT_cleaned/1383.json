Several years after the extraordinary events of ~the prophecy of the Maya~, the second chapter of the saga, we find our hero George Stobbart on a plane about to land in the Congo. However, a storm suddenly catches the American boy, causing the plane to crash. After a little nap, the fearless manages with his usual intelligence and quick reflexes to get out of the aircraft, poised on the usual precipice-magnet and trying to imitate Lara Croft among the rocks of the plateau where he ended up. Meanwhile the more than ever attractive Nico is engaged in an interview with a not quite normal programmer who prophesies the end of the world, when a gun kills his client. Naturally the two heroes will soon be reunited, in a story that repeats the themes of the previous chapters, especially the first episode. Unfortunately this time the dialogues and characters will not be as present as in the past, for a decisive turn towards action. In fact, the rigid structure based on the movements of a cursor, not particularly easy on consoles, has been abandoned, giving way to a more modern three-dimensional setting, where it is possible to move freely with the pad towards the various locations just like in a Resident Evil. This of course has led to several changes to the inventory and interaction with the surrounding environment: for starters, sequences have been introduced where you need to press a button as fast as possible. Luckily there are few of them, because they are quite annoying as well as not requiring any skill. Then (and they now represent the fulcrum of the game together with the solving) a whole vast series of action elements were included, as already mentioned, sometimes taken from tomb raiders as regards the very frequent puzzles with the crates to be moved and the 'ability of the protagonists to hang from ever higher and ever narrower places, or from solid metal gear for the stealth sections, which are not particularly exciting. In short, a cauldron, concluded by puzzles that are not particularly difficult but with a good scenic effect that are more reminiscent of Resident Evil than graphic adventures, which in the end, despite the gaps, proves to be decidedly fun and quite varied, even if decidedly short. Finally, the pal conversion is of a good standard, without the 60 Hz selector but still full screen, and the product is entirely in Italian, which is well translated, both as regards the texts and the dubbing. A bit of tourism Let's start with the usual graphic-sound examination by dealing with the acoustic component, which, as in the first two episodes, turned out to be the most refined aspect of the technical realization. Also in Broken Sword 3 it is not difficult to be enchanted by the compositional beauty of some songs, of classical origin in the happiest, darkest and least intrusive moments when it comes to creating suspense or underlining particularly dark phases. The voice actors of the protagonists are the same as in the first two episodes, alternating ups and downs during game situations. A similar discourse can be made for the aesthetic component, especially as regards the various cut-scenes, which instead of involving the player and creating a certain atmosphere show decidedly badly animated performers and not at all natural in their movements, albeit with a detail level. This also has repercussions in the actual game, which has gone from the typical two-dimensional graphic adventure to three-dimensional. The engine demonstrates a certain care in the structure of the various locations, rather credible and with happy chromatic choices, however lacking in details especially in urban places, which should be widely populated. It is one thing to represent them in rigid 2D, another is to depict them entirely, and here Revolution shows all its limits of inexperience the first time, as well as with regard to the various views that cannot be modified by the player, not always appropriate in the shot, above all in scenes where pad skill is required. Comment Revolution can be said to be satisfied: the first appearance of Broken Sword in the three-dimensional is an excellent title that tries to combine tradition and current events, not forgetting its roots and proposing puzzles and plots perhaps inferior to the first two episodes but at least of a certain level. However, the specter of what had happened on Monkey Island does not seem to have completely dissolved. The action phases can indeed be saidquietly a filler that inconclusively mimics productions such as Tomb Raider and Metal gear solid, just as the lack of a good number of characters and related dialogues is disappointing, the true epicenter of the first two episodes, being the game almost always set in exotic locations and uninhabited. The presence of some annoying but irrelevant bugs for the gameplay, too frequent uploads and some aesthetic flaws take away another half point from a title which, however, remains recommended with some reservations to fans of past episodes but also to those looking for a decent adventure with a nice atmosphere and a storyline worth following. Pros: Good Plot Excellent soundtrack Cons: Not excessively long-lived It is not a graphic adventure in the pure sense of the term Uploads too long The text adventure is a genre that originated with the video game itself in American universities, having gained early success as the video game turned into a commercial phenomenon. Naturally, the suitable environment was computers and not consoles, and so the first homes of Commodore and Atari were immediately flooded with more or less rich narrative-level productions, but this time also equipped with a scenario where ~the action~ took place . With technological innovation, the aesthetic has gradually been refined, finding its technical but also playful paradigm in the famous Monkey Island adventures. It was only a matter of time that the genre landed on consoles, and with the new 32-bit generation the first conversions such as Discworld by Psygnosis and Broken Sword by Revolution began to appear timidly, both characterized by the same allegorical and light-hearted atmosphere of the Guybrush series. However, it seemed that with the advent of three-dimensional the genre was destined to become a museum piece, like the shooter or the 2d fighting game. Instead, it was Monkey Island itself that took the plunge, albeit with much lower results than in the past. Now, some time later, Broken Sword also (re) tries. Will he succeed where the progenitor failed?", "date": "2004-02-23", "grade": null}
