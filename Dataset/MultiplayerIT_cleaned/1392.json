'created, Rovio Entertainment. However, one does not live on angry birds alone, and so the Finnish studio has tried over the years to find another formula that could capture the attention of users in the same way. Well, the review of Darkfire Heroes suggests that they may have finally found it, in a sort of attempt to expand the experience of another famous blockbuster, namely Clash Royale. Gameplay Darkfire Heroes, a combat sequence in a forest setting. The Supercell title obviously needs no introduction and if you are reading this article there is a very good chance that you have played it quite a bit. So know that in terms of gameplay Darkfire Heroes starts from that same setting to lead us however into a very rich single player campaign, the real fulcrum of the experience. The goal, formed a team composed of five characters, is to to progress through the scenarios and defeat all the enemies that will try to stop us, including huge end-of-level bosses. Our heroes move and attack automatically, just like the stars of Clash Royale, but the action energy that recharges over time, and which is highlighted by a bar at the bottom of the screen, is not used to launch any new to the battlefield. Darkfire Heroes, the bottom of the screen with skills and spells. No, the mechanism is different: each fighter has a special ability that recharges over time and which uses precisely that energy to be used. We will therefore have the task of using these maneuvers against the creatures that will try to stop our advance, supporting the action of the team and intervening quickly if necessary, for example to restore the health of one or more members of the group. In addition to the skills, there are also some rather effective spells, lightning and fireballs that can make things easier for us (especially during boss fights) and which fortunately are not linked to freemium dynamics with a consumption setting, but alternate and recharge exactly such as special character maneuvers. Structure Darkfire Heroes, some of the unlockable characters during the campaign. The strategic action RPG formula developed by Rovio works damn well, and although some aspects of the experience are so derivative as to border on plagiarism (see the character and skill upgrade system, identical to that of Clash Royale also in terms of graphic style), it is in the contents of the game that we find its true strengths. The aforementioned campaign in fact has over forty different settings, all very well characterized and divided into ten stages with increasing degrees of difficulty. There are also more than seventy-five characters to unlock, each with unique abilities and powers, belonging to six factions that adapt more or less well to certain contexts, increasing the effectiveness of our action. Darkfire Heroes, scenario scrolling is not always vertical. It is clear that the further you go, the more the weight of the challenge will be felt, inevitably aiming for microtransactions to release characters, upgrades and coins with which to speed up progression. However, it is possible to play for free without too many problems, by agreeing to do a little grinding when you find yourself with a team that is not competitive enough. The campaign is also supported by a whole series of options useful for obtaining additional resources, see for example for example, expeditions, and two different competitive online multiplayer modes: Conquista del Castello, which takes up the mechanics of Clash Royale in an even more brazen way in a race to see who destroys the opponent's tower first; and Contest of Heroes, a challenge on two parallel courses where the winner is the one who eliminates enemies faster. Technical realization Darkfire Heroes, our heroes fight enemies in the snow. Rovio's developers have never had problems effectively characterizing game design, and the technical realization of Darkfire Heroes is yet another confirmation of their talent. Let's start by saying that the characters are drawn and animated by hand, therefore they do not (deliberately) boast the fluidity of movement that one would expect and which instead we find in the animations of the enemies and in the scrolling of the scenario.e first is a bit strange but one gets used to quickly, also thanks to the beauty of the heroes themselves, the spectacularity of their skills and spells, as well as the wide variety of campaign settings, which undoubtedly required a lot of little work and were added over the long period in soft launch before the game's official debut. The display is strictly in portrait mode and therefore Darkfire Heroes undoubtedly arises as a smartphone game, rather than a tablet. Touch controls work very well, although we did encounter some accuracy issues when, for example, trying to use a healing ability on a specific target. Nothing transcendental, however. The introductory musical theme recalls that of the Avengers (a coincidence? At this point we doubt it) and in general the soundtrack manages to accompany the action on the screen effectively, alternating between an excellent selection of tracks. The effects are also very good, which however in the unpacking sequences are culpably absent and therefore do not go to emphasize an important moment of the experience.", "date": "2021-04-23", "grade": "8.8"}
