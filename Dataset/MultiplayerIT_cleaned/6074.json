Jenks Since we imagine that the thought immediately ran to the nineties, when hordes of failed adventures (and not only) full of full motion video crowded the market, it is right to immediately dispel all doubts. Her Story, Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure and this Contradiction - Spot The Liar!, to name a few, are born from a different awareness of the videogame medium and the possibilities it offers. Thus, if The 7th Guest was a traditional adventure castrated by the use of full motion videos, which seemed almost in contrast with the game itself, the titles mentioned use them consciously and think about how to playfully exploit them without demeaning the other elements. so that they coexist perfectly. Take Her Story, where the videos are merely deductive and the actual game is projected completely off the screen; or we get to the subject of our review, Contradiction, which magnifies its filmic nature by making words the fulcrum of the player's interactions, with only a few simple puzzles as a side dish. Don't misunderstand, because getting to the end of the investigation isn't easy, but not for the reasons that usually make graphic adventures complex. Contradictions In Contradiction - Spot The Liar! you take on the role of Inspector Jenks, charged with solving a case of alleged murder of a student, found dead in a small village in the English countryside. Jenks must figure out who committed the crime by trying to make it look like a suicide. Actors get away with it Places are animated postcards To do this he will have to go around the country questioning the girl's knowledge to highlight the contradictions. Let's take an example. Jenks first has to question a couple who live in a house on the road to the woods where the body was found. The places that can be visited are animated postcards in which only three types of interactions are possible: movement and, if there is something interesting, the search for clues and objects. In some cases it is possible to use objects to obtain hidden clues. What matters is that all the fruits of Jenks' research will end up in his repertoire of possible questions to ask during interrogations. For example, outside the couple's house there are empty bottles and a bicycle that can be used as topics of conversation. The interrogations take place automatically: having chosen a topic, the interrogated will give their version from which Jenks will extrapolate the arguments. So far everything is quite automatic, in the sense that the player is only responsible for looking for clues and choosing the topics of the interrogations (usually we tend to exhaust all those available to be on the safe side). It is by listening to the words of those questioned that his role becomes more active, because the objective becomes to find the contradictions of the testimonies and to compare them. Only through the discovery of contradictions can the story move forward, because they unlock other topics for conversation. And here, going back to the first paragraph, the choice of films with real actors becomes essential to guarantee the right identification: seeing flesh-and-blood actors who make their statements by reciting them increases the likelihood, because in addition to the words, one begins to pay attention to their faces and how they change when they are pushed, or when they are about to say something important that they may not want to say. The involvement is complete regardless of the story, however not negligible, because it comes directly from the game mechanics, inseparable from the representation. Any other stylistic choice would have been unsuccessful or, at least, would have made much less than the type of story. Contradiction - Spot The Liar! is a nice graphic adventure that cleverly uses FMVs Tim Follin Among the various merits of Contradiction - Spot The Liar! there is the return to the video game scene of Tim Follin, composer of soundtracks for video games very active at the time of 8 / 16-bit systems, to whom we owe, among others, the music of Renegade, Peter Pack Rat, Target: Renegade, Ghouls' n Ghosts and countless other titles. His last work, before stopping and returning with Contradiction, dates back to 2006. It is the PSP version of Lemmings. Rigidity Contradiction's only real flaw - Spot The Liar! is its stiffness. The game structure is all too tied up and when you get to the end you realize that there are possibilities that existdevelopers let it slip. For example, opening the investigation more to error, perhaps creating false leads or foreseeing the possibility of failure. As it stands, the gameplay appears very linear, despite the progressive increase in difficulty due to the multiplication of arguments and statements that make it more difficult to find contradictions. In a certain sense it would have been nice to be able to make mistakes to give the whole experience more breathing space, but we realize that the duration of the game (you finish in about seven, eight hours) would have made it tedious to replay entire sections having to review all the various cutscenes. Also considering the price, we can be satisfied.", "date": "2015-09-01", "grade": "8.5"}
