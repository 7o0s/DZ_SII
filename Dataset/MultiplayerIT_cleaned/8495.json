Not out of laziness on the part of the writer (Moioli is already dressed like a 47 and ready to kill) but because The Dream Machine is full of twists and turns of mood: revealing even just a few would be doing you an injustice. We will therefore try to be allusive. Meanwhile, it should be said that The Dream Machine is an adventure in five parts created by Cockroach with a very original technique for the world of videogames. Characters and scenarios were in fact created with clay, cardboard boxes and paper of various kinds. Think what it's like to model each animation frame and then photograph it; a big job. And in fact only three chapters have been released on Steam at the moment, with the hope of seeing the fourth at least immediately after the summer. In any case, the final effect is fantastic and rewards the patient player with a game with a truly unique atmosphere. Clay and noir colors seem to work perfectly in The Dream Machine, also thanks to the music which, like ribbons of notes, keep the plot and setting together. Speaking of tones and narration, these three episodes, absolutely connected to each other, have the great advantage of upsetting the player's expectations. It begins with Victor, the protagonist of the game, who moves with his girlfriend Alice into a new apartment. Disturbing dreams and an elusive owner of the building are the ideal terrain for cultivating a sinister anxiety worthy of Polanski's films, but already in the second episode it becomes clear who the real enemy is and what is behind the young couple's dreams. Thus begins a very philosophical episode, which takes its cue from some of Plato's ideas to immerse itself in a fascinating science fiction story without great anxieties. And here comes the blood, this time real though, and the game transports us to the third episode, a surreal yellow with gloomy contours. While the five episodes tell one big story, each chapter is thus a self-contained world. That's why we avoid going into detail. However, it is true that such a diluted seriality could mitigate the enthusiasm of gamers, accustomed to an overload of stimuli due to the many games that come out on the market every month. But the Cockroachs know their stuff and have closed each chapter with a twist that makes you crave to pick up the phone and call them to be told how the story goes. Even puppets dream We have said that all three episodes released to date have a different atmosphere from each other and that each concludes its own narrative arc, although they are all connected to the general plot. What does not change is the protagonist, Victor, who we get to know during the dialogues. As is increasingly the case in point-and-click adventures, the possible answers do not affect the unfolding of the story, but allow us to choose what kind of person Victor is. Patient, surly, ready to assert his reasons or encouraging even towards those who take credit that is not his? Above all in the exchanges with Alicia, a daily and credible dimension emerges of their relationship as a couple in which we can play our role. The amount of dialogue then changes from episode to episode. In the third, where we will have to conduct an investigation, there will be a lot to talk about. Unfortunately, the game is all in English, so those who have difficulty with this language will inevitably find themselves cut off from the world of The Dream Machine, at least until some amateur translation group takes the task of adapting it to heart. The writing in general is quite good, but it would have been nicer to hear the voice of some voice actors. The time of silent graphic adventures has definitely passed, although in this case it is understandable that the developers have preferred to pour their energies into the very laborious creation of the scenarios and animations. The final effect, as you can see from the pictures, is amazing. The characters are very well characterized, even in the facial expressions: probably the most difficult challenge for those who work with clay. As far as the game system is concerned, however, it is an old-fashioned adventure with rose water puzzles, which however grow in difficulty, even reaching the point of requiring a not bad leap of imagination in the third episode (a turn of words to say that we are stuck). Let's hope that this is actually the case and that the fourth and fifth chapters reserve us some memorable challenges to outline the beautiful story told so far. We venture the hypothesis that the subsequent releases will live up to the first three chapters and we gladly forgive the game for a somewhat subdued general presentation (parling of menus, inventory and dialog boxes). So if you haven't played a graphic adventure in recent years, this could be the one to convince you that the genre still has many tricks up its sleeve.", "date": "2012-06-15", "grade": "8.0"}
