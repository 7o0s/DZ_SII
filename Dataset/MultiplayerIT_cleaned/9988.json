The goal of the two contenders is the same: to bring into such a difficult context as many features as possible so far reserved for new generation platforms. In the case of FIFA World Cup South Africa 2010 for PSP, however, the operation cannot be said to be perfectly successful, on the contrary we are faced with an episode that in some ways constitutes a step backwards compared to what was done with FIFA 10. As we well know, the new EA Sports title was created specifically for the World Cup and therefore allows us to use only the national teams instead of the usual, large roster of international clubs to which the regular series has accustomed us for years. The problem is that there have been no steps forward from the gameplay point of view, indeed during the games you come across limitations that seemed to be outdated by now and which end up heavily influencing the experience. We are referring in particular to the AI, which sees our defenders remaining motionless in the face of an offensive maneuver and our attackers reluctant to participate in the actions in the opposing area. If we think that in the ~Lead your nation~ mode most of the work should be done by the players we don't control, the idea takes shape of being in the classic situation where a perfect opportunity (that of creating the definitive portable football game ) is realized in the wrong way. A kick in the heart We have already made it clear that the numbers are not the main problem of FIFA World Cup South Africa 2010, and the presence of almost all the modes seen in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version testifies to it: ~Kick Off~ to play a quick match, ~ FIFA World Cup 2010~ to play an entire World Championship or only the final stages, ~Lead your nation~ to try your hand at a sort of ~career mode~ in which we control a single player in Libero Grande style, ~History of qualifications~ which it presents itself as the classic collection of ~scenarios~ in which we relive historical games, possibly to be straightened out, and the important multiplayer mode both locally and online. As for the extras, we can create a player from scratch, choose a team and default settings or enter a shop where we can spend the points earned with victories on the field to buy new stadiums, balls and more. The range of possibilities offered to us therefore appears broad and in line with the best that can be found in the genre of football simulations, however it is necessary to clarify immediately that online multiplayer works very, very badly. No problems with registering the profile on EA Nation, very fast indeed, nor with matchmaking. No, the flaws are exclusively due to the lag, which transforms matches into a frustrating experience and soon becomes devoid of any attraction: even if you are dealing with an opponent whose connection is signaled by the system as excellent, the actions follow one another in slow motion and even the scrolling of the items in the menus proceeds slowly as a result, so that even making a substitution becomes a tiring operation. With these assumptions, the already far from extraordinary AI of our companions manages to give the worst of itself: on more than one occasion we have seen the opponent kick off and fly directly into our penalty area, without be disturbed by anyone. Furthermore, the ~bank~ plays and the first shots, in such a problematic context, work every other time, forcing us to press the PSP buttons when they are certainly not responsible for the failure to transmit the input. Own goal Luckily the ~offline~ games work much better, with good speed of action and adequate pace. The controls can be changed to assign shooting to the Square button and crossing to the Circle rather than the reverse as the default, for those who have never shaken off the influence of PES. You can also decide whether to set the deep passes and the direction of the crosses in automatic or manual mode: in the second case, the strength of the shots depends on how long we hold down the relative button. Unfortunately, this choice implies a decidedly steep learning curve, which often collides with the already discussed problems of AI. The construction of the maneuver is quite simple; sometimes the ball doesn't go where we want it to, but it doesommatum you are able to set the action as desired. The execution of the crosses on the background is almost always late, and the spectacular scissors on goal that occasionally conclude this type of solution appear simplistic and unnatural, although satisfying in the face of the result obtained. Making corner kicks is really cumbersome, with the analog stick determining the direction of rotation of the ball and the d-pad responsible for directing the shot. Once the ball has been kicked, however, the view remains on the corner attendant and therefore prevents us from doing anything, except pressing the buttons at random in the hope that someone will be able to score a header. Inexplicable. It should also be added that the team management interface (substitutions, form, shooters, etc.) could have been designed better: as it stands, it really requires too many steps even for the simplest operations. From a technical point of view, it is nice to see that some graphic effects (see the ~fading into blur~ when the action is stopped) and some classy touches (the partner who raises his hand to call the ball) have been borrowed from the versions ~major~ of the series, but the fact remains that the polygonal models are really too simple and reveal all their inadequacy during the numerous close-up shots. Even from a distance, however, things don't go who knows how well: the animations very often appear incomplete and proceed jerkily. The commentary, entrusted to the usual duo formed by Fabio Caressa and Beppe Bergomi, is not extraordinary but carries out its task in a more than decent way, while the effects of the stadium and the signed soundtrack fail in any way to break our ears .", "date": "2010-05-28", "grade": "6.8"}
