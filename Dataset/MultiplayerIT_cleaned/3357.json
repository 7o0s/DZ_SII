Whether it was to save himself from prehistoric predators, start the space race or solve a world conflict, man has always turned to cricket, a real panacea for all ills but at the same time a very powerful tool capable of wiping out our race if used incorrectly. Thanks to Cricket Through the Ages, even all those who have been deceived by the fake history that they study in books will finally be able to discover the truth: the greatest invention of human beings is, has been and always will be cricket! Exquisitely accurate cricket This bizarre introduction is necessary to enter the climate of Cricket Through the Ages, a title that doesn't even try to take itself seriously for a second, starting with an absolutely unconventional structure. Usable in its entirety by one or two players, the Devolver title offers six modes to be unlocked progressively, each with an increasingly labile relevance to the reference sport. The common ground is that in any section the screen is occupied by two characters controlled by the users (one obviously by artificial intelligence in case you play alone), who must try to get the better of the other: cricket rarely c 'something goes in, as the real goal is to take down the opponent by any means possible. In a completely random way, the characters can appear on the battlefield with their bare hands, clutching a throwing tool (which is only sometimes actually a cricket ball) or holding a bat or a white weapon, an element that slightly changes the effects of the very simple control system. Holding down a finger on one's half of the display rotates the ~athlete's~ arm on the screen, thus allowing him to throw whatever he has in his hand or to strike with the weapon, while with quick taps he is cascaded towards the 'opponent: we use this verb not by chance, because all of Cricket Through the Ages is based on intentionally unrealistic ragdoll physical routines, which in many cases produce reactions completely beyond the user's control. It is not an exaggeration to say that the success or otherwise in the clashes is almost entirely the result of chance, an aspect that if on the one hand demeans the player's ability, on the other produces hilarious results especially in multiplayer. Failing in Cricket Through the Ages is almost more fun than winning, because it happens in such absurd and unexpected ways that they can't help but elicit laughter. The developers then did their bit, peppering each match with random events that make each match different from the previous one and which we do not want to reveal because it is one of the best parts of Cricket Through the Ages and which deserves to be discovered by playing. However, we can briefly describe the six modes that make up the product offer: the first shares the same name as the application and stages an absurd parable of humanity entirely based on the exploitation of cricket; then there is the Ashes World Cup which offers a series of challenges between nations (and not only) in what can be considered a sort of distant and delusional relative of real cricket; in the English Premier League players use their feet instead of their hands to throw objects, with easily imaginable results; Court Badminton sees an attempt to transfer the extremely dangerous cricket into a closed environment, complete with unpredictable rebounds; World War represents the definitive escalation of cricket's violence, with the player having to advance by eliminating opposing soldiers by hitting them with the bayonet of his rifle or by throwing grenades; finally Cricket Quantico is a soup of all the previous modes capable of giving life to even more absurd situations than those of the ~normal~ game. If it had been sold at a fixed price, Cricket Through the Ages would have been a real joke, but included in the Apple Arcade subscription it absolutely has its why and we feel we can recommend it to all subscribers to the service, were it not more to get some laughs.", "date": "2019-11-22", "grade": "8.4"}
