Whether it has four faces, eight, ten or twenty it doesn't matter, because in the hands of the Master the die ceases to be an inanimate instrument and becomes a judge to be feared and respected. The d20 System, which uses the twenty-sided die as the focal point of D&D mechanics, has been revived and often altered over the years, influencing video games such as Neverwinter Nights, Planescape: Torment and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Made by Japanese developer Side Quest, Cardinal Pixel is a small free to play game that takes a four-sided die and entrusts it with the outcome of small battles between warriors, mages and paladins. Too bad that, in this case, it would have been better not to tempt fate. Cardinal Pixel is a free to play battle game that relies too much on chance A random game At first glance, Cardinal Pixel doesn't differ too much from other tactical RPGs already released on smartphones and tablets. Like Brave Frontier or One Piece: Treasure Cruise, the Side Quest game is a succession of clashes, in which two parties attack each other in turn using the abilities of each character in order to bring the opponent's energy to zero before he is do him. In this case, however, each action is decided by a simple die roll. Both teams start with only one hero on the battlefield, and on their turn the only possible action is to roll a four-sided die. The result thus establishes which of the four abilities at his disposal the hero can use, whether it is to inflict damage on the opponent, heal his team, create a protective barrier or poison one or more characters. Only if the result of the dice roll is equal to 1, is it possible to draw a card from one's deck and reveal it. And if this card were to be a hero, then that hero would take the field strengthening his party and allowing him to choose which of the characters to use on the next die roll. For example, if you have two heroes on the field and the result of the roll is 3, then you could choose whether to use the monk's third ability (~your team recovers 10 life points~) or the alchemist's (~ poisons a random team for three turns~). This intersection between card game and turn-based battles undoubtedly starts from interesting premises, and the willingness of the developers to recreate the typical feeling of some board games is evident. Unfortunately though, the fact that almost everything depends on a roll of the dice puts Cardinal Pixel on par with Christmas bingo or a children's game of the goose, where the winner is determined solely by chance. We talked about the importance of the dice in role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, but in those cases, despite the dice roll affecting the damage of the weapons, the outcome of the actions or even the initial stats in the creation of the characters, the d20 System it remains functional to the gaming experience and to the story, almost never taking over if the hand of a good Master rolls the dice. In Cardinal Pixel, on the other hand, from the coin toss at the start of the game, through the cards drawn from the deck and the ubiquitous d4, too much is due to chance, and the player's ability is almost exclusively limited (and even in this case, only in part) to the creation of one's own team. Theoretically, one is encouraged to create a balanced team, in which the abilities of the various characters are as varied and complementary as possible, so as to have more options to choose from with a single die roll. Heroes, however, are obtained by unpacking packs of cards, once again letting luck dictate the game. And even if a well-built team has a better chance of winning a match, this doesn't necessarily happen: we've had the best against players with a much more advanced team, but there's no satisfaction in knowing that you have won a match just because you were luckier. And this is perhaps Cardinal Pixel's most serious problem: your ability counts for zero, and the game does absolutely nothing to mask it. The result is a completely passive experience, unable to give the player the euphoria of a victory or the desire to improve after a defeat.", "date": "2016-01-05", "grade": "4.0"}
