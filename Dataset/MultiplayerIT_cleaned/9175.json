These protagonists of video games A burning start Black Mirror III begins with the fire of the family castle that wipes out much of the Gordons' affairs, allowing the spotlight to shift to Darren Michaels or, rather, Adrian Gordon. But coincidentally both the stake and the murders perpetrated by the protagonist's sister are blamed on him, the stranger who has brought chaos to the village. Fortunately, the circumstantial evidence is not enough for a lightning trial and so, after two weeks of waiting in the comfortable cells of Willow Creek, a mysterious benefactor pays the bail and launches the final adventure of the saga. The situation is desperate and we find ourselves having to manage a hero possessed by a dark presence and therefore unpredictable, but if nothing else without handcuffs we have the opportunity to seek a solution. Provided that the demon we have inside allows us to find an escape from a future made up of skimpy cells, which could be followed by a nice tour in eternal damnation. Two of the key characters are introduced to us immediately and they are the skeptical police chief, who obviously holds us guilty, and the psychiatrist who follows our case. But the NPCs are many and the adventure overflows with specks typical of English yellow and imagery linked to British rural villages. Not all the characters are always credible, first of all the protagonist who remains too naive after everything that has happened to him, but it is a question of scene needs that must give rise and contrast to the reactions of Darren's ~possessed~ soul. Towards the coveted ending of the story Black Mirror III retraces the path traced by the previous two chapters and at first glance does not bring substantial changes to the engine or to the look of the title. So we find the usual English rural atmosphere, secrets to discover and spot on jokes. On the other hand, the past two chapters have found some success among lovers of graphic adventures and distorting the formula would have made no sense. Yet, if the protagonist's movements were softer and more believable, we certainly wouldn't have complained. Fortunately, double-clicking the mouse activates rapid movement and this detail is capable of ~hiding~ the lack of the title in terms of animations. To help us then we find another shortcut activated by pressing the space bar which shows all the points of interest of a location with specific icons for elements to observe, dialogue possibilities and exits. Finally, to complete the interface, the classic inventory bar that appears when the cursor passes in the lower part of the screen. From a technical point of view, as we have anticipated, there are no changes of any kind. On the other hand, the overall performance remains valid, with very detailed screens and often enriched by rather accurate animations, lights, grass that moves in the wind and numerous reflective surfaces. And even the interlude scenes show a certain care, at least in the shots and in the editing. Too bad for the models that in the movies are decidedly inferior to those used in the title and are characterized by wrong proportions and awkward movements. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is acceptable and generally manages to recreate an atmosphere of mystery and silent waiting for the terrible events that will necessarily have to happen. Furthermore, during the particularly tense scenes, the now canonical contextual pieces start which are fundamental for generating pathos. Obviously there is no lack of dubbing, in English and subtitled in Italian, which is as always valid even if in certain dramatic situations some jokes are less credible and too theatrical. However, on balance, Black Mirror III does its duty both as a sequel and as a conclusion by revealing some background that has remained pending since the first chapter. Furthermore, the adventure introduces the possibility of using two characters even if this element does not vary the gameplay that much. And the same also applies to the possession of the protagonist which is not exalted properly and is used in a rather trivial way to create often superfluous ~skits~. In any case, the title can count on some peculiarities, at least in relation to the point and click genre, such as the possibility of dying, optional secrets and puzzles released from the main plot.", "date": "2011-07-14", "grade": "7.0"}
