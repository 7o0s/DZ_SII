Seeing a character linked to titles such as System Shock, Deus Ex and Thief genuinely enthusiastic about working on the Disney universe has always had a certain effect, just as the tests on the preliminary versions of the game have tended to leave a good taste in the mouth. In a Christmas devoid of a ~heavy~ game made in Nintendo (although recognizing the goodness of the imminent Donkey Kong Country Returns), a large part of the expectations for Wii owners therefore clearly rested on the shoulders of the most famous mouse in the world who don't want to settle for Party or Casual game. Not just mice That Epic Mickey was not the ~classic~ Disney game (or toy) had actually been understood from the moment Spector's name was associated with the project, but any further details revealed during development only confirmed this belief. The background of Mickey's adventure is in fact as unusual as in general the setting that forms the background to the title of Junction Point Studios; the kingdom of Rifiutolandia (Italian translation certainly not at the level of the original Wasteland) is in fact the place where the characters of the forgotten Disney adventures live, no longer used in ~modern~ adventures, or even discarded when they were simple sketches. Who remembers, for example, Gambadilegno, Clarabella and Orazio, just to name a few? Evidently few, yet all these former co-stars and supporting actors have not vanished into thin air; simply, they retired to this place created especially for them which sees the rabbit as ~sovereign~ Oswald, one of the very first Disney heroes but soon supplanted by the luckier Mickey Mouse. And in the end they wouldn't even be doing badly, because Rifiutolandia is also a nice little place; it's a pity that, as in the best comic stories, ~something~ very serious happens which seriously upsets the balance that had been created, forcing the usual Mickey Mouse to try to remedy it. A fascinating and sincerely engaging background, enhanced by the graphic style that acts as a common thread between the various locations that the hero with the huge ears will find himself visiting; gloomy, dark, not too covertly ~Timburtonian~, in short, the exact opposite of that brilliant, luminous and perfect world that we are used to associating with Disney stories. And this contrast, this distortion between the ~usual~ and the unusual which instead forms the basis of Epic Mickey, is undoubtedly the main value of Junction Point Studios' effort, as well as the winning intuition that actually pushes us to continue in the game , simply for the pleasure and curiosity of discovering new places and characters. For heaven's sake, not that the gameplay itself is scarce, but perhaps a bit disappointing yes, at least in the face of the expectations of the eve. Cartoons Epic Mickey is a somewhat platform action adventure, with a pinch of RPG, shaken and well mixed; in some ways it recalls Zelda, for other Psychonauts, for many Banjo Kazooie. Basically the game is divided into 3 macro sections that alternate and within which the balance of its fundamental components shifts. There are therefore areas more focused on interaction with other characters, dialogues and the resolution of more or less simple quests; others instead more focused on action and fights within 3D areas, and finally purely 2D platform connection sequences often distinguished by the black and white stylistic code that is linked to the animated stories of the 30s. In most of the time the gameplay develops on the basis of Mickey's use of the magic brush, the main element which in fact constitutes the only real and concrete source of originality in the mechanics studied by Warren Spector's team; in summary, using the aforementioned tool it is possible to use the color or the solvent on certain and numerous parts of the settings. This allows you to actively interact with them in such a way as to make them appear or disappear, to favor one's progression or possibly generate chain reactions. The simplest example can be to make the floor disappear under a pile of rocks blocking the passage, so as to make them fall; or on the contrary, color a bridge to be able to pass safely. But there are many more solutions and above all much more complex and satisfying to discover, and they are used in a surprising variety of playful contexts, albeit with fluctuating results. And particularly interextant is also the aspect of ~morality~ present in the game, which in fact evaluates the actions of the protagonist on the basis of the way in which they are performed. Many of the proposed objectives can in fact be addressed both in a ~good~ and ~bad~ way, and the relevance of the consequences pushes the player to become attached to and constantly pursue his own inclination. For example, to open a large door you can either eliminate all the enemies that defend it, or alternatively go and activate a couple of televisions (!!?) to be reached with a certain effort between various platforms and climbs. Or again, it is perhaps possible to recover the proof of Gambadilegno's innocence with regard to a certain event and decide whether to use it for this purpose in an ethically correct manner, or instead exchange it for a precious brooch, giving in to one's own greed. It must be said that even the worst of conduct will never give rise to a ~truly~ bad Mickey Mouse, but in any case it is a satisfying and well-implemented aspect of gameplay. The paintbrush also becomes important within the not-too-exciting combat system, as enemies can be eliminated via solvent blasts or made friendly with paint. Goofy in pieces Up to now the description is that of an exceptional title at the level of the best Nintendo productions, and potentially the fate of Epic Mickey could have been just that, but unfortunately a series of more or less important problems fatally reduce the final evaluation. The fact that it lacks the revolutionary and innovative charge that had been envisaged during development, in reality we do not think it represents a real defect; certainly playing Epic Mickey often brings to mind the 3D platformers on the crest of the wave at the end of the 90s, but the fact that in recent years this genre has almost disappeared transforms a gameplay into fresh that in reality for large stretches it is not at all. The biggest and most decisive real problem is certainly the fact that Junction Point Studios' effort is a discontinuous game, which alternates big highs with heavy lows. Moments of pure gameplay that seem to come directly from one of Miyamoto's best works find space alongside other boring, frustrating or simply unfunny passages; a misstep, this, which significantly resizes Warren Spector's creature, and which prevents Epic Mickey from having that completeness and consistency which is typical, for example, of the greatest masterpieces churned out by Nintendo itself. In addition to this, the mediocre management of the camera weighs heavily on the enjoyment of the experience, really irritating and often unable to effectively follow the action; especially in the more demanding platform sections it is far from rare to run into errors not attributable to the player but to the view proposed by the game. The possibility of acting manually is obviously a palliative, and it is a pity at the end of 2010 that we are still talking about this type of problem. On the other hand, the technical component is excellent; needless to talk about the usual and well-known limitations of the Wii, Epic Mickey is a beautiful game to watch not only for the fascinating artistic direction, but also for the quality of the graphics engine that manages with discrete ease settings rich in details and complex in their horizontal and vertical. Of note are the cut scenes inspired by the style of the artist Mary Blair. The soundtrack is also splendid, with exciting pieces orchestrated in perfect Disney tradition. Evolution of a mouse Epic Mickey is an important project for Spector, it is for Nintendo, but it is even more so for Disney. There have been excellent cartoon tie-ins in the past - remaining in the murine field, it is a must to mention Mickey Mania, born in 1994, developed by Traveller's Tales - but never had a video game been put at the forefront as in this case: starting from Epic Mickey, and therefore from the aspect that Spector and company have developed, Disney will begin the reconstruction of the image of Mickey Mouse. The most famous rat in the world appeared in public for the first time in 1928, and at the time it was more reckless and mischievous, characteristics that were visually reflected in a greater use of black and in less playful, more disturbing animations and expressions and animalistic of the current ones. From then on he never stopped evolving, but always continuing on the path of humanization: this process, whose main responsible was the great Gottfredson, slowly overturned Mickey Mouse, both in personality (he became a model hero/citizen) than in appearance (abandon long johns for men's suits, softer eyes, animations more morbide). This change has undergone a degenerating paroxysm from the 90s onwards, in fact in the last two decades Mickey Mouse has become the company's feel-good mascot, and many have begun to perceive him as a ~plastic~ character. Disney intends to relaunch its image before the break with the public becomes exaggerated: not a total return to the past - it would be too risky - but an ideal mix between the Mickey Mouse of the 30s and today's hero of Mickey Mouse. It is still too early to understand what character changes this new adventure will lead to, while we can already appreciate the visual innovations: the protagonist of Epic Mickey is slimmer and less chubby than usual, he has red knickers again, no pink on his face, but above all he returned to show off the splendid and grotesque ~button~ eyes, with no white spaces to humanize his face. These changes, as well as in the video game, can be admired in the concomitant graphic novel, written by Peter David and drawn by Fabio Celoni.Alessandro Bacchetta", "date": "2010-11-30", "grade": "8.0"}
