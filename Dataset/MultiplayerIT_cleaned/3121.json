{"name": "Sakura Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sakura-wars-recensione.html", "text": "The Sakura Wars review cannot fail to open with a reflection on the legacy of the series: as we wrote in our preview, if over time we have been able to enjoy games such as Persona and Mass Effect it is also thanks to this series and its innovative (for the time it was introduced) LIPS system that affects dialogue with other characters. Although in Japan it has crossed the videogame border to become an integral part of its culture, in the West its expansion has been significantly reduced and the last chapter published, years after the original launch, now dates back to a decade ago with Sakura Wars : So long, my love. Precisely from here SEGA has decided to restart the series, with a fresh chapter capable of speaking to both historical fans and those approaching this series for the first time: if the first hours of the game had satisfied us, once we got to the end of the adventure we can confirm the excellent impressions but with some reservations. Sakura Wars keeps up the honor of the old guard, emerging from the rubble of the past in and out of the game, but it does so with some slight compromises. A new Flower Division Sakura Wars follows the same path as the previous chapters: the appointment of a new captain who can lead, in this specific case, the Flower Division twelve years after the battle of Tokyo which confined the Archdemon where he could do no harm. This division is a special military unit that uses the theater as a cover: its members are in fact both skilled fighters and excellent actors and work on two fronts to ensure the well-being of the people. On the one hand they face and defeat every threat that may arise in Tokyo, on the other they keep the morale of the population high with ad hoc shows which at the same time allow the economic management of the theatre. Sakura Wars is set in a Taisho era halfway between real and steampunk, offering a unique vision of the Japanese capital thanks to a considerable effort in terms of aesthetics. The newly promoted captain Seijuro Kamiyama and the team are entrusted to the pencil of Tite Kubo (Bleach), which although it pays homage to Japan's aesthetic folklore, deviates from the 90s traits that characterized the previous chapters by opting for a more modern and pleasant approach - were it not for the tendency to create at least one too prosperous character along the lines of Rangiku Matsumoto. A pity both because the characterization of the characters is another strong aspect of Sakura Wars and because there has always been a refined elegance in the way the protagonists are dressed and this cheekiness feels like a sour note in a pleasant symphony . In any case, Seijuro arrives in Tokyo fresh from promotion and finds himself having to deal with a Flower Division that drags on in the glories of those who preceded it: the theater struggles to go ahead due to a lack of funds that prevents the mass on the stage of captivating works and to make the situation worse is the inexperience of the girls, whose good will is not enough to avoid tragicomic scenes. Seijuro's task will be to bring the Flower Division back to its former glory both on the battlefield and on stage: the story therefore proceeds on two parallel tracks, one along which the main plot unfolds between demons to eradicate and a world competition to be won in order not to be definitively resigned from their role as protectors; the other instead traces the real strong point of the series or the interaction between the captain and the other characters, in particular the girls of the team with whom a romantic relationship can be established during the eight chapters. A relationship built around trust, affection and possibly keeping Seijuro's perverted side in check when the game gives us the opportunity to do so. Despite everything, it is quite easy to choose the path of the dutiful captain, since many answers are so out of context that choosing them would depend solely on the player's goliardic will. Others, on the other hand, could be more nuanced, or the situation can be reversed and push us to be strict in spite of everything, creating an interesting balance. In all of this, the characterization of the characters stands out, each unique in its own kind, with the individual personal stories of the girls very well outlined in the chapters dedicated to them and interesting to the point of being able to push you to backtrack on a romance that you had not previously considered . The LIPS system once again proves to be the backbone of Sakura Wars, yet the feeling is that despite our answers, the plot would not have undergone significant changes of course, as well as the romances: evenand wanting to be perverted, the turning points (and therefore of regained confidence) are often dictated by the plot and are particularly imposed in the finale, letting us continue on a very linear track in which the importance of our choices is not very felt. In itself it is not a big bad, since the story is well written and lays the foundations of the animated sequel currently in the air, but we would have appreciated a few more nuances especially in terms of replay value. The protectors of Tokyo Beyond the small problems of the heart, Sakura Wars presents a conflict that goes beyond the boundaries of the battlefield to primarily touch the protagonists: each chapter is a struggle against oneself to prove one's worth, to be a useful element to the team and above all that one's diversity is not something to be ashamed of or considered dangerous. The game uses the concrete threat of demons very well as a glue between the past and a future to be built, because after twelve years of peace the outline of a new threat on the horizon makes it clear how much - at least as far as Tokyo is concerned - we had settled down too much on the laurels of a victory that seemed to have put an end to all evil. This is not the case and our heroes will find themselves thrown onto a battlefield that is both physical and moral: only by overcoming their doubts and therefore developing that relationship of trust that holds the entire division together, will they be able to overcome any other adversity. Courage, friendship and loyalty therefore seem to be the pillars of a possible new trend for the series, which also embraces the internationalization work started by Red Entertainment ever since it decided to shift the focus to Paris and New York: although the story takes place however in Japan, a world competition has in fact been called which brings the factions of London and Berlin to take the field, enhanced by the trait of artists of the caliber of BUNBUN and Fumikane Shimada - without counting the intervention of Shigenori Soejima and Ken Sugimori for some secondary characters. Sakura Wars is a choral work designed to restart the saga in gear, cloaking it in a modernity that goes hand in hand with the beauty of the graphics engine in play. Even the best strategy has a flaw and in this case it is attributed to the gameplay, when it comes to taking your mecha and launching an attack: Sakura Wars abandons the strategic soul to become a small-scale musou. If at the beginning it could have seemed like an action RPG, continuing on we realized that throughout its duration the game has been stripped of any RPG element and there is no progression outside of morale during the combat phases, the increase of which affects attack and defense of the team (as well as the decline penalizes them). There are no dungeons in the true sense of the term, since the path is very linear, only groups of enemies to be destroyed in order to move forward to the boss: a scheme that will soon be repetitive, also thanks to an uninspired and monotonous level design with exception of the final stages. The enemies themselves don't vary much and can be defeated with incredible ease especially when we are allowed to use Anastasia, who is in fact very OP compared to the rest of the team. The diversification of the individual members of the Flower Division brings a slight fresh breath but considering the structure of each chapter such that we will be called to use a specific girl without the possibility of choice (provided we do not want to replay the battles via the terminal in the theater), you can't be exactly free. The only fixed presence is obviously Kamiyama, whose command scheme has some attacks more effective than others and therefore will push us to use the same key combination in every fight. The level of challenge is very low and we understand it, because the focus of the game is more on its social and narrative component: just as we understand the need to adopt a genre other than the strategic one which would have unnecessarily slowed down an already rather staid pace of the game, opting for an approach designed to bring as many players as possible, but despite the fact that the space dedicated to the clashes is significantly lower than the rest, it is almost a nuisance to get rid of in order to move forward with the plot, rather than an opportunity to test one's skills on the field. Having introduced the world competition as an interlude was undoubtedly a good idea but the mechanics are not that different from the rest of the game, making it a pleasant diversion and little more. Good first The choice to sacrifice the combat system in order to enhance a valid narrative and staging is clearthe entire rebuild work of the series: Sakura Wars is like the plays that the girls undertake to stage, beautiful to see, live and above all listen to, thanks to the soundtrack composed by the historic author Kohei Tanaka, able to offer an excellent mix between historical pieces and other more modern ones. Excellent work also in terms of dubbing (available only in the original Japanese language), which contributes a lot to the characterization of the characters and maintains a basic musicality capable of bringing with it the theatrical spirit that accompanies the entire game. Not all the scenes are dubbed and this could leave you bewildered for a moment but, overall, the vast majority are those that are fully acted so in the long run you pay less and less attention. Lastly, the localization of the game is only available in English but considering how niche the game is in the West, having been off the radar for ten years, it's an understandable choice. Although the more action side of Sakura Wars can be controversial, the beauty of the game lies in the storytelling and in the genuine way it manages to convey emotions: in this respect, Sakura Wars wins hands down and represents an excellent restart of the series, thanks also to a splendid rendering of the settings, with perfectly realized urban fringes. In spite of the linearity, it is an engaging experience that takes us by the hand exactly like a play and accompanies us through a story that focuses heavily on the rediscovery of oneself. Take the combat cutscenes and the occasional - but enjoyable - mini-game as a break between acts, where you can catch a breather before diving back into the narrative.", "date": "2020-04-27", "grade": "8.0"}
