{"name": "Lost in Blue 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lost-in-blue-2-recensione.html", "text": "Survival Kids In 1994, Silmarils released a game with a decidedly interesting concept, called Robinson's Requiem, and put the player in the role of a space explorer shipwrecked on a savage planet. The free exploration and almost total management of the character made everything very interesting and new, but the lack of a guide and the amount of parameters to keep under control meant a great difficulty often resulting in frustration. As if to demonstrate that the concept of the virtual castaway is destined for a common, sad destiny, the same sensations seem to emerge playing Lost in Blue 2, although it is clearly a smoother game, filtered through Japanese taste and care. Basically, the game structure is based on the exploration of the island and on the management of the characters so that they basically stay alive, doing exactly what tradition suggests: find a place to shelter, collect food and water, go to hunting and fishing, just like a new Robinson Crusoe. Once the protagonist has been chosen between the boy and the girl, we find ourselves on the beach of the island: the game action is displayed on the lower screen, while the upper one can show, as desired (and variable by simply pressing a button) the map of the area or a summary screen of Jack and Amy's ~physiological~ situation, with the parameters corresponding to primary needs (hunger, thirst, physical strength) and the global health situation. The user interface takes full advantage of the potential of the Nintendo DS touch screen, and in some cases also of the microphone, with the feasible actions that vary according to the surrounding context: the ~action~ key allows you to do different things such as picking up objects, dig, climb, jump or drink water, depending on where we are in the game environment. The various sub-menus allow the use and organization of objects, the combination of these to create new tools (a stick and a line form a fishing rod, wood and bark create a flint, and so on), or allow the character to rest. The gameplay consists of the exploration and object collection section, and a series of mini-games that are triggered for each particular situation, from creating tools to cooking, from hunting and fishing to simply lighting a fire. Most of the problems of the game derive precisely from the very structure of the gameplay: for most of the time, at least until the moment in which you manage to delegate part of the workload to your partner, you find yourself having to repeat the short mini-games needed to cook, or make a fire, or collect shells from the sand. These fragments of the game are certainly original in conception, but unfortunately the adjective ~fun~ does not suit them almost at all. Basically, the game sessions of Lost in Blue 2, in the first long hours, are reduced to anxiously checking the vital parameters of the characters, and to a frantic search for food and water. The exploration of the island must be precisely dosed and balanced with respect to the autonomy of the characters, and the sense of freedom given by the large island available is strongly undermined by the need to feed the boys practically continuously. The Young Marmots We have said that the game structure is largely based on mini-games, but it is impossible to label Lost in Blue 2 as yet another simple container of gameplay fragments collected together. There's a fair amount of logic behind the way the game prompts you to do various actions. To give some examples, an occupation that you will often have to devote yourself to is cooking: once near the work surface, you can decide whether to cook ~cold~ or on the grill, and select the ingredients to use. If it is fruit or vegetables, you will have to cut it by simulating the knife with the stylus, if instead you want to make some seaweed or grilled mushrooms, you will find yourself keeping an eye on their cooking and having to turn them at the right moment, with the consequent circular movement to be performed on the touch screen. In some cases, even the microphone of the console is called into question, with the now usual action of blowing towards it: to light a fire, for example, it will first be necessary to touch the right arm and the left arm of the character with the stylus, in order to create a uniform movement of the stick on the wood; once the spark is lit, we will have to feed the flame by blowing into the microphone. While representing moments detached from the normal exploration phase of the game, also framed by a visualizationfirst-person action different from the basic one, these various actions integrate quite well into the playful continuum, without giving too much the impression of botched gimmicks with the aim of somehow justifying the use of the touch screen, or attempts to give liveliness to the gameplay. Something is changed? The first Lost in Blue was released in November 2005, two years later this sequel does not represent a particular step forward from a technical point of view, or as regards the game structure. Basically, the changes made are minimal, and in any case fail to increase the appeal of the original game: this means that those who enjoyed the first chapter will find this second enjoyable, while those who have not managed to get in tune with the shipwrecked Konami the first time, they are unlikely to succeed now. The general impression is that the developers have done very little to justify the number 2 on the side of the game title, although there are variations. The most obvious is the size of the island in which the adventure is set, much higher than that of the first chapter, and the amount of animals, vegetables and objects with which we are dealing in this new episode, which is reflected in a greater variety of situations in which we will find ourselves involved and in new actions to be carried out to deal with them. As previously reported, the game now allows you to choose the protagonist between the boy or the girl with the choice that determines the variations in the dialogues between the two, although it does not affect the course of the story. The multiplayer game mode has also been included, with which it is possible to perform in pairs in some of the mini-games of the Lost in Blue repertoire. The most consistent novelty, albeit not very evident at first, is the new type of relationship that is established between the two castaways, which gradually assumes ever greater importance, giving a different step to the whole game. In fact, the adventure companion is no longer a simple burden to carry around and to look after carefully, but takes an active part in the action, and if suitably instructed can carry out important and useful actions. The real significance of this introduction comes out over the distance, since at first the partner will not be able to do much, and in any case to do it well, but by persevering his skills will increase, and we will be able to assign him increasingly demanding tasks, making him an indispensable help and an excellent method to lighten the pressure of the various duties on the protagonist, who will be able to delegate many of the basic actions and concentrate on the exploration of the island. From a technical point of view, there are no particular steps forward: although we are now seeing games that fully exploit the graphics potential of the Nintendo DS, Lost in Blue 2 is practically the same as its predecessor. If the appearance of the first could be pleasant, and in any case decent within what can be defined as the first generation of software for the Nintendo portable, the development has made great strides lately, and this Konami title does not appear definitely in step with the times. The most that can be said of the graphics of Lost in Blue 2 is that it is functional, decidedly simple and very uninspired. The island that acts as a setting is much larger than that of its predecessor, but the graphic style adopted is the same, some mini-games appear practically the same and even the 2D representations of the characters are decidedly similar to what has been seen previously. Ultimately, it is clear how Konami, from a graphic point of view, has worked on savings. The audio sector, for its part, performs its function satisfactorily, with atmospheric music, standard sound effects and the presence of some short fragments of sampled speech. Comment The idea behind Lost in Blue 2 is undoubtedly fascinating, but having arrived at the second chapter without particular variations in the structure, one wonders if it is really suitable for a video game. The Konami title is neither a real adventure nor a complete management simulation, even if it has some elements, since the pure fun of one is missing and the sense of control and rational planning of the other. You find yourself running desperately in search of food and water, most of the time, and performing actions that, in the end, are far from being fun. The difficulty curve in this game takes on the worrying aspect of an insurmountable wall: if you have the constancy to persevere, it is possible to glimpse, and even enjoy, that adventure that lies beyond the search for food for the protagonists, but all the others will run into tedium and frustrationtraction of the first hours of the game, abandoning Lost in Blue 2 well before properly entering the heart of the action. Obviously, for those who have appreciated the first one it is an almost safe purchase, for all the others it is advisable to try it and see if the fascinating atmosphere manages to overcome the shortcomings of the gameplay. Pros The concept is original and interesting By persevering, you can discover an excellent adventure Cons Technically poor Boring and frustrating in the first few hours of the game Little news compared to the first chapter The charm of the shipwrecked man, forced to survive against the adversities of nature on a desert island, seems to have remained intact from Defoe's Robinson Crusoe to the present day, albeit transfigured very often, as in some recent television and cinema productions. Lost in Blue 2 keeps intact the original spirit of the challenge against the wild nature, of the use of reason to solve problems and be able to survive, just like in the work of Defoe. While obviously devoid of the Enlightenment propaganda intentions that characterized the adventures of good old Crusoe, the Konami game contains the challenge and drama of survival, the adventure and thrill of exploration, together with a certain amount of interpersonal relationships. The concept behind the game is therefore simple but very interesting: following the shipwreck of the boat he was on, the protagonist arrives on a desert island, where he meets a companion, with whom he finds himself facing the pitfalls of nature but also, above all, to think about one's physiological needs. Unlike its predecessor, the game allows you to choose between the male character, Jack (no, not the one from Lost...) and the female one, Amy, thus avoiding any possible problem of sexual discrimination. In both cases however, whether you choose to play Jack or Amy, the story and the aim of the game remain the same: to survive and find a way back home.", "date": "2007-06-06", "grade": null}
