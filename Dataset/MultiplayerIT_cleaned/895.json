{"name": "Batman Begins", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/batman-begins.html", "text": "I need a symbol The plot of the game faithfully follows that of the film, with some licenses aimed at better integrating story and game action; nothing substantial, and then here we are to retrace the very first exploits of the Pipistrellone in Gotham City, as well as a brief but intense training in the Himalayan mountains still in the role of Bruce Wayne. Let's not dwell on the plot yet: if you've seen the film you know what to expect, if you haven't seen it, sorry, but what are you waiting for? Anyone who has a minimum of knowledge of Batman certainly knows that our superhero has many abilities, developed over years of very hard training: first of all, a physical form that to define as dazzling would be doing her an injustice, and the almost perfect knowledge of numerous forms of combat with bare hands, with white weapons and with throwing and firearms (but our hero doesn't use the latter, it's a gun that stole his childhood); then very fine detective skills, extraordinary scientific skills, the boat of money and the financial empire received as an inheritance and expertly made to fruit and, which never hurts, a moderate success with women. Eurocom certainly could not avoid instilling all these talents also in the virtual counterpart I need a symbol All this leads the Batman of the comics to perform many different actions in his fight against crime, investigate, invent and make the best use of his ~magnificent toys~, give her a thrashing. One of the things that Nolan's film does best is to restore this multifaceted aspect of the character, and Eurocom certainly could not fail to infuse all these talents also to the virtual counterpart: in the role of the Dark Knight it will be your task to explore huge and intricate environments, moving as silently as possible, escaping the gazes of enemies and if necessary showing off circus acrobatics to overcome various obstacles; investigate the shady plans of the bad guys on duty, both by looking around for evidence and documents and by kindly convincing a big stinker to talk, beating hands like savages and in a couple of missions even putting yourself at the wheel of the absolutely fantastic Batmobile from the film, a concentration of speed, robustness and textbook wickedness. There are therefore many things to do, but it's nothing that hasn't already been seen, even all together, in a video game. And so what? Criminals are a cowardly and superstitious breed The film has a single central theme around which the whole mechanism revolves: fear. Little Bruce's fear of having been the cause of his parents' deaths, the atavistic fear always of Wayne, but this time also of the adult one, for bats, the fear he intends to use to protect his city and prevent other children from having to suffer like him It's incredible, sorry for the parenthesis, how well the director and screenwriters managed first of all to identify (it's just a few vignettes from a very old story by Bob Kane), and then to develop this theme in the film, which is actually indissoluble from the myth of Batman; in earlier films, even Burton's excellent ones, it was almost entirely missing. Returning to us, even the programmers have decided to insert this concept into the game mechanics, and it is actually a new thing: by exploiting his thousand skills as well as the possibilities offered by a carefully studied level design, Batman can inspire fear , fear and then real terror in his victims, so that, at the moment of combat, they find themselves facing little more than frightened and often unarmed big men unable to respond to his blows. Everything is managed audiovisually through indicators that are sometimes difficult to read and much more explicit reproductions of a heartbeat, the faster the greater the fear of the criminal. A concept of this kind, reading it on paper, is frankly exhilarating: first of all, the choice would be upstream, face the opponents head on or have fun scaring them first; then, in the case of the second option, one could indulge in finding the best way, or even just the most fun and spectacular one, to do it. So much freedom, and finally the need to use gray matter in a superhero tie-in. Batman Begins is one of the smoothest games in this universe Criminals are a cowardly and superstitious breed It is a pity that Eurocom has exploited these possibilities almost for nothing: Batman Begins is one of the most linear games in this universe, and if the structure of the apparently labyrinthine but in reality completely unique levels is not even a despicable thing, it is to see that in reality right in the approach to combat we are given no choice which triggers disappointment. It is notthat you can choose to frighten your opponents before fighting them, you must do so, otherwise you will be slaughtered in an instant by the hail of machine guns; and even the choice of the best way to create terror does not exist, simply because on each occasion there will be only one, suggested moreover by the game system which will identify for you the ~sensitive~ points on which to act. A big, big wasted opportunity: the idea of introducing fear as an active element of the game system was fantastic, and we hope that the discussion will be explored in the future. Despite proclamations and promises, what we have before us is therefore a canonical game action, which draws with both hands a little here and a little there; moreover, the difficulty is calibrated downwards, both in combat and in exploration, and advice will always be generously given to you by the faithful Alfred Pennyworth. Even the stealth element is nothing more than a sweetened version of Splinter Cell: to get behind the unsuspecting enemy and surprise him, just enter Stealth Mode and press the appropriate button at the right time. That's all, no tension, no emotion. At least the levels are numerous and above all huge, even two hours per mission; three difficulty levels then guarantee a minimum of challenge. Year One Among the many stories on paper that inspire the film (the effort of the production and the respect for the fans is commendable), the extraordinary Year One by Frank Miller undoubtedly stands out, the man who single-handedly reinvented the Batman myth with First Dark Knight Returns and then this Year One, drawn by a sensual David Mazzucchelli and colored by a ~noiresque~ Richmond Lewis. Nothing but the story of the origins of Batman as Bob Kane tells us, but reinterpreted by Miller in the light of his sensibilities and of his time, also giving great space to two other darlings of fans from all over the world, Gordon and Catwoman . A timeless masterpiece, if you haven't read it, get it in the comic book store! My city Where the game succeeds very well is in all the technical / aesthetic and exploitation of the license aspect. We are probably facing the multiplatform title with the best graphics on the market: everything is made in an exceptional way and with great care, and in particular the Batman model impresses, very faithful to the filmic counterpart, equipped with an impressive number of animations, very fluid and convincing. But you just need to look at the cloak, how it moves, to be exalted. The main character models are wonderful too, Ducard and Jonathan Crane, Falcone and Agent Flass look just like them; the only exception seems to be Rachel, Bruce Wayne's childhood friend here in the classic role of the beauty to be saved: Katie Holmes is definitely prettier. For once, even the models of the minor characters do not disfigure, read ~cannon fodder~, who, although for obvious reasons not up to the height of their more important colleagues, defend themselves quite well. And the scenarios The environments of the film are reproduced with care and mania, without saving on polygons and with textures that manage to appear bright and clean even on PlayStation 2! In this way the completely fictitious sensation of enormous complexity of the environment is restored, not to mention the effects of light and shadows which are heavily inspired by Splinter Cell, and which are also impeccably made. Flaws such as interpenetration of polygons and collisions that are a bit busted in some cases remain, but on the other hand, nobody is perfect, and the graphics are promoted with flying colors. The music is that of the film and therefore whether they are beautiful or not is not a merit or a fault of the programmers, but the sound design is wise, wisely dosing the use of the songs to leave some moments of silence in which only the convincing sound effects they are responsible for creating the atmosphere. Where the game succeeds very well is in all the technical / aesthetic and exploitation of the license aspect. My city And speaking of atmosphere, one can only bow their heads in front of those who have managed so well to bring the atmosphere of the film, and consequently of the comics, into a video game: graphics and sound at very high levels are used for this, and in the midst of everything the dialogues and the dubbing stand out on which the original screenwriters and actors worked. Hearing Alfred perfectly interpreted in one of his innumerable pearls of English humor while you are busy exploring the eerie corridors of Arkham is an experience that alone is worth the price of admission for a fan, believe me! A note, however, for the Italian dubbing, which also made use of the film's voice actors for the main characters, who, however, are already inferior to the original version; also all the ifsThe simple thugs of this or that super villain are entrusted to the usual ~skills~ who don't put an iota of interpretation: if you can, play it in English. This is therefore what the game does best, exalt the fans of the film and the comic who will identify in the blink of an eye in the character, situations and settings; finally, not to be disdained by the copious load of extras and bonuses to unlock, always in the name of attention for the fans. And the fans thank you. Seen and considered that when one judges a video game what counts in the end is the game itself, one can only be partially disappointed by Batman Begins, which on few occasions goes beyond carrying out the homework, quite amusing, linear, without too many demands, and it makes it even more angry if you think of the possibilities that the concept of ~fear~ opened up for designers. Perhaps it is not even the best Batman of the generation, with the first of Ubisoft who could very well have his say in a possible challenge. Having said that, however, one thing is clear: if you liked the film and/or generally adore the most charismatic character of the comicdom, you will get married with BB: the film is already a fantastic tribute to Gotham City and its fans , and for the transitive property with the game it is the same speech. Graphics, sound, settings, lights, shadows All made to the max, playing you will be Batman. And it doesn't matter if in the end you are told all there is to do, if you are a fan know that the only way to identify yourself even more in the character would be to put a hood on your head, a sheet behind your shoulders and climb neighborhood roofs. Take a seat Pro Multi-platform yet beautiful to see License exploited to the max! Certainly fun... Against...but not very stimulating Wasted the idea of fear In the cinema, it's called Batman Begins, but it could very well be called ~Wet dream of a ten-year Caped Crusader fanatic finally come true~, and there would be nothing excessive. Title length aside, sure. I don't know if it is understood, but the undersigned reviewer really liked the fifth Batman film, perfect as it is in bringing to the big screen that dark, noble, incredibly charismatic character that we read in DC books; months and months of intimidation of those in charge and the goal of grabbing the review of the obligatory tie-in has finally been achieved: will it be worth it?", "date": "2005-06-30", "grade": null}
