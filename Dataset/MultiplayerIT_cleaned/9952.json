They are all products developed by Bohemia Interactive Studio. For the last ten years this Prague-based team has worked exclusively on war-themed titles, developing an extraordinarily powerful graphics engine capable of ensuring a level of detail and depth of field that is truly rare. Fundamental elements when the objective is to show scenarios on the screen that extend for kilometers but which boast a surprising degree of realism in close-up views, moreover reacting to our actions in a timely manner. Try driving one of the many armored vehicles available in the ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead campaign and firing a cannon at a house: the walls will shatter while smoke and dust will cover the horizon for long moments. Similarly, attacking a vehicle with the same weapon will result in an explosion with a lot of ~jumping~ of the vehicle itself, or at least its carcass, while the flames licking the immediate surrounding area. From the point of view of the player who is inside the tank, these sequences appear extraordinarily realistic and undoubtedly reveal the care and passion that the developers have put into their creation. Factors that unfortunately do not characterize this particular ~stand alone~ expansion in all its facets, as we will see. Hot sand ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead is set in Takistan, a Middle Eastern nation clearly inspired by Afghanistan, and the American soldiers we will take on the role of are engaged in a series of missions whose ultimate goal is the liberation of the country. Before each expedition we are presented with a full text briefing detailing the operation, and then the action is taken. In some stages you are already projected into the interested area, in others you have to reach it on board a vehicle; in all cases, our turn objective is indicated by a brown arrow with a distance in meters. To say that the substance of many missions is to move from point A to point B to point C would perhaps be disrespectful towards the colorful outline of the movement phases, but the reality of the facts is that Operation Arrowhead behaves more like a military simulation than not like... a video game. The undoubted quantitative and qualitative elements that have already been mentioned above, in fact, in most cases are put at the service of a gameplay that defining ~aseptic~ is an understatement, in which there is no cinematic or at least ~epic~ element ~ that can make the action engaging, with huge distances to cover and a lot of problems deriving from an AI that is anything but sophisticated, both on the side of the ~good guys~ and on the side of the ~bad guys~. Using the function keys we can coordinate the movements of a large number of units and therefore approach the missions with more strategy than a normal first person shooter would allow, but this feature often proves to be mandatory to put a patch on soldiers who leave on a tangent. they drift away from the group, fall behind hundreds of meters away, or simply have no idea which direction to move in. The strategic element, therefore, very often turns into a sort of ~recovery operation~ that takes away more depth from the gameplay than adding it. Similarly, the behavior of the enemy troops leaves something to be desired, giving the impression of being limited to two or three alternatives: the enemy sees us and stops to shoot, becoming an easy target; or start running aimlessly; or still crouches hoping not to be hit. The possibility of surrendering when the situation gets difficult is perhaps the only point in favor of the members of the Takistan army, who really struggle to offer us firefights worthy of the name. Appetizing side dish ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead contains an enhanced mission editor compared to the base game, especially from a usability point of view, which allows us to create customized stages by placing enemies and vehicles on the scenario or relying on a wizard capable of completing the work for us (or to do it in full, of course). Our creations can be played both single and multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, unfortunately we have not had the opportunity to test it since the servers were not yet online, however there will be a cooperative mode for four players and competitive modes for up to fifty players. Operation realism ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead proves to be quite elastic from the outset for thisanto concerns the achievement of mission objectives, in the sense that we can move as we see fit in the scenario, which in fact has no boundaries and is represented on the screen as a virtually infinite expanse. Since the gameplay is already rather dispersive in itself, in direct proportion to the distances to be covered, the developers have set limits to prevent us, for example, from moving too far from our companions or from the area towards which we should move, especially if an attack is in progress and our support is required. We have already mentioned the enormous amount of vehicles that we can control in this expansion, and in particular in single missions we are given the opportunity to experience a little bit of everything, even the equipment in the hands of enemies. Unfortunately, in any case it is necessary to come to terms with an interface that is anything but immediate, taken verbatim from the base game without any (necessary!) simplification. Do you want your character to go down a ladder? Well, you have to approach the ladder, take one more dangerous step until the icon to go down appears, then press the mouse wheel on itself and finally move downwards, witnessing one of the worst ~climbing a ladder~ animations have ever seen. Although this is the lowest point in this sense, the animations in general are not exactly the flagship of the Bohemia Interactive Studio product, on the contrary they are really ugly to look at. In this sense, the possibility of selecting a third-person view is somewhat surprising, which perhaps makes it easier to drive a specific vehicle but which precisely shows off the shortcomings of a graphic sector whose qualities we have already praised. But let's go back to the interface: the commands are decidedly too many and not very accessible, it was necessary to make everything much faster and more intuitive and perhaps try to get closer to the current solutions proposed by Operation Flashpoint, from this point of view decidedly more refined (as well as compatible with the controller of Xbox 360, which unfortunately with Operation Arrowhead there was no way to make it work). The most trivial operations, such as going up and down a ladder but also blindfolding a companion or simply changing weapons, appear so uncomfortable that you get used to doing without them until they become mandatory. The firefights almost always take place at medium range, but the weapons do not return the sensation of ~impact~ that one would expect from a title so devoted to simulation. Or maybe this is the problem, in reality a rifle does not fire like in Modern Warfare and therefore the representation offered by ArmA II is more likely. But again: is this a video game or what? The technical sector was widely discussed during the preview, compared to the beta some problems that caused monstrous drops in the frame rate were resolved but the ~heaviness~ of the Real Virtuality engine remained the same, with the test system running at 1680 resolution x 1050 pixels, with most effects set to ~normal~ and drawing distance halfway through, struggled to render 20-25 frames per second.", "date": "2010-06-22", "grade": "7.5"}
