If we dry it to the bone, we can describe it as a racing game inside colored tunnels with various objectives to be achieved in order to obtain the three stars that mark an excellent race. Each level has its own unique mechanics, which become more and more complex from stage to stage. In reality it is not really true, in the sense that often at a level in which a new mechanic is introduced, usually explained by an animated tutorial, others follow in which the same is deepened and developed. To give you some concrete examples, in the first levels you simply have to grab spheres of light in sequence, in subsequent ones you have to collect them in pairs (depending on the color), while going forward you get to have to grab enemies, touch the sphere laterally you have imprisoned them, to accumulate a boost with which to dash against the enemies themselves. Now, we imagine that some of you must have misunderstood, even believing that Dyad has a complex gameplay. In reality, the growth of the challenge is so gradual that there is never a single moment in which you don't know what to do, except in the case in which the tutorials appear and you decide to do some push-ups, carefully avoiding reading them. At the end of each level, depending on the performance, stars are awarded and additional challenges are unlocked; much more difficult versions of the basic one. Obviously the ultimate goal, as well as advancing towards the fatal final race, is to break record after record to brag about one's ability to friends. Flow of unconsciousness Dyad is not just game mechanics. Indeed, Dyad is above all its aesthetic side. The developers have been very careful to make the visual part unique, creating tunnels of lights and colors that seem to come out of a Pink Floyd record played by Tangerine Dream on acid, perfectly accompanied by electronic music and suffused explosions. In short, it looks like a thesis on Jeff Minter made into a video game. The level of dedication to its real concept, which can be considered as such to the point that we can define the other mechanics described above as secondary with respect to the simple desire to amaze and enchant the gamer, leads to a series of not always positive paradoxes. For example, the advanced stages become a pure stream of unconsciousness where the scoring mechanics get lost in the rainbow shades that continuously appear on the screen. To paraphrase: where more skill is required, one finds himself having to fight with the difficulty of identifying the active elements of the scenario and one comes to think that one can win more by the force of chance than by actual ability. It would almost make you want to deactivate the game and take a hallucinated journey through the tunnels without having to think about how to grab luminous balls or how to brush against enemies without ending up on them. This feeling of almost uselessness of the game compared to the visual is magnified by the twenty-seventh level, which is nothing but a long outburst of what Dyad would have liked to be in the previous twenty-six levels, i.e. pure psychedelia in which it is really difficult to go beyond luck to score high scores (probably if you have an exceptional glance you will do much better). Well, don't expect so much a video game from Dyad as the expression of a style that has no other ambition to exhibit itself. If the idea doesn't leave you indifferent, then you will love it madly, but the others mind you that they will hardly go beyond the two hours of play, more than enough time to exhaust all the proposed contents, also because the subordination of the mechanics to the aesthetic aspect could deprive them of interest well before the conclusion of the last level.", "date": "2013-05-15", "grade": "7.0"}
