{"name": "Tales of the Abyss", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tales-of-the-abyss.html", "text": "Tales from the Abyss Let us tell you that Tales of the Abyss tells probably one of the most original, gripping and complex stories of recent years. It is not the usual story of a group of heroic revelers who save the world from a global threat, the protagonists of Abyss have very little heroic. But let's go in order. The world of Auldrant is subtly governed by the Score, a sort of prophecy handed down for centuries by the Order of Lorelei, following which the peoples have led a serene and comfortable life. However, the last prophecy of the Score was the source of wars and torments: kept by the Order in total secrecy, it led many nations to fight for it, interested in seizing it in order to achieve the ~prosperity~ announced in the other fragments of the Score. During one of these wars, the son of the Duke fon Fabre, Luke, was kidnapped: brought home in a short time, Luke however was so shocked by the experience that he lost his memory of the ten years of life prior to the crime. Tales of the Abyss begins seven years after the kidnapping: Luke is a listless, selfish, spoiled and ignorant nobleman who for seven years has never left his palace, gloating in comfort and only learning the art of the sword thanks to his friend and servant Guy and proud Commander Van Grants, almost like a father to him. But one fine day, during a training session, a beautiful girl infiltrates the palace of the fon Fabre, intending to kill Van: contact with Luke, however, will cause a mysterious phenomenon that will teleport our protagonist and the woman away... right into the territory of the enemy. Thus begins a return journey for Luke and the woman named Tear, who will cross the paths of destiny: while Luke will begin to learn how the world works, he will also have to deal with an unthinkable betrayal, an imminent war, companions and rivals ambiguous and obscure, and with his own memory and personality. What if you were at the center of a prophecy and finally discovered that you are not you? The originality of the plot is palpable from the first moments: Luke is anything but the usual heroic and complex protagonist, his flaws and his bad attitude are just the stepping stone for the emotional intensity of his growth and maturation during the adventure. He is joined by characters with dark sides counterbalanced by extroverted, almost clownish characters: the result is a disturbing contrast, all the protagonists need to mature and change, and only in the end will we be able to consider them real heroes, of that kind that is rarely encountered in more recent JRPGs. And above all, Namco has also given space to a compelling characterization of the enemies, especially the deadly Six God-Generals, and even if someone still remains muted, each of them has a chance to shine during the adventure, making it even more epic the clashes and the plot, full of twists and turns. Just think of the prophecy concerning Luke... turned upside down not even a third of the way into the adventure! TO. Skills & Cores An interesting element introduced by Namco in this Abyss is very reminiscent of the Skills of Tales of Symphonia (GameCube): during the adventure you will sometimes find ~Cores~ which, if combined with a character, will influence certain statistics at his level-up. Interchangeable, the Cores allow you to customize and balance the various characters. Not only that, based on the Core equipped, the characters will learn particular Skills that will influence their performance in combat: speed of execution of spells, speed of recovery after an attack, ability to rotate in mid-air to land on your feet, use of objects on all party members... This mechanic therefore allows a high level of customization, although it is initially a bit dispersive and requires a few hours to be mastered easily. Ten years of refinements The Linear Motion Action Battle System invented by Namco in 1996 for Tales of Phantasia is still one of the freshest and most fun battle-systems in the huge park of JRPGs available for each console. The frenetic action, combined with the freedom of action and reaction, has always made the fights of the Tales series the element of discernment for fans of the genre: you either love each other or hate each other, they still remain one of the most studied and fun mechanisms for this genre of games. For those who don't know what we're talking about, suffice it to say that the fights are completely real-time, with the player in direct control of a party member, while the other three are managed by a refined artificial intelligence, following orders and strategies decided by the player through a simple menu: our teammates atthey will not hit our target or another, they will heal when the energy of the characters reaches a certain percentage, they will use objects and spells at their discretion, but following the guidelines decided by us, committed to pressing the joypad keys to perform attack combos, special moves (here called Artes) and much more. In Tales of the Abyss this mechanic has been remodeled once again, after the experiments attempted with Tales of Symphonia and Tales of Legendia: the most innovative and revolutionary element is, in fact, the simple possibility of moving around the battlefield at will by keeping a key pressed, and releasing it, the character used will get back precisely in a horizontal line with our target. This mechanism allows for a huge variety of strategies and actions during combat, for example allowing you to take an enemy from behind to inflict more damage on him, or to extricate yourself from the most tangled ambushes. The Free Roaming System, ultimately reminiscent of that of Star Ocean 3, is also essential for the exploitation of the Field of Fonons. The Fonons in the world of Tales of the Abyss are the energetic vibrations emitted by matter and, in particular, the natural elements through which life manifests itself: in a nutshell, water, fire, air, earth, light and darkness. Each Fonic or Arcane Artes (basically elemental spells and attacks) performed during combat will cause a white circle to appear somewhere on the battlefield, marked by the element corresponding to the Skill used. The more Artes of that element are used, the more this circle will appear, until it appears colorful and shiny: by performing certain Artes above this circle, or Field of Fonon (FoF), we will obtain more powerful and spectacular Artes. For example, if Luke casts Fang Blade over a wind-based green FoF, we'll get Lightning Fang Blade, and likewise if Jade casts Stalagmite over a fire-based FoF we'll get the more powerful Eruption instead. Tales of the Abyss probably tells one of the most original, gripping and complex stories of recent years. Ten years of refinements In short, the Field of Fonon is a strategic element that is initially very random, but as new spells are learned it becomes increasingly central in the fights, given that it is also the only way to perform the devastating Mystic Artes: learning to coordinate the attacks by our party to take advantage of the right FoF at the right time and prevent the enemy from doing it instead is a refined and extremely satisfying art, which makes the fights in Tales of the Abyss incredibly engaging and strategic. However, it would be criminal to make the idea of a JRPG entirely based on combat: Tales of the Abyss is a JRPG of the old guard, with its beautiful three-dimensional world map to explore, initially linearly, then freely, especially once acquired means of transport (such as the Tartarus shuttle). Dozens of cities offer the player a living world, where even optional side-quests affect the economy of shops, and where there is always something to do or somewhere to visit again before the grand finale. Furthermore, the ~dungeons~ to be tackled during the adventure offer a series of puzzles that make them less linear despite the rather predictable structure, often centered on the intelligent use of the little cheagle Mieuw and his ability to destroy rocks head-on or burn twigs and obstacles, thanks to the Sorcerer's Ring he wears (an original way of proposing an omnipresent accessory in the saga, it must be said). Add to all this the visible and therefore avoidable enemies, and consequently the absence of annoying random fights, and the possibility of forging weapons and cooking delicacies, and you have only a vague idea of the depth of the new Namco RPG. And technically? From a technical point of view, unfortunately, Tales of the Abyss proves to be fluctuating, unfortunately showing in the worst way the enormous care dedicated to gameplay by the development team. The character design by Kosuke Fujishima (author of the manga Oh my goddess! as well as character designer of Tales of Phantasia, Tales of Symphonia and the Sakura Taisen series) has been translated perfectly thanks to well-kept and colorful polygonal models, proportioned, beautifully animated, both in the case of the protagonists than their rivals. Cities and locations are well structured, with remarkable architectural refinements (think of the cathedral of Daaht) and decidedly spectacular visual elements. The use of light and particle effects of all kinds during the fights is explosive but by no means intrusive, the clashes maintain a constant frame rate and lackor absolutely slowdowns, the interlude cartoon sequences are of the highest quality. In short, what is missing from Tales of the Abyss? Well, the texturing of the locations is sometimes extremely poor, in 2006 seeing a leaf made up of four green squares is rather depressing, it must be admitted, just as the notorious ~jaggies~ are all too visible, for a video game produced in 2005, during the works that led to the birth of visual masterpieces such as Kingdom Hearts II, Valkyrie Profile 2, Suikoden V and Final Fantasy XII. Finally, the uploads often turn out to be exhausting: above all the transition between battle and world-map is often extremely long, and the world-map itself, however essential, is the cause of some frame drops during exploration, unexplainable if not through a poor code optimization. The judgment on the music sector is still positive, starting with the animated introduction: Namco has always had the horrible habit of replacing the opening songs in Japanese with melodic songs of questionable quality for each of its Tales, with rather mediocre results. Resurrected with Tales of Legendia (in which the opening song was replaced by a surprisingly more beautiful piece of music), this trend has reached a turning point with the present Abyss: the beautiful song ~Karma~ by the musical group Bump of a Chicken does not it was replaced by another piece, but rather by the same melodic piece specially arranged without the text, with a decidedly positive result. On the other hand, the soundtrack, while not reaching the qualitative peaks of Tales of Legendia or XenoSaga (among the best soundtracks ever produced for this genre), is of high quality although sometimes repetitive, above all for the ability to approach the events in an always appropriate way, just think of the change in the music track in the world-map, towards the middle of the game, after one of the most important narrative moments, when the previous uncertain and mysterious piece of music is replaced by an incisive, intense and decidedly exciting track. The choice of American dubbers was also excellent, with a very high quality of the dubbing and always appropriate voices: even Tear's chants during the performance of his Fon Artes were reproduced perfectly, erasing the fear of the fans that they would be eliminated in the passage from the eastern to western version. Too bad that the many optional ~skits~ that show the characters talking and commenting on the events, deepening them, have not been dubbed, leaving the screen silent while the text follows one another. It's a pity that the last Tales for PlayStation 2 arrived in this period: Tales of the Abyss is probably one of the best JRPG ever made from the most important points of view, the story and the gameplay. The original and compelling plot, full of memorable and multifaceted characters and unusual protagonists is the engine of a JRPG really full of winning elements, starting with a truly perfect and very fun battle-system, passing through the countless side-quests, freedom exploration, mini-games and plethora of secrets to discover. Very long and devoid of any voltage drop, Tales of the Abyss flaws in the technical sector due to some significant graphic defects, mostly caused by rather naive programming of the code. However, these flaws are swept away by the depth and quality of the playful experience, making this episode of the infinite Tales saga absolutely unmissable for any fan of the genre and of the series. Pros Magnificent storyline and characters Perfect battle-system Extremely long-lived Cons Visually fluctuating Excessively long uploads On the back of the Tales of Legendia instruction manual, in the American version, we could admire a collage of artwork showing all the protagonists of the episodes of the Tales series released in America, a celebration for the tenth anniversary that flanked Stahn Aileron with Reid Hartschel, Lloyd Irvine and Senel Coolidge... also joined by the characters of Tales of the Abyss, until then not even announced in the American version. Namco was no stranger to the unfortunate habit of not translating some episodes of the series: Tales of Destiny 2 and Tales of Rebirth, for example, had never left Japan, and were two of the best episodes of the series. Fans had much to hope for, if it hadn't been a mistake, and fortunately a short time later RPG enthusiasts could rejoice knowing that Tales of the Abyss, highly acclaimed in the East as one of the best JRPGs ever made, would finally be translated. The unfortunate choice to launch it in American territory a short time before", "date": "2006-11-14", "grade": null}
