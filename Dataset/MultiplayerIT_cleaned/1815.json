{"name": "Il Signore degli Anelli - La Compagnia dell'Anello", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-signore-degli-anelli-la-compagnia-dellanello.html", "text": "A book to play Frodo Baggins is a hobbit, a small man who inhabits the Shire, a rural region of Middle-earth. A heavy burden weighs on him: Frodo was handed down by his uncle Bilbo a mysterious magic ring, found by the old adventurer in a dark cave during one of his vicissitudes. The Ring is none other than the notorious One Ring, belonging to a menace that Middle-earth and its inhabitants still remember with horror: Sauron, the Dark Lord of the land of Mordor. This fiendish Enemy had forged thousands of years earlier nineteen Rings of Power, and had distributed them among the elven, dwarven and human rulers who ruled the peoples of Middle-earth, to be seduced and possessed by dark lusts for power. Sauron, in fact, had forged a twentieth ring, the Only One, capable of commanding all the others. In short, he had subdued the free peoples and set out to subjugate every living thing, but in the end he was defeated and the Ring was lost. But Sauron never completely disappeared, for years he waited for the reappearance of the Ring, in order to be able to wage war again against the free peoples and above all against Men, corrupted by the growing desire for power. The only solution is therefore to destroy the trinket, but it will be necessary to bring it back to Mordor to throw it back into the mouth of the volcanic Mount Doom, where it was forged. Frodo has the arduous mission, but he won't be alone: with him there will be the hobbits Pippin, Merry and Sam; the mighty wizard Gandalf; the valiant Aragorn and Boromir; the slender elf Legolas and the grumpy dwarf Gimli. Together, the nine wayfarers will be the Fellowship of the Ring... The Fellowship of the Ring can however be misleading: unlike The Two Towers, this game is not directly inspired by the film adaptation, but rather by the novel. And therefore, great absentees from the cinema will make their (unexpected or predictable, of course) appearance on your television screens: the likeable Tom Bombadil will help Frodo and his companions in the dangerous Tumulilande; Glorfindel will take Frodo to Rivendell, escaping from Sauron's Black Knights and so on... In short, a great way to relive the splendid, complex and gripping storyline that made The Lord of the Rings the bible of modern fantasy... A game to watch Through the constant presence of cut-scenes in real-time or full motion video, the player will witness the unraveling of the events mentioned above, but The Fellowship of the Ring is also a video game, and so here we are talking about how plays. Basically, the entire adventure is divided into a series of levels that it will be possible to overcome by completing certain objectives: for example, in the very first stage we will have to recover the property deed of the Baggins house and take it to Lobelia Sackville, the greedy relative of ~poor~ Bilbo (another sequence that will be new to connoisseurs of the film but well known to readers). Often, therefore, we will find ourselves exploring the various settings in search of objects, but sometimes our only goal will be to survive the attacks of the Dark Lord's servants until the end of the scheme we are following: here, therefore, is that Vivendi has considered It is appropriate to put ourselves in the shoes of two other far more ~adventurous~ characters, namely Aragorn and Gandalf. Thus, although they lack Frodo's jumping skills, the two Men have a great war experience on their side: Aragorn wields his bow and sword with dexterity and precision, while Gandalf can rely on both his sword and a whole set of arcane spells of defense and attack. It goes without saying that the most interesting interactive sequences are those that see the two humans as protagonists: Frodo's missions in fact tend to be rather repetitive and particularly simple, despite being based more on exploration; while those in which Gandalf and Aragorn are played have more bite, despite being characterized by a certain monotony: slicing enemies without stopping in the long run tires you... and certain problems could make it extremely frustrating. A show to forget The Fellowship of the Ring is misleading twice: as already mentioned, it is based more on the book than on the film, and then it seems technically excellent. It seems. Graphically, there's not much to complain about, at first glance. Solid, well-animated and fairly textured polygonal models; vast and detailed environments, beautifully structured and very varied; surprising details such as the care taken in the creation of the ponds and light effects... In short, it would seem like a real orgy for the eyes. But in fact it is not so. The defects of theFellowship of the Ring, in fact, are caught while playing, and there are so many. To begin with, the collisions are badly implemented: the impossibility of getting out of the paths set by the programmers is shown through absurd slips on invisible walls, and this can arouse strong deja-vue of hundreds of similar products, up to being forgiven; but the same error in the code has a decisive impact on the most frequent aspect of the gameplay: combat. There is no lock-on system, so it is practically impossible to aim and land precise winning shots during melees with two or more enemies, not before having transformed the barbaric attacks of our heroes into gaffes worthy of Mr. Bean: seeing Aragorn trying to kick an enemy to throw him to the ground, and missing him, becoming the target of the other opponents who don't hesitate to knock him down and beat him to death is not a pretty sight... And not only that: the game provides the possibility of kill a downed enemy with one shot, by skewering them with the press of a button. It goes without saying that this deadly attack soon becomes a suicidal technique, given that the code does not immediately and precisely reveal the collision between our alter-ego and the enemy, leaving us uncovered for possible ambushes... And not only that. There was talk of excellent light effects with an astonishing realization of the water: well, as regards the first ones, it is incredible to note how in a game of this kind not a shred of code for dynamic shadows has been implemented; while as far as water is concerned... well, it's just a well-maintained texture, but one that has no physical reaction with anything that interacts with it: it's simply ghost water. These are just examples, but they work pretty well the idea: The Fellowship of the Ring surprises at first sight, it is truly admired, but in the end it is nothing more than an illusion, given that there is little behind it. As if that weren't enough, for some unsuspecting reason it was decided not to use Howard Shore's splendid music, which results in a shabby remix of his best compositions; nor have the dialogues of the film been adapted, as happened in The Two Towers, ergo we are faced with dialogues that are barely dubbed and full of errors of pronunciation or intercalation. Sin. Comment With bitterness, one can only define The Fellowship of the Ring as a decoy. Fans of the novel will not be able to give up a game that faithfully traces the paper stages of the Company's journey (only the presence of Tom Bombadil is an incentive to purchase for a true fan of the Tolkenian saga), as will all those who have appreciated the films will find in The Fellowship of the Ring a more than discreet game through which to relive the fate of Frodo and his companions... But nevertheless, it is undeniable that the product itself suffers from problems of a mainly technical nature which undermine its overall quality, making it superfluous for those who don't want to get nervous about the umpteenth ~game over~ caused by a shot that missed due to a mischievous code, rather than due to one's own incapacity. There are also few extras present, leaving out that the game obviously has no real conclusion... A missed opportunity, fans will be able to come to terms with the heavy programming gaps, but everyone else would do well to orientate themselves towards the Two Towers. Pros: The plot is that of the book Good variety of levels and situations Looks like a technical masterpiece... Cons: ...but it's not Impossible to fight without decent lock-ons and collisions Too frustrating and unbalanced The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the famous literary masterpiece The Lord of the Rings, written by the esteemed J.R.R. Tolkien over half a century ago. And so far, nothing new: after all, the work is experiencing a golden age lately, thanks to the success of the impressive film adaptation edited by Peter Jackson, who together with a cast of great actors has succeeded in what many they believed impossible, that is to give life to more than one thousand three hundred pages in ~just~ about ten hours. Obviously, the film was divided into three parts, as many as those of the book: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King. And so, while we are preparing to view the second part in Italy too, as with any classic commercial phenomenon, the fantasy saga par excellence has also seen the production of a series of video games for almost all platforms. Original, from this point of view, what happened on PlayStation2: Le Due Torri was launched first, an excellent quality slash'em-up; then the prequel came out, The Fellowship of the Ring, which takes place on a different playful level, perhaps the one most appropriate to Tolkien's work: adventure. But will this new product be able to satisfy both casual users and fans of the saga? Unfortunately, the answer is neither yes nor no. But let's go in order.", "date": "2003-01-11", "grade": null}
