Perhaps in line with the inspiring title, this curious remake tries to take up its spirit, proposing a short-lived adventure but open to replayability. There are some unexpected surprises, however. The purpose hasn't changed in all these years and still consists in rescuing Princess Mariko trapped in the manor by Akuma, an evil emperor surrounded by the most skilled warriors of feudal Japan. The more witty of you will have understood that it will be necessary to make oneself understood with kicks and punches. Always present The peculiarity that immediately catches the eye after the first departure of our character, the classic martial arts fighter, consists in the fact that there are two others ready to replace him: a monk not inclined to talk and a beefy giant with inhuman strength. The trio basically represents the lives available to the player, while the entire game is structured on turn-based combat, just like the original, which sees us pitted against a set of enemies ranging from simple guards to end-of-section bosses. What perhaps was not expected was precisely the simplification of the combat system implemented by Mechner, based entirely on timing. In a very similar way to a rhythm game, we must understand the right moment to parry the opponent's blows based on the sounds audible during the fight, in order to lower the enemy's guard to ring in one's combos. In the event of an error, the consequences will be the historical energy bar displayed with arrows. Once we have scored a certain number of hits we can carry out a special move capable of causing high damage to the opponents, which proves to be particularly crucial against the bosses. Xbox 360 goals Karateka features 12 goals for a total of 400 player points. By finishing the game you will take home a hundred, for all the others it is necessary to satisfy certain conditions, such as concluding the adventure with the first character or arriving at certain sections of the castle within a time limit. W the simplicity Karateka focuses on intensity before duration. Finishing the adventure takes no more than half an hour, while the presence of three characters, combined with the possibility of using the points accumulated as credits to resurrect the last one left, makes it almost impossible to abandon Mariko to her fate. The essence of the title lies in replayability, as only once finished is the picture clear. The real challenge lies in overcoming the fight against Akuma (the only really challenging one) with the first character, who represents the princess's suitor, while the various conditions dictated by the objectives and the online scores represent further incentives to return to the castle. An interesting idea, but implemented in a very small way, so much so that it fits better on a smartphone than on a console. The game thus is nothing more than a long series of quick time events that gets boring too soon, an inconvenience that is not a little out of tune with the purposes listed above. It would have been sufficient to deepen the movements between the various areas of the castle, reduced to empty and functional sections only to recharge energy, or to make the start of each new game more streamlined, weighed down each time by the intrusive tutorial. Mistakes that unfortunately resize Mechner's latest effort, despite the fact that it turns out to be quite enjoyable. Undoubtedly thanks also to the technical realization, characterized by a lively and cartoonish polygonal aspect that undoubtedly benefited from the collaboration with Jeff Matsuda, while the music even brings Christopher Tin into play. In short, a respectable team. Nostalgics are warned, there is still the eagle...", "date": "2012-11-14", "grade": "6.5"}
