Where the penumbra seems to have cornered hope and threats gather copious at every turn, we have experienced up close the desperate escape of the protagonist from unscrupulous tormentors and horrifying deformed thugs. We have escaped the long arms of the Keeper and evaded the threat of the deadly twin cooks, we have extricated ourselves with abnegation from the assaults of the leeches and the fat guests of the boat, afflicted by an unlimited greed for food. As we described in the review, the dark themes taken as a reference point by Tarsier Studios wink at some works of the German and English tradition such as the collections of fairy tales by the Grimm brothers and the stories written by the author Roald Dahl. But from many quarters there have also been references to Tim Burton's expressive style, especially as regards the aesthetic part and the markedly grotesque nature of the subjects represented on the screen. Little Nightmares is a story told in a silent way, where the flow of events is accompanied by the noises of the surrounding structure and the muffled atmosphere is broken by the heartbeats that mark the uncertain advance of the protagonist. It is precisely these moments that make the typical anxieties of childhood re-emerge in the viewer, with an interactive approach similar to that of other works but at the same time endowed with its own expressive identity. Although we find ourselves in harmony with the artistic style used in the representation, also as regards the use of sounds, we have not failed to highlight an extremely reduced longevity. And so, precisely in order to enrich the gaming experience, the developers have decided to offer the public the expansion pack called ~Secrets of the Maw~; purchasable at a price of 9.99 euros, it aims to increase the main path with new levels experienced from the perspective of another character trapped inside the Maw. In this first piece we will deal with the DLC ~The Depths~, available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from July 7th. The second package, entitled il Nascondiglio, will be published in November, while the third and final appointment is scheduled for January 2018. Playstation 4 trophies The first Little Nightmares DLC offers only three additional Trophies, one of which is secret. Escape from the basement As we have come to realize after completing the main adventure, Six is not the only one who wants to leave the Maw behind. In parallel to his story we discover that of the Fugitive, a child intent on crossing a flooded dungeon in the depths of the vessel, just as a threat looms beneath the surface of the water. The ignoble deformed being that you have to deal with is Granny, who in spite of the reassuring name will do everything to try to put an end to the advance of the young protagonist and will continually try to drown him without mercy. Tarsier Studios has said it wants to offer a different approach to the story of Six, but in essence the skills available to the Fugitive turn out to be almost similar to those already experienced previously. What changes is only the basic situation on which the chase hinges, since in this case you find yourself in the middle of a flooded basement and you are forced to use any object to stay immersed in the water for as little time as possible . For example, it is necessary to throw baits in the opposite direction to the one you want to go, so that Granny is distracted and there is time to reach the next hold unharmed after jumping into the water. Moreover, on more than one occasion these platforms do not constitute a safe haven, given that the tremendous underwater threat is able to disintegrate the wooden planks or to move the heaviest objects on which it is resting, constantly endangering the integrity of the Fugitive. But beyond this trick, The Depths add very little to the main experience. Basically, a single level of extension is made available to us equal to that of the other five chapters that can be enjoyed in the role of Six. We are therefore talking about a path that can easily be completed in less than an hour, also considering that in the first portion of the level some rooms already crossed previously are retraced. The interactive experience is demonstrated in thecomplex even more linear than what we had found in our previous game. The puzzles remain extremely basic, not to mention telephoned, while the progression is again hindered mainly by the fugitive's limited mobility: having to deal with his obvious condition of physical inferiority, in the presence of the threats he has to face, we will see forced to act cunningly, trying not to get caught and using the surrounding environment to their advantage. We would not have minded receiving some more information on the Fauci, some element that could give more consistency to our interpretations. On the contrary, no new elements capable of tangibly enriching the narrative background are captured. In other words you experience events from the perspective of a new prisoner, but beyond the progression for its own sake there really isn't much else to analyze.", "date": "2017-07-14", "grade": null}
