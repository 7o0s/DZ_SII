Like many of its similars, Battlestar Galactica Online provides a common beginning in which the players of both factions will find themselves dispersed together with the fleet they belong to in an unspecified point of the cosmos due to a hyperspace jump carried out in a hurry without having the time to make the right calculations. Cut off, the players will then have to manage to collect from the void all that is necessary to repair and upgrade their ship - or those of the fleet by accepting missions from some NPCs - facing at the same time great space battles against opponents, all with virtually no expense. More than a browser game The thing that amazes most in Battlestar Galactica online is, right from the start, the technical sector: accustomed to text screens, to spartan semi-humanoid depictions of people and in general to a barely sketched visual aspect, players are immediately displaced by a incredibly detailed spaceship, with an excellent cosmic background and remarkable light effects, with a free camera and the general impact of a graphic that seems to have come out, if not from a very latest triple A title, certainly from a recent and in each case of unprecedented graphic quality for the genre via browser, so much so that the frequent moments of interpenetration between the polygons are forgiven, especially between one's own spaceship and the allied ones. The sound sector is also excellent, which presents classic sounds of lasers and explosions (in space, oh well) accompanied by highly epic musical motifs taken directly from the soundtrack of the original saga. Even the control and combat system underline the clear intention of creating something more than a browser-based title for the classic five-minute break: the control, based on the WASD combination and the mouse, proves to be practical and functional right from the start , complete and intuitive, so much so that novice pilots will only need a few minutes to transform themselves first into destroyers of drones and enemies controlled by the AI (during the tutorials) and then into player hunters. As for the gameplay Battlestar Galactica Online is mainly divided into two moments: the aforementioned space exits and the sessions aboard the fleet flagship. The latter, which each player will perform on their own - it is therefore impossible to meet someone during the sessions on board - seem to mimic certain moments seen in Mass Effect: with the obvious playful and graphic proportions - and it is in the repeated interiors and in the grainy characters you can see the browser nature of the engine - the player will have to cross the various bridges in order to receive missions from multiple characters or upgrade his ship in the hangar thanks to the resources acquired during the missions themselves. Or why not, buy a new ship among the nine available, in turn divided into three categories - fighter, frigate and main ship - between which there is a balance of power treading the typical system of the Chinese morra, with the fighter undergoing frigates, frigates collapsing in front of cruisers and defenseless cruisers tight enough to block fighters and bombers. And it is precisely in the quests that the underlying problem of the title is highlighted: regardless of the objectives, the player will spend several minutes only scanning asteroids and collecting resources, without actually having much else to do: in short, there is a lack of epic objectives and different moments from the usual patrolling and gathering resources, factors that make the moments between the various space battles boring in which, thanks to the excellent graphics and a good balancing system between the spaceships and the hundreds of upgrades that can be purchased, the best of the offer is instead shown .  but something less than a free to play. It goes without saying that the secret to being competitive during clashes between players is not only in a greater ability to move your spaceship or manage its weapon systems, but rather in having powerful shields, upgraded missiles and perhaps an imposing spaceship at the own command rather than a small single-seat fighter. To obtain all this it is necessary to have thousands and thousands of resources (in this case called Cubits and Tylion, where cubits are the monetization of the resource Tylion) to spend on potements and vessels. This means hours and hours of boring solitary meditation sessions, also because the interaction with the players, limited to an in-game chat and to the alliance during the various PvP battles, does not really represent the pinnacle of sociality that can be reached online. To skip these steps it is possible to buy resources, not in exchange for your soul or improbable star pacts, but for dear old euros. Let's assume that the average cost of a large spaceship is around 60,000 cubits, and that a player can collect about 1,000 cubits every day (unless he injects himself with an IV), you too will understand that spending 10 euros for 30,000 cubits represents a solution ideal, if it weren't for the 60,000 required to reach the considerable sum of 20 euros. However, counting on the fact that in order to be able to buy a large ship, a high basic level is needed, so cubits can also be used to raise one's experience level, thus making it necessary to purchase other resources (always not wanting to spend years do nothing other than gather resources or drive a small fighter): let's say that the largest package for sale is 350,000 cubits, enough to make good or bad weather on your server but also with a not indifferent cost of 100 euros (the other options are for 160,000 cubits for 50 euros and 78,000 for 25). I agree that space combats are remarkable and that lately the genre is lacking in good titles - let's exclude X3 which in any case is approaching 3 years of age - but the balance imposed by microtransactions is in this case really too disproportionate in favor of those who pay effectively ruining the experience.", "date": "2011-05-04", "grade": "6.5"}
