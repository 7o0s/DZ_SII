The Metal Gear Solid series has seen its appearance on the current generation of consoles only on one occasion, in the now distant 2008 and exclusively for PlayStation 3; yet it has incredible popularity and has managed to create a highly devoted and eager fan base, who have learned in spite of themselves to absorb the long and ~problematic~ development of each chapter of Hideo Kojima's vision. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is precisely the fruit of all these vicissitudes. Announced in 2009 as a ~regular~ title of the series, between the second and fourth chapters, it was transformed several times and risked cancellation, eventually becoming a ~hybrid~ spin-off. In fact, the realization of the plot remained in the Kojima Production house, the technical development and the gameplay were however entrusted to Platinum Games. I, cyborgs Yes, the very ones who together with the brilliant boss Hideky Kamiya created that little action masterpiece that responds to the name of Bayonetta, but also other very valid titles such as Vanquish and Mad World. Open the sky to the announcement of the collaboration! The historical fans of the series, and they are many, have made a ~mess~ of the memorable ones, and it is no coincidence that the game has lost the ~Solid~ in the title in favor of the current one, precisely to clearly symbolize being a variation on the theme waiting for a regular chapter (Ground Zeroes), for which we expect biblical waiting times. Having said that, the narrative mold by Kojima Production can be seen, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is one of the action with the longest and most interesting dialogues ever to appear on consoles, and is set four years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. The protagonist is Raiden, that blond who, if in the second chapter appeared to have little charisma and doubtful tastes, in the fourth revealed all his talents, underwent mechanical grafts and revealed a difficult and troubled childhood, so as to acquire a charisma of all respect and become the absolute protagonist of a game dedicated to him. The themes of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance are very current. The threat of the Patriots who managed the war economy was actually just a fuse, the need for power on the part of large states, primarily America, has led to a diffusion of military units and organizations composed of cyborgs (PMCs) , and likewise mercenaries ready to carry out coups, subvert the powers and use any subterfuge, even morally unacceptable, to increase their earnings and firepower. Raiden works for one of these PMCs in order to maintain his family, he will find himself having to fight with his past and with antagonists moved by very specific ends and with a lot to tell, precisely to denote how Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is the product of two developers belonging to different schools of thought. To appreciate the story of the main protagonist you have to face eight chapters between Mexico, Pakistan, Africa and the United States, all linked by extremely dynamic gameplay and in full Platinum Games style; Raiden has become an expert and lethal swordsman, has crazy speed, a thousand moves available and controls himself like the best self-respecting Dante. We live in a world of cyborgs who do the hardest work, feel no pain thanks to inhibitors, repair themselves quickly but still need energy for all their advanced functions. Raiden uses his sword with the square key, performs the support weapon attack with the triangle, jumps with X and performs actions with the circle. When enemies are weakened enough, he can slice them thanks to Blade mode, provided he has enough energy: by pressing the L1 key, time slows down and it is easier to hit opponents. The right analog stick allows you to have total control over the direction to hit, and it is necessary in various moments of the adventure when you need to hit specific points of the opponents to absorb their energy. Playstation 3 trophies Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance offers 51 trophies, of which five are silver and three are gold. It starts from those related to the various chapters of the story, to the completion of some actions (for example ~Complete the fourth chapter without using Augmented Reality~) or even to the killing of a certain number of enemies. The more complex ones are obtained by listening to most of the conversations via codec or by completing all the chapters with an S rank on the fifth difficulty level, the highest. Talk and fights The carrying out of the action is altriad between dialogues, spectacular interlude sequences, fights against secondary opponents and then the inevitable intermediate and end-of-chapter bosses, represented by the Gekkos and above all by characters who play an important role in the plot. After successfully completing each section within the chapter, you are graded on combos performed, time spent, and more. The so-called Battle Points are obtained in the same way which, guess what, can be spent to enhance Raiden's characteristics. The customization menu, which can be accessed from the main menu or via the Select key, provides new skills for Raiden, primary and secondary weapons, the choice of ~clothes~ and physical upgrades. Some of these features can only be unlocked after finding specific objects while playing, during the main sections and the few secondary ones that are ~reported~ by Raiden's adventure companions. This is because the codec is also present in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. Each supporting actor has his own dedicated channel and provides various extra and optional dialogues, which in addition to unlocking a specific trophy are also interesting for better understanding the story. Returning to the upgrades, it is essential to learn some of Raiden's skills, this is because the main protagonist does not have a special key for dodging rather than parrying, but rather in the second case you have to counter the opponent's attacks with the sword. In fact, when they are about to launch their blow, a sort of red signal appears which indicates their imminent execution, therefore it is necessary to use the left analogue in conjunction with the attack of the primary weapon towards the direction of the attack itself, to get in defensive position. In the same way you can learn a skill that by pressing square and X simultaneously allows an attack with dodging backwards. While there is automatic lock-on (with R2) on the enemy and free-hand camera handling with the right analog, the extremely fast-paced action often clashes with the camera itself, especially when there is more than one enemy on screen. The fights in these situations become a bit chaotic and random, albeit spectacular, but the precision goes down the drain in favor of brute force attacks. Even the parry with the sword doesn't work very well because of this ~problem~, and in the sections where you use the right analog with L1 for free management of the sword, you don't have to get carried away, also because throwing fuel on the game takes the bad ~run~ of the analogs of the PlayStation 3 pad. Where therefore the fights against secondary enemies are not very strategic, repetitive and if we want easy at the normal difficulty level (three are initially available, but there are five in total), the bosses are instead made of a completely different stuff, some of which an entire chapter or several phases of combat is devoted to it. In this case, the attack with the white weapon is not enough even if you have several rations of energy available, you must constantly parry or avoid the opponent's attacks (even with the risk of making multiple attempts), and perhaps exploit the secondary weapon available . The ~topical~ moments of the fight are timed by the Zandatsu (ie the ~final~ cut with the sword), which allows you to weaken the opponent and move the combat plan, and by the inevitable conversations and mutations of the opponents. However, there are small variations on the theme, in some sections it is possible to kill enemies without being discovered, and this works very well and in a dynamic way, or to go unnoticed using pharmaceutical boxes that do not pass infrared. In other points, objects such as rocket launchers and bombs of various types are used, which we actually used very little and only when ~recommended~ by the game. The narration is valid albeit far from that of a Metal Gear Solid; however, there are some sobering themes and certainly spectacular interlude sequences; to give an example, in one Raiden tries to discuss the meaning of life with a cyborg, and the adversary is torn because despite having an extremely superior intelligence, he has to follow orders and in fact has no free will. In another Raiden ~dances~ in flight between some stealth fighters who want to kill him and Doktor, the inevitable supporting scientist. The opacity of platinum Going to the point, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a fun and immediate title, the chapters can be selected at any time and even at different difficulty levels Raiden keeps all the upgrades obtained. Not missingVR missions are also missing, which are obtained by analyzing some terminals during the game and range from reaching a certain point (running or without being discovered) to eliminating enemies with a specific weapon or something else. However, it must be said that the game mechanics are much less precise and ~dirtier~ than the previous works by Platinum Games, the boss fights are excellent but the others are much less, and only at the highest difficulty level do you begin to feel a real level of challenge. All set in a certainly not memorable longevity: we completed Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance in six hours and forty minutes, which even if they do not include the interlude sequences (if you replay a chapter the timer only counts the fastest completion, but includes instead if you die and restart from the checkpoint), are still few for a title like this. Replayability as mentioned is there, for pure fun or to unlock all the VR missions and the various sketches of the protagonists; however, since the mechanics do not shine for precision and balance, they represent a decidedly lower incentive than other important actions such as the aforementioned Bayonetta. We have not forgotten the technical aspect. The artistic side remains as per the tradition of an excellent level, in particular Raiden and all the main opponents are made with an extreme abundance of details and interesting stylistic choices. The fluidity is good, even if there is some slowdown, while instead the scene is rather dirty in terms of aliasing, the effects are only average (even the sky is static) and the range of colors helps to give the scenarios a rather bland impact and certainly not in line with the best productions for consoles. The interlude sequences, again created with the game graphics engine, are instead more beautiful to look at, since they have been ~cleaned~ of the aliasing and with a few more effects, characteristics that highlight the excellent amount of polygons typical of the Metal Gears and all characters in the foreground. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is dubbed in honest (but not memorable) English and subtitled in Italian; the soundtrack follows the type of action and is composed of rather aggressive electronic music, which may or may not like it as tastes, but it is certainly of good quality. Finally, on PlayStation 3, installation is mandatory and is completed in just over four minutes.", "date": "2013-02-19", "grade": "8.0"}
