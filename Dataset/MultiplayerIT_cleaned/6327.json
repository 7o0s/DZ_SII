{"name": "Un tuffo nel passato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/149972-gradius-v-un-tuffo-nel-passato.html", "text": "Born at the dawn of the videogame medium, the genre of so-called shoot'em ups, better known by us as scrolling shooters (horizontal or vertical), experienced its golden age between the 80s and the second mid-90s, a time interval in which all the titles remained in the hearts of fans were launched, such as R-Type, DonPachi, Gradius, Radiant Silvergun and Team 17's Project-X on the Amiga. Although they arrived when the genre had already begun to lose its influence on the market, more modern products such as Ikaruga (spiritual sequel to Radiant Silvergun) and Gradius V by Treasure, a small software house founded by former Konami employees, perfectly embodied it spirit and virtue, bringing with it all the experience accumulated by the developers in the past years. After the encore success of Ikaruga, translated on Steam last year, for the return of the fifth chapter of Gradius (originally released in 2004 on PlayStation 2) the PlayStation 3 was opted for, a rather anachronistic solution considering the sales prospects on the long term and market success of the fourth Sony flagship. Skipped over Konami's move, already in the eye of the storm for the news coming from Tokyo, and dusted off the DualShock 3, we are back in space aboard the legendary Vic Viper and this is the story of our journey into the past. Treasure brings the very difficult fifth chapter of Gradius to PlayStation 3 Once upon a time The first detail to take into account in this ~nostalgia operation~ by Konami is the need to forget the terms remake and remastered, which are so fashionable (even too much) at the start of this new generation of consoles. In fact, the game is nothing more than a carbon copy of the one already seen on PlayStation 2 over ten years ago, with all that follows from a technical and playful point of view. Downloaded from the PlayStation Store the approximately 600 MegaByte of data that make up the package, in the hard disk we still find one of the best horizontal scrolling shooters in history, whose most intimate dynamics are daughters of that old school linked to the smoky arcades of a time and, above all, to the arcade slot machines. In simpler words, we are dealing with a shooter of maddening difficulty, with a zero learning curve and a technically ephemeral longevity: it is enough to know that to complete a complete game, from the first level to the end credits, it takes maximum an hour and a handful of minutes. Having said that, before you succeed in the extremely tiring undertaking, months and months of cursing and very small steps forward will probably have passed, which session after session, memorizing attack patterns and enemy appearances, will improve your approach to the title and the effectiveness in battle. The main menu, translated into Italian, is quite simple and has a vintage flavour, and in addition to being able to start a new game, it is possible to select one of the previously unlocked stages, play a points challenge, observe the ranking (with the scores accompanied by the iconic three letters) and configure the options. The latter are not very many, but they can ~soften~ the edges of the huge rock that appears before the player from the very first minibosses. Beyond the traditional level of difficulty, from very easy to very difficult, for a total of five distinct configurations, it is possible to adjust the number of reserve spaceships (i.e. lives) and lower the scores which, once reached, give away extra lives. Among other things, the so-called resume point can also be activated, a very useful checkpoint - disabled with the default setting - which allows us not to have to start a stage over again at each death, although, to be honest, it is not exactly accessible as in more modern games, since it can make us replay rather long and tremendously complex sessions. Before starting a game and launching onto the battlefield it is necessary to set up the versatile Vic Viper: there are four different ~Types~ of the spaceship, linked to the arsenal and to the secondary fire modes, which are activated by collecting the classic bonuses released by specific destroyed enemies, usually colored orange. Manageable with the R1 key, the inevitable satellite guns can be blocked forward (Freeze), oriented diagonally (Direction), moved along the vertical axis (Spacing) or rotated around the spaceship (Rotate) according to the type of chosen Vic VI, while the main weapon is upgradable with various upgrades. Double fire, for example, in the Type 1 is directed frontally and diagonally, mentking in Type 2 is in Tailgun mode, i.e. with bullets also fired from the tail of the spaceship, a very useful solution, for example, against the first boss. There are also several bonuses for rockets and missiles, the laser instead of plasma (very appreciated by the most expert players), the increase in speed of the spaceship and the inevitable shield, which can save your life in many circumstances. The interesting aspect of these upgrades is that they are all linked to a selection wheel in real time, and the player, by collecting the appropriate bonuses released by enemies, must click at the right moment to equip the one he wants. Bullets rain The aspect that has sculpted the name of Gradius V in the Olympus of scrolling shooters, in addition to its uncompromising hardcore nature, is undoubtedly the superfine level design, still able to fascinate the player today thanks to the infernal solutions adopted by Treasure , with passages into deep space, huge space stations and sessions in the heart of colossal alien organisms. In addition to the simplest enemies to take down, i.e. the Bacterions (historical nemesis of Gradius) who usually move in formation, there are lots of mini-bosses and bosses, some of which are really huge, so bad and sneaky that to get the better of them you need to learn how to attack pattern memory and transformations. In some circumstances you are literally overwhelmed by enemy firepower, with the entire screen flooded with bullets and the maneuvering space reduced by the imposing size of the bosses; for this reason the developers have slightly sweetened the hitbox of the Vic Viper, which has a certain margin of contact with projectiles and elements of the scenario before exploding. The level of difficulty, as specified, is very high, and the risk of frustration with the consequent launch of the joypad is always around the corner, therefore to make the most of the work Treasure it is necessary to progress with hit and run sessions, with the sole purpose of making a small step forward from the previous game. There are passages that will really make your soul damn, with bosses who never seem to die by continuing to transform and change their attack method; already the second will put your patience to the test. Despite everything, the desire to proceed to the end remains intact even in the absence of a plot, and the level of challenge encourages you to keep coming back to the game, especially if it is possible to face it with the support of a second Vic Viper controlled by a friend. As pointed out in the previous paragraph, we are dealing with an exact copy of the title launched on PlayStation 2 in 2004, and you will notice it as soon as your screen adjusts to a resolution of 720x576 pixels. Although the graphics are pleasant overall, despite having been designed for the old cathode ray tubes, the blurred colors, the absence of an antialiasing filter and, above all, some very annoying slowdowns in the most excited moments, suggest that an optimization work would certainly have helped the return of Gradius V, whose vintage charm is enhanced by the old-fashioned sound effects and the compelling soundtrack signed by Hitoshi Sakimoto.", "date": "2015-05-19", "grade": "7.0"}
