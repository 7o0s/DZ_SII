Furthermore, this year, the French software house found itself in the awkward position of having to respond to an Assassin's Creed III received only lukewarmly by some critics, and to the still very vivid memory of GTA V, which brought the level design and storytelling in free roaming to a whole new level, not to mention the need to come out between two generations of consoles, with all the technical challenges that go with it. Precisely for these reasons, even among the most ardent fans, a certain disillusionment has arisen regarding Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Premonitions perhaps not entirely without foundation, but fortunately debunked by our evidence. After spending more than forty hours in total, we can say without hesitation that this fourth official chapter of the Assassin saga represents a successful work in many respects, starting with a wealth of content that exceeds any wildest expectation. Caribbean The short introductory sequence granted to Edward Kenway, paternal grandfather of Connor ~Ratonhnhak:ton~ and new protagonist, is exemplary in focusing on the cornerstones of Black Flag gameplay. A few seconds and you are already at the helm of a ship, familiarizing yourself with the improved controls and the new physics simulation linked to the sea. The great expanse of salt water that embraces the Caribbean soon becomes the true protagonist of Edward's adventures, an Assassin initially much more unaware, disrespectful and greedy than his illustrious predecessors. Once in control of the Jackdaw, i.e. the vessel owned by the protagonist, the player will be free to explore the vast map at will, covering long distances at sea (or via the fast travel system) and landing at will on islands and atolls , all without interruptions of any kind, with the only exception represented by the three capital cities, which require short loads. The unprecedented extension and the very cohesive and coherent nature of the setting (unlike, for example, that of the predecessor, clearly divided into watertight compartments) goes in great favor of immersion. To be explored far and wide thanks to the long story mode and the many secondary activities, the Caribbean Sea at the end of the 1700s manages to combine freedom of movement and more closed and controlled environments in the same context, such as the three cities and several islands, where primary and secondary missions are faced, without giving up a well-structured level design. Although one often finds oneself moving away from urban contexts, however limited in extension, the developers have finally refined open-air parkour, where secular trees and Mayan ruins no longer make us regret the tall buildings of Venice and Florence . Now evident, now more hidden, the acrobatic courses are all well structured, and give a good freedom of movement and choice in dealing with the different game situations. The story-related missions of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag effectively alternate a large number of different activities. Navigation and naval battles represent only half of the offer, while the remaining hours will be taken up by more traditional tasks for the saga, including stalking, listening to confidential conversations and, of course, fighting and assassinations on commission. The continuous alternation between sea and land life represents one of the most successful aspects of the gait, and guarantees good variety to the progression, largely avoiding repetitiveness. Clearly, the tradition of the series emerges to a greater extent during the assignments on the mainland, which alternate several very successful and spectacular sequences with less lively moments. This is the case, for example, of stalking with possible listening to conversations, repeated with excessive frequency and generally less fun than other proposed activities. On the other hand, the renewed emphasis on stealth shown by many missions is very appreciable, which offer multiple paths and the so-called ~hunting areas~, ie areas very well defended by the guards and dotted with bushes in which to hide and ambush, where he will stay the player to find the best path to reach his goal. There are also some new AI efforts here, with enemy soldiers more active in looking for Edward when a misstep should be made, although the medium difficulty level,as per tradition for the saga, it never reaches high levels. Assassin's Creed IV has features that should be the foundation of any free roam Combat and Weapons Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag offers mixed combat with sidearms and firearms, managing the latter better than seen in its predecessor. The availability of two or four pistols for Edward (depending on the size of the holsters created) allows him to fire several shots in sequence before reloading, and the direct aim system works, allowing even headshots. As far as white weapons are concerned, the double swords held by the protagonist behave as usual, with the possibility of slashing and counterattacking thanks to the special reversal. Enemies still tend, quite conspicuously, to wait for their ~turn~ to attack but, especially during boarding raids, melees can become more chaotic and fun than usual, given the limited space. As always, at the emporiums it will be possible to buy new weapons, with dedicated statistics, and upgrades for Edward's armor, while advancing in the plot, alternative tools will be unlocked, such as the blowgun equipped with classic soporific or fury darts. From the point of view of the interface, the elimination of the awkward circular menu seen in the predecessor is very welcome, replaced by two bars, one horizontal and the other vertical, to be navigated quickly using the directional cross, very useful for quickly changing the configuration of 'attack. Jackdaws About half of the main missions offered by Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag take place in command of Edward's vessel, the Jackdaw, with the full recovery of naval duties already seen in the predecessor. The renewed focus on combat and seaborne exploration comes with a neat overhaul of the combat-related controls, which ditch the awkward manual weapon selection in favor of an automatic, camera-based system. Much more immediate, the latter allows you to fire chained cannonballs (useful for slowing down enemy ships) when looking towards the bow, to make traditional cannon batteries sing when you move the camera to port or starboard, and to launch the explosive barrels (ancient version of today's mines) when the shot is directed towards the stern. Instead, the two navigation speeds that can be managed with the X key (A on Xbox 360) remain mostly unchanged, to which is added a shot from the outside, excellent for observing the landscapes, accompanied by the maximum possible speed. The fight with the enemy ships cannot be said to be excessively complex, but the map is immediately divided into regions, each distinguished by a certain level of difficulty assigned according to the firepower of the Spanish or English ships that cross it. The different quadrants of the map will also prove to be defended by forts on the coasts, which can be attacked and destroyed once and for all, provided you have the necessary firepower and defenses. The fight will take place in two phases, first by sea and then, once the towers have been destroyed, on land, with the aim of eliminating the lieutenants and definitively taking control of the structure. To have a chance against the better armed forts or brigs it will be absolutely necessary to gradually improve various characteristics of the Jackdaw, adding new defenses and weapons (such as the mortar for fire from a distance or powerful, devastating shots from close up), and improving those already present. increasing the number of guns and ammunition effectiveness. To do all this you will need both generous amounts in Rel, the in-game currency, and raw materials, including wood, metal and fabric. These can be recovered both by subtracting them from various warehouses, very well defended and located on the mainland (identifying the guard in possession of the key), and by defeating the enemy ships. The cargo and the offensive capabilities of the Spanish and English vessels in sight on the horizon can be discovered, even from afar, thanks to the telescope, after which the chosen victim can be designated and attacked at will. If the combat is successful, you will have two choices, sinking or boarding. The first, faster, will yield about half the cargo, while the second will give access to all the contents of the hold, and will also allow the player to choose whether to use the remains of the enemy ship to repair the Jackdaw, automatically reduce his notoriety, or assign the vessel to Edward's fleet, which via a special interactive map can be sent to carry out raids (a bit like what happened withon the Brotherhood Assassins), thus exponentially increasing the accumulation of money. In case you choose to board, however, to gain control of the ship it will first be necessary to eliminate a certain number of members of the enemy crew (from five to fifteen, depending on the size of the vessel) and, possibly, some lieutenants or sharpshooters posted on master trees. The Jackdaw can also be customized in terms of aesthetics, with increasingly elegant sails and ornaments, and from a certain point in the plot Edward will also have a hideout, represented by a mansion and a marina, which can also be customized by investing the money accumulated. Overall, from the first time the cannons are fired to the most prolonged battles, the re-enactment of naval battles represents one of the best aspects of Black Flag, both thanks to the fun mechanics and thanks to the extraordinary reproduction of the sea, the winds , storms and even waterspouts. Not just plot Side activities have always been part of the Assassin's Creed philosophy, and Black Flag presents what is probably the most crowded collection yet. It begins with the four keys of the Templars to be found, each obtainable following the completion of a small sequence of more or less complex tasks. Once recovered, they will unlock the usual special armor to wear as desired. We then move on to pirate and maritime-themed activities, such as the search for treasures thanks to the maps (which research really isn't, given the coordinates in full view...), underwater exploration in search of chests and harpoon fishing . Depending on your liking, these activities can take just a few minutes or many hours, as in the case of fishing, which provides for separate upgrades for the small boat used, and the possibility of creating personalized clothes like a real fisherman. The hunting of many animal species makes its return directly from its predecessor, the skins of which can be transformed immediately into useful upgrades to equipment (the laziest ones can always buy them in the emporiums, ready-made, however at prices that are not exactly cheap). Not to forget the additional naval missions, to be unlocked by conquering the forts on the coast, and the legendary vessels, naval fortresses which hunting will not be easy at all. More classic and difficult to find collectibles are instead represented by the Fragments of the Animus, which make their return from Revelations, and by the song sheets to be taught to the crew to cheer up the navigation (which behave like the letters in Assassin's Creed III) . More marginal from a gameplay point of view, but no less numerous, the Abstergo Challenges present themselves as a long list of actions to be performed repeatedly (killings under certain conditions, and so on), which gradually unlock a series of modifiers for the levels, which can be activated at will in the already completed sequences, with some hilarious effects. Overall, the side activities offered by Black Flag demonstrate how hard Ubisoft has worked on creating a large and believable game world, and they work very well. They fit pleasantly between one mission and another, perhaps when out of the corner of your eye you notice an island full of treasures while sailing, and above all they encourage exploration and completion, representing a real added value to the plot, already very long lasting in itself. The golden age As already mentioned at the beginning, Edward Kenway fits in a very particular way among the ranks of the Assassins known to date. If Ezio Auditore could not already be said to be in all respects faithful to the Creed, the captain of the Jackdaw represents an even more extreme figure, starting with his encounter-clash with the Order, completely fortuitous. Its characterization fits well into the historical context affected by Black Flag, i.e. the so-called Golden Age of Piracy (about 1650-1730), which saw the rapid rise and fall of a large number of sea dogs, which over the centuries real legends. The romantic dreams of freedom and anarchy that accompany the black flag with skull and crossbones have been reinterpreted by the Ubisoft screenwriters to great effect, punctuating the narrative with historical characters (from Edward ~Blackbeard~ Thatch to Stede Bonnet) and true events, but above all by enveloping the plot in a nostalgic seafaring atmosphere, unique in its own way in the videogame field, and even original, far from excessive nods to the cinematic success of the Pirates of the Caribbean tetralogy. This also contributes to the success of Black Flag, by distancing", "date": "2013-10-29", "grade": "9.2"}
