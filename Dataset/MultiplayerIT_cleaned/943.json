{"name": "Stronghold 2: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stronghold-2-la-recensione.html", "text": "Double click Our analysis of Sh2 will literally start from the beginning of the game: the initial loading. Normally overlooked in 99% of articles as not relevant, alas I must warn you that this game is one of the longest I've ever had the opportunity to witness even on fairly powerful PCs, losing patience enough in waiting. The best thing to do in these cases is certainly to go and fulfill one's physiological needs in order to prepare for the game session that awaits us. With regard to loading, however, the automatic update of the game should also be appreciated, which every time it is started will connect to the Firefly Studios site in search of any updates, downloading and installing them completely automatically (repeatedly clicking on the ~next~ button does not it's so tiring isn't it?) saving us the exhausting search to which every gamer has been subjected at least once in his life between free mirrors and broken links. Once the update and loading are complete, we find ourselves in front of the presentation of the game, made in a slightly less spectacular and more ~deep~ way than what we are used to seeing with titles close to the Sh2 genre. Once we get to the game menu, we are asked to choose between playing in single or multiplayer mode: although it is possible to play on custom maps created for the occasion, both via the Internet and GameSpy and via LAN (mode added in patch 1.1), the game clearly focuses on offline, offering the gamer a range of certainly satisfying modes that will help keep him entertained for some time. The first novelty offered by the game is in fact the possibility to choose between two game ~philosophies~: the way of peace and the way of war. As the titles will surely have suggested to you as they are not very free to interpret, the first mode focuses more on the economic and social growth of one's castle, putting armed conflicts in the background, which instead dominate in the second. Wanting to be a gentleman, thus choosing the path of peace, as before we have the possibility, we can undertake a campaign with objectives such as obtaining a certain amount of money and/or goods, the construction of a specific structure and more generally aimed at the development economic. It is also possible to choose to play peacefully on some maps supplied by default or to load scenarios created according to our tastes. If, on the other hand, it is the hard life in the Middle Ages made up of princesses to be saved, fearless knights and evil dragons that interests you, the choice will certainly fall on the path of war: more similar to the game mode of the first Sh, this allows you to choose between a to the conquest of the throne over the kingdom in struggle, a skirmish mode not different from those already seen on other occasions, as well as the possibility of loading custom maps in this case too. Last but not least, we also have the opportunity to relive ten historical sieges against real castles. Hand to weapons As already anticipated in the preview phase (which you can read here if interested), those who have already had the opportunity to play one of the two Strongholds preceding this one will not have much difficulty settling into the new game system. However, even novices to the series will not find particular difficulties thanks to the tutorial, which explains the main actions and constructions, and the in-game help available at any time. The first thing to do is to place the granary and the warehouse, where to keep the basic necessities such as food and raw materials, after which it is necessary to provide for the nourishment of one's subjects, under penalty of their removal from our castle: to do this we have the possibility to grow fruit, vegetables and hunt game. The more we are able to provide them with food, the greater their degree of satisfaction with us, thus also attracting other commoners from neighboring provinces when we need them. Once the maximum number of inhabitants of our castle has been reached, it will be necessary to build additional huts to house the new arrivals, as needed, thus allowing new enlistments in our army or the creation of new work units. One of the things that distinguishes Sh2 from the competition is the lack of time required for the construction of the structures: in practice, at any time we can choose a construction and place it immediately, without having to wait for it to be built by our workers. Among the most intriguing aspects of the game we certainly find the various economic chains, through which we obtain a simuvery realistic action of what life was actually like in the Middle Ages Hand to weapons Among the most intriguing aspects of the game we certainly find the various economic chains, through which we obtain a very realistic simulation of what life actually was like in the Middle Ages (and beyond): to enlist new members in the army, for example, it is necessary to build first their weapons, as well as to obtain fabric to resell to other provinces we must first raise sheep to obtain wool and then have it worked by the seamstress. Through the introduction of crime, structures already present in the old game, such as hanging poles, will have a new meaning beyond that of keeping workers efficient (at the expense of popularity): reminding any bad guys that crime does not pay , thus avoiding that the infrastructures are looted or destroyed, resulting in an abandonment of the castle by its inhabitants. Another thing to watch out for are fires in buildings: since these are mainly made of wood, it will be necessary to position some well workers who will put out any fire. The artificial intelligence of the enemies stands at quite high levels, given that they will often try to identify flaws in our defensive system, putting it to the test and very frequently finding a way to make us spend a bad quarter of an hour. The battles, even the largest ones, are easily controllable and spectacular, especially the siege phases, where the game gives its best. The new honor system implemented by the developers certainly deserves a separate discussion: by obtaining points we will have the opportunity to buy nearby territories and build particular buildings. One way to be promoted from the point of view of honor is to provide the commoners with different types of food: for example, if we are able to guarantee apples and meat we get one honor point, as well as several by organizing parties and dances of court. 3D...finally! As we have already had the opportunity to repeat abundantly, Sh's real flaw was the lack of a real 3D engine, which made itself felt even though the 2D isometric view was quite malleable. Now playing Sh2 is a pleasure for the eyes, given that apart from a few small bugs (some have been fixed with version 1.1, while others will be fixed in the future) the detail is in fact taken care of down to the smallest detail: we can in fact see the barn fill up with different foodstuffs, the crops of apples and vegetables grow and mature gradually and then be harvested by the various farmers and so on and so forth, with an extremely accurate zoom level. Obviously, being in the presence of a 3D engine, the camera is completely rotatable, with the possibility of making an ~architectural~ view, i.e. aimed at our buildings from above. As far as the sound is concerned, we can declare ourselves satisfied with effects and music, even if we must say it is nothing transcendental. if it is often said that sequels are not worthy of their predecessors, Stronghold 2 is the so-called exception that proves the rule After the parenthesis of Space Colony, Firefly Studios return to the series that made them famous by churning out a product of the highest level: if it is often said that the sequels are not worthy of their predecessors, Stronghold 2 constitutes the so-called exception which confirms the rule. The changes made to the graphics, essential both for a new relaunch in 2005 and for a deeper and more satisfying gaming experience, combined with the new gameplay additions, make the mosaic of the Stronghold series what fans of this genre could want from a video game , guaranteeing a fair level of longevity thanks to the various game modes. Long live the king! Pros: 3D engine implemented New game modes Gameplay renewed keeping the old solidity Cons: Initial loading endless Some minor bugs Part of the guide a bit too laconic Those who don't die see each other again Long-time readers of this magazine also with a good memory, will surely have noticed the quote in the introductory hat to the Stronghold review, which appeared in the now distant 2001 on these pages. Then as now, the Firefly Studios product was awaited with considerable interest by both insiders and non-experts, due to the promises of innovation made by the development team, which were kept by relying at the same time on some solid and tested. The biggest flaw of the game was certainly the 2D graphics, which even fourro years ago it was becoming obsolete (or perhaps we should say that it had already become obsolete in all respects). Coming to more recent times the Firefly, aware of the saying ~to err is human, to persevere is diabolical~, promised a new Stronghold 2, with the excellent characteristics of its father combined with some improvements that would have made it a game not to be missed.", "date": "2005-05-02", "grade": null}
