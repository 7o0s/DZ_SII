On the other side of the road, which you cross on the strip listening to a peculiar sound effect each time (happy intuition for the blind), there is a SEGA Club with a mix of classics and modern productions: with a hundred yen you can have a play Virtua Fighter or Taiko: Drum Master, that silly coin-op with drums; or operate one of the many machines to fish any prizes with a mechanical arm. If you are hungry, you can go and eat in one of the many restaurants, large and small, present in practically every neighborhood, for all tastes and budgets: from the ramen stall to sushi bars. Finally, in the evening, one can choose to squander one's salary by entering one of those clubs where one is served and revered by beautiful girls, with whom, however, they can only have conversation: stretching out one's hands would lead to unpleasant consequences, given that most of these exercises it is owned by the local mafia. We have not just described the last trip to Japan, but only some of the collateral activities with which it is possible to engage in Yakuza 5, the episode of the SEGA series released at home in December 2012 and arrived in the West only now; very late but welcomed with enthusiasm by fans of the franchise, as a demonstration of the fact that the publisher wants to offer this kind of products again in the USA and Europe. In the game we play the role of Kazuma Kiryu, but also of four other characters (Taiga Saejima, Haruka Sawamura, Shun Akiyama and Tatsuo Shinada), who alternate within five chapters of a single player campaign that lasts over fifty hours, in case you want to complete all the side quests in addition to the main missions. Yakuza 5 is confirmed as a full-bodied and convincing product, probably the best episode of the series The fire inside The key element of Yakuza 5 is undoubtedly the narrative, which involves and fascinates right from the start. The intensity of the Japanese dialogues is impressive, but it must be clarified immediately that the subtitles are only present in English, which inevitably affects the enjoyment of many small collateral texts in the long run; and it's a shame, because in those sketches it is possible to find an extraordinary work of characterization of the authors, focused more on Japanese culture than on the surrounding characters, from this point of view somewhat stereotyped. After the events of the fourth episode, Kazuma Kiryu has decided to leave the Tojo clan and start a new life in Fukuoka, under the fictitious identity of Taichi Suzuki, a taxi driver. However, the city is in turmoil due to a meeting between the commanders of the Tojo clan and the Yahata family, apparently destined to establish an alliance, albeit an uneasy one. Dojima Daigo, an old friend of Kazuma, is dealing with the negotiation with Tadashi Madarame, but disappears mysteriously immediately after the meeting. Someone kidnapped him to screw up the operation? While determined to stay out of the affairs of the yakuza, the protagonist of the game will not be able to back down in the face of a series of events. This is the incipit of the first of the five parts that make up the Yakuza 5 campaign, which, as mentioned, include a great variety of main and secondary activities. In the role of Kazuma, Taiga, Shun and Tatsuo we will find ourselves exploring important districts of five major cities (Fukuoka, Nagoya, Tokyo, Sapporo and Osaka), often coming into conflict with criminals, gang members or simple bullies, to be put back in line fighting. Compared to the previous episodes, where the clashes were managed like a jRPG from the point of view of the setting and waiting times, this time you fight in the midst of passers-by, practically without interludes and building up a repertoire of moves that in maneuvers Basically it appears a bit repetitive, but it gives its best when we grab the numerous objects present in the scenario (a la Dead Rising, in short) and use them for some of the craziest and most spectacular finishers ever seen. Kazuma grabbing a city bike, runs towards the opponent ~wheeling~ in his face and then crushing the frame on him is an exciting scene, just as the ~grater~ move to finish off an enemy on the ground by flaying his face on the asphalt; but the variations are numerous and also imply the use of background elements, such as mura and ostacoli. Fighting styles change according to the character and in fact Taiga tends to charge shots to place devastating uppercuts, while Tatsuo prefers joint grips to knock out his challengers. However, the campaign with the young Haruka is very different: determined to become an idol, the girl will have to grapple with rhythm game-style dance challenges, exhausting workouts, participation in television programs and even ~greeting~ sessions with enamored fans. terribly close to reality. Lots of things to do and see As mentioned, the main missions of the Yakuza 5 campaign involve exploration and combat, the latter also useful for obtaining information about our next objective on the map. The rendering of the impacts is excellent and makes the fights fun, as well as quite challenging (but the healing products are practically never lacking in the inventory), although inevitably the action becomes repetitive after a while. In any case, the thickness of the experience lies above all in the secondary activities, which, as mentioned, abound and substantially increase the duration of the game. As a taxi driver, Kazuma will be able to walk customers by paying attention to traffic lights, preselection lanes, direction indicators and crosswalks, dosing acceleration and braking to avoid jolts and in the meantime also trying to make a little conversation. These are rather tedious missions, which fortunately alternate with crazy speed races (graphically very dated, it must be said), arcade games, mini-games involving ramen cooking or blind dates, as well as quests that use traditional mechanisms to involve us in the affairs of secondary characters: a shopkeeper threatened by some criminals, a girl who has run away from home, a stage assistant looking for an actor, a mysterious taxi in danger, and so on. With Taiga at a certain point you find yourself engaged in hunting sessions against the background of a snowy forest, while as mentioned Haruka's activities all revolve around minigames and therefore constitute an excellent way to shuffle the gameplay cards and propose a break from to the standard structure of the game. Watch out for the save system, however, decidedly ~old school~: after a game over it is possible to resume the game exactly where we were but, in case of switching off the console, it will be better that you have saved the progress in one of the special boxes present in certain places. Playstation 3 trophies There are fifty-seven Trophies included in Yakuza 5, and obtaining them is simply a matter of commitment. There are in fact the achievements linked to the completion of the individual chapters, which therefore block in any case, but many others based on the realization of a certain number of specific actions: talking to passers-by, completing all the jobs, sending a large amount of money to the orphanage where Kazuma comes from and so on. Dated but charming It's really a shame that it took three years to see Yakuza 5 in the West, since at the time of the Japanese release the game offered substantial improvements over the previous episode, with some reused assets (see the animations), sure, but also an all-new engine and the ability to portray certain urban views with impressive fidelity. There are plenty of low-definition textures, there are no connecting movements to avoid the ~tank~ effect during the short movements of the characters, the speed races seem to come out of a PlayStation 2 title (if you want to be good) and the scenarios that form the backdrop to the longer combat phases appear empty and desolate, but at the same time the care of the faces is extraordinary, in support of the already vaunted quality narration, and the direction never misses a beat, managing to create sequences of great atmosphere or of great impact (Kazuma dodging two missiles while remaining impassive: can we talk about it?). Shooting inside the cities proves to be an exciting experience, which some technical limits fail to scratch, and the pop-up of passers-by occurs at such a distance that it is not annoying. Of course, to have a new generation Yakuza in the West we will have to wait a little longer, but considering the reference platform, the timing and the budget available, there is very little to complain about. Apart perhaps from the music, which more often than not appears out of place and fails, except in the slowest stages, to enhance what is happening on the screen.", "date": "2015-12-15", "grade": "8.5"}
