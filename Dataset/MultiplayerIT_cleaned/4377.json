And yet - unlike other fields where the giants have crushed the smaller retailers with their gargantuan size - here the independent world survives, even reaching the point of crunching more than commendable numbers every holy year. The motivation is easy to say: in the multifaceted field of video games each product is a mix of technical skills and pure talent, where creativity is often more important than cheap money. The lack of money is therefore made up for with ingenuity, and therefore numerous tiny teams were born ready to experiment in every field, often with extraordinary results. FTL, by Subset Games, was exactly one of these brilliant experiments: a curious mix between strategy and management, with procedural elements that made each game unique and a very high difficulty capable of worrying even veterans of the genre. It should therefore come as no surprise that the duo's second title was expected as a second coming of the messiah by many fans of the game; on the other hand, the chances of a new almost perfect center were all there. Ah, clearly we have always been among the ~faithful~, but unlike those who blindly believed in the title we had several concerns, deriving from the limited experience of the software house. After trying it thoroughly, however, we have completely converted and get ready to spread the sacred word, because Into the Breach is not only a second center, but one of the best strategists we have ever played. And we are not exaggerating. Pacific Rim, but smart Into the Breach is a title that makes simplicity and clarity its main strengths. Said of a turn-based strategy might seem crazy, but we assure you that in this case we are faced with a product very different from what the genre has accustomed us to. This concreteness is noticeable from the first moments, where with a few short sentences a pilot greets an earth destroyed by an alien invasion, and prepares to reach a new timeline to try not to repeat the failure of his mission. And this is the fundamental concept of the game: you are time travelers committed to saving the earth from a race of insectoids known as the Vek, eternally trapped by the coils of destiny and even ready to die to favor the defeat of the enemy (The inspiration from stuff like All you Need is Kill is evident, but everything is turned strategically). It is a narrative that goes well with the ~roguelike~ nature of the game: every time you finish facing the Vek everything is reset to the next timeline, as happened in FTL with each new game. Only here you can take a single pilot out of the three usable with you, and therefore you always keep something from the previous test. Among the various pilots, of course, it is possible to obtain specialists with unique skills and already leveled to maximum capacity, yet it is not in the development of your best agent that the splendor of this title lies (after all, pilots can only go up by two levels each), since it is its mechanics that make it a small masterpiece of tactics and design. At the apex of the system, in particular, there is the management of the clashes, where positioning and careful use of the weapons of the various units available are essential in order not to succumb. Mech and cheese Let's go into detail: Into the Breach is a turn-based strategy game with grid movement, and its maps are enormously smaller than those of other exponents of the genre, but precisely because of their minute size they are often too full of threats and elements to be protected at all costs. The Veks are fought on four different islands with the help of mechs of varying class, equipped with their own health point bar and the ability to perform one movement and one action per turn (unless they are piloted by someone capable of break this rule), whereas instead the player's ~life~ is indicated by an energy bar that goes down whenever the Vek hit a building containing an electricity source. At the end of each fight, the life of the mechs is completely regenerated, making their defense partially expendable, but not the energy bar: the only way to recover it is to complete one of the zones into which the islands are divided, provided that this indicate an extra point of energy among the final rewardsto. However, if you choose to focus on energy regeneration, you risk losing precious reputation points, which once the island is completed allow you to upgrade your mechs with additional energy reactors, buy additional weapons, or can simply be spent to recover energy lost at the start. Put simply, you have to be tactical even in choosing which sectors to save, also because in the islands the last three zones are always destroyed by the Vek, regardless of your actions. On the field, then, things make an impressive leap in quality, and everything turns into a chess game with a myriad of variables. In practice Into the Breach shows you every single information of the case: the damage that the Veks will do, where they will attack and from where on the ground they will appear in the next turn, complete with indications of the additional atmospheric effects and order of attack. With all this data, it is therefore only up to you to decide how to act to overcome the rounds by sacrificing as few resources as possible, whether it is the life points of your mechs, buildings and human lives, or the objectives to be completed to obtain the final rewards (which norm are the most important part to keep an eye on). A dangerous chessboard Everything works wonderfully, not much more to say. Already on easy difficulty you will often find yourself racking your brains to block the spawn of monsters - just place the mech above the Vek's exit area, provided you take damage the next turn, or move with an attack with movement properties one of enemies on top of a nest, causing the Vek themselves to kill each other (also works when they reposition themselves before an attack) - or to sacrifice a life point of one of your units to do additional damage to an opponent by bouncing it on them, or again , positioning yourself as a barrier to protect a building in a particularly infamous situation, or even drowning non-flying insectoids in nearby water sources. The possibilities offered by the game are many, and you can only use one turn reset per battle (even if the movement before acting can be reset at will), so there's really no need to act in a hurry. Then consider that, by completing the various achievements present, gold coins are unlocked with which it becomes possible to buy other teams of mechs - each equipped with new powers and built to have a specific synergy with other units - to the point of leading to a total change of playstyle based on your team's choice (for example, a team is totally built around immunity to fire and the ability to set a lot of terrain on fire). This formula quickly becomes an addiction, and makes you forget the cruel reality of permadeath during the campaign, which especially on other difficulties can become frighteningly brutal due to the monstrous number of enemies and the aggressiveness of the artificial intelligence. In short, Into the Breach is mechanically perfect: its procedural formula is never infamous, and it is calculated to the point to maximize the player's ingenuity, not to mention that it is really possible to complete it with every team available at any difficulty, provided you don't make no mistake. Its only weaknesses perhaps lie in the imbalances between certain teams, significantly more difficult to use than others, and in the technical sector, always basic and ~retro~ (but still pleasant). Robetta recently anyway; so there's really no need to miss out on this top quality indie.", "date": "2018-03-04", "grade": "9.0"}
