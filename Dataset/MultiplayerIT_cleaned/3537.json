{"name": "Banana Kong Blast", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/banana-kong-blast-recensione.html", "text": "Banana Kong Blast arrives long after the first episode of the series, that Banana Kong which clearly paid homage to the character and lore of Donkey Kong by catapulting us into a horizontally scrolling endless runner with various platform elements. Well, if possible the homage is even more obvious this time, because the new title from FDG Entertainment takes verbatim the sections with wooden barrels of the Nintendo franchise and transforms them into an experience in its own right, in fact a spin-off which abandons the endless structure in favor of something more sophisticated, in this case standard missions with increasing difficulty that take place within six different worlds. The game is offered on the App Store and Google Play in the traditional freemium format, downloadable for free, and it is possible to play without spending money as long as you accept a little wait if the five available hearts run out, each of which takes ten minutes to play. restored. Sometimes it is possible to watch an advertising trailer to refill the energy gauge or agree to unlock the premium version for 5.49 euros and thus obtain infinite lives and no advertising. A move that should certainly be evaluated if the gameplay of Banana Kong Blast convinces you, after all it takes just a few minutes to understand its mechanics and potential. Gameplay and structure As anticipated, Banana Kong Blast differs from the previous Banana Kong, released in 2013, and does something different: it takes the sections with the typical Donkey Kong wooden barrels and transforms them into the main game mechanic. Our character, a nice gorilla, therefore finds himself jumping from one barrel to another collecting bananas and coins, respectively useful for buying aesthetic objects with which to furnish the protagonist's house and for obtaining the best evaluation in each stage for the purposes of progression . The touch control system supports the simplicity of this formula by asking us to make a single touch on the screen to take the leap or a continued pressure where particular maneuvers need to be performed. Everything else depends on our reflexes: if the first levels look like the proverbial health walk, going forward in the countryside you come across rather difficult sections, in which you have to calculate the times very well because the barrels move, rotate, alternate with lianas, multiply creating alternative paths and so on. There is no shortage of obstacles along the way, and every misstep is punished with the loss of a heart, even if the game continues exactly where we left off: forget the frustration of having to repeat the entire journey all over again. Although somewhat repetitive, the action of Banana Kong Blast manages to offer enough variation to keep the interest alive, challenging us to complete increasingly complex sections while being chased by a tornado to give an extra boost to the challenge. From a technical point of view, the developers have created a very pleasant world to look at, colorful and well animated, diversified in its settings, which flows smoothly on the screen while the soundtrack keeps us company with tunes that are not unmissable but nice.", "date": "2019-08-26", "grade": "8.0"}
