Sometimes we still ask ourselves, when maybe the genres intersect and the final result is a mix of different mechanics, as happens for example for action platforms or third-person shooters. However, we are unable to understand how the developers of Rise to Fame: The Music RPG were able to present their product as an RPG, given that on balance it is only a casual game with some minimal action implications. As written in the introduction, in this title our goal is to manage a rock band during a tour that will take them to perform in the most diverse places, from small venues to large concert halls. Each successful evening will make us earn experience points and level up, so as to unlock not only new skills for the four members of the group, but also a large number of objects that will allow us to customize their appearance and give them special bonuses. The experience-based reward system also serves to access the new locations, seven in all, as well as to enrich the musical repertoire, made up of a total of five fairly well-made songs that the band will really play during our game sessions. But how hard is the climb... We said that Rise to Fame: The Music RPG actually has very little to do with the role-playing game genre. So how exactly does the gameplay work? It's simple: from the starting screen we can select one of the available scenarios and decide which song to perform with, then start the music and try to get acclaim from the audience until an indicator placed on the right side of the screen fills up completely, testifying to the degree satisfaction of the people who came to listen to us. Clearly we won't have all the time in the world to achieve the goal, but only the two or three minutes of the song, and depending on the level it will be more or less complicated to please the fans. Some of them, moreover, won't fail to boo us or even throw bottles and other blunt objects at us, a practice that will end up dampening the band's enthusiasm (literally), making it more difficult to end the evening successfully. In the lower part of the touch screen there are the skills of the singer, the guitarist, the bassist and the drummer, i.e. the actions that we can perform (respecting a different cool down period for each one) to make the audience unleash and fill the indicator of above. These skills can be enhanced during the story mode and will be accompanied by other more or less effective maneuvers, which we will have to alternate to keep the enthusiasm up. The action therefore takes place in this way, now launching a guitar solo, now an incitement from the singer, making the drummer throw a plate at a potential threat and using the bassist's skills mainly to ~heal~ the band and recover from a difficult situation. Beyond the sound sector, as mentioned more than discreet, Rise to Fame: The Music RPG can count on good graphics for characters and locations, although the show offered often turns out to be very static.", "date": "2012-06-28", "grade": "7.0"}
