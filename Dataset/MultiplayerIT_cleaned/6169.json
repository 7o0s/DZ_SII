Maybe one day we will be able to find out, but it is necessary that the franchise developed by Radical Entertainment returns to the spotlight, creating a minimum of expectation for a possible third next-gen episode. To achieve this, Activision has made the most obvious decision, resorting to the usual remaster and inserting the two chapters of the series in the Biohazard Bundle, available for a few days in digital format for Xbox One and PlayStation 4. The dynamics that led to the publication of the compilation however, they are bizarre, with a muted announcement and a presentation that is anomalous right from the start, given that the download of the two titles takes place separately and not from the point of view of a collection proper. Strengthened by past experiences with the adventures of Alex Mercer first and James Heller then, but aware that we could be quite disappointed by the remastering work carried out, we tried our hand at the bundle trying to keep expectations in check. Prototype: Bioharzard Bundle includes two excellent action games, but the quality of the remaster is poor Prototypes and stereotypes Originally released in 2009, Prototype puts you in the role of Alex Mercer, an ex-soldier who awakens from the dead after being infected with a mysterious virus. Nothing debilitating, indeed: the anomaly transforms Alex into a real war machine, capable of shaping its cellular structure at will and of assuming different forms, as well as developing weapons of extraordinary power. Resources that will come in handy, against the backdrop of a New York that sees the number of infected rise rapidly, people who, unlike the protagonist, become horrible mutants and who are summarily exterminated by the Blackwatch, an unscrupulous military division that has been charged with containing the epidemic at any cost. Mercer is indicated by the media as the one who voluntarily spread the virus, but the truth is different and we will have to find out during a particularly full-bodied campaign, which exploits the peculiarities of the sandbox structure to offer us main and secondary missions, with a view to remarkable hours. However, what is striking about Prototype is the extraordinary freedom, the immediacy of controls that allow you to do practically anything: run down the street or on the walls of buildings, make enormous leaps and ~glide~ from one roof to another to move faster towards the targets, grab cars and vans to throw them at gunships or tanks, in a riot of explosions, bullets, missiles and devastating special moves. The validity of this system has not been affected by the passage of time, but from a technical point of view the game has aged badly and the remaster does not do it justice: beyond the increase in resolution, brought to 1080p, the visual sector abounds of old-gen polygonal models, very ugly and repetitive textures, a basic lighting system, which makes the surfaces too flat, and animations that are also rather limited, both in terms of quality and quantity. Whoever took care of the conversion therefore wanted to do it at the minimum wage, without improving any asset and leaving intact a graphic that was already not crazy at the time, focusing for obvious reasons more on the number of objects on the screen than on their pleasantness. However, what leaves us more perplexed is the frame rate, which under these conditions and with this degree of definition should have reached sixty frames per second without problems, and instead not only stops at thirty but also allows itself to struggle in more than one hour. occasion. A bad technical result and a great pity, given the validity of the contents. Xbox One goals The Achievements present in Prototype and Prototype 2 are respectively forty and forty-three, for a total of 2000 Gamerpoints. As expected, the achievement system of the games is based on the sandbox structure, therefore on the completion of individual missions (both the main and secondary ones) and on the execution of a certain number of actions: eliminating twenty-five assault teams, dodging ten missiles , destroy ten bases, kill ten or more enemies with a single special attack, and so on. Of course, there are even goodies for the more savvy, such as completing the game without ever dying or without killing more than ten civilians, the latter thing being really difficult to do. The virus spreads Released in 2012, three years after the first episode, Prototype 2 takes us back to New York; or, better, in New York Zero, as the city is now off limits after the massive spread of the contagion, with the healthy inhabitants being locked up in ghettos by Blackwatch troops. Returning from Iraq and convinced that Alex Mercer murdered his wife and daughter, Sergeant James Heller is determined to kill the Prototype with Alex's hands, but ends up infected himself and gains the same abilities as Mercer. From the gameplay point of view, some important changes can be seen: an optimization of the controls that makes certain maneuvers more intuitive, such as the aerial shot or the same jump; a rationalization of the upgrades, which in the first Prototype were perhaps too easy to obtain, to the detriment of the challenge; a focus on the stealth aspect of the missions, with Heller who often and willingly has to absorb an enemy and take on his appearance to enter bases and / or access certain documents. In short, the developers have tried to enrich the experience by focusing on the best aspects of the package and enhancing them, but the differences also catch the eye on the graphics front, decidedly more sophisticated than the original Prototype: more complex polygonal models with well-finished animations , better and more varied textures, but above all effects capable of adding depth and personality to those same settings which in the first episode were so flat, dull and anonymous. In terms of sound, we must also highlight the presence of a discreet dubbing in Italian, with Andrea Bolognini effectively interpreting Heller. Well, despite a better starting point, in particular from a technical point of view, Prototype 2 is the least brilliant episode from the point of view of the remastering: here too we limited ourselves to bringing the resolution to 1080p and the greater graphic complexity partially buffers the lack of improved assets, but the frame rate suffers from rather noticeable drops when moving at speed, which is almost always. It's not an issue that would make the experience unplayable, but it's obvious and unacceptable when considering the Xbox One hardware. In short, with the Biohazard Bundle it seems that Activision has played the ~maximum result with minimum effort~ card, but without verifying the results obtained before the release; or - but it would be more serious - deeming the work adequate at a sale price which, however, seems to us decidedly not in line with the quality of the offer.", "date": "2015-07-24", "grade": "5.0"}
