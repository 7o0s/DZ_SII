{"name": "Galaga Legions - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/galaga-legions-recensione.html", "text": "That great cauldron of old glories, unpublished games and remakes that responds to the name of Live Arcade, now finds its place for any kind of video game, from every era and for all tastes, representing a parallel and surrogate choice to the traditional titles that find space on shop counters. Every week, on Wednesdays, there are important releases, twists and welcome surprises. The latter is precisely the case of Galaga Legions, the ideal sequel to that Namco title released way back in 1981, already the successor of Galaxian from which it drew inspiration for most of its gameplay. First of all, we still find our ship, which alone has to face hordes of insectoid robots, but the possibility of going deep, up and down the screen is now added to the movement limited to horizontal scrolling. This is not a trivial improved porting of the first chapter, but a new, fresh video game with many new ideas. A small classic that follows in the footsteps of a great Galaga Legions is a totally renewed and modern shooter. Through the five schemes that make up the game (something more could have been done) our spaceship, assisted by two mobile turrets, faces hordes of enemies and end-of-level bosses in full vintage arcade style, but infinitely faster and more frenetic. With the left analog stick we move, while with the right one we release the two side turrets, giving them the direction of fire. In practice, wherever we are, by pressing a direction we detach a laser from our spaceship and position it where we want, indicating the direction of fire with the analog itself, at the time of release and with a single gesture. The enemies (or rather, the swarms of opponents) that come upon us are heralded by a luminous trail which indicates their complete movement within the scheme, before reaching us. Looking at these signals, our task is to position the mobile turrets as intelligently as possible in order to anticipate the enemy and destroy him more easily, making sure not to find too many of them all at once. This is the key to Galaga Legions, a gameplay as simple as it is difficult to explain in words, deep, immediate and engaging. This is the key to Galaga Legions, a gameplay as simple as it is difficult to explain in words, deep, immediate and engaging There are no smart bombs, but sometimes it is possible to activate a sort of black buno that sucks in all the enemy galaga and transforms them into our allies: in this way we find ourselves no longer commanding two simple self-moving laser shuttles, but entire squadrons of spaceships they will aim their weapons how and where we want. The Galaga who fight alongside us are easily destructible, and on first contact with the enemy they vaporize instantly. It's a good thing, therefore, to make the most of the rare moments in which we find them by our side. In story mode you play one level at a time, until the end, as if we were in an arcade. By selecting league, however, you compete to obtain the highest possible score, and then send it to the Xbox Live online rankings. The latter mode is precisely the one that gives longevity to the title, as the only five proposed schemes can easily be completed in a very short time. Visually, Galaga Legions is an orgasm of colour, shape and enemies in motion. The minimalist style, combined with the use of saturated and lively colors, can remind some of Rez, the SEGA jewel recently re-proposed also on the Live Arcade. Galaga Legions does not enjoy particularly elaborate backdrops: all the schemes take place in spatial and futuristic contexts, with very few side elements. It is a very specific choice, which puts the player in a position to concentrate fully on the crucial points of the game: his own shuttle and the enemies. Everything flows very smoothly and convincingly, especially the sinuous movements of the enemy spaceships, of which the screen is always full. Hitting the motherships is the only way to make a clean sweep quickly, as in doing so all those following in tow are also pulverized at the same time. Each scheme is visually well characterized, not so much by the polygonal figures on the screen (almost totally absent), but by the use of dominant colors, game speed and amount of enemies. The audio sector is instead the one on which the developers could have done much better: with the quantity of electronic music artists present in Japan, and the high quality of the oriental productions, it is difficult to believe that they have not managed to find a more involvinginstitution and less anonymous. The level of challenge is gradual and intense towards the end, and once the fateful game over writing appears, you feel the desire to continue further, but unfortunately Galaga Legions offers only that handful of levels. Too bad for the lack of any multiplayer mode: it does not exist locally, nor via Xbox Live. Comment Galaga Legions is a great example of how to revitalize and modernize a very old classic. The new additions make it even more frenetic and extreme, and the psychedelic, colorful and crazy graphics are a feast for the eyes thanks to the high definition and the excellent color choice. The level design is superb, as is the challenge that Galaga Legions poses to the most savvy players. Too bad for the lack of any type of multiplayer, and for only two game modes: from this point of view, perhaps something more could have been done. Pros Graphics and level design Infinite challenge New gameplay solutions Cons Nothing multiplayer Soundtrack not very incisive Galaga Legions objectives Like any title downloaded from the Live Arcade service, Galaga Legions also makes the fateful 200 points available to the player. The game has only 12 objectives to conquer, simply by completing each area in the two game modes. Finally, two particular actions are required: complete a chapter without losing a single life, or without using satellite weapons. Set the difficulty to low, getting everything is relatively simple and can be done in no time.", "date": "2008-10-22", "grade": null}
