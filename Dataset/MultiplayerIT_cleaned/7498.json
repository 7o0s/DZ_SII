The game does not explain how and why it was entrusted to a simple teenager, but it is only one of the many narrative chasms that dot a specious plot to say the least: in The Alliance, at least, the story took on an almost meta-videogame trait, with the player and his PlayStation Vita (sic!) helping the secret society studying these strange creatures; in The Vanished Kingdom, however, the player controls Hiro himself. The story sees him venturing into the world of the Invizimals with the aim of studying them and helping them to counter the threat of the Xtractors: to do this, Hiro acquires the ability to transform into an Invizimal and exploit its peculiar abilities. Does it seem interesting to you? We thought so too, then we started the first level of the game. Invizimal's debut on PlayStation 3 is a platformer that left us with a bad taste in our mouths It was better if we didn't find it It's not like PlayStation 3 doesn't have other examples of platforming, for goodness sake! It's the first thing we thought about after spending a few hours in the world of Invizimals, trying to understand how Magenta Software - the developer who was responsible for bringing the monsters conceived by the Spanish company Novarama to the Sony console - managed to offer such a title bland and banal. And in fact, Invizimals: The Vanished Kingdom draws heavily on all the best platformers (and not only) that we have played in recent years, without being able to get something really good out of it. There is room for the wide-ranging levels seen in Ratchet & Clank and for the environmental puzzles of Skylanders, for example, but neither brand seems to have offered Magenta Software enough inspiration to come up with some puzzle or some passage that does not had already been seen and stravised. The ability to transform into Invizimal represents the heart of the gameplay: Hiro can take on the appearance of about twenty creatures, which are even too few if we consider that the number of Invizimal invented by Novarama exceeds a hundred. As if that weren't enough, some of the forms that Hiro can assume change only in appearance and maintain the same environmental powers and the same attacks. Changing shape is necessary to overcome the various puzzles we will come across, such as the boulders and levers that can only be moved by the strongman Xiong Mao or the walls that only the Minotaur can destroy. Chupakabra can glide, thus allowing us to jump further than usual, while Ocelotl allows us to take advantage of holds and ropes to move between apparently too distant platforms. Once you have identified the way to overcome a puzzle - often underlined and advertised ad nauseam by an intrusive hint system - just change shape and continue. Sometimes the levels branch off into crossroads and multiple paths which, however, do not particularly encourage exploration: the currency with which to enhance our Invizimal forms is always abundant and the extra collectibles are so evident and badly hidden that defining them ~hidden~ seems to us an understatement. Playstation 3 trophies There are twenty-seven bronze, seven silver, and two gold trophies to unlock. No platinum therefore, but collecting the others is far from difficult: just complete each level, acquire all the Invizimal forms and collect every collectible. Poor eyesight Of course, in Invizimals: The Vanished Kingdom it's not just about jumping from platform to platform and solving simple puzzles; it would be too simple, and therefore Magenta Software has filled the levels with enemies to be punched, launching combinations of attacks and special moves. There wouldn't be anything wrong, if there weren't two little problems: first, the collision detection was implemented badly, and if the defect is already found frequently in the platform area, with jumps that are inexplicably wrong, the worst comes when there collides with enemies and you don't feel the impact, just hitting the air and, just as inexplicably, damaging the target. Since there is no hooking system or real ~feedback~, one always feels the clear sensation of being pressing keys at random without following a logic or a strategy. The other problem is the control system in general, unresponsive and precise, almost as if there was a delay or interference in the response to our commands. Both are signs of a hasty development, perhaps due to the need to release at the same time as Invizimals: The Aalliance for PlayStation Vita, which - while not shining in quality - remains decidedly more faithful to the spirit of the original Novarama brand and also more interesting both in progression and in content. In The Vanished Kingdom it is also possible to import the ~captured~ Invizimals in the PlayStation Vita title and use them to fight in an arena both in single and multiplayer: it is a mode that particularly recalls the Pokmon Stadium of Nintendo home consoles, which allowed you to admire the battles between the polygonal models of the pokmon captured in the mother series. In this case the concept is the same; the problem lies in the fact that, visually, the PlayStation 3 version of the creatures does not differ much from the PlayStation Vita version. The polygonal models of the Invizimals - and especially those in which Hiro can be transformed - are made and animated quite well; unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the levels and the various settings, which appear generic and poor in the amount of polygons and quality of the textures. In short, the exploration of the stages does not even gratify the eye, and is accompanied by pleasant music, although often dominated by the repetitive verses of the Invizimals.", "date": "2013-11-12", "grade": "4.5"}
