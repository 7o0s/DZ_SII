The film sees the two actors playing the role of a pair of friends/enemies who play street basketball games around Venice Beach to earn a living. It is a simple and well-told story, which is definitely worth watching: if you find the DVD around, buy it without hesitation. But what does this film have to do with Slam Dunk King, PikPok's latest effort for iPhone and iPad? Well, the theme covered in the game is practically the same, that is ~street~ basketball games, those that are played with a single basket, sketchy rules and a lot of insults to the opponent on duty. Don't think of a rival of the excellent NBA Jam, however, because we are basically dealing with a variation on the theme compared to the Flick Kick series, mentioned in the introduction. More than a simulation, Slam Dunk King is an action game with a sports background that bases its appeal solely on touch controls, and which comes with a very simple gameplay. On the right side of the screen there are balls that we have the task of getting into the basket on the left, dragging them with a finger in different ways depending on the shot we want to make, and which, based on the difficulty of the maneuver, will allow us to get more or minus points. We can simply place the balls on the basket, make him do a single or double rotation, simulate a dunk, a three-point shot or even an alley-oop. The possibilities available to us are really numerous, the thing is that at a certain point the quantity of balls on the screen will be so high that it will be difficult even to make sure that not even one is lost along the way. If one of the balls leaves the screen without going through the basket, in fact, depending on the mode, we can lose a ~life~ or incur game over. Shohoku's Secret Weapon! There are three modes that Slam Dunk King makes available to us: Time Attack, Arcade and Sudden Death. The Time Attack mode sees us engaged in ~survival~ type matches in which our objective is to make as many baskets as possible before the timer reaches zero. We can make different shots to multiply the score and get experience points in exchange, trying from time to time to reach a higher total in the same amount of time available. The other ~quick~ mode, Sudden Death, stands out instead because it does not allow for any mistakes: it is enough that one of the balls thrown in the air is not crushed to the basket to incur game over. However, it is the Arcade mode that constitutes the fulcrum of the game, thanks to a structure with a minimum of progression and the continuous release of new maneuvers that can help us increase the score. This feature works hand in hand with obtaining the aforementioned experience points, which if desired we can buy using real money (Slam Dunk King is still a freemium type production) and spend to get new scenarios, new customizations for the ball and new mascot. The latter represent the only element capable of providing us with real support during the games, beyond the simple glance. There are six of them: Copernicus, available by default, allows us, if activated, to transform each bomb into an advantage rather than a threat, given that by discarding it we will get a good number of points; Rupert, who during activation completely prevents the arrival of bombs; Doc, who applies a point multiplier to our shots; Hugo, who slows down time to allow us to survive the most agitated phases; Wilbur, who doubles the points for every dunk; Leon, who randomly activates all other special powers.
