{"name": "Revival", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/revival.html", "text": "Revival offers a complex but not complicated mix of many aspects that will delight all lovers of turn-based strategy games. The task will be to build a civilization, see it grow, between development and recessions, until it dominates the entire universe. We will have to take care of every smallest feature of our creature, from trade to the construction of buildings, to the well-being of citizens, to the development of armies and their eventual successes or failures. The title brings with it two different modes, the simple ~dry~ game in single player or the real campaign, which is the heart of this strategy and offers maximum playability by focusing strongly on the exploration of the world created by Herocraft. We will start the game with an emissary who will be able to discover for us the new civilizations and their buildings, cities in primis. Once a city is occupied, we will be able to develop it by building schools, which in turn will allow the search for new units, or hospitals and medical centers that will increase the level of culture and well-being of our citizens. Another possible choice, and recommended by us, is to develop militias to guard our village, which otherwise could easily fall into enemy hands since it has no protection. Obviously our troops, once properly trained, will be able to start various military campaigns, which closely resemble what was seen in the first episodes of the Civilization series on PC. Technically Revival does not make you cry out for a miracle but does its job discreetly, with a graphics engine capable of giving some ~pearls~ such as the different types of landscapes, for example the tundra, the jungle, the deserts and the mountains or the various types of animals to hunt. The information on the screen is very many and almost always very clear, to appreciate the effort made by the developers in translating the game into Italian, even if this very adaptation is often inaccurate and botched. PRO Valid alternative to Age of Empires 2 Technically discreet AGAINST Far too much information on screen Poor adaptation", "date": "2007-05-08", "grade": "S.V."}
