Of all the EA Sports franchises, the one dedicated to 18 holes has lately been the one most subject to a dangerous stagnation, with little news between one chapter and another. At first it even seemed that the champion should no longer appear in the game, but EA Sports then reassured everyone with its full support. The real news, however, was the conquest of the rights to one of the most prestigious tournaments on the PGA circuit, the legendary Augusta Masters, an addition that dwarfs the Ryder Cup present in the last edition. As a result of this coup, the new Tiburon product puts mr. Woods slightly in the background, highlighting the legendary Georgia competition right from the title (but also the cover). Let's see it in detail. Ruling green Right from the start, you begin to feel the air of great occasions, with a very high quality film entirely dedicated to the Masters and the great champions who took part in the conquest of the legendary green jacket: Jack Nichulaus, Arnold Palmer, Demaret, Snead, Faldo and so on. A few minutes later, in full cinematic style, we are taken onto the course with Tiger to play the last hole of the Augusta National, and savor that fifth consecutive victory that may never happen, but in video games everything is possible. A touching tribute to the champion, a paradise for fans, but we are only at the tip of the iceberg. Having finally reached the main menu, we find ourselves in front of all the features that have characterized this endless series, from the possibility of creating a personal golfer, through almost infinite parameters, to the various modes that start from the simple stroke game up to the main career, obviously culminating with the victory of the Masters. This is exactly where we will put our greatest efforts, through a long journey that will take us from the most anonymous competitions to glory. EA Sports has spared no expense for this new chapter, the Pro Shop is still present, a virtual shop that allows us to unlock industrial quantities of clothing, personalized balls, clubs and gloves, a customization that is practically without borders. Equally rich is the sample of available itineraries, 16, which make this edition the richest ever in terms of content. From TPC Sawgrass, to St Andrews Links, historic Pebble Beach, with its stunning cliffs, Scottsdale and of course Augusta National. Various pros of this glamorous sport are equally present, so expect sultry Natalie Gulbis, Paul Casey, Anthony Kim and Suzann Pettersen and many more, all faithfully reproduced, plus the ever-present Tiger Woods! Who is your caddy? The other tasty novelty is represented by the presence of a real caddy, which this time is a constant presence in our games, which can be called up with the simple push of a button. In essence, the addition is justified as a more elaborate way of analyzing the hole, from the overview, shot prediction and advice on the most suitable clubs to use. The considerations of our helper (unfortunately in English) are always pertinent and definitely useful for tackling the routes in the best possible way. Frankly something that Tiburon should have put in much sooner, but better late than never, now the feeling of realism is made to the highest level. There are many possibilities offered to the player, especially in the customization department. The risk of getting lost among the endless menu items is strong, but in this way no one risks being disappointed, since a truly impressive scalability is offered for those who want to approach this title with different needs. The swing is managed as always through the movement of the analog stick, but like the latest editions there is the possibility of switching to an alternative shooting mode, based on the keys and more focused on timing, in the old-time way, where you played with a single key. The choice of which system to use is yours alone, personally we were very happy with the analog swing, improved compared to past years in terms of precision and sensitivity. Another interesting possibility is to completely remove the initial boost to obtain exaggeratedly powerful (and decidedly unrealistic) shots, as well as the effect on the ball that can be modified when it is still in the air. In this way, an extremely simulation is obtainedand rigorous, even if demanding. Xbox 360 goals 46 goals for the canonical 1000 player points. Being a title centered on winning the Georgia Masters, a lot will be achievable simply by tackling the main career. But all those who faithfully follow the caddy's advice will have very welcome surprises. There is also a part dedicated to online rankings, and a curious objective dedicated to the fourth hole of the Augusta National course, try to complete it in a single shot and you will repeat a unique event in the history of golf... In addition to collecting the always precious points! Everyone on the field with Lotti Technically Tiger Woods Pga Tour Golf 12: The Masters proves to be a product of absolute quality, by now customary from EA Sports, but it is pleasing how small improvements have contributed to the optimal performance of an engine that has now reached its peak, but which here in fully optimized version. Quality textures characterize the splendid landscapes that welcome our balls, the grass is animated in relation to the intensity of the wind, as are the trees, and the top competitions are accompanied by a polygonal audience that significantly increases the involvement of the matches. The commentary is also first-rate, even entrusted to Jim Nantz of CBS. Again realism without borders, with a large amount of detail that fans will surely appreciate. The system of experience points attributable to your virtual golfer is still present, with the convenient addition of importing all those earned in the previous chapter. At this point it would seem to be in front of the Eden of golf, without a doubt this is one of the best chapters packaged by the Canadian software house, but there are some critical points. First of all, the differences for those coming from a recent edition are very few, and little or nothing changes in purely playful terms. In short, those who expected epochal changes will risk being disappointed, not finding a justification for the purchase of this version. Another detail is the presence of the additional dlcs, already available, which bring the set of paths to the considerable number of 36. However, the operation is not exactly cheap, and the presence of the extra paths in the main career is a tantalizing idea only for those who count to buy them. All the others will perceive it as a deprivation to the main body of the game, which, however, we reiterate, is really richer than ever.", "date": "2011-04-11", "grade": "8.5"}
