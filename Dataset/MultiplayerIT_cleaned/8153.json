For others since the founding of Google. For lovers of a certain type of video game, it was the year in which Baldur's Gate was released, one of the most famous titles ever, not only within its genre, but also in the global gaming scene. It is no coincidence that it is still considered the best role-playing game ever made, despite the very long fourteen years that have passed since its first appearance. Behind the scenes, at the time, BioWare which starting from that 1998 will achieve an impressive series of successes in the following years, all in the same genre: from Neverwinter Nights to Star Wars: Knight of the Old Republic, up to the more recent Mass Effect and Dragon Age. Yet, despite so much competition inside and outside BioWare, the myth of Baldur's Gate has never died, as evidenced by the large community of enthusiasts still busy discussing the game on forums scattered around the Internet and self-sustaining thanks to the creation of unofficial mods. A passion that has not escaped the eye of Overhaul Games, a division of Beamdog, a team made up of Trent Oster and other veterans from BioWare, who have thus decided to give life to a facelift operation, bringing it back to our screens after so a long time. It was Oster's intention for a remake that at the same time managed to remain respectfully faithful to the original masterpiece, while adding new material capable of justifying the expense. It goes without saying that the fans literally went into raptures at the announcement of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition: it therefore does not matter if so many years have passed, because when it comes to a game like this, forgetting about time becomes more than legitimate. Hello child, shall we continue your lessons? For the benefit of those who do not know what we are talking about - we only justify you if you were too young at the time - before going into the details of this Enhanced Edition it is necessary to remember what Baldur's Gate is. Set in Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms, the game reproduces the mechanics of the second edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, using the classic two-dimensional isometric view to represent a rich fantasy world. The protagonist of the game is an orphan, raised in Candlekeep under the protection of a powerful wizard called Gorion, together with his childhood friend Imoen. The adventure begins when strange events begin to happen on the Sword Coast, the territory that forms the backdrop to the entire story, including the arrest of iron production and the appearance of bandits to sow terror. All this coincides with some inexplicable attempts to end the life of the protagonist in Candlekeep itself, which push Gorion to embark on a journey to hide from the mysterious enemy. However, following an ambush, Gorion manages to save the life of the main character at the expense of his own, thus leaving us alone in search of the truth and who murdered our adoptive father. A plot certainly known to most of which we have however wanted to describe only the beginning, given that after so much time even those who have played the original will be able to rediscover with pleasure what has been told: it is surprising to see how after more than a decade the level complexity of the story is able to leave many recently released titles in the dust. But the one just mentioned is only the first of the many aspects in which Baldur's Gate shows that he does not suffer at all from his age: it is no coincidence that the old BioWare game and its mechanics are still considered today one of the yardsticks for the entire genre . You must gather your party before venturing forth We are facing a classic role-playing game, in which races and classes appear that have now entered the tradition of this genre. In this regard, it is good to note the introduction of subraces and classes from Baldur's Gate 2. At this point, to avoid misunderstandings we must repeat that the one carried out by Overhaul Games is a deliberately faithful review of the original, with all that follows . Starting from the game system, able to put a strain on players accustomed to the simplified mechanics that have taken over in recent years, proving to be complex especially in the management of fights. In fact, these take place in an unchanged way compared to the past, through the THAC0 (acronym of To Hit Armor Class Zero) which involves rolling a 20-sided die to calculate the minimum value to hit the opponent. A system that is not exactly immediate for beginners of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, given that contrary to what one might think the possibility of success inincreases as your character's THAC0 value decreases, from which the value of the enemy's Armor Class is then subtracted. To help the player in their choices, as in the original version, there is a pause system, which can be used to issue orders in what remain of the real-time battles of Baldur's Gate. The difficulty of the game has also remained unchanged due to a declared choice, so the golden rule of saving your game often and willingly so as not to be forced to replay large portions of the adventure applies more than ever: in the Costa della Spada, death knows how to be behind the corner, and it is precisely this feeling that makes the game something unrepeatable. However, Overhaul Games has tried to refine the general experience of the player, introducing a series of improvements to the interface and usability of panels. The game tutorial has also been slightly changed, in order to offer more guidance before jumping into the fray. What's new? Beyond the more than four hundred changes that Overhaul Games claims to have introduced (some are more noticeable, others a little less), there are some obvious innovations in this Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. Naturally starting with the three new NPCs with which to enrich your game party: the monk Rasaad yn Bashir, the wild sorceress Neera and the blackguard Dorn Il-Khan, thanks to which you can give a touch of diversity compared to the ~usual~ Minsc, Jaheira and company. Each of the new characters offers a further addition of hours of gameplay: for Rasaad and Neera there is also the introduction of new areas, while Dorn brings the Blackguard kit with him. Longevity set to increase further, given the presence of the brand new mode entitled The Black Pits. An arena in which such Baeloth has decided to imprison our protagonists, forced to clash in fifteen different fights to the death to gain freedom, using a growth system and the purchase of new weapons between a round and the other. While The Black Pits will probably only be completed by the most hardcore gamers, it's still pleasing to note what is an addition of around 20 hours (including unreleased characters) to the base version of Baldur's Gate. Finally, it should be remembered that the Enhanced Edition also includes the original Tales of the Sword Coast expansion. At the moment multiplayer only allows direct connection by entering an IP address, but a matchmaking system entrusted to Beamdog's servers has already been promised for the future: for obvious reasons it was not possible for us to try it, so we cannot express evaluation in this sense. To Infinity and beyond We conclude the review by going as usual to analyze the technical sector of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. Also in this sense, Overhaul's decision not to distort the original version is valid: most of the models and animations remain practically the same as they were fourteen years ago, with some additions concerning above all the effects of magic, capable of making it even more spectacular battles between wizards. The 2D nature of the Infinity engine remains unchanged, while the interface, as already mentioned, has been revised to adapt the game to widescreen monitors, naturally with high resolution support. A zoom system has been introduced, but getting too close to the shot ends up graining the images shown on the screen. The interlude scenes of the old Baldur's Gate have instead been replaced by some brand new sequences, composed of hand-drawn comic-style drawings. A choice that for some may perhaps clash a little with the gloomy setting of the Costa della Spada. The sound is more or less as we remembered it: new voices have been added for the unreleased characters, which is a good and right thing. Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition runs just fine even on older machines, for obvious reasons, also offering the possibility of playing in a window with practically zero loading. To report some pathfinding problems and some sporadic crashes of the game under Windows 8, in the hope that it is only a problem of the review version we tested.", "date": "2012-11-29", "grade": "8.5"}
