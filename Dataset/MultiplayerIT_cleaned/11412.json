And, mind you, having a sort of ~sacred assignment~ is most often a brilliant move in the difficult world of development, because it leads the teams to concentrate all their forces on precise projects without pindaric flights of any kind. Too bad that, even with all the good will in the world, the goal of this talented group of programmers is not exactly the easiest to achieve. The Pathfinder system is in fact a (powerful) reworking of the already complex rules of the pen and paper Dungeons & Dragons which, while offering an enormous amount of material to be based on, is never exactly simple to adapt in digital form. they've proven to be true cultivators of that universe, and their first title, Pathfinder: Kingmaker, turned out to be good enough to lead to both an excellent re-release and a hugely funded sequel on Kickstarter called Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. There is only one small stumbling block: Kingmaker, even in its Enhanced Edition, is still today a game with several technical and balancing flaws, which enjoys its fame mainly for its enormity and ability to pamper lovers of elaborate builds and ~breakable~ systems. All well and good considering its roots, but with Wrath of the Righteous will the Owlcats have managed to make a qualitative leap capable of making their creatures overcome this niche nature, or will they have embraced it completely? And above all, are we facing a title that is finally solid and stable from a technical point of view, or a video game that is more dancer than its predecessors? Today we try to explain it to you, in a long review of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. Fiction: more mythical than epic Pathfinder WOTR: Protect that ram Just like Kingmaker, Wrath of the Righteous is built on the skeleton of a huge Pathfinder Adventure Path, basically large scenarios updated monthly by Paizo (the company behind Pathfinder, in fact), which masters can use to offer epic adventures to players of the paper edition. However, the choice of Wrath of the Righteous is extremely more ambitious than the already remarkable Kingmaker. We are talking about an adventure set in a monstrously important phase of the narrative background of the world of Golarion, which narrates the raids of a group of adventurers engaged in fighting a mighty crusade against demonic forces after the opening of the so-called Worldwound (a catastrophic ~wound ~ in the world from which the demons began their invasion after the death of the god Aroden). The plot, of course, has been largely reworked with some interesting twists centered on the nature of the protagonist, who appears at random in the city of Kenabres shortly before an invasion of the powerful demon lord Deskari, and soon discovers that he can absorb the essence of objects that belonged to creatures of enormous power. Overall, however, we found it less inspired than that of Kingmaker. On the other hand Wrath of the Righteous is a campaign designed more to offer a titanic experience full of events than a superfine story, and we are therefore not surprised by the fact that it is slightly less successful in the main narrative, but more appreciable in the individual quests and in the characterization of the various characters encountered. Here everything happens according to the gameplay and the development of one's alter ego and its allies. The choices you make sometimes have a significant effect on who you carry with you and your growth, and overall it seems like a perfectly fitting fit for the work the Owlcats wanted to create. Yes in short, approach the game without expecting an absolute masterpiece of fantasy fiction and you will be pleasantly satisfied. Progression: Balance is for the weak Pathfinder WOTR: AoE spells of that color are never a good sign Let's start from the fundamentals, because as previously mentioned this game is built on the original Pathfinder ruleset, therefore we are talking about a variation of the 3.5 edition of Dungeons & Dragons, with some changes to the systems and an inordinate number of classes and variables to choose from. And when we talk about ~excessive number~ we are not exaggerating: Wrath of the Righteous offers you 25 basic classes, each with six archetypes (often considerably diversified from each other), plus a fair number of prestige classes obtainable once certain prerequisites are reached, with moreover, the possibility of becoming a multiclass character at each level-up. There are of course some characters already set up by the da teamselect if you don't want to go crazy, but a lover of statistics and builds risks spending hours in the creation and development of his character, not to mention that even the numerous companions found here and there can be specialized at will. In practice, the work of the Owlcats is a wet dream of the so-called ~minmaxers~ (those who take the progression systems of a title to the limit by maximizing the effectiveness of the characters), a game that immediately pushes the accelerator on the possibilities of development of protagonists to offer all kinds of crazy combinations; yet, incredibly, the excesses in this field do not end there. Wrath of the Righteous is in fact a campaign designed to offer the player the so-called ~Mythic Path~: levels parallel to the twenty normal levels, capable of unlocking skills that cry out for revenge before the god of balance. These branches of development are unlockable only with the completion of some quests (some are offered very easily, for others the obtaining is much more convoluted), they have enormous synergies with certain classes, and it is even possible to unlock advanced ones in a late campaign (they replace those previously selected, in case), complete with events and companions directly related to some of them. A madness practically impossible to balance, which in fact the Owlcats have left a little to itself. In fact, following the curiously solid philosophy of ~if everything is enormously unbalanced the game balances itself~, the developers have fielded combinations of absurd powers and abilities, and the possibility of resetting the development of one's characters at no cost, just to meet the wishes of the most hardcore fanbase. There is therefore not a chapter in the game where you cannot readjust your progression and your strategy (just talk to a specific non-player character for the ~respec~), and we assure you that this is a boon for anyone who dares to face the highest difficulties that the title offers. Gameplay: Much tougher than the Balduro. Pathfinder WOTR: camp on fire The monsters of the game after all are placed in the various zones based on the level you should have at that moment, and are often positioned in the various cadres with rare sadism, which can lead to having to eliminate huge groups of enemies capable of inflicting status, immediately after having faced hours of battles capable of consuming all your resources (rest the recharge, but if you exaggerate you will get a penalty linked to corruption that will make you practically helpless). On normal difficulty things are still manageable, albeit significantly more brutal than 90% of RPGs on the market, but on higher ones things take crazy turns, which require perfect class management and exceptional knowledge of the best skills available, since the only way to overcome certain obstacles is to literally break the system. Could everything have been more balanced? Absolutely yes, and we admit that certain choices made us turn up our noses. Overall, however, paradoxically everything works more than worthy, adapting to almost any type of RPG player. We just want to give you some friendly advice: don't be afraid to lower the difficulty if things get too difficult (and you've aimed too high with the initial challenge level), it's a choice that can save your sanity. the game system, on the other hand, we are faced with a mixture of mechanics already seen in Kingmaker, and to be exact in its latest edition (the base had this option only thanks to modding): it is possible to take advantage of an imprint beyond Baldur's Gate with tactical pause and real-time combat - and actions conveniently indicated by timers on each character - or choose a very comfortable turn-based mode, closer to the real Pathfinder regulation and much more convenient for making strategically solid choices without errors of any kind. Honestly, we always recommend the turn-based mode to enjoy the battles to the fullest, however keep in mind that Wrath of the Righteous contains some prolonged fights, and in those cases this choice risks heavily lengthening a title where the longevity is already scary (the hundred hours to complete is far from difficult to achieve). Structure: a century-long crusade Pathfinder WOTR: Too many things are found in a cave Yes, because we are dealing with a work in several acts, all extremely long-lived, where things start with a rather common structure (complete quests, solve puzzles, kill enemies), and then open up to a mixture of exploration of the world map, strategy and managerial elements. It also happened in Kingmaker,we know it well, but this time things are a little different, and without annoying timers. If in the first work of the Owlcats in fact you had to complete tasks as a ruler within a few days, here you will be put in charge of the crusader forces almost immediately, and you will constantly deal with the advance of the demons in distinct management phases (without the days counted, fortunately), which begin with the simple recruitment of small armies and then evolve into a more elaborate system of building buildings in population centers and managing various events (mostly through direct political choices). Overall, a less pressing solution compared to the predecessor, but only marginally better. The battles between armies in fact recall a simplified version of Heroes of Might and Magic, where everything comes down to the power of the troops in the field, and certain units are enough and advance to tear most of the enemy armies to shreds if there are sufficient numbers. As expected, although at the beginning managing the crusade in this way is quite amusing, it doesn't take much for boredom to subside, and the clashes between troops begin to break the rhythm in a rather annoying way. For heaven's sake, there is an ~automatic crusade~ function to eliminate everything, but in the third act it leads to the loss of various interesting elements of the narrative, and therefore we do not recommend it. If nothing else, it's a step up from the past and doesn't spoil the experience all that much. Technical sector: let's kill demons, not bugs Pathfinder WOTR: On the way to the next quest The growth of Owlcat from a technical point of view is immediately evident in this new Pathfinder. The game still uses Unity, but the character models are noticeably more detailed, and the settings more varied and inspired. The technical improvements have also led to a slight approach of the camera, which you actually get used to quite quickly (also thanks to the very clear global maps and the ability to rotate the view as you like). Also from the point of view of sound the game has improved significantly. The music is often excellent and selected to fit the epic atmosphere of the campaign, and the voice acting is of more than worthy quality (even if it is not complete, given the impressive amount of dialogue). The problem here, once again, is the bugs : infinitely less worrying than the first edition of Kingmaker (which was a disaster at launch), but still potentially irritating, not to mention a couple of fairly serious events that partially ruined our first run. Before the arrival of a large corrective patch (we are talking about 11 gigabytes), in fact, we unfortunately witnessed the disappearance of an NPC that prevented us from completing some secondary quests necessary to unlock one of the funniest Mythic Paths (that of the Azata , to be precise). In a repeated campaign with the same events and the same class after the patch, the problem did not reappear, but a whole series of more or less annoying minor bugs did not disappear. You go from actions that rarely connect during turn-based mode, to some enemies that cannot be hit at spawn, to interface elements that become unreadable and minor enemies and companions that suddenly disappear (and no, they don't because they use invisibility unfortunately). We underline this before making those who want to buy the game worry excessively: most of these bugs are minor, easily solved and circumvented, and after the patch fortunately nothing has blocked our progression or ruined the main questlines, but the Owlcats are still a small team that with Wrath of the Righteous tried to create a titanic RPG, and more serious flaws are absolutely possible in the game. Save often and on multiple slots, just in case. Ah, one last clarification: the game has various languages besides English, but not Italian, and there really is an ocean of text to read.", "date": "2021-09-04", "grade": "8.2"}
