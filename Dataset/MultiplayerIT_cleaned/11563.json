{"name": "Wild ARMs 5 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wild-arms-5-recensione.html", "text": "Wild ARMs is a series that has always aroused the attention of JRPG enthusiasts, both for its particular style with an ~atypical~ setting for a similar product, halfway between western-futuristic and classic fantasy with orcs and creatures magical, both for its gameplay which, at least in the first few episodes, contained some adventure element. So much so that the first chapter, born on the old PlayStation, despite a dated 2D graphics very ~Super Nintendo~, is still considered one of the best RPGs ever on consoles. But let's go back to the present day and analyze this Wild ARMs 5, which from the premises seems able to revive a slightly tarnished saga after the last episode. Dean Stark and Rebecca Streisand are two boys who live in a small village called ~Capo Bronco~, in the now well-known Filgaia. One day, while they are busy exploring a mountainous area, the two friends see a huge object literally fall from the sky, which shortly after, with great amazement, will be discovered to be the arm of a Golem, in whose hand there is a girl who, maybe also because of the impact, doesn't remember anything of his past, except for his name: Avril... Shortly after Dean finds a set of ~ARMs~ called Twin Fenrir. This is the summary of the initial plot of the adventure. Doesn't it roughly remind you of the beginning of an old Final Fantasy for Super Nintendo? As for the setting of the game, this is similar to the old chapters of the saga and the classic JRPG, albeit with some changes. In fact, as per tradition, it is necessary to explore various areas, ranging from western-futuristic style villages to castles, passing through woods, dungeons and so on, meeting characters with whom to interact to collect useful information or simply unlock Sub-Quests, objects , weapons or upgrades, fighting here and there the enemies that will appear in front of you along the way. Without forgetting the resolution of riddles and puzzles typical of this series, perhaps using the ARMs of party members to press the usual remote button, etc. 'Hexed' Battle System The combat system of Wild ARMs 5 is immediately familiar to those who played the previous episode (Wild ARMs 4). It, called the ~Hex Battle System~, is structured in turns and regulated by a sort of ATB which establishes the moments in which each PC, whether friend or foe, can act, and is obviously conditioned by many factors, not least the level of themselves. Each fight takes place on a grid made up of six boxes (hence the name ~hexagonal~, but when you collide with the Bosses the number varies), on which the fighters of both factions move: this element gives the title a really interesting strategy, allowing the player to often vary their tactics and experiment with new ones in relation to enemies and situations. In fact, moving from one square to another or remaining motionless has immediate consequences on the next event, such as avoiding a shot with a range of action that cannot cover a certain space or grouping a couple of heroes on the same square in order to launch a more powerful attack. Note how now it is possible, unlike in the previous chapter, to perform a movement and an action at the same time, for example ~running from one hexagon to another and casting a spell~. Another interesting peculiarity in these phases is that some boxes can be associated with a particular element, such as Fire or Ice, which is why anyone who is positioned on one of them is more subject than others to suffer magical attacks with those characteristics. Not to mention that the ~Status~ such as Poison, for example, can be inflicted not so much on the Pg directly but always on the ~Hex~ on which he stops. This means that moving from one hex to another the party member does not carry the ~poison~ or otherwise altered state, which remains in the original square. There are only six characters that can be recruited in the team of heroes, each with their own upgradeable skills plus equippable accessories, three of which can be used simultaneously in battle. However, to avoid the player having to carry out a huge series of extra fights to level up even the secondary or in any case little used members, the game provides that the three characters ~on the bench~ earn more or less the same experience points as those who fights. Still present are the battle-cards, using which it is possible to increase the number of Gella (money) or the Exp points obtainable after the battle. Wild ARMs 5 also introduces a very interesting feature that in our opinion should be used in all RPGs with random encounters: this allows with the simple pression of the R2 key to temporarily eliminate them from a certain area, in order to be able to explore it freely avoiding annoying interruptions perhaps in places where the enemies are now of too low a level to constitute a threat or an adequate recovery of Exp points. Graphically well made , with a purely anime-style character design, this Wild ARMs 5 also likes the look of the scenarios, certainly not complex but still pleasing to the eye, for the introduction of a customizable view complete with a 360  rotatable camera and equipped with zoom , and from an audio point of view for a well-made soundtrack and effects, including English dubbing. Comment Wild ARMs 5 is in all respects one of the best titles in the Filgaia saga. Characterized by an effective and interesting system of battles with a grid that gives it a certain tactical depth and by some slight innovations made keeping in the tradition, the game deserves the attention of all those who love the genre and want to enjoy a healthy, old, JRPG. Pros: Excellent longevity. Interesting battle system. Great game variety. Cons: Sometimes difficult, even without excesses. Not very original plot.", "date": "2008-03-14", "grade": null}
