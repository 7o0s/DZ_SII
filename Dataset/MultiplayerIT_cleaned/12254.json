{"name": "NBA 2K7 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-2k7-recensione-2.html", "text": "Before being able to access the heart of the simulation, one inevitably collides with the game interface, very approximate and certainly cumbersome. With the right analog of the Sixaxis pad it is in fact possible to recall the main menu, but its consultation is rather cumbersome, especially when it is necessary to go back or go down a level; in this case, most of the time, you have to start over. On the other hand, the menu is available in almost all situations, which allows you to switch from one mode to another quite quickly. The first distinctive element of NBA 2K7 is certainly represented by the considerable amount of game modes and options: first of all, it is possible to choose whether to create a team from scratch and made up of NBA characters, your own profile with relative associated team and visit the room of trophies and characters unlocked during matches. At this point you can choose whether to learn the basic techniques of the game through training or try your hand at one of the different modes available. The main one is called ~The association~ and allows you to reproduce in all respects the American basketball season, with the 82 games of the regular season, the playoffs, the management of transfers (or exchanges, for those who know the environment), the choice of rookies and the type of training, which allows you to enhance certain characteristics at the expense of a decrease in physical form. Therefore a complete management (but not for this reason that can be improved in terms of organization and complexity) of one's team, which makes the player become a real General Manager, with a president to be accountable to. If in any case the association for some may be too expensive in terms of time, there is always the possibility of organizing customized tournaments by length and number of teams, try your hand at a quick match or still face the 24:7 mode, all the inside of which you take a budding basketball player by the hand and guide him, through a progressive development and seasoned with a narrative component, so to speak, up to the acquisition of the status of NBA star. Before taking the field, it is also possible to choose the level of simulation with which you want to compare yourself, in such a way as to make the title of the Visual Concepts usable by all types of passionate sports gamers. The first aspect that can be modified at will is obviously the hardness of the Artificial Intelligence of the characters controlled by the computer, passing through the single enabling of all the rules that make up a basketball game, up to the frequency of whistles for infractions such as fouls, second , steps and so on. After all these premises it is finally possible to get on the parquet, and it is here that the work done by the developers is most appreciated. Playing with NBA 2K7 is currently as close as it gets to a real basketball game, the movements of the players are fluid and realistic and, thanks to the capture technique called Isomotion, the transitions between one animation and another (think for example of a run on the counterattack with a final dunk) are almost always painless; the management of the schemes, of the melee contacts or the breakthroughs are realistic and can be appreciated, including the extreme characterization, in terms of animations, of the various basketball players: see for example Shawn Marion who performs his classic immediate shot and with raised shoulders, it allows even more to immerse the player in the game. In this context, the Artificial Intelligence of the opponents controlled by the CPU sometimes appears too unbalanced, especially as regards the percentages of free throws - very high - and in some shots to the basket. To mitigate the imbalance a bit, it is therefore necessary to play a very careful game, vary your patterns a lot and not always get stuck in the shot, trying to build the action in the most varied way possible. To increase the sense of identification in the game we think the excellent outline and technical sector of the game which, apart from an inexplicable drop in framerate that lasts for a few seconds at the start of the game and only in offline mode, has been further refined compared to the others versions. As already mentioned, the animations are convincing, the fluidity always excellent, the realization of the players convincing, with a high number of polygons and definition of the textures more than satisfactory, especially as regards skin and clothes. The creation of the faces is of less impact, which clashes alternately between some close to the real counterparts and others completely different, almost caricatured. Lastly, a special mention should be made in regards to thisrda the arenas and the public. The scenographic impact is in fact simply perfect, with an entirely polygonal stadium, enriched by details that only those who don't play will be able to grasp. The home team's mascot moves non-stop, running between the seats, annoying the public, or bursting onto the pitch during time outs and intervals. It's priceless to score a 3-pointer at the end and see the whole home crowd jump up and cheer, or even just having taken the lead and hearing your crowd shouting ~De-fence! De-fence!~. The control of the players goes well with the PS3 pad if we exclude the absence of the vibration, which makes melee contacts or dunks less appreciated. The front buttons are used for shooting, the two types of passing, defensive blocks and interception of the ball, the back buttons instead for aggressive running and specific passing based on your teammate. The left analog stick controls the player, the right one allows him to shoot, while for each direction of the digital cross it is possible to recall, even during the game, schemes such as quick post and pick and roll, substitutions and so on. Finally, with the select button it is possible to recall the timeout when in possession of the ball, and the intentional foul in defense, for example in the last remnants of the game, when your team is behind by a few points and you want to recover by stopping the clock . The management of free throws represents the real novelty of the control system compared to the other versions of the game. In fact, each shot must be performed using the Sixaxis pad's tilt sensor: by moving the controller backwards, the basketball player will load the shot, bringing the pad forward will release the ball. Obviously the right timing, which among other things often varies from player to player, will be the key to making the free throw itself. Even if initially this system requires more practice than a standard solution, in the long run it appears more natural and contributes in a small way to increasing that often mentioned sense of identification. Online Mon Amour On the online side, NBA 2K7 also allows for high customization and variety of gameplay. In fact, it is possible to download the updated rosters, play ranked or unranked matches, entire championships and online tournaments, complete with dedicated lobbies. The attention paid to relations with the other players is particularly appreciable, the phases dedicated to team management are not visible to the opponent, and a small interesting survey is proposed at the end of the match. It will be possible to report to the servers if the player has assumed correct sporting ethics in the match, in order to filter the subsequent ones in order to obtain a balanced online experience. During our games we were almost always able to appreciate the absence of lag, and the gaming experience always proved to be enjoyable and satisfying, except that, due to some problems with the netcode, one match out of three did not go to successful and we were unable to connect with the challenged opponent in one of the lobbies. Comment Someone has compared the weight of the NBA 2K7 series with respect to Basketball not very dissimilar from that of Pro Evolution Soccer / Winning Eleven with football. Well, he was right, even in its latest incarnation the title developed by Visual Concept is a more than convincing simulation of basketball and the NBA championship, supported by a huge number of game options and modes, a first-rate audiovisual sector and the ability to customize the gaming experience at all levels. Something still remains to be fixed in the artificial intelligence and in the interface, but basketball lovers know where to go if they want to find a simulation of this sport with all the trappings of the case. Pros Convincing match simulation Excellent technical sector Enviable longevity Fluid and complete online... Cons ...but which suffers from ups and downs in the functioning Interface widely revisable Artificial intelligence sometimes unbalanced Not a big step forward compared to the already excellent 2K6 edition Basketball in Italy is a rapidly growing phenomenon, thanks also to the increasingly constant media coverage that is involving matches in our championship and international ones. Unlike football, however, we find ourselves in a rather different situation, in which the best championship is not ours, but the American one, a true temple of basketball where the best athletes perform in stadiums that are always packed with over fifteen thousand spectators. Seeing Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant, Tracy Mc Grady and others at work is a pleasure foreyes, which inevitably leads to a little envy for these sacred monsters of basketball. NBA 2K7 has been the pinnacle of gaming for some time now, and it's also coming to PlayStation 3 in all its glory, both offline and online.", "date": "2007-05-24", "grade": null}
