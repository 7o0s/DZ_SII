After the good success of Icebreaker: A Viking Voyage, the first product to take advantage of this sort of fast track, it's now the turn of Tiny Thief, a brilliant mix of genres developed by the Catalan team of 5 Ants. Greedy little hands The protagonist of the game is an anonymous medieval petty thief engaged in a whole series of thefts that will see him involved in six distinct scenarios for a total of thirty levels characterized by a gameplay that could be defined as a modern reinterpretation of the concept of point and click adventures. Each stage has a specific objective to be met - most often represented by a particular object to steal - taking care not to be discovered by the guards who populate the various settings. The result is an intriguing mix of puzzle and stealth mechanics, with gameplay made intuitive by the choice of two-dimensionality and by a very simple control system to assimilate. In fact, a tap on the screen is enough to make the protagonist move towards the desired point, while virtual keys appear near points of interest such as tools to use or elements to collect and possibly combine with others at a later time. As announced at the beginning, the idea of the developers seems to have been to propose a variation on the theme of point-and-click adventures, breaking up the experience into many micro-scenarios to make it more suitable for the hit and run use typical of the mobile context: a bet that can be said to be easily won, thanks to the numerous qualities of Tiny Thief. To begin with, the game boasts an excellent level design, with stages that are not only well differentiated from each other but also characterized by progressively more and more complex puzzles (although never reaching incredible heights of difficulty), with solutions that are sometimes really fun and original. Tiny Thief is a fun game, original and cared for down to the smallest detail It also doesn't hurt that the 5 Ants product is a real pearl from an artistic point of view, equipped with a minimalist style that is impossible not to appreciate and a graphic sector characterized by an obsessive attention to detail. In fact, backdrops and characters appear sought after down to the smallest detail, with an honorable mention to be expressed above all in relation to the incredibly varied and fluid animations. It is also surprising to note how the developers wanted to provide all levels with their own introduction - consisting of a table of comic-style illustrations - and a very personal skit to celebrate the achievement of the goal. Even the behavior of the protagonist when he is discovered by the guards changes with each stage, icing on the cake of a title that is a real feast for the eyes. Returning to talk about playability, Tiny Thief then respects one of the golden rules of modern mobile gaming to the letter by offering a stratified experience, with a surface suitable for all kinds of users and hiding in depth stimulating challenges for the most experienced users. All this translates into the three-star evaluation system inherited from Angry Birds and a thousand other similar products: the first is obtained by completing the level, while the other two require, respectively, to collect a certain number of secondary objects and to track down the ferret friend of the protagonist who usually hides in the most hidden corners of the levels. To achieve these secondary objectives, it is often required to tap certain elements on the screen (be they living beings or inanimate objects) to find a clue or start a chain reaction, an activity that can be quite challenging but at the same time rewarding. Certainly the title 5 Ants is not entirely free from defects, and it can be attributed to a substantial basic repetitiveness, an objectively rather limited longevity and a sometimes excessive exploitation of trial and error mechanics: however, when one is faced with a product made with such passion and attention to detail, it's even easier to turn a blind eye.", "date": "2013-07-19", "grade": "8.8"}
