A lot of irons in the fire could take Phenomic strategic fans by the throat but at the same time leave indifferent those who did not approve of the unusual gameplay, remained in good substance unchanged after installing this expansion. Pros Many new features to return to explore the SpellForce universe Improved copy protection system Cons Unchanged graphics Loading a bit long The time for the first expansion has also arrived for SpellForce 2, exactly one year after its release date; two had been made for the predecessor: The Breathe of Winter and Shadow of the Phoenix. Dragon Storm, this is the title of the object of our review, naturally requires the installation of the original game in order to be used. Many players will be happy to know that JoWood and Koch Media (distributor in Italy) have decided to abandon the StarForce protection in favor of the Tages system, which has proved to be decidedly less invasive. Big and small tricks Right from the start you notice a renewed graphic design of the initial menu which allows access to the new single player campaign, one of the strong points of Dragon Storm: unfortunately it is not possible to import the avatar of the previous games also because, as the introduction, it is precisely his disappearance that gives the incipit to the story. A regrettable decision in our way - it is in fact the program that makes the remaining skill points available, which are essential to be able to face the new and demanding challenges - which deprives the player of the very dear party he had developed. The plot tells of the usual portals that are losing their ability to transport the people of Eo, the region where SpellForce is set, from one island to another. It will once again be up to a Shaikan to take the problem head on, joining the factions fighting for survival, to understand what lies behind this catastrophe. Obviously present new enemies and objects; in particular, sets have been introduced (just like in Diablo 2 or Titan Quest) of weapons and armor which, when completed, give significant modifiers to the avatar and accompanying heroes. Among the many innovations brought about by Phenomic, the new faction of the Shaikan deserves particular mention (already the protagonist of the original Shadow Wars campaign) which also brings together the blades, skilled archers, and the dragonlings, that is to say the ancestors of the dragons, very resistant and suitable to hand-to-hand combat. The titan, the strongest unit, is the spectacular fire-breathing lizard featured on the cover. Remaining on the subject of Shaikan, the third discipline of specialization of the avatar (not immediately available however), called precisely Shaikan, which is a real middle ground between fight and magic, should also be remembered. Gameplay unchanged The game mechanics haven't changed much. Once again the user will have to deal with a series of maps, now more oriented towards pure RPG, now more devoted to real-time strategy. It is precisely this aspect that is slightly balanced both by the introduction of the aforementioned faction and by a series of small tricks that make the games more challenging. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, however, there is no news to report in terms of the graphics sector, which continues to behave very well a few months later, although it would have been reasonable to expect some improvements. For once, the requirements indicated by the programmers are true: even with mid-range systems, in fact, it is possible to set a high level of detail while maintaining a decent frame rate, undermined from time to time by disk uploads. Of course, a new soundtrack has been included which, like the previous one, lacks repetitiveness; the dubbing in English (with Italian subtitles) is good. It therefore appears clear how the programmers have focused on the longevity variable. From this point of view, SpellForce has never really had any problems, both for the style of play which, in line with other German titles, prefers a slow pace (about twenty hours is needed to complete the new campaign), and for the numerous methods made available. The skirmishes (or ~skirmishes~, as they are defined in the manual) have in turn been improved and are not limited to being the classic online game simulation against the CPU: in fact, you can decide whether to face an RPG or RTS map, and there are some for all levels. The fact that the avatar also accumulates experience in these single games prompts players to think before uninstalling the game after the ccompletion of the single player campaign. Dragon Storm also adds more maps created specifically to take advantage of the new race. On the other hand, we point out how SpellForce has not taken hold of the internet communities, given that the presence of users on the official servers is decidedly below the average of canonical strategic games such as WarCraft or Age of Empires. The fact remains that SpellForce fails even with this expansion to align itself with the champions of the two genres it is inspired by: the tactical section is too approximate and the role-playing one is not deep enough. After all, Dragon Storm's tasks were quite different and it can be said that they were fully achieved. However, these observations leave a bit of the time they find, since we have not happened to review so far any other attempt to mix these two styles of game as brilliant as the title in question.
