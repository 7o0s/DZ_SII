The first exponents of the jumping game action genre were followed by many others, refining that type of structure and trying to enrich it by introducing boosts, bonuses, items to collect and enemies to fight. Exactly what happened in Sonic Jump, which actually did practically nothing innovative but could count on a solid system, which abandoned the traditional survival approach of the genre in favor of a sequence of levels complete with final bosses, rather varied situations , opponents to be eliminated with the classic spinning jump and so on. In short, a great use for the Sonic license, still very popular today. Almost two years later, here comes a sequel that right from the start gives the impression of being a substantial step (sorry, leap) back from the first episode. The fulcrum of the game remains the same, that is, you have to jump from platform to platform in a vertical progression that will take us to the end of the level, avoiding falling or impacting enemies during the descending phase of the leap. The feeling hasn't changed either, which is confirmed as pleasant thanks to the vivacity of the colors, the precision of the tilt commands, the many objects present in the scenario and the inevitable social facets, with the possibility of ~challenging~ friends on Facebook. Sonic Jump Fever is a great disappointment for those who expected an improved version of Sonic Jump The fever The problem is that those aspects of the original Sonic Jump that had impressed us, namely the progression, the bosses and the variety, have for the moment vanished into thin air. We say ~for the moment~ because Sonic Jump Fever stands as an open construction site from the point of view of content, with new scenarios arriving every week and perhaps even a return to story mode. Currently, however, the offer is surprisingly poor: it is possible to unlock new characters (we start with Tails, after a few games you can ~buy~ Sonic, while the others are almost unattainable unless you pay) who however do not have any differences if not in the possible upgrades, which can be purchased using the collected rings; and a Chao, a magical little creature that accompanies us during the jumps, rescuing us if we fall or going to create new platforms on the fly. The controls have remained the same, with the accelerometer to regulate the direction of the jump and the touch screen called into question when we want to double jump, while as already mentioned we have passed from the structured story mode of the first episode to a simple survival mode, with a time limit available to get the highest score possible and close the ~climb~ by trying to launch some pet into the balloon that will take us to the next stint. Without changing the scenario, given that for the moment we remain anchored to the evergreen Green Zone Hill (although randomly ~shuffled~ each time) and with a lower degree of challenge because we no longer incur game over in the event of a fall, but one is simply thrown back into the fray. So how to judge Sonic Jump Fever? This is certainly a disappointment for those who expected an evolution of the series that was not purely visual, given that the graphics are able to offer something new. What is missing is precisely the substance, and in this sense the contrast with respect to the first episode is really too sharp to be able to ignore it. We must also add that the freemium mechanisms appear more present and limiting, with various advertising films, an energy bar that places a constraint on the number of games that we can play in a row and the aforementioned impossibility of unlocking all the characters if not putting a hand to the wallet.", "date": "2014-07-15", "grade": "5.0"}
