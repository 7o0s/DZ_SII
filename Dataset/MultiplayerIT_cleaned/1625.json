Given the enormous success that the game is enjoying among fans and after having won the record for best launch ever for Square Enix on Steam, the looter shooter of People Can Fly seems to have an excellent chance of continuing to receive long-term support. In light of this, much of what we said to each other during the last test acquires even more value. Outriders is not, according to the declaration of its authors, a so-called GaaS, but in practice it follows its deeds and mutability, being able to pass from a finished and finished work to a possible title in constant evolution. After spending about sixty hours on the game divided into two different platforms, it's now time to have our say in the Outriders review, considering it for what it would like to be: that is, a game done and finished, long-lived and replayable like few others. Pioneers on Enoch Outriders: The War Begins As already anticipated in the previous ones tested, the narrative of Outriders certainly does not stand out for its originality. The plot draws heavily from the cauldron of science fiction, from the more sophisticated and environmentalist one like Dune and Avatar, to the more boorish and direct, almost B-series cinema, which in some cases reminded us of films like Alien vs. Predators and Starship Troopers. After a very bland and meager character editor we find ourselves catapulted to the planet Enoch, our new home. All the studies done on an Earth now dying and in continuous conflict seem to tell us that Enoch is the Promised Land. Breathable air, different biomes and quiet enough not to risk death at every step. After eighty years of travel and relative cryosleep we have finally reached our destination. Unfortunately, as in the most classic of situations, all that glitters is not gold and Enoch appears very unfriendly. Torn as it is between frightening fauna and a series of aggressive weathering, the approach appears anything but successful. A few hours after landing on the planet, a force bursts into the heart of the forest, sweeping away everything and everyone and leaving us with the awareness that we have made a mistake in our calculations. However, the short-sighted responsible for the expedition decides to recall all the residents of the orbiting ship with which we arrived and, essentially, condemns us and all that remains of the human race to a life of hardship and suffering. As our alter ego falls back into cryosleep the war rages, and everyone finds themselves, inside or out, affected by the Anomaly and by an unassailable planet. Outriders: A peaceful inhabitant of Enoch Thirty years later we are awakened and the show we are facing is certainly not the most encouraging. The planet is now divided into factions, which fight for survival. We have become a ~Mutation~, that is a human being affected by the anomaly and who, instead of dying atrociously, obtained hidden power from it, thus allowing us to choose the class of our alter ego from a list of four. The whole campaign then develops in the long road trip east in search of a lost signal, divided as it is between dialogues bordering on the ridiculous, discreet insights into the characters and an ultra-spoiler final section, but more successful than expected could wait. It is here that the first short circuit of Outriders is revealed, powerful and impactful, able to stand as an emblem of the production. Abundant two-thirds of the campaign is dull, narratively redundant and, in some situations, even drawn too long. The journey east is interesting from a pioneering point of view, much less from a variety point of view. Outriders: our trusted armored car However, there comes a moment in the course of history, we assure you that you will notice it, where everything changes, becomes more interesting, more cinematic, more artistically successful and, incredible but true, even the narration is increased, as it matured. How long you want the journey to last will depend a lot on you, how you manage everything in terms of gameplay and degree of challenge and how much you want to divert your path. It is no coincidence that we are talking about over fifty secondary missions and dozens and dozens of documents and ancillary elements - unfortunately to be recovered, inexplicably, for each of your characters - which deepen the lore without forcing you to give it weight. It is evident that People Can Fly cared about give life to a credible and interesting world and we must acknowledge that we have succeeded, even with its distortions far from truly cinematic triple A productionsatographic. A ~shooter~ gameplay Outriders: there's also room for trench warfare We've already said it dozens of times what game it is. Outriders is a looter shooter in the most literal sense of the word. You will move through an infinite horde mode, managed by waves of dozens and dozens of enemies in arenas interspersed with corridors. This gameplay, which appears so anything but exciting, is based on the experience of a team that makes shooting a faith. The first hours of Outriders are the most anonymous that can be found on the square, all without even putting an aesthetic and a search for the taste of any category on the plate. On more than one occasion we happened to ask ourselves why People Can Fly had decided to develop such a poorly characterized work, given and considering the studio's pedigree. The hours passed, they accumulated inexorably and the more the counter climbed , the more a sensation made its way. Over time, with the analysis and with the comparison we have understood perfectly what it was about: fun and addiction, the purest ones. And so People Can Fly came back to the rescue, reminding us who they are and what their goal is. Arriving absurdly to innovate a formula again, that of the third-person shooter, now stale and stuck at the progenitor of that Gears of War that they themselves have crossed over the years. Outriders: group photo? Outriders is the clearest and most concise demonstration of how a small, insignificant idea can totally change the cards on the table. Thus was born the system that brings into play four different classes that make aggression their source of regeneration. Even with the due differences between them, far from trivial from a certain point of progression forward, they all reduce the use of covers to a minimum, despite their massive presence on the various battlefields. Whether you are dealing with a pyromancer fire-breather (probably the most balanced class), with a technomancer engineer (a real support), or whether you dabble with the destroyer or the trickster (respectively one the classic tank and the other the weakest, but also the most destructive of the four) the only rule is to assault. Without pause, without hesitation, learning by heart the various classes of enemies that you will find yourself facing - few, but well studied in differentiation and artificial intelligence - and managing the use of skills to stay alive just enough to recover more health points than how many you lose. This approach, however simple and difficult to communicate without trying it on your own skin, we assure you that it works really well and that over the hours it will lead you to love the management of the gameplay, even where the feedback of weapons and the approximation of almost every other mechanic really leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Outriders: a nice return of fire Yes, because next to this ingenious idea there is very little else. Outriders is a game made up of many maps, all similar in structure and certainly not articulated, on which you can't do anything but collect ammunition and loot, as well as resources (actually only one) and collectibles. Such a death of elements has not been seen for quite a while in a triple A with this level of marketing. For the rest, Outriders remains exactly what we have already said to each other in recent weeks and months. The maps follow one another between one horde and another, giving breath with a series of secondary ones which, in addition to repeating an almost identical pattern for each of the few categories available, at least sometimes manage to give an interesting insight into the supporting actors and Enoch We could also mention the personalization of one's own armored car, but it seems superfluous to talk about it, given and also considered in this case the scarcity of elements available. Endgame Outriders: strange ruins We've said it many times, Outriders doesn't seem to have plans to expand their content over the weeks and months. Despite this, given its nature as a hybrid between a classic TPS and a Diablo-like ARPG, the endgame represents its lifeblood to all intents and purposes, which is important for it to survive for a long time. We could do all our phantasmagorical calculations, but we know well how this aspect depends on a combination of often imponderable factors. We will therefore limit ourselves to telling you what the Outriders endgame is and it will be up to you to decide how to evaluate it. It goes without saying that this paragraph, unlike the rest of the review, also contains spoilers on advanced elements and mechanics. As we all know Outriders is a title based on the constant repetition of tasks and mechanics that lead tolevel up the world. This increase marks the progression, the difficulty and, as it is easy to understand, also the rewards. Loot is the core of Outriders gameplay and its Diablo-esque hybrid nature also recurs in the endgame. Outriders: World Level If you want to know how the world levels work, we refer you to the previous test, which analyzes the issue in a dedicated box, but in essence it is a parameter that changes constantly during the campaign and which, based on the ratio between your kills and your deaths, adjusts the difficulty of the game in real time. Once you reach level 30, the current cap, the only element that will change the challenge will be the world level. This will affect the rarity percentage of the rewards, the maximum level of equippable items and that of the opponents you will face. Fifteen world levels and as many increases in difficulty, in full ARPG style. The actual endgame will instead have its own dedicated map, intelligently exploiting the campaign ending to justify the so-called ~expeditions~. Forget about raids to be completed in many or particularly complex mechanics. Outriders remains just a giant horde mode, but it adds a couple of important elements to the equation. Expeditions are real races against time during which your only goal is to go from room to room killing anything that moves . The goal is to reach and open the pod containing a myriad of brand new items. Based on the completion time and the degree of difficulty chosen, the percentage of rarity of the loot will also change, which as always moves from the common up to the legendary. Outriders: We are still human Each of the four classes can count on a series of specific armor sets, which increase their characteristics and which also have a specific perk. Even legendary weapons are no joke in terms of aesthetics, mixing our guns with Enoch's technology and artifacts. From a purely aesthetic point of view, we're really on Destiny's side and, starting from inventory management to finish with artistic taste, it is clear that People Can Fly has looked closely at Bungie's work. Management of the degree of difficulty of the endgame is similar to that of the world level, albeit totally separate. We really appreciated this choice, because it allows to drastically reduce the times for the base leveling of other characters in addition to the main one. We ourselves, partly for fun and partly out of necessity, have completed the campaign and tested the expeditions with all four classes and the ability to maintain world level 1 and asphalt everything in the progression of the campaign, has allowed us to get to the endgame in very easy times, albeit with ignoble equipment. Outriders: some glimpses are breathtaking Shipments are managed via a degree within the mode, which you can raise and lower at will from the war table dedicated to launching the mission. There are currently fourteen maps, some with dedicated bosses and in general all with a sort of short narrative, up to the last great expedition of degree fifteen, which ideally also concludes the endgame games. Ideally because narrative closure doesn't determine the end of the action. Outriders will require you to complete these tasks dozens of times, to improve you and hope for the right drop. While the first ten do not require any currency to access, the last four can only be launched from a certain degree onwards and by spending a specific resource that can be recovered by completing the expeditions. This currency is also used to purchase high-grade items, allowing you to reach the so-called equipment hard cap, currently set at level 50 and turning into the endgame-specific resource in all respects. We do not hide that we would have liked to see some more particular mechanics and perhaps some tasks to complete with a more substantial group, but we are still talking about a title with four classes and three players per team, which already makes you laugh on its own. Technique is not everything Outriders: The Skill Tree On a purely aesthetic level Outriders defends itself, at least on PC, the platform on which we have played it for most of the time. It is difficult to consider it an example of an important technological leap, also thanks to some textures that are anything but detailed and a level of polygons that are often not exciting. Despite this, a part of the environments, biomes and above all the Outriders' paraphernalia and clothing strongly reminded us", "date": "2021-04-12", "grade": "7.5"}
