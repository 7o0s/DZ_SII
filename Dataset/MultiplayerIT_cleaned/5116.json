Given the circumstances, the title represents a sort of heritage and the developers have seen fit to spend it to try to expand into other genres, in order to diversify the offer by always exploiting the appeal of an intellectual property that has become well known. The latter thing is not common on mobile devices, where to achieve global notoriety there is a need to elbow against several other suitors, just to put it mildly. Instead of trying something completely new, however, Subatomic Studios has decided to recover Filedrunners and launch it in an inflated genre, to say the least, that is the typical strategy of mobile platforms, made famous by games like Clash of Clans. This is a particular situation because it sees a title that has managed to achieve strong notoriety try the direct attack on a real mobile entertainment giant, in a clash that could have been epic, in case the team had chosen a slightly more courageous approach. The Fieldrunners Attack! is in fact a certain lack of distinctive character, an almost total flattening of the canons of the genre that make it to all intents and purposes only a clone of Clash of Clans, devoid of elements capable of effectively making it something unique, as Fildrunners was in its original form of tower defense. Not that this necessarily represents a defect, being a common feature of many other games on the market and still enjoyable, but it seems rather a wasted opportunity for a title of this level. Pocket strategy a bit obvious but still enjoyable in Fieldrunners Attack! Pocket attacks The classic formula is therefore re-proposed without particular upheavals: it is a question of building one's base, ensuring the constant supply of resources, building various structures and preparing defenses. The construction of the army, made up of different units with their own specializations is obviously the fulcrum of the management phase, the basis from which to start to then face the attack section. The latter takes place in a very simple and fluid way, thanks to a functional control system that allows you to move the units separately, through the management of the heroes on which the various teams of specialists depend, or all together. Special markers show which targets to hit, in search of the maximum result and corresponding reward. The fights alternate between single player missions and PvP battles, with the former more set on the initial progression and learning of the various features of the game and the latter representing more complex and more profitable challenges from the point of view of earnings. A big problem, at least as regards the first days of launch, seems to be the stability of the online infrastructure, and in a game so based on server activity it is not a trivial matter: disconnections happen often and some problems with matchmaking and correct recording of results after matches. These are drawbacks that could be resolved shortly with some updates but for the moment they are still present. The free-to-play structure provides for the possible separate purchase of boxes that allow you to speed up the expectations on the recovery of the units and increase the statistics, with the possibility also of making a sort of subscription that ensures a constant supply of bonuses to be particularly competitive in PvP, but the game is generally playable even without spending money. Where Fieldrunners Attack! fully rediscovers the link with its origins is in the graphic characterization: the rounded and cartoonish style, bizarrely associated with the staged war without quarter, represents a perfect return to the atmospheres of the famous tower defense and an element in which the game manages to define a own identity.", "date": "2016-12-22", "grade": "6.8"}
