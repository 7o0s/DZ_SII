In the case of Defender Chronicles: Legend of the Desert King for iPhone, for example, we can enjoy a well-balanced mix between a real-time strategy game and a role-playing game, given that our ~generals~ (the characters who guard the station enemies want conquer, in this case) grow and hone their skills as they achieve victories on the field. From a special screen it is possible to spend the ~credits~ earned during the battles to improve the values of power, the effectiveness of the spells and the ability to command the troops, with obvious repercussions during the action. What's more, the money can also be spent at ~shops~ that supply various types of equipment: from armor that improves resistance to swords that enhance attacks, from protective rings to healing potions. The discussion extends to both the heroes we will take on the role of, a human general and an elf, each called to face seven scenarios characterized by five different levels of difficulty that must be unlocked gradually and which guarantee prizes corresponding to the required commitment . I'll wait for you at the gate The approach adopted for the game is not a little different from what is the tradition of ~tower defense~, in fact we have a side view rather than from above and we can manage the scrolling of the scenario and the zoom at any time by touching the touch screen of the iPhone. In each location, the position to be defended is in a different area, just as the way in which the endless hordes of orcs, trolls and monsters of various kinds will approach to threaten it is different. The platforms that make up the internships are somewhat reminiscent of how much seen in the various Lemmings and Worms, and are characterized by the presence of points where we can place our soldiers. Just touch one of these areas for the interface to show us, in the lower part of the screen, the icons relating to the type of station we want to build. At first, only the warrior and archer outposts are available, but as you level up, wizards and hobbits also arrive, for a total of six character classes (since warriors then become ~berserkers~ and archers become rangers). , each one different not only for the offensive capabilities but also for the sentences spoken. When it comes to creating a location, the game shows us the range of action of the character we're going to place there. Archers are obviously the ones with the longest range, closely followed by wizards with their lightning bolts. The warriors act in a very restricted area, but they have the ability to hold back the enemies who therefore do not continue to advance but must try their hand at a short duel before continuing. All stations can be upgraded a certain number of times, depending on the money we have and which increases as we eliminate the enemies. The strengthening of the soldiers is an essential practice, also because towards the end of each mission we will find ourselves facing powerful and very resistant opponents, who are only scratched by our most powerful attacks. The action can be speeded up using a button at the top of the screen: ~fast forward~ becomes a must when you want to quickly understand how the enemy will move... Technical realization Defender Chronicles: Legend of the Desert King stands out for its really good two-dimensional graphics, managed, however, impeccably: on the screen we will even see hundreds of sprites at the same time, always with the possibility of zooming and scrolling, all without ever slowing down or uncertainty. There are no ~touches of class~ such as parallax scrolling, which would certainly have increased the sense of depth of the scenarios, and the animations in general are far from fluid or varied, but we really can't complain: visually, the product published by Chillingo is a show. Likewise, the sound accompaniment manages to be rich and epic thanks to the presence of numerous sampled phrases of excellent quality (in English) and really good music and great atmosphere.
