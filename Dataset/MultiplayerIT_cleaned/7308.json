This is the case of Hoplite, the strategy developed by Magma Fortress, which was created with a view to the Seven Day Roguelike Challenge, a contest in which a roguelike must be created in seven days. The evaluations received by the game were so positive that the authors soon decided to publish it on the App Store and Google Play, giving owners of iOS and Android devices an apparently simple experience but in reality rich in depth, tactical mechanisms and challenge. In the role of a Spartan soldier armed with a sword, spear and shield, our goal in the game is to find the legendary Golden Fleece by descending into the underworld and facing a series of progressively more complex, randomly generated levels inhabited by creatures demonic capable of attacking us from short or long distance. To survive as long as possible we will therefore have to manage our movements within the hexagonal boxes that make up the map, avoid ending up in the attack range of the opponents, take advantage of their missteps to attack and finally reach the exit. Hoplite is the perfect example of how you can make a roguelike in days and do it really well In search of the Golden Fleece Hoplite's gameplay is reminiscent of the game of chess in many ways since, as mentioned above, one wrong move can put us in the attack range of an enemy and therefore result in the loss of a precious little heart. Certainly the survival approach of the Magma Fortress title is not particularly punitive, given that we can restore vital energy, as well as access a whole series of upgrades, reaching the votive altar box in each stage. The bonus in question will be able to restore our energy, increase the capacity of the relative bar, provide us with an additional starting point for throwing the javelin or for jumping, making the shield blow more effective and so on. It will be up to us to select the upgrades based on what we see as the priorities of the current game, favoring defense rather than attack. The mechanics that regulate the combat system are simple but at the same time profound: the standard units must be attacked only when they have made their move, while the ~bombers~ can be approached in any way, as long as you pay attention to their explosive charges ( which, if desired, we can deflect with the shield, so as to make them end up on the other enemies). The most difficult opponents are archers and magicians, given their ability to strike from a distance, but just touch their figure on the screen to get an idea of their range and therefore avoid the ~hot~ boxes during approach maneuvers. The play system at first creates some uncertainty, but then it meshes and involves in an incredible way, making us completely forget the 8-bit style graphics and the barely mentioned sound.", "date": "2014-02-18", "grade": "8.0"}
