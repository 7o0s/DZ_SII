Because, in fact, there are several things to save: as was to be expected, the Japanese publisher has not simply thrown away its most important brand to collect easy money on mobile platforms, but has elaborated the thing in a rather reasoned way and for certain aspects even appreciable. Mind you, that's basically what remains, that is a commercial operation aimed at exploiting the brand to follow a well-established and likely successful game structure, but an interesting gameplay has been built around this idea, taking advantage of the rich lore of the series in intelligent way. In fact, the story takes us back to Midgar, the famous setting of the first part of Final Fantasy 7 (and its Remake), exploring the background of the SOLDIER program organized by Shinra - from which Cloud Strife himself emerged - putting scene events dating back to 30 years before those seen in the chapter of the RPG to which we refer. Although it may seem like a simple, newly developed pretext for staging armed battles in Midgar, it surprisingly also represents a more than sufficient starting point for a battle royale, probably much more than what has been seen in many other similar games. The fact of being able to count on characters and events that have by now settled in the imagination of the players represents a notable plus: the idea of going to investigate the origins of Shinra's war program and perhaps discovering some secrets about Jenova gives an edge to this game , as we also said in the preview of Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier. Gameplay between battle royale and RPG In Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier you fight in Midgar Beyond the setting, The First Soldier has very little in common with Final Fantasy 7: the gameplay is the standard one of the battle royale shooter in all respects. In the role of a ~candidate~, we find ourselves fighting in a third person view on a large map representing Midgar and its surroundings, parachuted from an aircraft together with 74 other players with the intention of remaining the last ones standing at the end of the match. As befits the canon, we have to explore the map and collect weapons and equipment from the setting that progressively shrinks over time, all without respawning and therefore trying to survive as long as possible in a highly threatening environment. All according to the trappings of the genre, therefore, but Square Enix and Ateam have seen fit to insert some distinctive features in this game, in order to tie it more to the reference series and release it a bit from the slavish imitation of the many direct competitors. peculiar elements refer to the RPG tradition of Final Fantasy, even if they are obviously immersed in a completely different context. It starts from the subdivision of the characters into five different classes, which reflect the typical ~jobs~ of the reference universe and are defined as ~styles~: Warrior, Sorcerer, Ninja, Monk, Ranger, which vary the approach to battle significantly . If on the one hand this allows you to range between characters focused on melee attacks and others more inclined to magic or ranged combat, on the other hand we must detect a certain confusion in the balance, which is also joined by the objective problems of interface and control. Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier, clash with an enemy mech Melee attacks are powerful but difficult to land due to the general imprecision of the touch screen controls, while ranged attacks lack the feel of the fight and even these can be imprecise, although a comfortable targeting and automatic fire system does not as soon as the crosshair lines up with the enemy. Everything improves a lot with the use of a compatible controller, but the general confusion also remains due to a decidedly bizarre camera management, which can make the clashes frustrating. Other features derived from Final Fantasy are the Materia, or the typical magical orbs that can be found around the Midgar map or conquered by slaying enemies and allow instant access to specific magic, beyond the standard skills of each class. The spells are the traditional ones of the series, to which are also added some powerful evocations capable of giving spiessubstantial nts to the possibilities of attack, also varying the game action a little. Another particular element is the presence of monsters that can appear within the map and allow you to obtain further bonuses through real PvE sections during the normal battle royale action, a good idea that distinguishes The First Soldier a bit from the other battles royale and brings it closer to RPG. A somewhat dull Midgar Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier contains stuff for summoning Despite the direct reference to Final Fantasy, the characterization of The First Soldier appears rather anonymous, from the character design to the construction of the map. The Midgar represented is functional to a battle royale shooter, with many structures scattered among houses, warehouses and abandoned buildings around in order to offer shelters, areas to explore and loot to discover, but if it weren't for the background with the mega-structure which gives a glimpse of the upper areas of the city could easily be mistaken for the scenario of any other similar title. However, some element from the lore is still present and will please fans of the series: going around the game areas it is possible to discover references to the church of Aerith, the den of Avalanche or other typical areas of the Slums. In addition to these, more direct references come from the chocobos used as mounts, from the summons and from the creatures of the PvE sections, but in general the direct connection with Final Fantasy is not exactly clear in the screenshots of The First Soldier. The animated sequences in computer graphics and the orchestral soundtrack that incorporates some historical themes of the series are spectacular. However, it is a game that can be managed quite well by mobile hardware and is certainly an advantage given its complexity, even if battery consumption and the large memory space required (over 2 GB) must always be taken into consideration.", "date": "2021-11-22", "grade": "6.4"}
