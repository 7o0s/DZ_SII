{"name": "Il libro parlante", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77074-nier-il-libro-parlante.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360After the last controversial Final Fantasy for Square Enix, it's time to take a breather; the expenditure in terms of time and costs to complete the thirteenth chapter of the well-known jrpg saga was certainly huge and to remain always present and active on the market, the Japanese giant relies on the guys from Cavia by publishing Nier, a game full of features interesting including references to the more or less recent videogame past. A title this Nier that had a particularly singular gestation: born as a project including two separate games but arrived on the European market only in one form, barring any and unlikely new announcements. It is a difficult title to classify, announced as an action has taken on characteristics closer and closer to an RPG as new material on the work in progress was made public. Even now, faced with the final product, we remain rather embarrassed in having to catalog Nier using the classic known categories; for convenience we feel like approaching it to an action rpg even if its peculiar characteristics deserve attention and deepening. Civilization in crisis Nier tells the story of a world destroyed by a devastating epidemic: centuries after its appearance, modern civilization as we know it has completely collapsed and men have returned to live, or rather survive, embracing a rural style. A new, slow development that grows on the remains of a past that is by now more mythical than historical, and even the cities that are slowly and timidly reviving maintain almost as a warning to the new generations the glimpses dominated by the ruins of the old great works of man: bridges, buildings, infrastructures now unusable and decadent, symbol of a modernity and progress that have now disappeared. In this bleak context the adventures of our hero develop, a character to be baptized at our pleasure as happened in the adventures of a few years ago. We will impersonate a father, no heroes or predestined therefore, the protagonist's only motivation is to search for a cure for his seriously ill daughter of the terrible disease that has already once destroyed the world: the so-called Black Scrawl. The unusual choice of gravitating the adventure around a figure devoid of the typical heroic characters is also reflected in his appearance: a middle-aged man, aged with white hair and hardened in soul by the sad fate that afflicted his only daughter. However, this characterization pays off with a practically absent charisma; this makes it difficult for the player to become attached to his digital alter ego and it is a limitation that unites all the cast who act in Nier, significantly undermining the immersion. In our search for a miraculous cure we are called upon to visit the various cities and suburban areas that make up the game world, the latter does not appear particularly vast but can boast of a discreet and appreciable variety of environments that can be visited. The various locations are divided into macro-areas accessible with contained loads, rather it is the representation of these environments that appears cheesy offering a geography lacking in charm, a non-existent physical interaction and a barely sufficient technical realization, both in the monotonous and bare open fields despite the dynamic light cycle (without ever descending into the night though), both in repetitive dungeons and with overly simplistic level design. Sharp paper like blades Initially the father protagonist of the events appears equipped only with a miserable sword with which to fight in close combat through simple one-button linear combos but soon manages to obtain the favors of a magical book called Grimore Weiss giving him the ability to use magic , art already available from the prologue that serves as a comprehensive tutorial to the arcane arts. This power will progressively be enriched in the course of the adventure with new defensive and offensive spells, all of which can be upgraded and used in the normal way or in office so as to slightly vary the effect, however, increasing the cost in terms of mana. We go from the evocation of spears and huge hands to impenetrable barriers to opposing spells passing through a classic ranged attack that is so reminiscent of two-dimensional shot 'em ups. Already from the high number of spells and their effectiveness against enemies, one immediately realizes how the use and exploitation of spells (entrusted to the back keys of the pad) plays a fundamental role in Nier's combat system: especially the huge bosses have characteristics and weaknesses often reachable by magic attacks alone. InoFurthermore, to win against the toughest monsters it is necessary to destroy particular body parts once they will be highlighted by a timer which will indicate the time in which they will be vulnerable, while in case of failure this will result in the partial healing of the boss forcing us to repeat the action from the beginning. With the exception of these rare discounts with the most important monsters, the combat system is very simple and intuitive and, thanks to the great variety of offensive spells, more than enough to get the better of most of the monsters here commonly called Shades, ill-defined anthropomorphic figures similar to clusters of symbols and reflections which to tell the truth are not completely convincing like all the bestiary present in the game. Even the use of the parry, once learned to effectively master the providential dodge, will be almost superfluous. Perhaps given the particularly action characterization of the title, a greater development of the battle phases would have been appreciated, surrounding them with a tactical and strategic dimension that appears completely absent here and the ease with which one emerges victorious even from clashes in which one is in serious numerical disadvantage is perplexing. The exchanges between the protagonist and his verbose paper companion are nice, often encroaching on making fun of some video game clichs, helping to play down the adventure, provided you are familiar with English as the game lacks any Italian localization. Our pilgrimages will also lead to meeting and enlisting other adventure companions, always singular and somewhat improbable figures like the strangely (un)dressed Kain but of whom we don't want to reveal too much to you for the sake of surprise. Xbox 360 goals Nier, like many other Japanese games, is stingy with points and objectives, most of which appear secret, in particular those related to the storyline which include about half of the loot up for grabs. Others, albeit visible, are rather enigmatic in their explanation while it will also be essential to devote yourself to all the side quests to reach the thousand. Hunting and fishing The progression of the adventure continues for missions that always make new explorable areas available, these quests are accompanied by numerous secondary-order tasks that can be obtained by accepting the requests of the inhabitants, in both cases it is a matter of carrying out rather canonical tasks for the genre from the elimination of specific monsters upon harvesting particular items or resources. Nothing new under the sun therefore: a structure without particular defects but not even prodigal with twists or moments of high epicness, we continue in a linear manner without too many difficulties, also thanks to the medium-low difficulty of the entire game. To surround the classic routine of the good adventurer, a whole series of more or less useful activities such as hunting, fishing, forging weapons or delivering letters come in handy, all trivial tasks often functional to meet the demands of the inhabitants but which nonetheless represent a pleasant variation. On the other hand, the evolution of the character is totally automatic and as the level increases, his statistics are strengthened without having the possibility of managing this growth; this diminishes the role-playing component of the product by shifting the focus more towards the action component. In the player's hand is the possibility of enhancing weapons, spells and skills such as parrying and dodging through the use of ~words~ which, associated with an offensive or defensive characteristic, perform the function of real enhancements, giving bonuses or increasing some parameters such as attack or magical energy recovery. One eye on the camera One of the most interesting features of Nier is the original use of the camera which rotates according to the context. It often happens that the shot of a wall or a bridge is rotated sideways giving it an old-school platform flavor, or that sessions aboard carts are framed from above and are tackled with ranged attacks, almost to emulate a session of the old scrolling shooters. The limits of this solution are manifested when some sessions require particular attention in the calibration of the jumps, a precision that is lacking in a title without that refinement that distinguishes the great masterpieces of platform games. Sometimes the use of this expedient appears spot on and pleasant as the side shot inside the buildings that is so reminiscent of titles such as Castelvania, on other occasions instead it would have been preferable if the developers had the centell this solution more rather than forcing the hand by inserting pans of the camera that clash or do nothing but complicate the control of the character in the environment, sometimes hiding the way forward to achieve our goal. The least convincing aspect of the whole production is the graphic one, we are far from the great productions of Square Enix and the lack of refinement work is felt. All the characters and also the environments in which they move present a cheap realization with a decidedly poor polygonal load and (which is particularly evident in the protagonist) coarse and unrelated animations; even the textures are deficient in terms of definition and almost totally absent of effects that have made the fortune of other technically avant-garde games. Very annoying is also a blur effect that invests the image in very close shots, thus making it impossible to look closely at the characters. The ambient light effects and those of the spells are saved, even if more for artistic than technical merits. On the other hand, the musical accompaniment is of a completely different level with songs rich in sacred choirs which only in a few cases are excessively invasive to the ear, while given the presence of only English dubbing we would have frankly expected a better quality voice acting. The lack of English localization for some could represent an obstacle to the fruition of the adventure but it must be said that the game always holds the protagonist by the hand indicating on the map the next place to visit or listing every kind of object needed at the moment as in the case of quests , all of which partially limits the possible problems of understanding for a non-English-speaking audience.", "date": "2010-05-10", "grade": "6.5"}
