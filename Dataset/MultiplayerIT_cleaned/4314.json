On the other hand, in a medium that makes escapism one of its fundamental reasons for existence, it can represent the most effective solution for staging a plausible story in a bizarre setting. Umiro fits perfectly into the case study in question: it tells the story of two boys, Tinto and Satura, who find themselves mysteriously projected into the strange world that gives the game its name, with no memory and with strange clothes on. They soon discover that the only way to reconstruct their memories and identity is to touch the crystals scattered around the world, which therefore become the focal points of the various levels that make up the four settings to explore. In doing so, they progressively remember each other, reconnecting the memory fragments of their life as ordinary students while strengthening their relationship within the bizarre world of Umiro, where it becomes necessary for them to rely on each other. other in perfect harmony, overcoming the distrust and initial embarrassments of two boys who do not understand what is happening to them and making them feel like a real team that has their own survival at stake and perhaps a safe return to their everyday life. The game tells all this in the dialogues entrusted to a few lines of text and in the romantic hand-drawn images that occasionally space out the action between the levels, remaining far from verbosity and also leaving a lot to the imagination of the players but creating a nice substrate to accompany the series of puzzles to solve. The common thread The levels are single screens framed in a ~bird's eye view~ with a flattened perspective and a minimal and almost ~metaphysical~ graphic style that well underlines the dreamlike atmosphere of the strange world in which the two protagonists find each other. Within these screens, the two characters must be guided towards their respective crystals (green for Tinto, pink for Satura) in order to unlock memories and move on to the next level. This happens simply by drawing with your finger the path to follow for both and then pressing the play button to see the actual outcome of the movements. Obviously various elements intervene to make the action more complicated: the settings are infested by dark spheres that cannot be touched and move according to pre-established patterns, there may be traps or passages to be deactivated and opened by pressing keys and mechanisms to be used while the crystals to reach can be more than one each time for each character, including a golden type that allows you to unlock extra memories. All this translates into a complex mechanism that requires careful planning of the trajectories to be given to the two characters, so that they take the paths with the right timing and act in a coordinated manner to achieve the objectives. Since the interaction on the part of the player takes place in a moment prior to the actual execution of the movements, everything is resolved in a preventive planning which must precisely calculate the times of movement of the two characters at the same time, which is even more complicated by the fact of having to go through different paths. It is not easy to predict everything with precision, therefore it often happens that you have to proceed a bit with attempts, also to understand how the mechanisms present in the various levels work, but the pleasant interaction through the simple drawing of the strokes on the screen (even if in certain cases the response to the inputs does not seem to be perfect), the graphics and above all the evocative music that accompanies everything makes the experience particularly pleasant.", "date": "2018-04-09", "grade": "8.3"}
