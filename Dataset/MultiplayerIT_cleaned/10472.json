We immediately state that it is necessary to have the basic title in order to install Galactic Adventures. Non-conventional expansion From the point of view of the actual game, we are faced with a series of missions set in the Space phase, which is the last of the five evolutionary stages of Spore. Those who have not yet arrived will be able to choose to immediately face the new contents by deciding on one of the pre-packaged ~captains~; however, it is equally possible to prolong the efforts of the alter-ego already used, an option that we recommend. Completing each mission provides experience points to spend to upgrade the hero: the amount of quests is not high at all but they increase exponentially in number if those of other users, freely downloadable, are also considered. This is because the real reason for the existence of the hybrid DVD (it can be used both on Windows and Macintosh systems) is the very powerful editor supplied with Galactic Adventures and with which to create customized missions; we would say that in reality the beating heart is the toolset and that the levels created by Maxis are nothing more than reference examples. The mission locations can be defined in detail by modifying their morphological characteristics, populating them with previously created characters and creating special scripts for these. It will then be the player's responsibility to define the objectives that you want to be achieved in a maximum of eight acts, each of which can contain a maximum of three quests. This limitation prevents you from creating very tangled situations, respecting the ~hit-and-run~ gameplay of the starting game. One of the strengths of the editor is the ability to exploit Spore's malleable game dynamics from time to time: it will be possible to create hack'n'slash missions, others more based on real-time strategy and still others with a vocation more ~platform~. As can be understood, the potential of the editor is very high and the eyes of those who have seriously appreciated the customization possibilities of the original title will light up. The major problem of Avventure Galattiche is given precisely by the quality of the missions carried out by Maxis: impeccable from a stylistic point of view, they quickly reveal a verbose repetitiveness, giving the impression that the creatives have only taken care of the aesthetic aspect almost to entice the players to create a product that is equally valid artistically but more profound. Objective only partially achieved, because we have struggled to find quality productions created by players, despite the fact that the expansion already has a few months on its shoulders. From a technical point of view, however, nothing to report, even if a touch-up to the textures that are not always impeccable would have been appropriate.", "date": "2009-10-13", "grade": "6.8"}
