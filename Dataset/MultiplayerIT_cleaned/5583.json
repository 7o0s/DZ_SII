The protagonist is always Linda, a high school student who during the classic school trip finds herself wandering the streets of a town haunted by dark presences. Between one traumatic experience and another, poor Linda also ends up in the mysterious Realm of Mirrors, but the original title tells us nothing about what happens at this juncture. DreadOut: Keepers of The Dark fills this gap, catapulting us in front of a strange guy who cleans the floor of a long corridor dispensing cryptic advice. Entering the game we find ourselves surrounded by eight doors that lead to as many realms and it is here that the structure of this expansion changes radically compared to that of the original, placing us a few steps away from thirteen creatures ready to kill us. But even if the setting is different, the mechanics behind Keepers of the Dark are the same as the original which, as we all know, is heavily inspired by Fatal Frame. This means that poor Linda finds herself once again forced to face terrible supernatural creatures with only the help of a smartphone and a reflex equipped with a flash. Fortunately, these tools are more than enough to banish ghosts, provided you discover the specific strategy that allows you to effectively attack each creature. Keepers of The Dark makes this mechanic its whole world by putting us in front of a real compilation of supernatural fights that concentrates all the cerebral and physical action of DreadOut, distorting its structure, reducing the narrative component to a flicker and eliminating the character evolution. All fights are at hand and Linda, unlike what happens in DreadOut, is immediately ready to face them. DreadOut: Keepers of The Dark represents the missing chapter of the peculiar Indonesian horror Smile, you're dead While not particularly large, the eight realms that we find ourselves cleaning up from evil are to a certain extent open, include some puzzles and force us to a minimum of exploration during which it is good to keep our eyes and ears open. On the other hand, although the gameplay culminates in the act of taking pictures, this also lives on the need to understand where and how to move taking into account the sound clues, the colored halos that indicate the proximity of threats or points of interest and dangerous unexpected events such as knights ghost that charge us at great speed. In certain situations, the shutter button is transformed into the equivalent of the trigger of a Kalashnikov but in many cases, such as that of the fearsome Kami, to emerge victorious from the battle it is necessary to understand when it is appropriate to point the lens at the monster and when it's time to look elsewhere. Obviously the creatures that appear in front of us do not leave us time to think but attack incessantly and for this reason it can be quite complicated to study the situation while the vision becomes more and more blurry, the world is getting darker and the eventuality of a terrible and imminent death makes its way into our thoughts. When this arrives, the destination is limbo that forces us to walk for several seconds towards a blinding light before being able to return to the last checkpoint and resume combat with the creature on duty. Many have appreciated this peculiarity of DreadOut, which among other things forces us to think about what we were doing just now, but the obligation to waste time doing the same thing every time can prove annoying in a title which, if of particularly tough enemies, turns into a flurry of trial & error. Fortunately, the clashes with the ghosts are quite rapid, at least once you understand the mechanical specifications of the creature we are facing, even if leaving us with the feathers is an integral part of an experience that entrusts a large part of its longevity, which varies according to the commitment and the skill of the player, to the high difficulty. Nonetheless, the developers have decided to reduce the damage inflicted by creatures, leaving more room for the player. If on the one hand this choice makes some fights rather simple to deal with, on the other it makes the title more accessible to the general public despite being almost completely focused on a type of action that is anything but trivial. In any case, the narrative component is not completely absent even if it plays a secondary role and it is necessary to be familiar with the events of DreadOut in order to understand it. The right atmosphere Fruit of the work of a small Indonesian team,DreadOut: Keepers of the Dark rests on the same modest foundation as the original. The polygons are scarce, the structures are spartan, the anonymous textures and the animations leave something to be desired. Furthermore, the cutscenes are composed of still screens that tell us very little and, finally, only two of the eight environments of this expansion are new while the others are all recycled from the three acts of the original title. What stimulates our senses is the atmosphere, the use of lights and the ghosts who are the absolute protagonists of Keepers of the Dark. Even when the technical side is weak, the creatures we are facing can count on a good characterization and realization work that has been carried out in collaboration with the major financiers of the Indiegogo campaign dedicated to DreadOut. Among fetuses, giant heads, phantom dancers and mannequins ready to suddenly come to life, there is no shortage of variety and inspiration, at least partially balancing a cosmetic that takes us back about ten years. In parallel, the sound sector does its duty between ghostly laughter and samplings that give a lot to the atmosphere even if they don't shine for variety like the ambient soundtrack which focuses on the most classic horror tones. We find one of the sore points in the control system that travels between woody and marble. If things work well enough with the smartphone in hand, during the escape from the creatures that chase us things become grotesque and do not change much, preferring the pad to the mouse and keyboard combination. The other negative note is the total absence of the adaptation in Italian. After the launch of DreadOut, the subtitles in our language also arrived, which makes us hope that in the future they will also arrive for Keepers of The Dark, but it is difficult to understand why the translation of the menus, implemented in the original two years ago now, was used in this expansion.", "date": "2016-04-11", "grade": "7.0"}
