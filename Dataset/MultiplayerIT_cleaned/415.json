With the cold we know hunger and in general the bulk of Crown of Glory revolves around the ability to manage the supply chain in relation to your army. In reality this is the tip of a very complicated and initially disheartening iceberg, especially for the editor, since the game does not provide any in-game description to help the player distinguish the icons, but it is rumored that the version for sale in shops is accompanied by a juicy manual. Just to give an example, it will be your duty to control the commercial channels with the provinces, regulating the volume of sales and the type of products that you want a certain region to produce in greater quantities. Although the entries related to the development are generic and not inclusive of specific buildings, the resulting statistics to manage are varied and interrelated with each other, unfortunately without a clear overview, so that understanding how things are really going requires a loss of time and excessive nerves. Think about what it's like to review every accursed territory and check all the items inherent in the development of the kingdom, weighed down by an essential but inflexible interface, always oriented to detail rather than summary. with great class the programmers then added a ~negotiating table~ for the losing nations Packed lunch in the Russian winter However, let's go back to the supplies, which must be accumulated in essential deposits for storage, without this umbilical cord between the paying empire and the fighting army ever failing, otherwise goodbye dreams of glory, because often you will have to move armies so numerous that the risk of a hasty retreat would be at least disastrous. Let us remember that at that time the soldiers didn't take long to pack up and turn their backs on the enemy, one more reason to keep troop morale under control as well as that of the local populations, who can feed the soldiers if you decide to weigh on the taverns rather than the imperial trust fund. Although the level of cohesion between the different aspects is intriguing, you will only be faced with numbers and statistics, but concretely on the game map you will not get great satisfaction. The items to be managed mostly play a symbolic role while it would have been more interesting to be able to interact on the choice of which buildings to erect specifically, perhaps being able to historically characterize the different cities. Packed lunch in the Russian winter Despite this Crown of Glory has yet to play its best cards, one of which is the fine art of diplomacy, perhaps the most entertaining managerial framework of all. Not only can ambassadors go around the map forging alliances based on explicit agreements to be negotiated between the nations concerned, but they can also influence the very course of conflicts, for example by obtaining a do-over from a hostile province. With great class, the programmers then added a ~negotiating table~ for the losing nations, which can thus negotiate the terms of surrender, a case study that includes many particular situations that you will discover as you enter the thick undergrowth of diplomatic salons. It goes without saying that we cannot shake everyone's hand and while Sweden is made to believe that it must send its troops against Great Britain, we calmly sail loaded with cannons towards the shores of Stockholm. Yes, you read right, we finally go to war, only we do it in the next paragraph. the development of the battles is worth the time that each of them requires At the base there is always a hexagon The most pleasant component of Crown of Glory is certainly the ballistic one, but let's also say that it doesn't offer anything new compared to what you would find in a good hexagonal-based board game. Mind you, it is very detailed and full of elements that directly affect the progress of the battle but don't expect any particularly important gimmicks. Everything takes place as already anticipated on a hexagonal-based grid, taking into account atmospheric factors and solar time. For example, fighting at night or in the presence of heavy rain limits the range of the shot, while steep terrain or a river to ford are a serious impediment to the movement of troops. Although the presence of charismatic personalities determines the possibility of obtaining specific bonuses, it all lies, as always happened in those times, in being able to supply adequate supplies to one's troops without dispersing theformations; the weapons were in fact not adequate to obtain bloodshed in a short time, therefore many conflicts are won by breaking the opponent's morale. At the base there is always a hexagon Since the clashes are slow and can last for a long time, the option that allows you to resolve the altercation in a much more expeditious way should not be underestimated, arranging your pieces in three lines and letting the computer determine the result of the clashes, quickly calculating the sequences of turns. Although in some cases this possibility is highly recommended, the development of the battles is worth the time that each of them requires (once a battle has started you will be forced to conclude it), above all thanks to the many tactical choices available. In fact, each kingdom has elite troops with unique characteristics and the playing field is very detailed as regards the elements of the landscape and the effects of smoke, albeit within the limits of a Spartan setting that thrives on two-dimensional sprites animated in a way hasty. It is therefore not the form that shines in Crown of Glory, which on the contrary is reduced to the bare minimum by indulging in some frivolity only on the battlefields, and dominating the menagerial aspects of the game requires an effort that will undoubtedly exhaust the vast majority of players. The fact is that there are no alternative game modes or particular coups in the gameplay. Without a doubt as a turn-based strategy it reaches high levels of complexity and even if you can entrust the economic command cadres to the computer, you would thus lose the sense of this game. It is difficult to make substantial criticisms of it, except for the absence of some features for a more comfortable supervision of the game, but beyond this, Crown of Glory hits the target and has no big rivals at the gates. If only he had dared to do something new, it would be a cut above, while it remains an excellent wargame aimed at a small audience of passionate enthusiasts, with a penchant for the Napoleonic era and which has undoubtedly found bread for its teeth. Final comment Crown of Glory is a concentration of complexity, a torrent of management items curtly represented in four command screens to give you a serious headache. At the same time, however, it is also a great turn-based strategy game, where every small change in terms of management influences the entire chain of the economy, strongly supported by a cause-and-effect relationship that links the cultural development of Provence with the opening of a trade channel between us and Holland. The clashes are long successions of rounds, Machiavellian as only the conflicts of the eighteenth century were capable of being, exhausting and stubborn. Rather than killing, they exhausted the enemy and this too has been faithfully simulated. However, it remains a poor graphic setting for a very thick juice, impossible to digest for most, but perfect for the most ravenous wargame maniacs. The price then easily whets the appetite. Pros Huge management framework Strategically complex and challenging battles Very high historical detail Cons Lack of overview Overall presentation is kept to a minimum Basically nothing that hasn't been thought of before Italy has awakened, a century later The curtain opens on the Napoleonic era around 1799 and then falls on his melancholy figure around 1820. It goes without saying that in those years Europe was going through a crucial moment for its socio-cultural development but we are far from a simulator of contributing causes historical. We want blood and lots of toy soldiers to send to the front, so let's rejoice at the idea that Crown of Glory, winner of numerous awards in 2005 as the best strategic ~brick~, is ready to steal your sleep, sure of its wide selection of playable kingdoms. In fact, there are eight war banners (and go with the list): France, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia (up, dust off your school books), Russia, Turkey, Sweden and Spain. Of course, dozens of small starving statelets are just waiting to be annihilated, but the task of controlling them will still fall to the computer. When we talk about strategy for once we are not referring to the ever green RTS genre, but rather to the glorious turn-based strategy, which respectful of tradition offers two-dimensional hexagonal maps, with the exception of the historical map of Europe, on which you will move from one province to province in the style of the Total War series. So what to do? The title provides the answer to the age-old dilemma, as your expansionist ego will have peace only after obtaining a large number of Glory Points, which can be accumulated mostly by returning victoriousfrom the battlefields. But here comes the best, because to sit securely on the throne, at least for twenty years, which for the time are a sign of great foresight, you will have to dialogue with learned figures represented by pictorial icons, which if stimulated with the mouse will give you free access to the kingdom's accounting almanks, to give all kinds of orders. Your despotism will have to deal with the infrastructure of the nascent empire, population development and supply management (crucial node of the game), even if it is only a taster compared to the four screens full of waiting items to manipulate that as the months go by (standard playing time), your tactic proves to be productive. Come on, people of hexagonal strategists, if you really exist, the time has come to take an in-depth look at Crown of Glory. Let's go.", "date": "2006-07-11", "grade": null}
