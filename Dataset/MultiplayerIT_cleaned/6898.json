There have been many variations on the theme, some even of excellent quality, but it is a trend that at a certain point became too inflated and unable to renew itself, which led to a halt in productions of this type. Well, Spider-Man Unlimited, the new Gameloft tie-in, manages to offer a different endless model; which in the first place is not ~endless~, given that in addition to a special mode (useful for acquiring points and experience) the levels of the game are not infinite but have a precise term and purpose, that of eliminating five dangerous super-villains as well as all the their alternate versions, coming from as many planes of Marvel reality. To succeed in the enterprise we will be able to take advantage of the same expedient, playing the role of the classic Spider-Man or his many variations: from Ultimate Spider-Man to the Spider-Man of the Mangaverse, passing through Spider-Man 2099 and many others. The switch of the character does not produce changes in the approach to the game, in reality, but it is possible to take advantage of the additional skins to ~merge~ them and obtain an increase in level or rank, as happens in many strategic ones based on trading cards. An extra substrate that helps to increase the variety of experience together with a whole series of precautions that we will see in a moment. Spider-Man Unlimited is a varied, fun and well-made endless runner, full of missions and enemies Unlimited or maybe not Spider-Man Unlimited is a freemium title and can therefore be downloaded for free from the App Store, Google Play and Windows Store. It is played for free without major problems, but with two limits: the first and most stringent is that of the now traditional ~action points~, which are spent every time we play a game and which are recharged over time, ten minutes to be precise to point; the second is that of the in-game currency, the crystals of ISO-8, which allow you to continue to game over and level up more quickly. You throw your strings The control system mixes various types of approaches: from the purely touch one of Subway Surfers and Running With Friends to the tilt one of the aforementioned Temple Run, with a view to a system devoted to the greatest possible variety. Indeed, Spider-Man's race begins on the roofs of Manhattan, in a shower of obstacles that are lowered from above, simple barriers or enemies to be knocked down (by jumping or sliding); but then come alternative sections in which you have to swing with the web (holding your finger on the screen to go up and lifting it to go down) or you climb vertically on a building, or you still let yourself fall. In these situations, the accelerometer comes into action, with the device that must be tilted to avoid impacts and continue to collect the capsules that make up the game's virtual currency, the one that will allow us to unlock new alternative versions of Spider-Man. The setting works very well and gives the Gameloft product experience an unprecedented freshness, capable of conquering even those who thought they had really had enough of endless runners. This happens above all thanks to the progression, represented by the levels and by the alternative areas, one for each super criminal (it starts with the Green Goblin and with the Vulture, but new enemies will arrive via update), and to the various extra challenges present on the maps, also 'esse ~at term~. If desired, then there is the Unlimited mode, which we talked about at the beginning, which poses the challenge in the traditional endless terms that we know well. The picture that emerges is therefore that of a game with a certain depth, which manages to overcome the well-known limits of the genre to which it belongs and to make good use of the Marvel license, accompanying the frenetic action with excellently crafted cel-shaded graphics , fluid and detailed, and a sound that is also very well done.", "date": "2014-09-24", "grade": "8.0"}
