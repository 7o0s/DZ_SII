{"name": "Wrestling d'altri tempi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100143-wwe-wrestlefest-wrestling-daltri-tempi.html", "text": "When Dan Peterson was on TV wrestling commentary and the WWF was in the throes of the gimmick era, with wrestlers like Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior and ~Macho Man~ Randy Savage dominating the scene, the arcades were full of two fantastic coin- ops made by Technos Japan: WWF Superstars, produced in 1989, and WWF WrestleFest, of 1991. The former boasted a more ~consistent~ gameplay, with fewer moves and characters but an excellent sensation of impact. Among its peculiarities stood out the similarity in the sprites of the various wrestlers with those of Double Dragon, developed two years earlier by the same team. The second, WrestleFest, was graphically ugly but represented the wet dream of the fans of the time, given the huge number of characters and the possibility of playing not only a full-bodied single player mode, but also the spectacular Royal Rumble. Twenty years later, THQ has seen fit to take over the original code and to package a re-edition of the game capable of satisfying both nostalgic and new fans, adding a new series of modes to the original mix and above all to support the superstars classic some wrestlers belonging to the attitude era (such as The Rock and ~Stone Cold~ Steve Austin) as well as to the roster of the current WWE (John Cena, Randy Orton, Rey Mysterio, The Undertaker, etc.). The result of the operation, obviously entitled WWE WrestleFest, is a mix of strengths and weaknesses which on the one hand can boast a gameplay very similar to the original and an excellent amount of content, on the other it suffers from some at least questionable solutions, especially regarding the graphics and the control system. What'cha gonna do, brother? As mentioned, the original WWF WrestleFest allowed us to participate in the Royal Rumble and try our hand at a single player campaign, in this case a tag team tournament that culminated with a match for the title of couple against the Legion of Doom. In the case of the THQ re-edition, on the other hand, we have quite a few more options: from the simple exhibition to the Road to WrestleMania mode (a real career, rather long and articulated, which in fact involves saving the match), from the Royal Rumble to the tournament Saturday Night's Main Event, from the Tag Team mode to the survival approach of the Gauntlet, finally passing through the online multiplayer (which we weren't lucky enough to be able to try during our tests). The selection of characters is also good, which however is ~castrated~ natively and requires the purchase of a first DLC (priced at 79 cents) to unlock CM Punk, Big Boss Man, Shawn Michaels, Sheamus, Triple H and the arena of the Survivor Series. Once in action, you immediately notice the similarities between WWE WrestleFest and the 1991 coin-op, with a control system that takes up the original one and is therefore based on a virtual stick and two buttons, one for football and one for punch, the repeated pressure of which, once the opponent has been hooked, allows us to win the physical confrontation and carry out the throw on the ropes or one of the many moves that fall within the repertoire of the wrestler we have selected. The adaptation of different characters to the scheme adopted by Technos Japan twenty years ago is sometimes problematic, but often it is well done: The Rock executes the Rock Bottom when his antagonist is cornered, and if he falls to the ground ~crosswise~ that's enough the pressure of a key to start with a spectacular People's Elbow, just to give an example. Unfortunately, there were some elements that didn't need to be reproposed, for example the fact that the wrestlers are all the same height (Rey Mysterio as tall as The Undertaker? Sure, right...) and the aforementioned two-button control system, if to run you have to press both at the same time (impossible to do with the thumb). On the other hand, it is curious how the ~licenses~ that made sense from the point of view of gameplay have changed, such as being able to pin the opponent even in the Royal Rumble instead of limiting ourselves to throwing from the top rope. Furthermore, the technical sector leaves much to be desired, especially the animations.", "date": "2012-03-20", "grade": "6.7"}
