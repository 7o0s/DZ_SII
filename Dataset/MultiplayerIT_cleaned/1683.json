Once you have chosen your character (others will become available as you complete the game), you can decide whether to practice with the control system (thanks to the simple tutorial) or jump into the real game, which in this case identifies the stages in Springfield's most distinctive location. In each of these levels you will have to face a series of challenges, ranging from reaching goals to finding objects, passing through performing tricks. The acrobatic maneuvers don't just act as a ~spectacular side dish~ to the game, but they have a precise function: the better the quality of the trick, the more money you will earn. You can spend the money on improving the characteristics of your counterpart, for example by increasing Homer's otherwise poor jumping ability. It is an element that adds a pinch of depth to an otherwise ~flat~ game... A certain depth is also given by the level advancement system, which are not all available immediately (just like the characters): a new stage becomes playable only when you pass the previous one. In this case, however, we are faced with a double-edged sword: a product that is not technically excellent like Simpsons Skateboarding, in fact, should have counted more on an ~everything and now~, favoring variety, rather than on a system ~in fits and starts~, capable of creating interest but starting from an already valid basis. Pros and cons of the control system As you'll learn in the tutorial, controlling characters can give you some satisfaction but also a lot of headaches. You move using the Dual Shock 2's left analog stick, decelerating by simply pulling the stick back. The problem is that this solution makes ~precision~ maneuvers extremely complicated, and on the other hand the game will immediately put you in front of such situations: already in the first level you will have to pick up an object that is located on a tubular construction, and to climb it you will first have to take a run, then jump and ~grind~ to the goal. Easy to say, hard to do... Luckily, performing tricks isn't complex at all, and can give you some excitement: for stunts, you just need to launch yourself up a ramp, jump and then press a simple key combination. As usual, you have to pay close attention to timing: grabbing the skate with your hands as you are about to return to the ground will result in a disastrous fall, seasoned with exclamations that vary from character to character (in English, however). Concluding... Simpsons Skateboarding, on balance, is a skate game that can hardly compete with the best products of the genre. Its real strength, that is the Simpsons license, has not been exploited to the full by the developers, who could have enriched the title with some animated sequences as well as with the appreciable original sampled voices. The graphics have the advantage of rendering the atmosphere of the series well, but lack both in quantity and quality with regard to the settings. The engine that drives everything has some uncertainty, moreover. There are some moments in which the game manages to entertain, but in the global context they are far too few to justify an expense that, from this point of view, I would only recommend to those who collect everything related to the yellow inhabitants of Springfield Pro : Simple execution of tricks Upgradable characters Very cartoon-like graphics Cons: Poor control system Difficulty poorly calibrated There is a certain Tony Hawk's Pro Skater around Bart Simpson? A skater... Anyone who follows the Simpsons animated series knows well that its strength lies in the possibilities of the various characters. I mean, Homer Simpson is the (all too realistic) caricature of the average American family man: obese, bald, nave enough to believe teleshopping and, in general, anything said on TV. On the other hand, his son Bart is a ~thug~ who loves to devise diabolical pranks on his teachers and who rides on a skateboard. Electronic Arts thought that the numerous ideas offered by the cartoon could be used to make video games of different genres, and Simpsons Skateboarding sees the light, in fact, after a wrestling game and a driving game. Initially in command of Homer, Marge, Bart or Lisa, you will have the opportunity to try your hand at numerous competitions that mix the execution of stunts with the achievement of certain objectives. All against the backdrop of sunny Springfield, of course.", "date": "2003-04-15", "grade": null}
