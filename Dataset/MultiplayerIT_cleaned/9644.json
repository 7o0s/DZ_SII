The community is thrilled by King Elessar's impending visit, and so there are kiosks at every corner and numerous attractions to welcome the arrival of the ruler of Gondor in the best possible way. Sam Gamgee, who became mayor, directs the work together with his young son Frodo, who in the early stages of the game we find ourselves impersonating. Armed with a sword and a wooden shield, during this introductory level we can become familiar with the control system and learn the basics of combat: the use of the shield to parry blows and open up the opponent's defence, dodging, the various types of attacks that can be made with the sword, and so on. Having completed a few simple quests, little Frodo and his friends reach Sam's house together, where the hobbit decides to tell him about when he met King Elessar, who at the time called himself Strider, and about the extraordinary adventure he lived together with the Fellowship of the Ring to avert the threat of Sauron. At that point we take command of Aragorn, reliving his first encounter with Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry and wandering through a dark city, threatened as much by the presence of shady minions of Saruman as by that of the terrible Black Knights. In this situation the ranger enriches his equipment with a flaming torch, which similar to the shield can be used by shaking the Nunchuk and has a not indifferent offensive value, especially against the Black Knights and, in general, the creatures that fear fire so particular. After escorting the Hobbits to Gran Burrone, Aragorn is chosen by King Elrond to take part together with the elf Legolas, the wizard Galdalf, the dwarf Gimli, the warrior Boromir, Frodo and his three friends in an expedition whose purpose is to reach Mount Doom to throw the One Ring into its eternal flames. An uphill road A few minutes are enough to frame The Lord of the Rings: The Adventure of Aragorn as a not very successful attempt to merge Tolken's work with the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. Between main and secondary quests, there are so many things that little Frodo on one side and the brave Aragorn on the other can do within the locations, the point is that in any case these are missions characterized by a frightening linearity, of like ~cover the path from A to B~. These all too simplistic dynamics are not, in the first instance, supported by an action worthy of the name: the fights turn out to be devoid of bite and challenge, the enemies generally show little initiative and the presence of active companions during the clashes (a by the way, it is possible to play in two without split screen (just hold a second set of controllers) makes things even easier for us. The scenarios are rather bare and in most cases it is not difficult to orientate, but just stop for a moment and press the A button for the system to show us the direction to follow to reach the objective of the turn. Relying solely on this feature, it goes without saying that the adventure quickly becomes boring. We must not give up, however, because when Aragorn acquires all his equipment (the bow and the spear, in addition to the aforementioned shield and torch) things begin to mesh, the most spectacular sequences seen in the films directed by Peter Jackson arrive and the fights finally they become challenging, forcing us to resort to special moves (the power combo, the charged attack, etc.) to get the better of our multiple opponents. Playstation 3 trophies There are thirty trophies contained in The Lord of the Rings: The Adventure of Aragorn, and as usual the difference between the bronze, silver and gold ones is based on the complexity of the objectives to be achieved. The nine bronze trophies are unlocked by killing one hundred goblins, as many orcs and Uruks, and so on, while for the fifteen silver trophies you have to win a series of fights without taking damage, acquire all the upgrades and defeat some bosses. The five gold trophies are earned by completing all main and secondary quests, while the platinum trophy arrives as always when we have obtained all the other trophies. Wii-mote vs Move The motion detection control system works well on both Wii and PlayStation 3. In the version of the game for the Sony console it is also possible to use the Dual Shock 3, but in this way the experience ends up becoming poorer and more sterile than than it already is. The sword is clearly controlled by the oscillations of the controller, and yet withoutresorting to the Motion Plus of the Nintendo flagship we note a good response to the lunge as well as, clearly, to the lateral and vertical slashes. The inability to control the view in both versions is not only irritating, but also creates major problems in the sections where you need to draw the bow quickly, a maneuver that must be done by using the infrared pointer to operate an on-screen reticle. Collision detection sometimes shows the side to some annoying uncertainty, but in principle the more advanced combat phases return a good sensation of impact and require some effort. The game was evidently designed for the technical capabilities of the Wii and subsequently translated onto the PlayStation 3, and unfortunately it shows: beyond the interlude sequences, which are pre-calculated on the Nintendo console, the graphics appear decidedly ~old gen~ for those that are the potential of the Sony platform. Even on PS3 there are frequent drops in frame rate. In short, apart from the HD resolution, The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Adventure looks much better visually on the Wii, with some nice solutions (the leaves of the trees, which seem almost cel-shaded), a discreet artistic direction and a good fluidity. The comparison with the aforementioned Twilight Princess is neither in heaven nor on earth, but in the end, the product developed by Headstrong Games looks good and offers, thanks to the film's music, some good moments. The dialogues have been entrusted almost entirely to the original voice actors, therefore we have Pino Insegno as Aragorn, Gianni Musy who plays Galdalf, etc. The acting is more than good, and from this point of view fans of the saga can only be happy. A small note: the PS3 version has many more sentences than the Wii one, perhaps due to the greater space available on the Blu-ray support.", "date": "2010-11-17", "grade": "6.0"}
