The original Spellforce 2: Shadow Wars was a great mix between RPG and real-time strategy that really convinced everyone getting very high ratings and cementing the fan base conquered by the first chapter. Unfortunately it dates back to 2006, which is about nine years ago. Demons of the Past is the third official expansion (if we don't count the DLCs of the second) which follows after about a year and a half Faith in Destiny, the second, released in mid-2012, after years of silence in which many had thought that the series was now dead, also due to the well-known problems of the previous publisher, JoWood, which went bankrupt the year before. Well, probably if Nordic Games, the new publisher, has chosen to publish it there will be a reason, that is, there must still be a passionate audience of the SpellForce universe who, after all these years, continues to ask for and buy extra content. Now you just have to ask yourself a question: are you part of that audience? If the answer is yes, then know that this video game was made for you and that only you can enjoy it. If the answer is no, forget Demons of the Past, because it would not make sense to buy it. Sometimes it's best if the good memories stay the same and that expansions like Demons of the Past don't come out Continuity Let's analyze the reasons that make this expansion unsuitable for newbies. Let's start with the single player campaign. Demons of the Past is a stand alone expansion. This means that you don't need to have other chapters of the series to play it. Unfortunately, the developers have chosen to continue the story told in the previous episodes, so many things are taken for granted. By starting the campaign, no one will explain the nature of the evil that is threatening the world again, no one will give you a smattering of the Shaikan and their history. Once you have chosen the gender of your hero of the day, you will be thrown into the fray to fight skeleton warriors and solve the problems of a city under siege. As you progress, you will come into contact with the system of collecting raw materials and creating your army, but always without anyone explaining what is happening around you and, above all, where you come from. In reality, the basic plot of the campaign is clear, very clear in its banality, only that facing it without having played Shadow Wars, Dragon Storm and Faith in Destiny is like crashing a party that is almost over. The only solution is to go to some enthusiast site to get all the information you need to enjoy the plot to a minimum, but at this point it's better to buy the complete Spellforce collection and play them all again (if you want, it's also worth it, if it intrigues you the genre), instead of spending hours reading about them. Let's also assume that some missions are badly calibrated and introduce enemies with a lazy and poorly studied graduality (why put giants under a tree immediately next to a farming village if not to fill the map a bit?), to conclude a picture not exactly idyllic. Shadows of the past The second reason why Demons of the Past is not good for those unfamiliar with the series is its age. Visually, Spellforce 2 looked very goodin 2006. Today, its style is dated at best. We are not just talking about details or textures, but about a series of discoveries that can be accepted only if the original is esteemed to the point of not paying attention to the inevitable limits that time mercilessly puts before the eyes (for example the workmanship of the models three-dimensional figures of humans and monsters). Let's talk about the general feeling, which ends up disfiguring even in the face of more recent minor productions. We would also have to ask whoever took care of the communication where the dreaded game engine update is, since there is no trace of it (there are also some bugs present in the original, just to say), but they are trifles. Also because one could overlook the old age of the graphic aspect, but what about the chronic lack of novelty? Mind Over Matter Studios (the developer) has not bothered to add anything new to the original formula, except a multiplayer mode that leaves the time it finds, in which you have to fight particularly resistant bosses and which wears out after a few hours . For the rest we are faced with absolute nothingness, with half-recycled online maps, modes already seen, situations already experienced and so on, up to the fateful bottom of the barrel to be scraped. At least Faith in Destiny had introduced dragons as mounts! There is really nothing relevant here, to the point that we can consider it more of a luxury mod thana real expansion.", "date": "2014-01-22", "grade": "5.0"}
