After saving the world from the return of the terrible demon Balasar, he certainly doesn't let a little fatigue and the prospect of even more daring adventures slow him down. The fate of his mother, Magdi, is at stake and such a motivation is enough to leave the peaceful native village again and embark on a new adventure. On the other hand, Toku is not alone: at his side is Enril, the spirit of the wind, a fellow adventurer with whom, after having settled the demon, he is now able to face any threat. But was Balasar really defeated? And what happened to Magdi in the meantime? As befits a sequel, the story of LostWinds2: Winter of the Melodias has a less soft start than the first chapter, and immediately puts us in a rather eventful context, staging new actors in the plot and launching a Toku already experienced in the using the power of the wind directly in the action. There is therefore more movement, already in the first minutes of the game, starting from the beginning which surprisingly shifts the attention to another character, illustrating a new perspective with an interesting narrative device, before returning to the protagonist. Since there is no need for a gradual and complete tutorial as in the first chapter, the action starts immediately intense and offers a series of decidedly different and interesting situations, with changes of scenery of notable variety and able to keep interest high right away , although the surprise effect is obviously weakened by finding ourselves in front of a second chapter. There is a better pace of play given by a more open and complex level design, thanks to a greater amount of variables in terms of skills to be exploited and structure of the puzzles, even if there is a substantial dose of backtracking which, in line with the genre, it forces us to thoroughly explore previously visited scenarios in search of new paths and hidden objects, a feature that may not appeal to everyone. Seasons and Melodies LostWinds2: Winter of the Melodias is, like its predecessor obviously, a platformer with adventure elements that could fall into the category denominated by some MetroidVania, meaning by this term a game that bases its structure on action between platforms, fights with enemies and a good dose of gray matter to be applied to the resolution of the puzzles that the complex level design places before us. Within a vast open world, we find ourselves guiding Toku simply by tapping the edge of the screen in the direction we want to move it and managing Enril, the spirit of the wind, with quick taps of the fingers on the screen, in order to precisely draw the trajectories gusts and activate special abilities. In fact, almost all the puzzles require the diversified use of the wind, just as Toku's movements usually take place with the support of the element in question. In this regard, we must mention the improvements made to the control system, which although it continues to be rather strange in its indirect management of the protagonist, who moves automatically in the two directions given, is now decidedly more precise and responsive than seen in the first chapter. There are still some uncertainties in the response to the commands, with Toku suffering the influence of the wind even if these are aimed at elements of the scenery, but in principle the accuracy is remarkable and if nothing else there is no longer that constant risk to fall from the platforms or that need to issue the command several times to finally see it executed correctly. The audiovisual sector is remarkable, consisting of a perfect conversion of the excellent work done by Frontier on WiiWare, with the addition of the application of high definition and the addition of some graphic effects regarding lighting and particles.", "date": "2012-05-22", "grade": "8.6"}
