The developers of Contrast had the same experience: having successfully passed the selection on Steam Greenlight, this particular action platformer with puzzle elements, set in the 1920s, catapults us into a dream world, practically into the mind of a little girl who lives difficult situation and finds no other way to escape than by giving vent to his imagination. His mother is a charming singer who performs in clubs, his father a bumbling troublemaker who wants to redeem himself at all costs and return to be with his family. In the middle is Dawn, the character we control, a mysterious acrobat who never speaks during the game but who boasts absolutely peculiar abilities: in the presence of a light source, she can enter the dimension of shadows and explore it to take advantage of passages that apparently they do not exist but which allow them, once materialized again, to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. This ability is used in Contrast to solve a variety of environmental puzzles, as we'll see in a moment. Increases the contrast Little Didi is put to bed by her mother who goes out to work, but the girl has no intention of sleeping: she finds her friend Dawn in the shadows and together they go out for a ride, interacting with the environment in various ways. The mechanics of switching between the normal dimension and that of the shadows work in a very simple way: just approach a wall, press the right trigger on the controller and the girl becomes a shadow, with the possibility of jumping on objects that are only the projection of those who are actually around her. Sometimes Dawn has to interact with the light sources, moving them to create the ~steps~ and bridges necessary to move in the shadows and reach the destination that is indicated to us on the screen from time to time as events develop. There is a famous magician in town, the spectacular Vincenzo: wouldn't it be nice to go and meet him? What is certainly remarkable about Contrast is the design, as Didi and Dawn move in a distorted reality, a microcosm in which the streets and buildings are suspended in the void, while the other characters appear as shadows. The historical era of reference creates more than one parallel with BioShock, which certainly figures among the titles that the authors were inspired by for their work. In terms of gameplay, however, the two productions are clearly different, and unfortunately the limits of this particular experience quickly emerge. The game sessions, with platform sequences and the interaction with the shadows, are in fact too fragmented: it never happens that an enigma develops beyond a certain point, and consequently not only is the degree of challenge leveled down, but there are really too few things to do... so much so that the campaign is completed in scarce two hours. Contrast tells a good story and has an interesting style, but it's short and corny in mechanics. Notes in the night One of the things that is done most often in Contrast is to move objects to cause the formation of a certain type of shadows and then ~ride~ them to get on a platform. Sometimes this mechanism is subordinated to the activation of a series of devices, such as the traditional buttons that light up when a weight is placed on them. And so here we are transporting huge crates from one part of the scenario to another, between shadow and reality, or inserting steel spheres inside mechanisms for opening a door or releasing a platform. During one of the final phases there is also room for an appreciable fairytale turn, with Dawn becoming the protagonist of a puppet theater while Didi's father tells a story to the spectators, but even here the ideas put forward are rather trivial and inconsistent. Going into the specifics of the gameplay, the package works but we found Dawn's control a bit too ~ethereal~ and slippery, which fortunately only causes annoyance at certain moments, when perhaps it happens to ~get stuck~ somewhere. In the shortlist of situations proposed, however, there is no room for particularly innovative ideas, and this is perhaps the biggest disappointment for a project that many people looked at with curiosity. But let's go back to the characterization, which undoubtedly represents the strong point of the game. In addition to the valuable stylistic choices for what is the visual component, Contrast is also accompanied by a soundtrack of great quality and atmosphere, as well as really well-acted dialogues (too bad they are only in English, with subtitles in Italian). Behind the undoubted taste of the developers hides a very simple, almost basic graphic, which does what it can to hide its limits, aware that it is a difficult undertaking. All the characters apart from the two girls are represented as shadows, yet this only further highlights the angularity of their polygonal models and the lack of a proper animation set. Effects are also decidedly lacking, and the adjustments of the PC version are practically limited to selecting the screen resolution.", "date": "2013-11-22", "grade": "6.5"}
