It could be defined as a peasant simulation, but even compared to such a strange genre it still manages to go beyond the standards, because if it is true that even here it is a matter of growing vegetables and raising livestock, to argue that the fulcrum of the game lies in these actions would be quite misleading. It could be defined as a cross between this type of game and a sort of walking simulator, where the story is rarefied and sometimes impalpable but always turns out to be the substrate on which the game action is grafted. We find ourselves playing an elderly peasant woman, Talma, who lives on a farm at the extreme edge of civilization, in the midst of a deserted rural setting. The writing, which could be defined as alternative, does not continue in a standard way but adopts in its own way a type of environmental narration, whereby we learn about the world in which we find ourselves through documents, memories, dreams, letters and sporadic dialogues with the merchant -postman who every day acts as a link with the outside world. It's not easy to get a precise idea of the historical and temporal location of everything, but it seems to be a sort of alternative world, which appears constantly threatened by something obscure. While Talma's life proceeds at the pace of work in the fields, pressed by the fast turn of the days, we gradually learn that there is a sort of looming threat, which makes a basic concern more and more consistent. On the farm, reality seems to crystallize around the simple daily actions but it is felt, through dreams, visions and what is reported in the letters that arrive from relatives and friends (the texts are distinguished by a great writing quality, unfortunately there is no translation in Italian), this sense of imminent end that creeps into the cracks of everyday reality, despite the great peace and harmony that seems to reign over the tiny corner of the universe managed by Talma. The Stillness of the wind takes the contrast of a life of the past to extremes, in contact with nature and on the margins of society. In its slow and staid rhythms, forced by the limited abilities of such an elderly protagonist, it forces us to reflect on what we do in the game itself but in a certain sense also in our real life. Talma's dedication to her farm speaks to us of the importance of attachment to one's roots and of managing a microcosm in harmony with nature and according to human rhythms, in spite of the glowing progress that seems to invade the outside world, far beyond beyond the desert but still perceptible with a certain disquiet. Farm at the end of the universe In short, The stillness of the wind is a reflective and contemplative game, which pushes us to think about important issues such as old age, loneliness, abandonment but also melancholic memory and dignity in facing life with the few means available . It perfectly manages to move the soul of those who play it thanks to its particular style, the unusual choice of the protagonist and the topics covered but some doubts about its structure exist: in fact, its problems all lie in the game, given that from a stylistic point of view and as far as atmosphere and narrative modes are concerned, it is truly impeccable. The obsessive repetition of the same gestures obviously has the function of conveying the idea of life in the fields but the problem is that, in fact, it's not exactly fun or engaging. It probably doesn't even want to be: in representing the passion but also the effort that characterizes Talma's work, the title provides us with a few micro-actions to be carried out regularly to carry on the farm, alternating with a few forays into the areas surrounding the search for objects capable of stimulating memories, sections made particularly difficult by the very slow pace of the protagonist. As far as gameplay is concerned, this title has critical aspects both on the conceptual front, due to the simple mechanical repetition of gestures and its request for unique and specific uses of the tools that are around but without providing any explanation, and on the technical side, since the touch screen interface, on tested iOS devices, is often inaccurate. Contemplation is not motionless, unlike the landscape around the farmoria: in fact, it derives from the continuous repetition of the jobs that mark Talma's day: hoeing the earth, sowing, watering, milking the sheep and preparing the cheese, with the fundamental interlude of bartering and chatter guaranteed by the merchant's daily passage. The rapidity with which night arrives adds a further element to consider, pushing us towards reasoned and tight sequences of actions to be carried out, including care of crops, animals, possible excursions in the immediate surroundings of the farm and the need to be in the right place every time the merchant/postman passes, because the trade of products, carried out moreover through an interesting form of archaic bartering, is indispensable for obtaining raw materials and information on the developments of life outside Talma's house. All this is represented with a truly impeccable style by Memory of God, thanks to a clever use of colors and animations that stage the apparently immutable tranquility of the happy island represented by the farm, immersed in an extraordinary and melancholic stillness. In this, the audio sector also plays a fundamental role, which largely eliminates the music, leaving the task of outlining the bucolic and strange picture of The stillness of the wind to the noise of the wind, animals and Talma's cheerful muttering. .", "date": "2019-02-19", "grade": "7.8"}
