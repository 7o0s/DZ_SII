{"name": "Mario Kart DS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-kart-ds.html", "text": "To understand the present, one must know the past The way of racing with karts has evolved a lot over time, and every Mario Kart released so far, apart from Super Circuit, has delved into a certain aspect of racing, which is also why it is so difficult to determine which is actually the best between past ones. Super Mario Kart laid the foundations, introduced the concept that gave birth to this type of racing game. Mario Kart 64, with the advent of the four pad ports, was built with a view to multiplayer, with a particularly careful study of weapon management. The Super Circuit, for Game Boy Advance, was a mix between the first and the second, inserting the kart statistics and evaluations at the end of the grand prix. The most recent Double Dash, taking advantage of the GameCube to generate a fully polygonal graphics and an efficient physics engine, was created with a focus on driving, and that is why it is loved mainly by time trial enthusiasts. From each of these games Mario Kart DS has drawn the best. The art of holding a steering wheel Drifts are an evolution of those seen in Double Dash, which have been improved thanks to careful study of previous games. Thanks to the polygonal environments and characters, skidding is managed very precisely, drifting is controlled very well, but despite this, it is not as easy and immediate to perform as that of the GameCube version. In Double Dash it was an exhausting race based on generating one more power-slide than the opponent, in Mario Kart DS instead, in addition to the drift, great importance is given to the line and the trajectory of the car as in Super Mario Kart. The power-slide loads in three steps as usual: you start to slide with the right backbone, lean towards the outside of the curve, go back towards the inside, Everyone is free to create their own driving style, navigating the sea of possibilities offered by the Nintendo asphalt The art of holding a steering wheel then back outside and inside again, when finally your boost is ready to be released. If in Double Dash this process could be carried out in a few seconds, with simple bending of the analog, in the DS the movement must be more decisive and complete, which consequently led to the reduction of short drifts. Moreover, if your car is not inclined enough, very often you will not be able to load the boost, and this is why the much-hated straight-line drifts in the DS are, except in very rare cases, counterproductive. The jump has given further depth to a control system that was already full of nuances, as it can be used not only to turn in a simpler and more immediate way, but also at the end of the boost to create new and interesting moves. In essence, everyone is free to create their own style, navigating the sea of possibilities offered by the Nintendo asphalt. The art of overturning opponents Bonus management is instead a perfect mix between the SNES version and the N64 version, given that the number of weapons was inherited from the former and their use from the latter. There are a maximum of three boxes per round, so they must be dosed wisely. Almost all weapons can be parried by shielding themselves with shells or bananas, so some objects take on, as in Mario Kart 64, an important defensive value. For this reason, the use of the map below is essential, meticulously detailed for the first time thanks to the double screen of the laptop, which allows you to check both the position of the objects already launched and those momentarily possessed by the other runners. By knowing the weapons that others have, and by knowing the others what you have, an infinite number of different situations are created which require a In short, the nirvana of racing games and multiplayer The art of overturning opponents great speed of calculation and reasoning, perhaps while the thumbs are consumed by the power slides. To all these aspects extrapolated from the past, Nintendo has added a physics engine that is clearly superior to that of the GameCube version. The contacts between the various cars have been perfected, and now play a more important role than in the past, as it should be. The weight of a kart is evident from the first moment you check it, you immediately understand its characteristics. The behavior of the cars while they are in the air has also been improved, now it is impossible to load the power slide while in flight, but above all you can lean forward or backward to slow down or speed up the descent process. During the race it is also possibleile stay in the slipstream of one of your competitors, in order to go faster and also gain further acceleration that will allow you to overtake him; always, however, according to shell risk. In short, the nirvana of racing games and multiplayer. The cars There are many karts to choose from, thirty-six at the end of the game. For the first time, the character does not constitute a limit, in the sense that everyone can enter any vehicle. It is the kart that has certain characteristics, the driver has little influence. In MK DS each car has six parameters: speed, acceleration, weight, handling, slip and objects. They are not mere statistics, but give each kart its own identity, particular capabilities. Some manage to drift even on grass, some are faster, still others favor the arrival, once they come across a box, of a strong weapon. All can be customized with their own symbol to be drawn via the touch screen, in a space of 32x32 pixels. Better alone than badly accompanied.. maybe Mario Kart DS single player is undoubtedly much more full-bodied than usual, and ensures fun for any type of player. The main mode is, as usual, the grand prix, and it is also the one used to unlock most of the secrets. It is divided into engine capacities, which are three, 50, 100 and 150, and represent both the speed at which your cars will go and the difficulty of the races, therefore the skill of your opponents. Although the first two are simple as usual, the 150 is able to give a bit of a challenge even to the best riders, so it will take newbies a long time to complete all the cups, also considering that at the end of each competition you will be assigned an evaluation based on your times. There are thirty-two tracks in all, sixteen new and sixteen taken from the old episodes, all rebuilt with polygons in the essential elements. The new ones have a very high quality standard, as an average they are probably the best of any Mario Kart, although in terms of difficulty the Super Nintendo ones are still a step above. Some tracks, like the Flipper in Waluigi, have a very original structure, and are difficult to master even for the best riders. The other sixteen, considering the repertoire from which they were taken, could have been better chosen, especially those taken from Mario Kart 64. The absence of Super Mario Kart's Rainbow Road is distressing, while the choices made with the Super Circuit and Double circuits are excellent Dash. In addition to the grand prix, the battle is also playable in single, usually reserved for multiplayer. In this mode, players collide in an arena, trying to destroy each other using the weapons scattered throughout the setting. To signal the energy left to the runner there are three balloons, which you must keep up continuously by blowing on the microphone of the DS. There is also an alternative version of the battle which consists in trying to recover the only keepers scattered in the game area before the other competitors. Then there are the challenge, the time trial and the missions. The first is a sort of fully customizable friendly, from the duration of the competition to the quality of the runners controlled by the CPU. The time trial is the usual time trial, this time more accurate than usual: experts of this mode will know that previously each character, regardless of who it was, was granted two or three mushrooms to use during the journey. In Mario Kart DS, in order not to always choose the same kart, some cars are assigned three mushrooms, others only one, and it is up to the player to decide each time which is the best choice. The CPU ghosts, usually easy to overcome, are this time very fierce and hard to beat. The missions are the real novelty of the game, together with online. Indeed, very probably if there hadn't been online there wouldn't have been even the missions, given that, however well done, they are essentially a tutorial. The approximately fifty tests will guide beginners in learning the basic techniques, so as to allow them to play good multiplayer races. While they're also rated like Grands Prix, they're easier to complete, even with maximum points. A nice and fun addition, which will serve newbies more than expert players. The only flaw lies in the fact that the learning curve is not calibrated perfectly, given that from one mission to another, at a certain point, there is a clear leap in quality. The slopes Here is the list of Mario Kart DS circuits playable online: Eight Bend, Yoshi Falls, SpiSmack Palace, Luigi's Mansion, Smash Desert, Dolphin Town, DK's Peaks, Mario Circuit, Wario Stadium, Rainbow Track, SNES Mario Circuit 1, N64 Muu Muu Farm, GBA Peach Track, GCN Luigi Circuit, N64 Circuit Snowy, GCN Baby Park, N64 Cioccocanyon, SNES Cioccoisola 2, GBA Cloud Garden, GCN Yoshi Circuit. Offline-only ones are: Waluigi's Pinball Machine, Mushroom Hills, TicTac Track, Flying Fortress, Peach Gardens, Bowser's Castle, SNES Donut Plain, GBA Bowser's Castle 2, SNES Koopa Beach 2, GBA Luigi's Circuit, GCN Bridge of the Mushrooms, N64 Haunted Pier. Compete with the world The game, undoubtedly, gives its best in multiplayer. Offline is simply a bomb, LAN extended to eight players, battle, possibility to face the team grand prix, a real paradise. With a single cartridge, only a few circuits can be made and the ~guest~ will not be able to choose the character to play with, since he will automatically be assigned Shy Guy. In wireless offline it is just perfect. Online, on the other hand, has several limitations, unfortunately essential to avoid the classic problems deriving from online gaming. There are four competitors at most, and the weapons that can be used as a shield offline, for example the green shell, must be thrown. Furthermore, not all the tracks are usable on the net, those with external elements have been removed which, due to the lag, could create confusion among the players. Peach's Garden, for example, is full of 'chatters' that scour the track, so it would not have been appropriate to transfer it online without being sure of maintaining perfect synchronicity between the connections. These cuts are compensated by the fact that the network game is incredibly smooth, and the lag is very minimal, even non-existent if the two runners both have a good connection. The service, by contrast, is overly simplistic, and you can't communicate in any way with the other competitors. They are searched for by establishing certain conditions, for example we can search for elements of a similar value to ours or that come from our own continent. You can't directly choose who to play with, but thanks to the friends list, to be filled in by exchanging codes, you can limit yourself to competing with your acquaintances. There are a lot of people online and it takes just over a minute to create a game, a pity that everything works automatically and in some cases the match starts even if four participants have not been reached. The audiovisual sector is a small miracle. If you look closely, both the polygonal models and the textures are nothing exceptional, but thanks to the small size of the screens, the splendid light effects that the DS can generate and the perfect fluidity of Mario Kart, the overall impact is extremely pleasant. one of the best games for the Nintendo portable in this field too. The sound is nice as usual, but above all useful for noticing the arrival of some weapons a few seconds before they reach their destination, so as to attempt a countermove to neutralize them. Mario Kart DS is a game that has been in development for thirteen years, and it is inevitable that it has an incredibly powerful basic structure, tending towards perfection. Everything is masterfully crafted, surely among the most beautiful titles that one of the best development team on the planet has ever created. Mario Kart DS is potentially infinite, thanks to the new online mode but also to a deep driving system built with wisdom and experience. The game is permeated by a sense of completeness and compactness, it is pure rock. It could be said that it is the best Mario Kart in history, that it is the pinnacle of multiplayer, that no other racing game is on its level; one could say, but it would be boring. Just play it, you will understand everything by yourself. Pros Perfect in basics Smooth both offline and online Great track design Masterful control system Full of references to the entire Mario story Little graphic miracle Cons Hands hurt after an hour of drifting Not all tracks playable online Overly simple online service Missions abruptly change difficulty It is said that the ability to synthesize is a rare gift, reserved for a select few. Evidently among these chosen ones there is a certain Hideki Konno, capable of summarizing thirteen years of history, his history, that of Mario Kart in a single game. The path started in 1992, continued and carried forward on four Nintendo consoles, through various experiments and metamorphoses, flows today, November 2005, into a single, tiny cartridge: Mario Kart DS.
