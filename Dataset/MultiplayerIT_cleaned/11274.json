{"name": "Off Road - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/off-road-recensione_a.html", "text": "If it is true that to err is human and to persevere is diabolical, the Ford Racing series certainly has some connection with the lord of the Underworld: the franchise made its debut in 2001 on the PlayStation, since then collecting an unstoppable sequence of failures characterized by products that at best they could be considered mediocre. A fact that evidently did not scare the developers of Razorworks, who with this Off Road even abandon the straight path of the asphalt to launch themselves onto dirt roads, puddles and mud. Let's get our wheels dirty For the occasion, Ford wanted to drag its ~colleague~ Land Rover into the mud with it (it is appropriate to say it): the two historic car manufacturers therefore lend to the title the beauty of 18 licensed vehicles, belonging to the categories of trucks, 4x4s and SUVs. The user therefore has the opportunity to put himself in command of one of the aforementioned beasts and compete within 12 different tracks whose settings range from canyons to glaciers, passing through forests and mountain roads. These few lines are enough to already begin to perceive a very strong feeling of deja-vu, which the Razorworks title shows no sign of countering: every single element, from the range of modes available to the workmanship of the various menus, has already been seen hundreds of times in as many racing games, and almost always with far better results than those achieved by the Off Road here. The feeling is that of being faced with a budget product dating back a few years ago Let's get our wheels dirty The sensation is in fact that of being faced with a budget product dating back a few years ago, such is the level of approximation with which the game was made. Obviously starting from the graphics sector, whose flatness can already be seen from the introductory screens and is fully exposed when you get behind the wheel. Off Road is a multiplatform based on PlayStation 2, and it shows: the cosmetics are the most old-gen you can conceive, made up of bare and not very detailed scenarios, cars with sketchy polygonal models and practically non-existent environmental effects. In the merciless picture before us, that of the cars is by far the most disconcerting aspect: the various off-road vehicles seem more like toys than authentic four-wheelers, so much are they improbable in their total lack of detail. It is not necessary to make high-sounding comparisons to give the measure of how primitive Off Road is in this respect, especially when one considers that the Empire product lacks elementary factors such as decent physical routines and environmental effects, practically completely absent. From the pan to the grill Not that things are better from a gameplay point of view, on the contrary: Off Road can't even decide whether to take the road of the arcade or that of the simulation, sadly crashing into the wall that divides them. The look & feel of the game would initially seem based on a realistic approach, but the reality is that of a simply badly structured racing game. The sore points begin with the control system, timidly inspired by that of Excite Trucks: the steering is in fact managed by the rotary movement of the Remote (to be held in a horizontal position) but the results are bad, given that the vehicles have an agility comparable to that of an anvil. Not even the track design is saved, with rather anonymous routes equipped with alleged shortcuts which more often than not turn out to be real traps. Then the AI of the opponents is irritating, capable of tailing the user throughout the race only to mock him at the last corner. Off Road is a product that literally leaks everywhere From the pan to the grill But the worst is certainly represented by the collision system: the developers have well thought of inserting a damage indicator, which fills up in conjunction with accidents (causing a drop in performance) and which can be restored by special bonuses on the track. It is a pity that first of all the bodies are not affected in the least by the blows received, and secondly that the extent of the collisions makes a mockery of the most elementary physical laws: and therefore a head-on at 120 km/h against a rock wall causes minimal damage, while a prolonged swipe with an opposing car (this much more frequent event) can easily take away half of the aforementioned indicator. In short, it is clear that Off Road is a product that literally leaks everywhere, as if that were not enough, also penalized by an extremely poor selection of modes: a boring Carrer Mode and the classic Quick Race and Multiplayer via split screen are in fact the only possibilities offered to the player. Although, given the results, maybe it's for the best.... Comment Off Road is a low-demand racing game despite the budget price, which has the only virtue of owning the Ford and Land Rover licenses. Technically anachronistic, devoid of personality and laughable from a gameplay point of view, the Razorworks title is one that simply should be left on the shelf.
