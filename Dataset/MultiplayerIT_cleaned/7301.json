{"name": "Souldiers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/souldiers-recensione.html", "text": "The metroidvania genre has long since resurrected and, as often happens, it is due to the indie world. In recent years, more and more top-notch games have been released and the public has responded by putting their money on the plate. This has prompted more and more independent teams to focus on this genre. The direct consequence is that the market is now full of proposals and, with a rather high average quality, proposing a valid game may no longer be enough to emerge: the goal can only be excellence. This is precisely the problem with Souldiers, the new Metroidvania from Retro Forge. The team, in their first field test, has built a solid game, which however fails to impress, in almost every respect. It's a bit anticlimactic to reveal it immediately, but in our review of Souldiers we will explain why we have come to this conclusion. Terragaya Terragaya is the setting for Souldiers Souldiers is set in Terragaya, a sort of limbo between life and death, which is accessed thanks to the Valkyrie, taken directly from Norse mythology. Our character is a generic soldier who, in the real world, was trapped under a landslide together with his fellow soldiers. With the start of the adventure, we will be able to choose our class, which will remain fixed throughout the game. We have the classic soldier with a sword and shield, a ranger with a bow and a wizard with a stirrup. The difference is not only linked to the weapon, but also and above all to the skills. Each class has its own skill tree and as you level up, you can unlock them, gaining new abilities and attacks. Each class pushes you to fight and approach the levels differently. Class management is one of the best components of Souldiers and for this reason it's sad that two out of three are blocked. The idea, we believe, is to entice replayability, but it would have been nice to be able to change them at fixed points, to enjoy all the gameplay ideas and be able to adapt to the various clashes with the most comfortable class from situation to situation. Souldiers classes This would also have helped reduce some difficulty spikes. Souldiers, even on minimal difficulty, is not a rosy game. The bosses, in particular, can destroy the player in a few hits and it will be necessary to spend some time studying their moves before achieving victory. The differences between the various fights are pleasant, even if on average the number of moves is limited. As for common enemies, there are plenty of them, but many are stylistically generic and uninspired. This criticism can be extended to the entire artistic sector of Souldiers. Don't get us wrong, there is great care in what is made by Retro Forge. The environments are filled with detail, both foreground and background, with moving and destructible elements that bring each area to life. The problem is that almost everything seems already seen, with a pixel art that doesn't mind, but never manages to impress. Design Souldiers will pit us against classic creatures At least, the environments are cured in terms of design. As mentioned, Souldiers is a metroidvania. Don't expect one huge map that connects in dozens of places, more a series of areas with various internal passages, backtracking and secrets. You have to go back and forth in the great little world of Souldiers, looking for everything that is hidden around, re-exploring each area several times to see what you missed and to complete side missions. There is obviously no shortage of various types of power-ups necessary to interact with the game world and create new passages, including elemental orbs that will also allow us to attack the weaknesses of the enemies. All this, however, is not particularly original and each section will know a bit of what has already been seen and we will not be too surprised by the secrets hidden by the exploration. Souldiers doesn't make any real mistakes and is always a solid game, but it always lacks that extra spark. Of course, there are some objective limits. The control system is not always very comfortable, but above all we suggest players to pay attention to the saving system. In each dungeon there are save points that allow you to heal yourself, make enemies respawn and secure your progress. It is advisable to exploit them profusely because with each death you lose everything you have done: experience points, map exploration, collected objects, passed key moments. Nothing remains and you have to go back to the last save; if you turn the wrong corner and advance into an area with a powerful enemy or trap when you're not prepared, that's it. There are some autosaves, but that's itonly suitable for patches. More ~experienced~ players may not be concerned, but younger players used to more forgiving save systems may risk running into some frustration having to redo certain steps over and over, feeling like they've just wasted time . Each class of Souldiers has its own skill branch Without making any kind of spoiler, we point out that even the plot is certainly not the most surprising and it is not the main reason why you should approach Souldiers. Finally, we specify that the game is not translated into Italian: there is no shortage of dialogue, so take that into account.", "date": "2022-06-06", "grade": "7.5"}
