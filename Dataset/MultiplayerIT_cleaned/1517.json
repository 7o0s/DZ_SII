{"name": "Dragon's Lair 3D - Return to the Lair", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragons-lair-3d-return-to-the-lair.html", "text": "Once upon a time Nothing new on the horizon: a kidnapped princess, a wizard - Mordroc - cruel and fearsome, an immense castle full of enemies and pitfalls, a fearless hero - Dirk - who throws himself headlong into the clutches of danger at the cry of help of his beloved, beautiful and helpless - Daphne. Even for those who have never played the original Laser Game, the plot that will act as a Background to DL3D will immediately feel old and stale. The clichs are all there, the clichs as well. After all, it is true that no one expected twists, articulated dialogues and a deep narrative plot. Furthermore, by recycling the same canvas of the first - legendary - ~Dragon's Lair~, the designers were able to tickle the deepest strings of the romantic soul of all long-standing players by proposing settings and situations certainly dear to the most. We will soon have proof of this with our ~triumphant~ entry into the mythical castle: the fearsome sprawling monster is still there watching over the drawbridge... Ah, the memories. In short, the most interesting story will certainly be the one told by the special inserts supplied with the actual game (as a DVD). We are talking about three different films, unfortunately in English and not subtitled, which through interviews and various insights will reveal new details and anecdotes on the development of the original title programmed more than twenty years ago now. Definitely interesting. Cloak and sword We had to save a princess remember? To achieve our goal we will therefore be called upon to guide the versatile Dirk through dozens of rooms full of enemies and pitfalls of the most disparate conceptions. We go from the normal situations to be solved in full 90s two-dimensional platform style, with jumps sometimes of millimeter precision (sometimes almost frustrating) and infinitesimal game rhythm, to the more advanced, but still rather inflated ones, which will see us grappling with levers, buttons and various combinations. During our wanderings we will be supported by the persuasive voice of our Daphne (the voices are in the original language, however all the text, subtitles included, has been localized in Italian) who, in addition to giving us some useful advice more than once, will explain how to exploit the different magical artifacts that we will earn as we progress throughout the game. Obviously, almost needless to say, between a precipice to be overcome like an unusual medieval Tarzan through the skilful use of ropes hanging from the ceiling and a magical room infested with a horde of animated objects and crazy murders, every now and then we will have to use our trusty sword. Unfortunately the fights turn out to be the weakest part of the entire production: the few moves available to us and the lack of spectacularity of the same will soon bore us. Even the introduction of ~special moves~ or the ranged attack with the crossbow fails to improve the fortunes that much. Despite this, the skilful mixing of puzzle sections and other combat sections still manages to maintain a fairly enjoyable pace of play. My kingdom for a cell It is useless to go around too much: the most characteristic and peculiar element of this DL3D certainly lies in the use of Cell Shading. For those few who still don't know it, let's remember that Cell Shading is a graphic style that allows, while using a three-dimensional graphics engine, to transmit to the gamer a visual feeling very similar (if not identical) to that of a normal cartoon. The solid pastel colors without shading, the hard and decisive edges: looking at the images on these same pages you will have immediate feedback on what has just been explained. First used successfully by console titles such as Jet Set Radio, the Cell Shading technique has among its undeniable advantages the fact of guaranteeing a personal and pleasant visual impact even with a low number of polygons and, therefore, with graphics engines that are not too greedy of resources. With these premises, in a market where ~But 'ndo go if you don't have the tredd engine?~, it was practically obvious that the new chapter of a game based on the Dragon's Lair universe should exploit this graphic system: and the results can be considered excellent. The levels of XIII - also from UbiSoft - will not be reached, but it is true that turning a blind eye to the intrinsic poverty of many game environments after a few hours of play will really seem to be playing inside a cartoon. The same, sadfamous (for the finances of the players of the time at least) death scene, although this time made with the three-dimensional graphics engine, it is practically identical to the two-dimensional sequence used in the original cartoon. Of course, we are far from the graphic marvels of latest generation titles - and not only - such as Unreal 2 or Max Payne 2 but it is also true that if the technicalities are not everything, DL3D manages to present a graphic aspect that manages to distinguish itself from the mass. The sound aspect, on the other hand, remains almost anonymous but without obvious flaws. Some catchy but in the long run decidedly monotonous music and a series of sound effects also directly inspired (and perhaps even taken up) by the first Dragon's Lair will still manage not to make us lower the volume of our audio subsystem to turn on the home stereo. Comment Let's face it, we are not dealing with a masterpiece; nor anything close to it. Yet this ~Dragon's Liar 3D~ manages to entertain and certainly not by virtue of its noble pedigree. Audiographically it doesn't make us cry out for a miracle (indeed) but, I repeat it umpteenth, the particular graphic style adopted manages to make up for this insufficiency very well and to justify the lack of visually spectacular but emotionally empty technicalities. The mix between puzzles and fights, then, is overall well calibrated. Too bad that the fights soon turn out to be quite monotonous and that sometimes the camera system does not prove to be exactly ~user friendly~. The puzzles, on the other hand, are most of the time well thought out and never too frustrating, the same control system with rare exceptions (for example when you are inexplicably unable to direct the character in the right direction or when the game view is suddenly changed without no notice of any kind) appears simple and immediate. An unpretentious title which, despite not boasting any noteworthy acute notes, nevertheless manages to entertain, even if taken in small doses and without hours of training. And this, after all, is no small thing. Pros: The return of a legend, complete with ~special inserts~ Personal and successful graphics Minimal hardware requirements Cons: Not very deep gameplay Not very exciting fights Back to a legend After more than twenty years since the release of the original title and almost a year after its debut on the American market, ~Dragon's Lair 3D~ finally arrives on our shelves. Produced under the supervision of Don Bluth himself and developed by Dragonstone Software, this new UbiSoft title seeks to exploit one of the most renowned brands in the world of videogame entertainment with proven gameplay and a decidedly underused graphic style, especially in the PC environment . So if at first glance DL3D could make someone turn up their noses, perhaps for fear of finding themselves faced with a clever commercial operation in full ~nostalgia action~ style, we can tell you right now that this title still tries to find its own videogame identity and personality in the boundless world of Arcade Adventure with three-dimensional graphics. Will he have succeeded? Before answering, let's proceed in order and start with the story: A long, long time ago in a happy kingdom", "date": "2003-10-27", "grade": null}
