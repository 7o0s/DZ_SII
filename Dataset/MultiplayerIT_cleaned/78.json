Sonic Rivals is a praise to pure and raw speed, racing is the keystone on which the whole game structure is based and around which a decidedly accessory story and a series of extra modes have been built that can extend the gaming experience. This chapter for PSP sees the return of Dr. Eggman among the villains, engaged once again in the extreme and Machiavellian attempt to conquer the world using a special machine capable of transforming people into playing cards and subsequently into pure energy. Sonic, Knuckles, Shadow and the newcomer Silver will stand against this menace, covering the paths that make up the game levels at mach5 speed; the word ~Rivals~ in the title of the game refers to the rivalry between the four heroes, perpetually running against each other to reach the finish line before the others. Sonic Rivals is a tribute to pure speed Speed of Light The main mode of the game is represented by the story mode: it will be up to the player to select a character among the four present and start competing against one of the other three along crazy courses that seem to belong more to the mind of a roller coaster creator than anything else. Each macro setting will be made up of three acts, the third of which is dedicated to the battle against the boss on duty. In addition to the story mode, it will be possible to compete in particular championships made up of three races or retrace the game levels by completing some specific challenges, more or less difficult depending on the level selected. The multiplayer section concludes the count of playable modes, which is none other than the single player with the participation of a human player instead of the CPU. Story, challenge, championship and multiplayer will be equally useful for obtaining special cards that can unlock new clothes for the four speedsters. Digital roller coaster Going into the details of the race, a level stands on average lasting about 3 minutes, within which the two challengers will run wildly along paths that seem to have come out of Escher's mind due to the sheer complexity and architectural fantasy. To meet the players and not block the gaming experience in the time it takes to assimilate the commands, Blackbone has decided to set the races in totally 3D worlds, albeit governed by exquisitely two-dimensional logics: the player will not need to know anything else than pressing ~right~ you will always go forward (regardless of the view) and throwing yourself to the left you will go along the road in the opposite direction to the finish line. The paths seem to have come out of Escher's mind due to the sheer complexity and architectural fantasy Digital roller coaster The only aim of the race is to reach the finish line in first position and to do this each player will have a whole series of ~weapons~ useful to slow down the opponent and make him slide back. Each character will have a particular special move on his side capable of damaging the opponent: Sonic will be able to perform a sort of move halfway between a slide and a sprint, Silver will be able to use his ESP powers and lock the opponent in place and Knuckles will beat fists as usual. In addition to the personal qualities of each porcupine (or echidna) players will be able to collect a whole series of weapons along the way with both defensive and offensive characteristics: the game will intelligently recognize the player's position and based on this he will decide whether to use the bonus in order to protect him (if in first position) or to attack the opponent (if in second and last position). However, one of the most appreciable elements remains the graphic aspect that the developers have created for the game: colorful settings, well-finished and varied level design, and cinematic shots. One of the few negative aspects in all of this is represented by the camera which, while not losing a single step of the entire race, is not always up to the speed of the game, often framing the game in too limited a way to be able to understand in time the possible presence of jumps, enemies or whatever. However appreciable the game structure is, on balance Sonic Rivals remains an incomplete and highly repetitive product: if the story mode could alone deserve an excellent mark, it is the presence of the other modes (almost identical to each other) to lower the voverall evaluation. However, Blackbone's attempt remains interesting, especially taking into account that the Canadians came from the mediocre Death Jr. The cinematic cut and the action at supersonic speed make a product attractive that with a little more care and desire to insert content could have been be even better. Pros: As frenetic and fast as in its best days Visually appealing Fits the PSP specs perfectly Cons: Camera not always perfect Modes are too similar to each other Panta rei, everything flows. The concept expressed by these two simple Latin words are valid for nature, man and his history, and in the same way for video games. Let's take the example of Sonic: in the 90s the (almost) undisputed king of platformers with his breath of novelty and his excellent dose of speed. Times have changed, and as absurd as Sonic is, he hasn't always been fast enough to run after him; the releases on the previous generations of consoles and on the current ones have been many and in different solutions: racing games, platforms, adventures, Sonic Team and SEGA have really tried everything to be able to bring the saga of the blue hedgehog back to the fore, without getting particular results. The story however is sometimes bizarre, and confirms the unwritten rule that sometimes the most recognizable things need to be looked at from another angle to be appreciated again. This is Blackbone's experiment with Sonic Rivals on PSP, Canadians commissioned by SEGA to make the green of the Green Hills shine once again.", "date": "2007-02-20", "grade": null}
