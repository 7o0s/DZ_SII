In the Nineties, however, real-time strategy games were a damned serious thing... From Dune II to Command & Conquer onwards, RTSs exploded and matured in just a few years, reaching the peak of popularity thanks to Blizzard - with Warcraft before and Starcraft after - but also thanks to the beautiful and revolutionary Age of Empires of 1997 and even more its immortal sequel. The Age of Empires introduced several interesting dynamics to RTS and a historical context that appealed to both young and more mature strategy enthusiasts, even many who had never gone beyond the massive turnarounds of Civilization before nor had any intention of to do it. Age of Empires II is a game that achieved the status of an enduring classic very early on, and as soon as the developers tried to change its formula, the public turned away from it: Age of Empires III was a spectacular flop that dragged itself to its grave all plans related to a fourth and final game in the series, which has already been planned for some time. To resurrect the franchise, Microsoft turned to the veterans of Relic Entertainment. With masterpieces such as Homeworld, Company of Heroes and Dawn of War to its credit, Canadian Relic is undoubtedly a first-rate choice, if not the best possible choice, even if you get to work on such a prestigious name and after so long time, it would not be easy for anyone. After devouring Age of Empires 4 we can say that Relic has succeeded. Hell did she succeed! A race against time The beauty of Age of Empires is also its speed: you have to explore, collect, organize, build, defend and attack all at the same time. Also for this reason, sometimes the matches are competitions of nerves rather than strategy Age of Empires IV immediately turned out to be an extraordinary product made with a lot of heart and intelligence. Not reinventing the wheel, rather pretending that Age of Empires III never existed, the new game returns to the rhythms and ideas of the second chapter, the most loved and successful one. The game system, net of some differences and novelties, is therefore always the same: a settlement is set up and the surrounding resources are exploited to create, build, arm and technologically advance one's faction, up to overpowering the opponent or opponents present. Amazon offer Age of Empires IV Standard | Windows 10 - Download Code 59.99 See Offer No surprises among the resources: wood, food, stone and gold. Forests and mines deplete over time, as do many of the food sources, but not agricultural plots which after being built need only one inhabitant and no further concern. During the game, when we have accumulated sufficient resources, we will be able and will have to advance in the four technological ages (High Middle Ages, Feudal Age, Age of Castles and Imperial Age): this is because with each passage we will not only have access to new units, buildings and improvements, but for the first time in the series we will also have to decide which of the two proposed special buildings to build, each with its own unique characteristics. Special buildings Of the two buildings that will be offered to us at each technological advance, we will be able to choose and build only one. If this is destroyed, it will be lost forever along with its bonuses There are seven special buildings for each civilization: they will be offered to us in pairs of two in conjunction with each of the three possible technological leaps, the last leap is the one that will allow us to build the only wonder available for each faction. The marvel does not give bonuses, it has no special functions, but once built it allows access to one of the possible conditions for winning the game. This is a novelty that we immediately appreciated because it allows us to consistently modify what we could define as the ~build~ of our civilization. Choosing whether to build a special building that maximizes trade income rather than one that accelerates archer recruitment can have big repercussions in both the short and long term, you may prefer one over the other also based on the map that we will find ourselves in front of, in order to better adapt to any shortcomings and abundances, as well as to the tactics of the adversary. However, not all of these special buildings have a net utility, or at least an interesting one at first sight; here a little imagination is missing, but it is possible that in the future things will not change or even the choices will multiply. I challenge you! One of the biggest leaps forward in Age of Empires IV rCompared to the past chapters it is in the maps, finally varied and full of gradients to be exploited with a strategic flair Of course it's too early to understand how the meta-game will behave in multiplayer games, how everything will be balanced along the way, what extreme tactics the most skilled players will invent. In short, it is difficult to understand how Age of Empires IV will really behave in a competitive context, where it must necessarily shine if it really wants to stand up to its illustrious predecessor. The affinities with Age of Empires II once again reassure, as indeed the double dozen matches that we managed to fight online. We have tried all the civilizations, really deepening only the British and the Russians, diversified the tactics as much as possible and the same did our adversaries who, however, like us, were still in an exploratory phase, stunned by the news and without the malice that they will then pour out when they are ranked matches are finally available (we will have to wait for the first update). How do you win? In this mission, the newly conquered small town prepares for another attack by the Danes who, as you can see from the image, can be attacked in turn or bribed with gold, so as not to weaken the army in view of the battle more important Each match presented its unique challenges, we survived sudden invasions and managed to break through the enemy walls in a very long battle where both of us had practically run out of resources, we hid our archers in the forest for exciting and decisive ambushes, we were massacred in ten minutes on the clock and won and lost by the skin of the cuff several times. We had a lot of fun, finally putting aside the more modern ~moba~ to return to a more personal and perhaps even more honorable challenge. The only thing that annoyed us a little is the specularity of the troops of the eight civilizations present, where we would have liked a greater visual and strategic asymmetry. In Age of Empires IV you can win in four different ways: by tearing apart each opponent's unit and building, by destroying the historical places controlled by the enemy, by conquering all the sacred places on the map and by building your own wonder and subsequently destroying that of the others. Of course, during the creation of the game it is possible to choose which victory conditions to activate and on which type of map to play, such as its size, the number of players, the composition of the teams and so on. British, French, Mongolian and Russian For the first time in the history of Age of Empires it will be possible to place units on stone walls to defend our fiefdoms There are also those who love Age of Empires for its unforgettable campaigns. From this point of view, no doubt: with Age of Empires IV, Relic has done a crazy job, building exceptional epics with an innovative structure, and able to offer many variations on the theme. Veterans know that usually the series offers many different campaigns, one for each civilization included, but this time very different choices have been made and despite the eight civilizations present, the campaigns are only four, but much longer and more surprising than they will be able to never be those of past games. Take for example the first campaign with the English, this begins in 1066 in Hasting and ends a century and a half later in 1217 in Lincoln. The campaigns dedicated to the French, the Mongols and the Russian one called The Rise of Moscow have the same breadth and which presents at least a couple of missions destined to remain impressed for days. I disclose hard A still image of one of the introductory documents: on the real shooting of the place where we will go to fight, the marching soldiers are superimposed. Suggestive! In the game there are also other extra documentaries, on falconry for example, on the strengths and weaknesses of the crossbow, on how to make a chain mail This structure follows hand in hand a whole series of high quality documentaries that will introduce each mission with interesting historical notes and real and high definition footage of the places we will go to battle, to which the medieval troops in action will be superimposed with an explicit result and suggestive. Age of Empires IV missions are key moments in a wide-ranging historical and geographical cycle, some are consecutive, others make more important time jumps. All or almost all offer unique elements that keep attention high and the desire to see what the game will invent next. In the Norman countryside you start with a handful of heroes and you break through the first fences, then you besiege a castle impenetrable at first sight, two missesions later we are called to guerrilla warfare in the woods, to steal gold from enemy villages to convince the other nobles to supply us with troops for the final assault, which will go better if in the meantime we weaken the reinforcements arriving from the south. Small-range battles and exciting pitched clashes, exhausting feudal resistances and counterattacks of cavalry and arrows, strategic choices and tactical compromises amidst the shouts of the captains and the trumpets of the non-commissioned officers, among the waves of the sea, above the mountains to spy on the wars of others, waiting the opportune moment to make the sword count, ours this time. All beautiful, never really easy or obvious, with some missions that will require several attempts to be mastered as required, as is necessary to once again snatch victory from the opponent. Build, attack, fold Woods and rivers are an excellent natural border, but be careful of the former because by collecting wood they could soon end up leaving you with an uncovered side Each mission is a different situation, if not even reversed from the previous one. And as in past games, different historical characters will appear here too, some with special abilities. Their presence, however, remains relegated to one or two missions, unlike Age of Empires II where many of them were absolute protagonists of certain stories. We don't tell you the precise figure because not everyone wants to know the numbers, but the missions present in Age of Empires IV at launch are numerically identical to what Age of Empires II offered at its debut. Between the tutorials and the campaign missions, therefore not counting all the games you will play against the AI and any human challengers, you will easily have more than fifty hours of gameplay, even more if you raise the difficulty. The campaign can be tackled on easy, intermediate and hard difficulty, then there is the story difficulty that allows you to enjoy the game and documentaries without suffering the bitterness of defeat. Historical sobs Which civilizations will be added next? And which of them will new and inevitable campaigns be dedicated to? First of all, we are sorry that there are no classifieds at the launch but after all it is not even that bad to get carried away a little, before starting to think about pure competition. Missing at launch will be Seasonal Ranked, but regular Ranked will normally be present. While one thing that half satisfied us is the characterization of the units which are not always easy to distinguish from each other on the battlefield, the fault of often laughable graphic differences which with the minimum zoom become practically non-existent. There are other readability issues to work through, for example it's never really clear whether a troop is hidden by vegetation or not, and other inelegant visual fixes. The ballistics of archers and siege machinery should be reviewed, which does not provide a percentage of missed hits that could make certain clashes less predictable. Finally, civilizations have different characteristics, they are designed to be played with different approaches, but the troops at their disposal do not have unique variants, except in some specific cases, and this leads to a too conservative symmetry that not everyone, rightly , they will appreciate. Special events One king before the other What we liked about Age of Empires IV is much more than what didn't convince us. The countryside is powerful and we have already told you about it; the new maps full of ups and downs, valleys, woods, crevices, bottlenecks, rivers, fords, hills and mountains then guarantee a continuous, procedurally infinite, graphic and strategic show. Even the new naval battles, slower and more reasoned than in the past, they unexpectedly convinced. In war, then, we found this mix of macro and micro unit management extremely satisfying, where every little nuance in the positioning of the individual soldier can have extreme consequences, if you naturally have enough guts and cold blood to waste time while the generals shout orders , cannonballs whiz in the air and a hundred fully armed knights knock menacingly on your door. Peculiar, possibly decisive, but not easy to use religious units, with their ability to exploit any relics with which sooner or later we will come across, the importance and limits of the healing capabilities of some of them that we still have to fully understand . In general all new is good new in Age of Empires IV. We were also satisfied with the graphics on which we had several doubts: it is designed to be flashy, but not so heavy, thus avoiding cutting out the less performing computers. The sector is definitely up to par", "date": "2021-10-25", "grade": "9.0"}
