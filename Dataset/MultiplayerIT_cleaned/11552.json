{"name": "Dynamite Fishing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dynamite-fishing.html", "text": "The protagonist of Dynamite Fishing has no ethical problems: he has to bring home a certain amount of money every day, to pay the bills and to take his girlfriend out, so he goes around in a boat and throws sticks of dynamite into the water for the fish to go afloat by themselves, after which it collects them. Every time he goes out to sea he has to total a certain amount, or there will be trouble. It is clear that there are fish that are worth more and fish that are worth less, moreover the equipment has its cost and you have to find the right balance between outputs and incomes... There are three game modes: story, freestyle fishing and aquarium. The last two are respectively a time attack and a sort of ~contemplative~ mode, in which it is possible to observe the swimming fish and blow them up if necessary, to move on to another subject. The story represents the most important choice: after a short but complete tutorial on how to steer the boat, launch the explosives and shoot the birds (yes, our hero doesn't miss anything...), we will find ourselves with a first list of bills to pay and a sum to raise to do it. So we will pass by two trusted shops (one that sells weapons and the other that sells upgrades for the boat) and then move on to the real action. The trajectory of the canisters varies according to the power of the cast, which can be determined by holding down button 5 for a longer or shorter time, but usually it is the ~gusts~ that produce the best results, especially when there are many fish below us. After contact with an explosion, the fish will rise to the surface and we will have to go over them with the boat to collect them: an indicator at the top of the screen lets us know how full our hold is, and at the same time how much money we have collected. Of course we can't just sit around fishing all the time, because there's a limit to where we'll have to be done, whatever the results. Once an internship is finished, the sums are drawn up to understand whether we have exceeded the necessary figure or not: if we have not succeeded, we will have to repeat the level all over again; vice versa, we will not only be able to access the next session but also evaluate the purchase of new weapons or upgrades for the boat. There's a little bit of everything: explosives that explode on contact or remotely controlled, very special decoys, stabilizers for the boat, more powerful engines or completely new vehicles. All the sprites are drawn with an angular and demented style, somewhat reminiscent of the LucasArts adventures. The animation is kept to a minimum, but there are many moving elements on the screen (the boat, the fish, the birds) and there is no stuttering. The use of colors is always excellent, and scrolling remains quite fluid at all times. As far as the sound is concerned, it is possible to choose whether to activate the music or the effects: the former is catchy and accompanies the action without disturbing, the latter are really excellent but have the (not negligible) defect of causing heavy slowdowns when they are played . The control system is very simple and immediate, but the response to inputs is not always immediate, and consequently episodes of frustration can occur. PRO Pretty funny A large number of upgrades Graphic style guessed AGAINST Fairly limited action Response to commands not always immediate Some problems with sound effects", "date": "2008-03-19", "grade": "S.V."}
