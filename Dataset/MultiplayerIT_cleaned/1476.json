{"name": "Fire Department", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fire-department.html", "text": "But let's play Pressing the play button from the main menu, we are faced with a rigid structure of the missions. In practice we will have to face them one after the other with increasing difficulty. The first is a tutorial that although it is possible to skip it, it is advisable to face it. You will be taught not only the basic movements, but also the use of the various vehicles at your disposal, so that you can take full advantage of them during the actual game. For each mission, a difficulty level can be selected from the three available (easy, medium and difficult). At this point, a detailed presentation of the same will start, complete with animations and speech, after which the actual loading of the map will take place, actually quite long. But let's play At this point we get to the heart of the game: depending on the missions you will find yourself having to manage a different number of firefighters, specialists, technical managers and paramedics, as well as an also variable number of vehicles. As already mentioned, each class will have a well-defined role during the mission. Furthermore, as you make your way through the flames, you will be communicated, through windows, of secondary objectives which, if completed, will increase your final score. For example, you will have to save a particular character or protect and recover important documents, or even make sure that the flames do not destroy certain machinery, for example in an industry. To bring your team to success, you will need not only a certain familiarity with the commands, but also the speed in imparting them. The flames in fact extend quickly, and dynamically, so, as in reality, you will have to constantly keep an apparently ~healed~ area under control, in order to avoid the flare-up of new flames. Technically... The game is very pleasing to the eye. The graphics are detailed and clean, while special effects such as explosions are rendered in an exemplary way. The maps are also, as you continue, more and more extensive, which however has sometimes created some problems in the management of the men scattered around it. In fact, in many cases the buildings will have several floors, which will force you into continuous and acrobatic changes of shots in order to always have the situation under control. In any case, the shots are controlled via the mouse, so with a little practice it won't be that difficult to manage them. A somewhat annoying flaw is the zoom level. Nothing to say about the maximum magnification, but it would have been more convenient to have a greater distance than that made available by the minimum level, this in order to have more global control of the map and avoid the continuous framing changes mentioned above. Also, sometimes you feel a general slowness in the firefighters' movementsbut why don't they ever run? This often results in a failure of the goal that perhaps should have been completed as soon as possible. The sound is essential but very atmospheric. There will be no soundtrack during the actual game. Instead, we will be accompanied by the ~noise~ of the fire and that of the water jets (rendered among other things with really well done particle effects), as well as by the voices of the firefighters who will obey your orders. Tested on an AthlonXP 1900+ with GeForce Ti 4200 it never gave fluidity problems at the resolution of 1024*768 with a color depth of 32 bit. With a gigahertz processor and up and a 32 Mb graphics card, everything should go smoothly as long as you make some compromises with the graphics Conclusion A nice surprise this Fire Department. Fun and not frustrating, with a well-calibrated level of difficulty and graphics that won't win the Oscar for innovation but that certainly make you look at them pleasantly. Lovers of the genre should not let it get away, while all the others should certainly give it a look to evaluate a possible purchase. Pros: 34 missions fire and water effects well done collaboration of the Italian VdF! Cons: lacks multiplayer some maps are confusing slow movement of firefighters When I grow up I'll be a firefighter! Fire Department, by Montecristo Multimedia and produced by Ubisoft, is a real-time strategy game, in which you will be given the opportunity to take on the role of a team of intrepid Firefighters from barracks 615. During the missions, you will be assigned various tasks, and for once your primary objective will not be to kill, but to save lives. The game in question makes use, among other things, of the collaboration of the VdF italiani, which can only increase its simulation goodness as regards the techniques of extinguishing fires and rescuing the victims. Once the game has been installed on the Hard Disk, and the executable has been launched, what appears before us is a classic menu with the various items among which ~Play~ obviously stands out. Irresistiblebut I hold back and after a look at the graphic settings (the supported resolutions range from a modest 800*600*16 to a more luxuriant 1280*960*32) the mouse rests on the wording barracks. It was important to access this section for the purposes of the game, as the classes of vehicles and men that we will then have to use during the missions are explained in detail. For example, it is essential to know how to distinguish a simple firefighter (who puts out the flames and breaks down a few doors) from a specialist (who can disable more complex devices or, depending on the case, reach points inaccessible to others by means of harpoons). The distinction between the means is also important: it is necessary to know that by means of a ladder truck it is possible to reach the highest floors of the buildings, but this will not be able to supply the individual firefighters with water in case they need it (the their reserve is in fact limited and they will have to go to a tanker from time to time to fill the individual tanks).", "date": "2003-11-21", "grade": null}
