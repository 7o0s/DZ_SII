{"name": "FIFA 07", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-07_b.html", "text": "New year, old Fifa? At the beginning of the review we defined Fifa as a periodic update of football according to EA. This can be interpreted as a criticism, but it is first of all an observation, which among other things concerns, more or less, almost all sports series. Let me be clear: no one expects annual revolutions of tested mechanics, of winning gameplay. Titles such as PES or Madden rest on solid foundations by now consolidated, and on a feeling with the player that has settled over the years. In short, an asset to be kept. Games like these live on filings and adjustments on an annual basis: a choice acceptable to some, even desirable for others. But does this apply to a relatively young title like Fifa DS? Is the game structure already so mature and perfected as to advise against a deeper revision? According to EA yes, and therefore Fifa07 does not risk anything more than its predecessors did, but a few tweaks here and there still allow it. The menus are the same as always, so those familiar with the series will not struggle to extricate themselves from the numerous options and settings of the game. Compared to the Fifa World Cup, the various national championships with their respective club teams are back, and we are delighted about it. By selecting one of these teams, it is possible to embark on a career as a manager, a method that is more in-depth and richer in this edition. The summer storm that has upset Italian football does not seem to have claimed any victims in Fifa; Juventus is in fact included under the list of Italian Serie A teams. The opportunity to get hold of a historic copy of Fifa fades away, some Nerazzurri will think with a grin. Once on the field, one can only breathe a sigh of relief noting the regained fluidity of the game, a sore point from the previous episode. First kicks at the ball and the sensation of having a sort of heated soup in your hands is immediately clear, albeit enriched with some appreciable ingredients. All things considered, playing Fifa07 is fun, as long as you turn a blind eye to some approximations and to the sometimes questionable behavior of the players on the pitch. The Achilles heel of the title, from this point of view, are the team movements, rather than the individual ones. It can happen on more than one occasion to surprise the pair of inexplicably tall, or excessively wide, and consequently vulnerable central defenders. The same goes for the goalkeeper controlled by the cpu who, to face the wingers who push themselves towards the back to cross, prefers to leave the posts unattended and throw himself at the feet of the wingers... a maneuver that would enrage the most seraphic of coaches. At higher difficulty levels the phenomenon does not disappear, but at least it is limited. Compared to the previous editions, the control system for carrying out free kicks and penalty kicks changes, and with this we are at the third different interface in three titles: an aspect of the game on which EA does not disdain to experiment. Formula in this case borrowed in all respects from golf titles; with the stylus you choose where to hit the ball (if someone wanted to imitate Totti's spoon...), while pressing the A button with the right timing determines the power of the shot. Curious then, among the novelties, the possibility of composing personalized choirs by recording one's voice with the microphone and accompanying with drums, trumpet blasts and rhythmic applause. Sorry to report, once again, the absence of online support for multiplayer. Probably the biggest regret. While not rising much above the sufficiency, Fifa07 can be considered the best football title for the Nintendo laptop. Superficial but widespread improvements in the animations, in the audio sector and in general in the safety of the graphics engine (especially in comparison to the lame ~World Cup~ edition) are worth this praise. Equally good cannot be said of the heart of the game; despite the changes made to the free-kick and penalty control system, the gameplay remains almost identical to what was shown a year ago with Fifa06, retaining its strengths and weaknesses unchanged. EA is reluctant, or perhaps lazy, to heavily evolve its recipe for pocket football, probably considering an alchemy that, when tested by hand, is far from fully satisfactory. Pros: Graphically decent Lots of options and game modes Lots of teams, as always... Cons: ...but outdated, as always. Only marginal improvements. No online support AAA wanted ultimate soccer game for NintendoDS. Requirements: convincing gameplay, solid technical sector, online multiplayer. The post is still vacantAnd. The last candidate in chronological order is Fifa07, the usual annual update of EA's home football. Perhaps ungenerous definition (but not necessarily), we realize. But we have our reasons, and in this review they will be spelled out. Fifa07 is the third title in the series developed for NintendoDS, after the discrete debut on two screens that took place last year with Fifa06, and the subsequent title entirely dedicated to the glorious World Cup in Germany. If the first, as mentioned, did not let himself be despised, the same cannot be said of the second, which in some ways represented a real involution, at least from a technical point of view. In the meantime, the historical rival Konami has also had its say, publishing, for the moment only in Japan, a disappointing Winning Eleven. Fifa07 is an opportunity for EA to take a step back and restart on the best path.", "date": "2007-01-12", "grade": null}
