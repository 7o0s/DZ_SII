Around you only darkness; no noise except loudspeaker crackling incomprehensible instructions. Where did you go? A few steps and the answer comes: you are in a hospital. Desert, one would say. No doctors around, no nurses, no patients. Just empty rooms juxtaposed with locked doors, long corridors filled only with senseless destruction with furniture, cots and tools piled up like trash. And the blood, which seems to be a fixed presence, smears most of the walls. What ever happened? What creatures have infested the building? You will have to find out, willy-nilly; because you wouldn't like the alternative one bit. Only in the dark Developed by Renegade Kid, Dementium: The Ward is a survival horror strongly inspired by the atmosphere of Silent Hill, as evidenced by the scenario in which the sixteen chapters that make up the story are set: a huge deserted hospital, infested by demonic creatures that seem to have clean sweep of personnel (as evidenced by the bloodstains everywhere). In the role of the protagonist, we'll have to explore the various areas of the building in search of objects that will allow us not only to survive the horror, but also to discover what triggered it. We will be able to use a flashlight to counter the prevailing twilight, as well as blow and firearms to eliminate the monsters that will try to kill us from the early stages. The view of the game is in first person and the control system closely resembles that of Metroid Prime: Hunters, so you have to slide the stylus on the touch screen to move your gaze while the d-pad determines the movement of the character. The backbone L allows us to activate the equipped tool, in this case turning on and off the torch, hitting with the truncheon or opening fire with a pistol. While the action takes place on the upper screen, a well-organized interface takes place in the lower one, with the objects in the inventory in the lower part and the references to the map and the notebook in the upper part (useful for taking notes about various puzzles to solve). Quickly switching from the flashlight to a weapon turns out to be a fairly intuitive operation, even if one wonders why the character can't wield both objects at the same time. Evidently it is a choice capable of enhancing the contrast between dark and light, which in fact in this Dementium: The Ward is the most popular. Unique, important note: the control system set up in this way is unfortunately inconvenient for prolonged sessions, and unless you are particularly used to that position of the hands (in practice, the left holds all the weight of the DS but must also take care of the d-pad and to the left dorsal key), cramps will soon occur. Well, that happened in Metroid Prime: Hunters too, right? Monsters vs aliens Despite being a survival horror, thanks to the first-person view, the game particularly winks at the action component of this videogame genre. Fans of the various Resident Evil and Silent Hill are well aware that part of the tension induced by these series lies in the player's inability to defend himself and move in an agile and intuitive way. In this case, a series of limitations make the encounter with an enemy more formidable than it actually is, simulating in some ways the ~tension~ component which in a real situation would certainly influence our moves. We are not robots, right? Condemned on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 has shown that very high tension situations can be built even with a first person view and movement free from constraints, introducing strong ~twists~ which, however, are difficult to reproduce on Nintendo DS. Well, how was the ~fear~ component handled in Dementium? Well, let's say that the introductory phase of the game is very weak: we find ourselves catapulted into a situation that we already know for better or worse (for having experienced it in almost all the episodes of Silent Hill, by the way) and from there to the arrival of monsters the step is too short, without a minimum ~crescendo~ and, above all, without finding technical solutions that go beyond obscurity to represent our enemies. The combat system is precise when it comes to firearms, with the viewfinder turning red when it focuses on the target, even in bad light conditions, but with the truncheon things get much more complicated and it is difficult to strike without suffering damage. Fortunately, in each ~problem~ room we will find medicines and ammunition in abundance, which in fact makes the game a little too easy and predictable in its structure.ra. Technical realization Moving on to the technical analysis, it must be said that we are certainly faced with one of the most visually impressive DS games: the scenario flows extremely fluid, probably at 60 fps, without dips or uncertainties, while the effect of light and dark is handled almost perfectly. Indeed, even the touches of class are wasted, represented by the brief ~blackouts~ of the flashlight, which luckily for us has infinite batteries but which in these situations at least makes our position a little more uncertain. The hospital is huge and the level of detail of the environments is very good. Let's say that the only limits of this production lie in the repetitiveness of the scenario (which is basically always the same, made up of the same repositioned graphic elements) and in a certain lack of ~style~ in relation to the design of the monsters. Let's be clear, the work done is certainly excellent, but given the technical limits of the Nintendo console, it was necessary to find alternative solutions to the pink zombies with a beautiful view of the heart. Finally, it is pleasing to note that the localization in Italian does not stop at the texts on the screen but also affects the graphics themselves, in particular the writing on the walls. A title of this kind must be played strictly in the dark and with a good pair of earphones, but unfortunately the sound sector of Dementium is a bit disappointing: apart from the incessant noise of the protagonist's heartbeat and the inhuman cries of his opponents, the music are too simple and uninspired.", "date": "2009-04-26", "grade": "7.5"}
