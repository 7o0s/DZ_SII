{"name": "WRC: Rally Evolved", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wrc-rally-evolved.html", "text": "We are all rally drivers The short period of development that Rally Evolved was dedicated to already by itself should suggest a marked similarity to the previous chapter. And in fact the programmers have certainly not changed what they had done well in WRC 4, especially from a graphic point of view; the improvements are rather marginal, also due to a hardware now squeezed to the limit. However, this does not mean that Rally Evolved is a product with little aesthetic care; on the contrary, the excellence of the Evolution Studios graphics engine also confirmed its qualities at the end of 2005, with cars that were truly faithful to their real counterparts and settings rich in details, a barely hinted pop-up and an always stable frame rate. Coming out of a curve and finding yourself in front of an ancient castle, or snow-capped peaks in the distance, or anything else the glimpses reproduced by the graphs offer is truly spectacular. The effects are also excellent, with an absolutely credible reproduction of water splashes or clouds of dust. The official license of the world rally championship has also made it possible to have all the rallies (16), the drivers and the liveries of the cars available, to the delight of enthusiasts. So Rally Evolved remains, and indeed confirms itself as a very nice product to look at, without particular defects or problems of any kind. Where, on the other hand, something has changed is in the catchment area to which the series is aimed, thanks (or because of) a series of truly incisive driving aids and assistance. In fact, these are corrections to traction, brakes and steering, capable of making the game more affordable by the less experienced, but also of irritating anyone who is familiar with the genre, thus imposing its immediate deactivation. Among the few innovations, the presence of dynamic events within the tracks must certainly be included; in other words, in a completely random way it can happen to find yourself in front of rolling boulders, animals crossing the road, or even cross other drivers stopped in breakdown or due to an accident on the side of the track. It is a completely accessory introduction, but which helps to increase the visual realism - and not only - of the game. Less than before The physics of the cars and the control system confirm the perfect mix between arcade and simulation offered by WRC 4; not simplified like Sega Rally, nor challenging like Richard Burns Rally, Evolved qualifies in the hands of the player as an enjoyable, demanding but never frustrating experience. The diversity of the terrains produces real changes in the behavior of your racing car, exactly as one would expect. Damage management is unfortunately questionable, due to a lack of real disadvantages following even quite serious accidents. Which is a pity, because the generation of the same is credible in relation to contacts with the precise parts of the car; moreover, the number of ~sensitive parts~ and consequent damages is certainly substantial, which are then promptly reported by the navigator alongside the pilot. But seeing that with the engine in pieces the car changes its behavior almost imperceptibly is frankly disappointing. Furthermore, the repair phase at the end of the stage is too simplified, as is the set-up of the car which can easily be ignored in any occasion or weather condition. But what embitters the most in the package offered by this WRC: Rally Evolved is the reduced number of tracks present, certainly a step backwards compared to the past. The 16 world locations touched by the ~real~ championship are all reproduced, but with only 3 stages each, which are particularly short (from 3 to 5 minutes). The very long tracks of the fourth chapter, as immersive and engaging as they are demanding to complete, are unfortunately only a memory. Furthermore, the new rallycross mode does not represent a valid addition, giving the impression of being a stretch not too much in line with the philosophy of the game. The online mode, excluded from WRC 4 due to lack of time, deserves sufficient judgement, but given the very small diffusion of network adapters on Ps2, we doubt that it will be appreciated by many people. Comment WRC: Rally Evolved represents an appreciable new chapter in the Evolution Studios series. The playability, thanks to a credible but not uncompromising physics of the cars, is undoubtedly of a good level, as is the technical aspect, which has always been a hallmark of the brand produced by Sony. Nonetheless, the innovations compared to the previous chapter are really reduced to a flicker, and in some ways even a step backwards should be found, as in the case of the number and length of the tracks. Therefore, to define Rally Evolved a disappointment would be frankly excessivevo, but we don't even feel like recommending it dispassionately to fans of the automotive discipline in question. Pros Great graphics Fun and engaging Some interesting new features Cons Only 48, short tracks Superficial damage management Inconsistent evolution of the series Evolution Studios' WRC series, despite ups and downs, has now become a fixed point of the Ps2 line-up. After an excellent WRC 4, for many attributable as the best rally game available on the Sony console, just one year later WRC: Rally Evolved, the latest interpretation of the automotive discipline in question, now makes its appearance in European stores.", "date": "2005-12-17", "grade": null}
