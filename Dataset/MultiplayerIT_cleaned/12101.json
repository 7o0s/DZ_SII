{"name": "Super Stardust HD - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-stardust-hd-recensione.html", "text": "Super Stardust in high definition A sort of clever and pumped up mix between Robotron, Asteroids and Geometry Wars, Super Stardust HD puts the player in command of a small spaceship that moves in a limited play area and has the task of repelling those frequent (very) storms of asteroids and those alien attacks that just won't stop scourging the planets below. Each level of the game naturally consists of a new planet among the five total, and is in turn divided into five phases of increasing difficulty, which culminate in the canonical boss fight. The controls are very simple: with the left analog stick you move the ship, with the right one you shoot in the desired direction, with L1 or R1 you change weapons and with L2 or R2 you shoot the classic mega bomb. The basic weapon, the laser called ~Rock Crusher~, can be replaced by the flamethrower ~Gold Melter~ or by the fragment machine gun ~Ice Splitter~: each of these weapons has its own particular characteristics, and it is up to the player to choose the most suitable one from time to time, based on the enemies you have to face. This simple feature actually adds more thickness than one might imagine. Weapons can also be upgraded as you progress through the levels. Super Stardust HD is a title that can be enjoyed by anyone but requires real skill to play at a high level Super Stardust in high definition Super Stardust HD is a title that can be enjoyed by anyone but requires real skill to play at a high level, and despite the fast-paced action, great end-of-level bosses and brilliant visuals, it is precisely this balancing act that is what Housemarque did best. Completing the game is no cakewalk, and requires the right amount of practice to acquire the necessary skills. One of the coolest features is the two-player co-op mode, which adds a nice dose of extra fun. Coordinating as quickly as possible to face enemies is truly satisfying, and to increase the ~couple spirit~ comes the fact that bringing the ships closer increases the firepower, along the lines of what happened in historical titles such as Raiden. But here the defects come to light at the very best moment: unfortunately, a rather serious flaw in our opinion, this mode is not supported in online multiplayer, which certainly makes you lose something in the global evaluation of the title. A welcome presence is instead that of a system of classifications and sub-classifications for each planet, which allows high score enthusiasts to try to reach the world's top with their own score. Graphics and sound In Super Stardust HD it is certainly not the settings, the scenarios or the design of the ships that capture the gamer's attention and give the eye the famous part that always claims: what makes the work appreciate are instead the visual effects, the infinite explosions, the swirl of color and light that comes to crowd the screen. The game supports 1080p resolution, and the frame rate is always constant (well, come on, it would be weird the other way around). The sound effects are good and the selection of music is discreet, with sounds in a pseudo-science fiction style. Overall a more than discreet result, a pleasure for the eyes from different points of view. Final comment Super Stardust HD is the third game of its kind to arrive on PlayStation 3, and it's definitely the best as well. Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind, sang David Bowie in Ziggy Stardust, and if we are forced to hazard a comparison we could say that Super Stardust HD has not only a part of the name in common with the famous song, but also the ability to ~suck~ the player, if not into his own mind, at least into a vortex of action, explosions and colors from which it's difficult to get out even for me, not exactly a fanatic of the genre. An obligatory purchase for enthusiasts (and in fact better than Geometry Wars from many points of view, if we really want to say it), but to be weighed carefully, despite the only  7.99, for those who are not so attracted by shooters, especially if so frantic. Pros Fun, addictive and colourful, a drug Awesome co-op mode Cons No online co-op multiplayer A few more modes would have been nice Super Stardust in high definition Super Stardust HD is the modern-nextgen-1080p remake of an old game for PC and Amiga, which at the time failed to reap great success. In 2007, however, with the fashion of ~two-knob~ games in full revival, here comes the second opportunity for the developer Housemarque, throughthe well-established PlayStation Network.", "date": "2007-07-25", "grade": null}
