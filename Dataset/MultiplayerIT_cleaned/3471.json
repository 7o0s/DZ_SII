{"name": "Mario Kart Tour: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-kart-tour-la-recensione.html", "text": "Before starting the real Mario Kart Tour review, there are some elements that must be kept in mind to understand the direction attributed to this project for Android and iOS. First, Nintendo's attitude towards mobile gaming has changed a lot; and not only with respect to the old position which simply consisted in boycotting this market. It has also changed a lot compared to the one defined by Satoru Iwata who, when it was now impossible not to embrace (in some way) mobile gaming, had decided to do it in ~Nintendo style~. And that is by using these apps as a bridge between the casual player and the potential future Switch buyer (which worked quite well with Pokmon Go and 3DS); refusing, more importantly, any financial transaction that could put the children in difficulty. In fact, Super Mario Run came out with a free world, very short, and the whole complete package for 10 Euros: many downloads, little - in proportion - the money received. Nintendo has failed, for various reasons, to shape this market: for this reason Furukawa has chosen a more aggressive approach, of which Mario Kart Tour Tour is perhaps the most striking example. The second aspect that must be taken into consideration is how important this brand is for the company, because it is one of the best-selling ones ever, and certainly the most lucrative one in recent decades. Mario Kart is the second best-selling game on the Wii, the third on the DS (recording crazy numbers anyway) and the first on 3DS, Wii U and Switch. It's a series that everyone knows, a series that, with the eighth episode, has found substantially perfect shape. The commercial union between the mobile world and Mario Kart is, in simple terms, potentially devastating. But we are here to evaluate the game. Checks Another very important element to consider is that Nintendo, at least as far as we have seen so far, does not rely on the capabilities of the smart device audience; also Mario Kart Tour, as well as Super Mario Run, is played with one hand, and always with the screen vertical. This model has been applied to the series that we all know, without being modified from below: the moves are substantially identical to the main saga, but here they are almost all automated and, except in rare cases (which always involve the glider) it is impossible to fall out from the track, and it is very difficult to get out of it. We still haven't figured out which corners, if taken incorrectly, ~allow~ you to end up off the circuit: some have an invisible wall, others don't. In an apparently arbitrary way. All this by playing with the most complex settings possible, i.e. with the manual power slide (as on Switch, there are three stages of charge), the limited automated driving (it is impossible to eliminate it completely) and the management of objects entrusted to the pilot, without that they are thrown as soon as a block is collected. Yes, the weapons: they are also very similar to those of the home version, they can be thrown both forwards and backwards, and are used by swiping up or down (instead of left or right, a move that allows you to move) at the bottom of the screen. We can tell you that it's not very comfortable, at least drifting manually; we often found ourselves using the object with the other hand - which, in theory, the game does not contemplate - or even using the thumb, with the index finger clearly engaged in driving. The main flaw of this control system, contrary to what the developers would have liked, is that it seems quite familiar to Mario Kart fans: more cumbersome than usual, but familiar enough, suitable for modulating curves. On the other hand, it is imprecise and uncomfortable for all those uninterested in power slides, because making short trips is not easy and, with the automatic acceleration (which cannot be eliminated), sometimes it seems to be driving a crazy tractor. Tournaments and characters What we didn't like at all is the chaos of the interface. The goal is clear: to provide continuous rewards, scores that often go up, and so on. However, the legibility of the game is damaged; even without considering the initial need to register a Nintendo Account (or log in, you already have it), between starting the app and being able to run, there are many, too many icons involved. We'll talk about transactions and all the ~useless~ objects the game is full of in the next paragraph, now let's limit ourselves to the playful aspects. First, tournaments are temporary. Don't expect a subdivision similar to the classic one. Some are uploaded every day, and the goal is to connect users in the long term: eachThe cup consists of three tracks, to be tackled in a mandatory order, and a final challenge. The latter are appreciable, because they constitute a cross between a tutorial and an alternative mode. However, of course, the focus lies in the race: the competition always has eight challengers and, as far as we are concerned, we can only praise the fluidity of the game. Always online, never a slowdown: this at the cost of leaving out poor connections, but we have to admit we were pleasantly surprised by the fluidity of Mario Kart Tour. The competitions are structured in two rounds, instead of the canonical three: at the end of them you will get a score, which will increase your overall ranking, as well as stars (necessary to unlock new tournaments) and rubies and coupons, useful for winning new characters. As for the racers, cars and gliders, we haven't noticed the big differences that usually exist in Mario Kart: Peach and Toadette have - in our opinion - very similar weight and maneuverability, and we haven't noticed any notable differences even between one kart and the other. The choice of racer seems to be determined more - this is a new aspect - by the familiarity bonuses between the track and the ~character pack~ than by the characteristics of the individual components: for example, Toadette has advantages on the Toad circuit (the more points per stunt, the more weapons for a specific item), therefore, in short, the selection is very situational, and tends to favor changing the set, as well as owning many elements, rather than specializing on a single package. As regards the tracks, the new ones are few (in this first week, only the one in New York is unpublished), and they draw from the enormous repertoire of the series: they are well reconstructed, and milked to the maximum of their possibilities, each track being present in normal, mirror and opposite. As we said, Nintendo, a bit like in Splatoon, is dosing out the contents: in the currently available tournaments there are about ten tracks, but new ones will certainly be introduced in the coming weeks. Transactions and 200cc As we wrote earlier, the game is full of objects (coins, rubies and coupons) to buy new elements (characters, vehicles, badges): and these continuous donations are, as well as annoying, difficult to read. The stars are used to unlock new tournaments, i.e. they constitute the most important element, and are combined with rubies which, conversely, are used to obtain new components. Many cars and many characters, as we anticipated earlier, serve above all to complete the ~album of stickers~, rather than to deepen the gaming experience: the differences between them are minimal, simply having a vast collection helps, of course time after time, to choose the combination most benefited by a single circuit. The overall score itself is unclear, as is the selection of weekly opponents: the friends list shows the total ranking of the users in question, and so does that of the opponents, with the difference that the latter is not drawn up in an incomprehensible way. It is probably made up of the first opponents you played against in the initial tournaments, and throughout the week you will be challenging them to whoever has the highest score. The reward is still unknown, but unfortunately the competition is at a distance, since rarely, except in the first tournaments, have we competed on the track against our ~opponents~. Finally we come to the transactions that do not involve Mario Kart Tour coupons and rubies, but real money. First of all, the rubies themselves, in various quantities, can be purchased for Euros. More rubies means more karts and characters (and they too are limited to time periods, so measure them up so you don't have too many duplicates). Then there's a block, worth around twenty Euros, which gives you many of the rewards you could have gotten by playing during the week, as well as some bonus characters. Finally, at 5.49 euros per month, the Gold Pass: in addition to various amenities, it provides you with the 200cc mode, an otherwise inaccessible mode. As in Mario Kart 8 it is much faster than the 150cc one, as in Mario Kart 8 it is clear that some tracks are unsuitable for such speeds, with almost untouchable curves, especially here where acceleration cannot be limited. We have prepared a video for you, with two great laps on the same track (Yoshi Circuit), to show you the differences. On a graphic level, the game defends itself well: as we said before, it is extremely fluid, and this is, without a doubt, the most important thing. Characters and vehicles are well done, and the same can be said of the objects and visualscloser to the runners: the landscapes, compared to the Switch title, have been greatly lightened, as has the lighting system. Mario Kart Tour has less personality and details than its predecessors, the title is more anonymous, however the package found is still acceptable.", "date": "2019-09-28", "grade": "6.8"}
