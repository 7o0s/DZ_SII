The championship of high-sounding names, the Rossis, the Lorenzos and the Stoners, is opposed by a less predictable and frenetic competition, made up of continuous head-to-head, overtaking and almost acrobatic actions. In short, even if the Doctor exalts and enchants on other shores, for more than one reason the SBK supermotos have always had a charm that remains unknown to MotoGP racing prototypes. It is true that those who limit themselves to following the world championship on TV will find it superficial, almost senseless, to compare the two categories, but the annual challenge between MotoGP and SBK is now a fixed appointment for passionate gamers who love to whiz between Monza and Portimao pad in hand. So, after Capcom recently released a lukewarm MotoGP 10/11, the turn has come for the Italian Milestone to show the cards, with a new chapter in its flagship series. The traffic lights are on! Trajectory adjustments If last year SBK X had tried to innovate the series through a good number of innovations, many very successful and others a little less so, this year the developers' goal seems to have been to improve the product in every aspect, smoothing the rawest parts and striving to deliver the most believable and fulfilling experience a SBK fan could ask for. In short, no particular upheaval, despite the possibility of scaling the rigidity of the simulation, going from a very realistic level to a less severe and more permissive one, has certainly proved to be a winning element. With the last edition, SBK had tried to please lovers of arcade experiences by introducing a game mode characterized by improbable turbos and a mediocre driving system: an unfortunate solution for excellent intentions. The cold reception received by the fans has thus led Milestone to take a step back, completely eliminating the Arcade mode and working on the scalability of the simulation. The result is a chapter that, although it doesn't offer the same level of customization of the driving aids seen in MotoGP 10/11, allows easy access even for those who don't like hard and pure simulations. The player can freely set one of the three levels of severity made available, while additional options allow him to have (or not to have) further control over the brakes, gear shifting and weight shifting on the bike, and in the latter case the action ends up having a noticeable effect on the level of pitching in braking and stability. And yet, even with all the driving aids and a low level of simulation, the game does not become trivial at all and, above all, it always remains fun: the motorbike tails and keeping it on the track requires a minimum of attention, even if collisions between cars are forgiving enough, perhaps too much, to avoid going belly-up after each heads-up. Once in the saddle, the less experienced player can then practice gradually increasing the depth of the driving system, up to that simulation complexity so dear to fans of the series. Being able to keep the bike upright will be a real challenge at every hairpin but, unlike MotoGP 10/11, everything is believable, everything is coherent, everything is pleasantly realistic. Compared to SBK X, progress has been made in the stability of the bike, in the sense of heaviness and in physics on the curbs. Then the sky on the track darkens, fills with clouds, and a sudden rain overturns the rules of the game: tackling long races allows the player to appreciate the dynamic changes in the weather conditions and, above all, the effects they have on the track and on the motorcycle setup. At this point a brief pre-race meeting with the team engineer becomes essential, because fitting dry tires when the weather is uncertain risks transforming the race into a world festival of skidding, jeopardizing a sure podium at the first drops of rain. SBK 2011 also sees the return of the excellent technical solution that Milestone had baptized as Evolving Track, thanks to which the asphalt conditions change as the cars pass: on a wet circuit, for example, the track dries up along the trajectory followed by most part of the riders, while in the dry the track tends to get rubbery in the areas where the most braking occurs. In this way, the player is not only helped visually, seeing the ideal trajectory and braking points appear lap after lap, but he will be led to adapt his own strategyplay both before and during a match. Playstation 3 trophies 50 trophies to unlock may seem like a lot, but unfortunately most of those present in SBK 2011 are unlocked almost by themselves by playing in the various modes. Not that more originality was expected from a racing, of course: the most that can be asked for is a nice trophy called ~A flash in the rain~, in which to reach 300 kilometers per hour on a wet track. A legendary roster Another feature appreciated last year, and which makes its return in SBK 2011, is the Legendary Roster, which joins the Superbike, Superstock 1000 and Supersport riders with two-wheel stars such as Fogarty and Bayliss, two names that young followers of Valentino will have just heard of his name, but who only a few years ago melted motorcycling enthusiasts like hysterical groupies at the concert of their favorite boyband. It is also possible to create a pilot from scratch, although the editor made available by the game does not allow great freedom in terms of customization. The few aesthetic elements that you can choose from are scarce in both number and quality, and the result that comes out ranges from the barely acceptable to the eyesore. Not that it's a big deal, since the whole time you'll see him from behind and with a helmet on his head. A full-bodied career mode allows you to climb the two-wheel Olympus starting with a Nobody from the Superstock 1000: between agreements, constant suggestions from the team and objectives to be overcome in exchange for improvements to the bike, the years of the career go as smoothly as the oil, but one still gets the impression that the developers are only scratching the surface. Let me be clear, we don't ask that squabbles and slaps between Biaggi and Melandri be replicated by their digital counterparts, but the truth is that, especially now that driving realism leaves little room for criticism, we wouldn't mind if Milestone elaborated more on what is happening behind the scenes, between races. The SBK Tour mode allows you to distract yourself from the classic races with a series of challenges thanks to which you can unlock new riders, circuits and exclusive photographs: the variety of objectives proposed is quite high, for example by challenging the player to complete races without straying from the ideal trajectory, drifting for a long time or traveling a certain distance while wheeling on the bike. Competition lovers can then compete online against fifteen other players, but the work done to improve artificial intelligence is already evident at the lowest difficulty levels: the opposing pilots are no longer limited to following the ideal trajectory in predictable little trains, but they face each other side by side in different, often risky actions. A good job was also done for the damage to the bike, with the wear of the tires quite credible and the mechanics faltering following more or less disastrous falls. In the next edition, however, we would like to see greater care for the presentation: seeing your rider shaking his head or punching the ground after rendering the bike unusable on the last lap will certainly not enrich the game in terms of gameplay, but without doubt it will make it more visually pleasing and engaging. The latest novelty introduced in SBK 2011 is the unprecedented option to take and share screenshots online from any angle: a pity that in this case the game turns the knife in a plague that the series has been carrying around for some time. Nothing to say about the excellent motorcycle models, but tracks and environments still appear graphically obsolete and sadly bare, certainly far from the standards to which the latest racing productions have accustomed. And, to those who say that what matters is the credibility of the driving model, we respond by saying that now what separates SBK from being an exceptional new generation racing game is precisely the graphic component and the attention to detail of the environment .", "date": "2011-04-29", "grade": "8.0"}
