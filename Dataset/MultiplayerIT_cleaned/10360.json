The Star Wars cornucopia, which made the fortune of the Lucas empire, in addition to becoming a cult for millions of people, has always managed to provide new ideas for various works, beyond the merely cinematic sphere. Obviously, video games are one of the means most used in recent years to spread the word about the Force, the Jedi and the Sith: the ideas drawn directly from the plots of the films quickly ran out, for new games almost every year it was necessary to explore well soon new corners of the Star Wars universe. The Force Unleashed represented one of the most successful examples of interpenetration and expansion of the original script, telling an absolutely new background temporally placed between the third (the last of the ~new series~) and the fourth (the first of the classic series) episode cinematic. The final result, taking into consideration the game, and not so much the ~Star Wars product~, turned out to be a somewhat perfectible action game: despite the interesting story (which in any case may be enough for fans to consider buying), the technical realization of alternating but generally good quality and the thrill of controlling a lightsaber and dark powers, various defects in the gameplay and in the game structure have affected the final judgment. Nevertheless, the game performed very well on the market, which prompted LucasArts to release a generously sized expansion, and for the occasion also a special version Star Wars: The Force Unleashed - Ultimate Sith Edition for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and for the first time also for PC and Mac, including all the additional content released so far plus an exclusive and final level of the added mini-series ~Infinities~. The evolution of the Force The game scheme and the graphic aspect follow the narrative evolution hand in hand, with the enhancement of the apprentice's powers, his doubts about which side of the force to embrace and who to fight, for a title that is an adventure in terms of setting with places a strong emphasis on the action phase, without concessions to other genres or variations on the theme that go outside the combat and reaching a certain point. But this feature is also one of the strengths, where thanks to the technology of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 using the powers of the Force has never been so fun and spectacular. At the beginning of the game we start with the trusty Light Saber (red...) with which it is possible to perform some combinations of attacks, and with the rudiments of the powers of the Force itself, but already very interesting. In fact, by holding down the R2 key (it is possible to change the setting in the options) it is possible to block and levitate a large number of objects on the screen and even the ~lighter~ enemies, also uprooting elements of the scenario and throwing them against AT-ATs, structures and so on. After having done the necessary practice, indeed undermined by a far from perfect coupling system, using this power is both useful and fun, and often necessary to get the better of when there are several opponents in front. In any case, the powers are certainly not limited here, with a key, for example, it is possible to release a devastating shock wave that throws enemies and smaller objects away, with another instead of electric shocks and so on, according to a system of progressive and role-based enhancement. Continuing in fact in the adventure you get Strength points, which are used to level up and to acquire some spheres that can be spent on upgrades, which are of three types: those to learn new combos, those to enhance the physical characteristics of your character and finally those to expand the powers of the Force, such as the possibility of gripping multiple enemies at the same time. There is also a complete internal database, the possibility of using different costumes among those that are unlocked and new crystals for your sword, which on the one hand change its color and on the other add bonuses in attack or defense. Cracks in the Force To act as a shoulder for the apprentice is Proxy, a robot capable of taking the shape of other characters, who offers several jokes together with the protagonist, while the levels vary from space stations to the beautiful mushroom level, up to some well-known ship space, in a mix of quotes and characters that will make Star Wars fans gloat. The flow of the game is obviously arenriched by boss fights, in which the view often remains fixed and you have to use the combos and powers at your disposal with more discretion, a fight that ends with the classic interactive event that involves pressing the buttons at the right time, placed there for pure spectacularity and nothing else (since it can be repeated until it is successfully completed) and which sometimes even distracts attention from what is happening on the screen. The main story, without considering the new additional levels, can therefore be completed in 8-10 hours, to then access a fourth level of difficulty and the possibility of starting the adventure again with all the power-ups and clothes unlocked, while it is absent any multiplayer or additional mode other than the main one. Despite being one-way, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed ends without any problems, thanks to the powers that are still fun to use and the setting that draws liberally from the Star Wars universe. On this point, however, the merits of the game end and as many defects begin which unfortunately have a significant impact on the final evaluation. Starting from the approximation with which the contour is made, with the menus more than meager at the beginning up to those that are not very accessible during the game, which have the aggravating circumstance of loading from one menu to another and which show little optimization of the All. The biggest problem, however, lies in the structure of the levels and in the artificial intelligence, factors that significantly lower the challenge and the memorable points to remember. In the first case it is often possible to face a ~running~ level, without worrying about the enemies who at a certain point stop chasing the player, in the second case they do not shine for reactivity or for being competitive, but are limited to being sparring partners for the raids of the player who uses force. The approximations of the Force In some cases this defect is even more accentuated, such as for larger enemies, which are equipped with very few offensive variants and can be killed with simple tricks such as hiding behind bumps or moving away to the point of not being chased and then hitting them distance to boulders and other objects. In all this the difficulty level settles, where the game is always rather easy except when the AI ~cheats~ not by increasing the challenge level, but rather the number of enemies present on the screen, which leads to repeating several times some passes with frustration rather than exploit bugs by attacking from a distance or hidden. Even the combat system, in addition to the aforementioned small lock problems on enemies and objects, remains undeveloped in the melee one, which is resolved in the usual frenetic push of the button, with the strategy reduced to a minimum. In short, a whole series of approximations that make the game far from being valid in all its aspects, while being supported by a fair amount of fun derived from completing the adventure. Also because technically Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is very good, and there are many breathtaking views, made with perfect visual depth, excellent choice of colors and in general a decidedly satisfying impact. To say the least, it is satisfying to release, for example, a powerful shock wave of the Force, and to see a large part of the scenario crumble and move thanks to the excellent physics engine, giving that sense of power that only a Sith or a Jedi can return. The sound has unreleased tracks and others rearranged from the original soundtrack, and in general it is also excellent in terms of effects and dubbing. Xbox 360 goals The Force Unleashed is quite rich in objectives and points, with the Ultimate Sith Edition further enriched by those contained within the additional levels. In general, continuing in the game, the achievement of the various awards comes naturally with a normal progression, through the completion of the levels, the conquest of particular powers and the intensive use of these. For other, more particular objectives, it will be necessary to carry out particular actions within the levels, find hidden objects or raise the difficulty level. A challenge on several levels, therefore, but the perfectionist will have to work hard. The new levels There are two additional levels that can be downloaded separately through digital delivery channels, both console and PC, with a third conclusive episode which, at least for the moment, remains exclusive to the Ultimate Sith version. The latter, presenting itself as a collection of all the available materials, therefore presents itself as the version definal game, recommended for those wishing to try the full experience (of course, buyers of the ~smooth~ version may still find it difficult to explain a new full-price outlay, and may feel understandably satisfied even without the third exclusive level). The additional episodes fit into the original narrative of the game and, while not essential to understand the plot, they fit as further pieces of a larger puzzle: it is a sort of series within the series, identified with the name ~Infinities~ . The first of the additional levels is set in the Temple of the Jedi, and is placed in time about halfway through the game, revealing some backgrounds that remain obscure during the course of the original story, while the other two, set on Tatooine and Hoth, go to place chronologically after the conclusion of the ~normal~ story, but connect to the alternative ending, the decidedly ~negative~ one. In the Temple the Apprentice will be asked to reach a secret chamber inside the base, then complete three tests which will lead to a more complete mastery of the Force by the protagonist. Those who have not yet played the original edition should perhaps avoid reading the following: the other two levels are therefore placed after the conclusion of the game, assuming the player's negative choice: Starkiller, therefore, will have killed Darth Vader taking his place as Sith Supreme. In the role of the most powerful adept of the dark side, ours is sent first to Tatooine in search of the droids belonging to Princess Leia, also visiting famous places of the film series such as the birthplace of Luke and Jabba's lair, and then on the glacial Hoth , right during the famous battle between the rebels and the troops of the Empire. This last level also ends with an epic scene: a fight with lightsaber and Force powers against Luke Skywalker himself. Already present in the package without the need for further downloads, obviously, also all the unlockable special costumes with which it is possible to radically change the appearance of the protagonist.", "date": "2009-11-25", "grade": "7.5"}
