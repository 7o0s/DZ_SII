{"name": "Lo skateboard del futuro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/161307-power-hover-lo-skateboard-del-futuro.html", "text": "It seems that the fashion of 2015 is to imagine a future in which movements take place via hoverboards, boards similar to levitating skateboards, but unfortunately the products that come closest to it are still far from the one made immortal in Back to the Future and are also not rare fires due to poor design and not at all attentive to safety. In a few centuries, when the earth will be inhabited only by robots and every trace of humanity swept away like dust on the bedside table, the use of these gadgets will be the norm, but other far more serious and difficult to solve problems will arise. Power Hover is a game that amazes with the depth of its gameplay, but disappoints with its short duration Cracking gameplay The shortage of energy in the future world is the starting point on which Power Hover is based and the player's task is to solve this problem, at least in part: the little robot who has this delicate task must chase and catch a battery thief who he tries in every way to escape with the precious electricity taken from the village. The plot, in any case, is more of a pretext to introduce the levels that are gradually to be overcome and although cassettes are scattered around the world that delve into the historiographical question, the developers have done very little to make the narrative plot a point interesting to linger on for more than a few seconds before resuming the frantic ride. Ultimately, what matters is the actual gameplay and we can safely say that the software house has done a truly excellent job at this juncture. For a product of this kind, the difference lies in the controls which are of fundamental importance to decree its success or failure: basically all you have to do is move the character to the right or left by pressing the screen in the respective corners and collect the batteries scattered along path. Unlike other runners, the hoverboard has a certain response time to the feedback received and therefore you need to get the right timing right to perform a curve or a grind perfectly: at the beginning the experience may seem frustrating in some ways, but it doesn't take much to understand how to adjust accordingly. The sense of satisfaction that comes from the perfect execution of a level fully repays the initial discontent felt in the easy initial stages in which you fight with the apparent slowness of the hoverboard to execute the commands. Continuing in the adventure, the challenge gradually becomes more difficult, but never in such a way as to be impossible, thanks also to the gradual increase in difficulty. In terms of gameplay, therefore, the developers have created a product that differs from most of the endless runners that crowd the mobile market. Even the eye wants its part Stylistically the title presents itself in a pleasant way, with a varied number of environments ranging from huge deserts to intricate glaciers, with a whole series of levels located in even the most extravagant places and claustrophobic interiors. The graphics are deliberately sparse and made up of few polygons and are very pleasant to look at, even if in some particular situations one has the feeling of wanting a few more details to make the game world more lively and dynamic. The color palette used is based on strong contrasts, from the orange of the deserts to the gray of the city, and makes the landscapes unique and never boring to cross, even if the passage from one location to another does not always appear completely logical to the eye of the player. The soundtrack is excellent and successfully accompanies every second of gameplay thanks to the presence of multiple techno-style tracks. If you necessarily want to find fault, you have to look at the duration which does not exceed a couple of hours, given that there are only 20 levels and each is no longer than a handful of minutes; despite this, the experience is gratifying and despite the price of 3.99, which perhaps turns out to be a little high by mobile standards, Power Hover still leaves a sense of satisfaction at the end of the adventure, thanks also to the high factor replayability.", "date": "2015-12-30", "grade": "8.0"}
