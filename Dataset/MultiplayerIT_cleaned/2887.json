The review of Magic: The Gathering Arena - Zendikar Rising indeed speaks of a content set in a plane loved by many fans, but at the same time in this return it has created many doubts in fans especially for ~l'affaire Uyro~: the card introduced with Theros Beyond Death he is in fact the ~permanent center of gravity~ of most of the decks, especially Standard in the current meta and the arrival of numerous cards and keywords able to help him remain more anchored to the meta did not help the elimination of such a rift in the fans. Uyricentric meta game Before talking about the cards, the heart of the expansion, let's stay focused on the Uyro discourse and mechanics. Mainland and the possibility through numerous cards to create Combo decks based on the Mill (that is, making the opponent discard cards) were the bone of contention. Mono Blu Mill Decks and Mainland 4C Combo Decks (Altruism or Light Temur Decks if you prefer) have consequently become the basis on which competitive players have based (especially Arena) their runs in Standard. Discussions, however, have little sense of existing and we will now explain why. The first reason concerns the type of game, given that only Standard has suffered this situation, unlike Historic, Legacy and least of all Limited Draft/Sealed, given that in their arsenal they can count on a very large amount of cards capable of countering Uyro and the Terraferma decks: limited for the obvious reasons of the type of game and Historic and Legacy for the fact that they have not been affected by the Rotation of the cards. The second reason, more technical, is that Zendikar Rising offers many possibilities even for those who do not want to play those decks mentioned above. There are many possibilities for Aggro and Ramp decks that counteract the Mainland mechanic in a super effective way by attacking the sources of the opposing game. Just the mechanics, addressed in a dedicated article, seemed to us the great strength of this expansion. Mainland, Boost, Party, and the arrival of Modal Double-Faced Cards have been a lifesaver for the game. The keywords due to their return and the deck building possibilities they offer, but above all the new Modal cards for the revolution that they will bring with them. Many enthusiasts weren't convinced by this introduction, but we did. Modal Double-Faced cards are truly a possible next-step in the way of approaching Magic. These Modal cards offer numerous possibilities: in their land-only Rare version they allow players to choose between two different colors of mana, thus adding one of the two based on our choice (this cycle of cards, 6 in all for now called ~ Path~, will be expanded in the Kaldheim expansion). In their mixed version instead (Rare and Uncommon), we will be able to choose whether to play creatures, instants or sorceries from one side or one land to the other. Finally, in their Mythic Rare version, the Double-Faced Modal Cards will allow us to play either a land (in this version, however, we can also play it untapped by paying 3 life points) or a very powerful Sorcery. And it is precisely this version that is the most revolutionary. In every card game the so-called ~life points~ are a precious asset to be safeguarded, not even in Magic and above all in this case. The most powerful version of the Modal Double-Faced Cards leads the Magic player to think differently, tries to lead him towards using life points like any other resource, a fair exchange: 3 life points in exchange for an additional land, or a high-impact Sorcery that can turn the tables in one turn. In our view, a play from Game, Set and Match. Few reprints and many unpublished As for the cards instead, Zendikar Rebirth proves to be in line with what has been done in terms of setting and mechanics. The few reprints of the set focus on those useful for developing winning combinations related to Mainland, Kick-Up or Combo Decks. From the classic ~Negare~ to the more contextualized ~Nel Torbido~ the reprints are not wasted. However, the real spearhead is ~Cobra del Loto~: downgraded to Rare, it is proposed as a 2/1 at 2 cost, one of which is Green with Keyword Mainland. In practice, it makes us add a mana of our choice every time a Land card enters our side of the battlefield. Fast, lashing and deadly like a cobra, when you notice its hiss it will be late. Among the unpublished cards instead to be mentioned there are certainly: ~Segugio Infernal di Akoum~ among the commons, excellent for Aggro Mono Red decks; ~Crab of the Ruins~ among the uncommons, true and only ruler of the Mill and Combo Terraferma decks, if you see him on the field concentrate on him because in a few turns you could lose your entire deck; ~Orah, Hierophant of the Celestial Enclave~ among the rare ones, excellent for decks based on the Party mechanic and above all on the Tribal Cleric; finally, among the mythical ones to mention there is certainly ~Tyrant of the Leyline~: a finisher card for Aggro Rossi that provides multipurpose solutions even in late game, a must have if you are a fan of Dragon decks or very ferocious decks.", "date": "2020-09-21", "grade": "9.0"}
