It matters little if also in this case both could have been easily included in the original package, on the other hand the latter already has a remarkable consistency in itself, and the two episodes released separately do in fact have a certain specific identity that separates them from the main body of gameplay and narrative of the fifth chapter. Nightmare Without Exit and A Desperate Escape, or rather this new DLC that we are going to examine, seem to represent the two souls of Resident Evil in a paradigmatic way: the first expansion convinced everyone in its attempt to recall the classic spirit of the series, with its Victorian mansion to explore, the lilting rhythm and the cautious exploration among the decadent rooms and the rich decaying furnishings, while the second DLC well represents the more frenetic action soul that characterizes the horror series in the last two chapters, with hundreds of enemies including extricate yourself, explosions and fire at will. A Desperate Escape, between the two, is probably the one that fits best into the fabric of Resident Evil 5, filling a section of history that remains contemporary and parallel to the actions of Chris and Sheva and therefore sharing their narrative background and scenario where the episode takes place, fitting precisely into the space left by the discovery of Jill to her reappearance in the finale, thus making it recommended to those who have already finished the main game. The system is the same seen for the ~Versus~ and ~Nightmare Without Exit~ DLCs: the package costs 400 Microsoft Points and, once downloaded, inserts a new episode to be played within the ~Extras~ section of the menu. The games (single or cooperative) take place in single sessions at the end of which the score obtained is counted and entered in the online ranking, which obviously pushes the most passionate to try their hand at the test several times to increase their ranking. Desperate escape Warning, if you haven't already finished the game, avoid reading this paragraph. As the title summarizes well, the story told in this episode stages the escape of Jill Valentine and Josh Stone towards the helicopter that will take them to safety. The start hooks up precisely to the cutscene present in the main game at the end of the battle which sees Chris and Sheva face each other on one side and a Jill Valentine (victim of psycho-physical manipulations by Tricell) and Wesker on the other. After the touching moment that sees Jill come to her senses and clarify her situation in front of the two protagonists of Resident Evil 5, they set off on their mission leaving the young neo-blonde fighter to her fate, only to meet her again in the finale: what Has this happened to you in the meantime? This expansion answers the question, showing how Jill is recovered by the BSAA Josh Stone and begins with him a ~desperate flight~ - to be precise - towards safety. In line with the theme represented, in this new section of the game there isn't much time for exploration, dialogues and puzzle solving: Josh and Jill find themselves alone having to travel a good amount of road, attacked by an overwhelming number of enemies within mostly open areas, where threats come from all sides. It looks like a sort of ~endurance~ race, with enemies assaulting continuously and in waves, attacking melee or at long range, with frequent appearances of the most difficult monsters to further complicate the situation. The action is therefore pushed to the paroxysm, incessant and adrenaline, with the story flattened on the only imperative to reach the meeting point with Josh's team, and possibly get there all in one piece. The level of challenge here is very high even at the Normal level, requiring simple and well thought out strategies to try to dispose of the industrial quantity of enemies that surround the protagonists, possibly taking advantage of the elements of the scenario such as the usual explosive or incendiary barrels. For this reason, it is strongly recommended to face A Desperate Escape in two, or in cooperative mode with a partner, with whom to develop attack tactics and act in a more coordinated way than can ever happen with the support of the AI. Xbox 360 goals This DLC also brings with it 5 unlockable achievements, for a total of 100 Gamerpoints to add to your tag. Three of thisthese are conquered by finishing the episode in various difficulty levels, while the other two are linked to particular results to be achieved during the single game. Run and shoot Compared to Nightmare Without an Exit, the work done by Capcom seems to have been easier with this DLC. There are no particular introductions on the plot level, nor twists and turns designed to offer new insights into the historical background, to tell the truth, the narrative support is limited to a few dialogues inserted in the middle of the action phases that follow one another without interruption . Even with regard to the chosen settings, these are perhaps the most anonymous elements in the repertoire of scenarios proposed by the fifth chapter, with fortified bases, pseudo-port structures and short indoor sessions, but we are far from the scope of the graphics sector present in the DLC last. On the other hand, the puzzles are practically absent, while the only elements that encourage exploration are the different paths that open up within each macro-room where the clashes take place, which can lead to the discovery of additional weapons, extra points and the usual hidden emblems to hit, this time actually harder to find than in the previous additional episode. The audio sector and the graphics are obviously derived from those present in the main game, but there is a certain flatness to be recorded in the choice of scenarios and game situations, which differ from each other substantially only on the progressive increase of the enemies present on screen and their resistance to attacks. Like the previous downloadable pack, this one also comes with two new characters to tackle the ~Mercenaries Gathering~ mode, this time featuring two old acquaintances from the Resident Evil mythology: Barry Burton and Rebecca Chambers, who can be used within the pre-set scenarios for the option in question.", "date": "2010-04-08", "grade": "7.5"}
