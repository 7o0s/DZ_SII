Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is the ultimate summary of Cowboy life, telling a gripping story across four chapters steeped in action, gore, and pulp dialogue. The story tells the story of the brothers Ray and Thomas McCall, initially in the ranks of the Confederate army, finally as deserters in search of the infamous gold of Juarez and a new life, free and without war. Ray is the older brother, the one with the most experience, the one who knows how the world goes and always has something to teach. He's good at close quarters duels and using revolvers, he's tougher, stronger and can even lift a heavy Gatlin machine gun. Thomas, on the other hand, is decidedly more cunning and quick, he specializes in using the rifle and is therefore favored in long-range battles. In addition, he is able to use the lasso to open gaps and reach insurmountable points. The whole game revolves around the bond between the two brothers: each level can be tackled differently depending on the character we choose. Initially, some missions can only be tackled with Ray or Thomas, finally we will be given the choice to decide our favorite and use it at will. The face in the wind, the iron in the arm The adventure begins when the brothers return to their home to find that the farm has been attacked by Union soldiers. The two betray the army and become deserters trying to defend their family. From here, an endless series of events leads them to cross America in search of the infamous lost gold of Juarez, arriving as far as Mexico. The four chapters of the game wind through dozens of missions (grouped into chapters and acts), all different from each other and very engaging. The work of the development team was to want to diversify the possibilities offered to the player as much as possible and the variety of actions to be performed, always in different contexts and environments. We go from head-to-head challenges, with a third-person view and hand on the holster, to assaults on the stagecoach. There is to sink boats that cross the river, blow up bridges, save beautiful girls, ride with your face in the sun, and much, much more. For the entire duration of the game, about ten, twelve hours, one never does the same thing. Many levels can only be overcome thanks to specific character skills, many others with cooperation between the two, helping each other to climb too high points, breaking through doors in unison, covering each other in shootouts, or leading the caravan while the other he cuts down the enemies pursuing us on horseback. There are intermediate bosses, and they all face each other in the beautiful ~face to face~ mode: with the left analog you move our character, while with the right one you control the movement of the hand, placed just above the holster. It is necessary to coordinate the movement with excellent timing, dictated by the striking of the noon bell. At that moment, the fastest gun survives, the other perishes. During the clashes the artificial intelligence of the CPU performs very well: the enemies take cover, run from one side to the other, throw sticks of dynamite in our direction, making the task decidedly difficult for us. After a few kills, however, we can activate the ~concentration~ mode, during which a slow motion is triggered which makes aiming easier and more effective. Ray can ~lock on~ to several enemies on screen at once and quickly shoot them all, while Thomas can instantly kill anyone in his sights. The levels are all well designed from an architectural point of view, but above all as regards the construction of an action scene that leaves the player with cover areas, secondary ways, alternative routes, secrets to discover. The path to follow is always linear, but the player is free to move around the level being able to follow it as he sees fit. Sometimes, not very often, the player is left free to move around in some free roam-style sandboxes to explore on horseback, looking for arms sellers, jobs to earn money and bounties to collect. Or simply gallop our steed looking at the horizon and enjoying the fabulous panorama offered by the Wild West. These sessions, extremely likeflights, they serve to detach a little from the action and give us some free time to spend in the world where the main adventure is set, just as if we were in another game, this time more similar to a Grand Theft Auto. You look around with frozen eyes Exploration is stimulated by the possibility of discovering new weapons, cash boxes or collectibles. All statistics, together with the accuracy of shots for each weapon used, are then reported in a screen at the end of each mission. The amount of weapons is huge. Pistols, carbines, shotguns, of course; but also knives, cannons, gatlin machine guns, incendiary torches and wooden chairs that can be gripped with two hands. The adventure can be tackled in multiple ways based on the controlled character, but also depending on the weapons we want to use. Bound in Blood also features a full-bodied online mode, through which it is possible to set up ranked or customized games by being able to choose from a vast list of maps, all taken from the original environments of the game, and dozens of characters including the Mexican Hombre, the Indians, the Cowboys, the soldiers of the American Army, the Texan, the sheriff and so on. There is a cooperative mode that introduces a whole series of side missions, and another option called ~Sheriff vs Bandits~ that leaves little room for imagination: divided into two teams, one takes control of the good guys, while the other of thieves looting banks. This type of multiplayer option, which sees us pitted against another team, is by far the most fun and complete in the game. Since the latter takes place completely with two characters, a cooperative mode was almost obvious with regards to the main story, but unfortunately this option has failed. In any case, the effort of Techland (the Polish developer) to want to pack a next-gen product that is as complete as possible, from every point of view, is evident, as is now the case for any high-profile product. Xbox 360 goals Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is a game that knows how to reward and give satisfaction also from the point of view of the objectives to be unlocked. Completing the game on hard mode will unlock almost half of the 1000 points up for grabs, while the rest is split evenly between online multiplayer objectives (not very simple, to tell the truth) and bizarre actions like blowing up 10 chickens with dynamite, knock down twenty enemies from the caravan, or take down five of them while riding our ~horse of death~. The beauty of the West The Polish studio of Techland has proved to be largely above expectations, both in terms of the heart of the game, the playability, but also on the technical and graphic front. The first Call of Juarez was perhaps too immature, gaunt, simple, while showing good things. This sequel (which is actually a prequel) uses the fourth incarnation of the Chrome Engine, a proprietary 3D graphics engine that has been in development for nine years. Chrome 4 proved to be multifaceted and well structured: it runs on PC as well as on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, implementing a splendid 64-bit HDR, a massive and complex polygonal management that runs smoothly at 30/40 fps, but above all an infinite series of particle, meteorological, volumetric effects. Superb management of dynamic lights, shadows and the sun that dazzles and creates a distortion effect on the horizon, just like in the desert. The vegetation is also beautiful, all drawn by the GPU in a procedural way. Every blade of grass or tree is animated, illuminated, shaded. In short, the world of Call of Juarez is believable and true, solid, impactful. The graphic power of Chrome has been put in the hands of excellent artists, who have recreated dozens of different settings in a commendable way: saloons, cities, mines, rivers, hills, grand canyons, Mexican villages. The quality of the animations is excellent, especially that of the lifeless bodies of enemies flying off their horses, falling to the ground or falling from balconies. Wanting to find a weak point in the look of Bound of Blood, we can mention the not too convincing character design of the characters, perhaps too rigid and cold in the context in which they are inserted. The audio sector is excellent, and the vast sampling of sound effects (there are hundreds of them) is supported by an effective soundtrack in underlining the moments of action or suspense, melodies suitable for the western context and themes that closely resemble Ennio Morricone. The game is entirely in Italian, but shows a very fluctuating quality of voices and acting. Excellent performances, like those of most of the secondary characters, are alternated with unrelated voicesand poorly placed in the narrative context.", "date": "2009-06-30", "grade": "8.7"}
