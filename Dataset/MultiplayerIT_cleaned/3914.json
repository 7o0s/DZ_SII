An ambitious and courageous online (and offline) survival game in many of its choices, certainly imperfect in various elements of the technical sector; not too favored by a controversial marketing operation, which has transformed it into a real triple A, but this also and above all from the point of view of the high market price. A rather precarious balance, which in any case resisted the weight of the first year of life quite well, so much so that after also landing on mobile devices Ark: Survival Evolved lands on Nintendo Switch, with a port created in collaboration with Abstraction Games. It didn't go very well for the prehistoric creatures of Ark, and in our review we explain why. Gameplay: Big, chunky and varied We certainly don't expect you to go over the whole story that we told you a year ago with the review of Ark: Survival Evolved, since here we will deal specifically with its conversion for Nintendo Switch; it is true, however, that all newcomers may not know what kind of game it is, and why (in the opinion of the writer) at least a couple of times in life it should be played well and calmly. Developed by Studio Wildcard, Ark: Survival Evolved is a survival game that can be enjoyed in a myriad of different ways, each of which has the potential to profoundly change the gaming experience. It can be played in complete solitude, surrounded only (and that is no small thing) by the over sixty species of more or less hostile creatures of the mysterious island; you can play it in the company of friends in PvE mode against monsters; finally, it can be played online in PvP mode where you will have to worry not so much (and not only) about the creatures, but about the others on the game map. Setting aside the infinity of different aspects that Ark: Survival Evolved is able to assume on the gameplay side depending on the player's tastes, the title still maintains its own very specific identity: that of a survival game that leverages on crafting, on a large sandbox world and some fairly marked RPG components. In words, the game mechanics may seem even more complex than they are: simplifying as much as possible, the Ark player creates his own alter ego and wakes up on a mysterious island inhabited by equally bizarre creatures, including more or less dinosaurs and monsters. less prehistoric but revisited in a fantasy key. Think of a weird creature, not necessarily a gigantic T-Rex chasing you around the game map: it is probably present in Ark. The player's task is to stay alive and upgrade his position, exploring everything that can be explored, collecting the collectible, creating from scratch through projects what does not yet exist in that world. Obviously, by challenging the creatures or simply by staying alive and organizing your base well, you accumulate experience points, with which you can buy new skills and materials for crafting: all for a progression that respects the rhythms of the player himself. Unless you want to test yourself on certain servers that accelerate the gaming experience, which complicate it to the maximum or simplify it excessively: but in Ark you can do almost everything, and after doing almost everything, even much more . And just when you think you've seen it all there will be some additional DLC already available, some free and some paid; So what is the problem with all this goodness? Here we center the point of the matter: the conversion for Nintendo Switch. The conversion for Nintendo Switch Let's start with what we could define as the only positive aspect of the whole thing, namely the fact that Ark: Survival Evolved has arrived on Nintendo Switch in all its basic contents, without any aspect of the game having been eliminated. Studio Wildcard has offered all owners of the Nintendo hybrid console the same experience already available elsewhere, and one might say ~God forbid~ given that the proposed price is decidedly high, even after more than a year of presence on the market. The problem is how the contents mentioned arrived: our first gaming experience on Nintendo Switch was not the most exciting and it does not seem excessive to define Ark: Survival Evolved on Nintendo Switch a bad copy of the versions already available elsewhere. We first selected a game server to immediately enter a game in progress: there were already quite a few players, but the limit of36 in attendance was a long way off, so it seemed like a good idea to rush to help out. After an apparently interminable loading period we were kicked out of the screen: unable to connect to the game in progress. Patience, we double-checked our online subscription for Nintendo Switch and the stability of the internet network: since everything was in order we tried again, hoping for the second attempt; unfortunately nothing to do, at least in our case, accessing the Ark online on Nintendo Switch proved to be really difficult, even in the following days when we made new attempts with different types of connection. Let's hope that the situation improves soon, the development team is probably already at work. Unfortunately it's not that all the rest of our experience with Ark on Nintendo Switch has gone much better, starting with the optimization of the technical sector, in itself already lackluster elsewhere, perhaps with the understandable exception of Ark mobile. Ark: Survival Evolved on Nintendo Switch is when you can imagine the furthest from fluidity, the movements of your character and the creatures present seemed almost fatigued to us, slowed down by a frame rate which (not always) stands at 30 frames per second; this in TV mode, because in portable mode if possible everything becomes even less performing. The glance and the graphic sector suffer from a very low level of detail, unthinkable for the current generation of consoles and also for Nintendo Switch: it is not possible that on the Breath of the Wild Ark console it arrives in this state, as if it were a conversion budget close to zero has been reserved. Even on an aesthetic level, Ark is really ugly to see on the home TV, while things improve a bit in tabletop mode thanks to the smaller size of the Nintendo Switch screen. Beyond the actual technical details, then, any type of ~Switch effect~ is missing: what happened to the vibration systems, the HD Rumble, the gyroscope, a minimum of optimization in the game menus to exploit the touch screen? The impression is that Ark was taken by weight with everything it had to offer and forced into Nintendo Switch, compressing the overall quality of the product as much as possible so that it could fit inside.", "date": "2018-12-05", "grade": "5.0"}
