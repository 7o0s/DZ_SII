{"name": "Wacky Races", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wacky-races-2.html", "text": "A 30-year run The funny introduction had, I hope at least, the task of bringing to mind the funny events of one of the most popular cartoons in the 80s and 90s. Actually the first episodes of Wacky Races appeared on television already at the end of the 70s on the American network CBS. The lucky owners of digital satellite kits can still enjoy all the episodes of the historic cartoon thanks to Cartoon Network which broadcasts the misadventures of Dick Dastardly and Muttley daily to the delight of young and old. Precisely these two unfortunate characters have taken on the role of protagonists of the cartoon, contributing significantly to the considerable success achieved. How can we forget the hilarious laugh of the dog Muttley? ~The troublemaker~ par excellence now also arrives on PlayStation 2, bringing with it all the characters from the series and all the elements that made us laugh day by day. Wacky Races has already appeared on Dreamcast, PlayStation and Game Boy in the past, albeit with not always convincing results. Will this also be the case on Sony's 128-bit console? Cheating is the best way to win... Before starting to tell you about the title in question in detail, I think it's fair to point out that the entire game has been translated into Italian, including voices and commentary. Wacky Races can be traced back to the genre made famous by Mario Kart and the equally excellent Crash Team Racing. At the beginning we have 8 vehicles available, including the original ones from the cartoon, while during the races we will also be able to conquer the remaining 3 including the spectacular ~Zero Zero~ of Dastardly and Muttley. The game essentially has two main modes: Arcade and Adventure. In the arcade mode we can choose to compete in a single race, to participate in 4 ~Wacky Cups~ and to go around the track in a real time challenge. As in any self-respecting kart game, we can take part in competitions by challenging up to 3 human friends. Exclusive to this multiplayer mode are the ~Battles~ and ~Free-for-all~ challenges that help increase the fun and longevity of the game. There are no less than 20 tracks on which we can try our hand even if initially we are only allowed to compete on 4. All the tracks are distinguished by specific peculiarities, by the variety of situations to be faced and above all by the very colorful settings which are always able to keep us glued to the joypad. The smartest ones can also take advantage of the numerous shortcuts on the route, thus having a better chance of winning. But remember that Dastardly and Muttley could take their revenge... ~Muttley! What have you done!~ The control of the vehicle is quite simple to master and so even the little ones will have the opportunity to make a good impression in the races. Jumps, falls into the void and head-on collisions with objects on the course abound in the game and after each curve it is reasonable to expect a surprise blow. The main feature of Wacky Races is the possibility given to the vehicles to shoot objects, to transform themselves or in any case to perform out of the ordinary actions. Each single vehicle has its own special weapons, often of great effect, which it will be our task to make the best use of in order to be able to reach the finish line before the others. The Zero Zero can thus transform itself into a helicopter, submarine or use a special laser weapon capable of shrinking the unfortunate opponent. Even the very sweet Penelope Pitstop (there are rumors of her relationship with Peter Perfect) becomes lethal if we let ourselves be attracted by her gentle ways and her enchanting face. Infogrames programmers have not left out anything! Up to this point you might think that we are dealing with a masterpiece but in reality it is not all rosy. We are facing a very fun and immediate game, but one that probably only nostalgic fans of the cartoon or children will be able to fully appreciate. Excessive ease could in the long run distance the most demanding or more adult players from this game. ~I'm afraid I broke a nail~ It's certainly not with titles like this that the PlayStation 2 hardware gets squeezed to the bone. Despite this Wacky Races has been made with care and is almost always beautiful to look at. The colorful graphics are enriched by some ~gems~ that we can only notice by playing it several times and often the sensation received is the closest to what one feels watching the television episodes of the cartoon. The graphics engine proves to be adequate moving to a robuframerate even if on some occasions it is possible to notice some slowdowns due to the simultaneous presence on the screen of many vehicles. However, this is noticeable only in certain tracks and above all in the multiplayer mode. The sound, on the other hand, is one of the strengths of the game, thanks to the hilarious commentary, the perfectly timed sound effects and above all the hilarious voices of the game's protagonists. Muttley's engaging laughter, Penelope's comments (~I'm afraid I broke a nail~) and Peter Ferfect's delicate exhortations (~Could you please step aside?~) make us more than smile, often deconcentrating. .. but in the end what does it matter! Last corner Having reached the end of this episode too, all I have to do is decreate Wacky Races winner of the challenge undertaken by landing on PlayStation 2. The new effort of the ubiquitous Infogrames in fact proves to be a winner thanks to a gameplay that is as simple as it is durable over time, especially in multiplayer. The graphics rarely give glimpses of the power of the PlayStation 2's emotion engine, but that's not why it can be considered a weak point. If you are looking for a ~Crash Team Racing~ style game for your PS2, you have found it! If, on the other hand, you are not a fan of the cartoon or you prefer more demanding racing games, then my advice is to wait for the next releases or to give Rumble Racing by Electronic Arts a chance. That's all with this. Dick Dastardly and Muttley will be racing for waoo years to come, I'm sure. Pros: Great fun Dastardly and Muttley are awesome! Great sound Cons: Maybe too easy Occasional framerate issues Wacky Races starring Dick Dastardly & Muttley The crazy super-race of Hanna-Barbera returns and with it the new adventures of Wacky Races. Competing for the title of craziest driver in the world are 11 extremely aggressive crews: Peter Perfect's Turbo Terrific, Rufus Ruffout and Sawtooth's smash-it, Penelope Pitstop's Pink Powder, Placido's Crackling Insect and Bubba Bear, Clyde's Armored Car and his gang, Sergeant Blast's and Private Meekly's Special Army, Red Max's Red Baron, Professor Pat Pending's Omniconvertible, Mentus Horribilis and Tappus Horridus' Diabolical Coupe, the Mobile Boulder of the Slag brothers and finally the Zero Zero of the perfidious and dishonest Dick Dastardly and Muttley. Who will be the first to cross the finish line this time?", "date": "2001-07-02", "grade": null}
