The developers have been able to mix various videogame genres in the best possible way, so as to obtain a varied and profound gameplay, which starts from a solid action approach but soon reveals itself to have important strategic implications and frequent references to the MOBA trend. As far as the structure is concerned, the missions alternate phases of attack and defense, with positions to be conquered and others to be preserved, while the enemy hordes reorganize themselves in a continuous cycle to launch all their firepower against us. Three years later, Foursaken Media has created a sequel that aims to substantially enrich the original formula, while keeping the basic mechanisms intact. So here in Bug Heroes 2 the available characters multiply, reaching a total of twenty-five classes, each with unique characteristics, different upgradable weapons and four special maneuvers that are unlocked during each mission, just like in the multiplayer online battle arena. The game now asks us to select two insects instead of one and to face missions with precise objectives to achieve, or try our hand at the Endless and Skirmish modes, or even find online opponents to organize fun one-on-one or two-on-one matches two. Bug Heroes 2 stands as a perfect sequel, adding many new features to the already excellent first episode Insect life In Bug Heroes 2 there is no shortage of news and not even variety, in short. The technical sector of the game has undergone important improvements in terms of detail and fluidity, and the control system has also been made more precise and elegant, eliminating the visible virtual sticks in favor of an ~invisible~ solution, which recalibrates itself every time that we place our fingers on the touch screen and that takes only a few minutes to be well assimilated. The two views, from above or in third person, ensure the best visibility of the scene in all situations, allowing us to intercept the enemy troops as they head towards our base camp, whose towers we can naturally transform and upgrade by spending the ~gears~ that we collect around the scenery. The MOBA-style strategic aspects of the experience, i.e. those that are spent in the single game, are supported by permanent elements, such as passive perks to be activated between one mission and another or the same selection of characters. Unlocking them involves spending diamonds, the precious currency of the game, and therefore a reminder of the inevitable in-app purchases; however, new units are also obtained simply by gaining experience and leveling up, which means that in the end it will be possible to test all the classes, or almost all, simply with a little patience and trying to completely dissect what the title has to offer offer. Those unfamiliar with the series will have to invest a few minutes to understand its philosophy and mechanisms, but by then Bug Heroes 2 will have already fully conquered them.", "date": "2014-03-07", "grade": "8.6"}
