{"name": "Enchanted Arms - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/enchanted-arms-recensione.html", "text": "Golem mania In Enchanted Arms we will play as Atsuma, an apprentice enchanter who finds himself involved with his friends in an adventure that is decidedly bigger than him. A plot that is divided into about forty hours of play, going through various twists and turns, and which in general does not upset the typical jrpg canons, based on some ~universal~ values such as friendship, sacrifice and love . After all, saving the world from mad machines won't be easy, thank goodness there are friends. We will command a party formed by elements with peculiar characteristics, a mention of merit, if only for the originality and breadth of vision, must be made to the developers who have inserted a homosexual character like Makoto, moreover decidedly stereotyped in every aspect , and which plays an important role throughout the adventure, also giving several moments of pure hilarity. The story itself as mentioned is not particularly innovative, certainly not evil, leading us to explore the various areas of the planet, meeting places and villages that will always mean something to the members of our group, leading them to reveal something about their past and obviously doing proceed the plot in that direction. The entire game revolves around golems, artificial minions whose origins are lost in past ages Golem mania In the world of Enchanted Arms we will come into contact with golems, a kind of artificial humanoid servants created during the war that raged on the planet a thousand years earlier. We will be able to exploit them in combat and often new creatures will be the reward for passing the dungeons encountered on our path. Collecting the largest number of golems is certainly one of the main objectives of the whole game, their characterization is very good, we go from a semi-cartoony look for some of them to a purely dark and very gloomy look for others. Each of these enchanted creatures has a unique set of skills, which is why the choice before each battle will be essential. Meeting and defeating the creatures is certainly satisfying, let's say that the real and only flaw is that the golems do not develop together with the progress of the character, and therefore it is obvious that the ones we will meet towards the end of the game will be decidedly stronger than those used in the first hours of our journey. In the tradition Anyone who has played a Japanese role-playing game knows what to expect. Exploration, moreover limited in the case of Enchanted Arms only to the places to which we have already gained access through the events of the storyline, turn-based combat, character development and obviously a solid plot. We have already said about this and more it is better not to reveal, as far as the fights are concerned, we do not deviate much from tradition. Encounters with opponents happen randomly, it is not possible to avoid them, and unfortunately their frequency is a bit too high. Each fight will immerse us in a sort of arena, characterized by a grid on which, like a kind of chess game, we will move our characters. Each of our warriors has their own ~attributes~ which refer to the elemental forces, earth, wind, water, fire, light and darkness. In clashes, using characters with opposing elements such as water against fire will be essential to inflict as much damage as possible on the opponents. All the statistics on our party members are the classic RPG ones, VP vitality points, HP hit points, EP ether points and then the indicators that help us understand when it is possible to use particularly effective attacks, carried out in combination or through extra skill. On the grid, we will be able to move all the members in turn and choose whether to have them fight hand-to-hand or at a distance, depending on their respective abilities. To counter the too numerous amount of random encounters with enemies, the developers have inserted two very useful commands, namely the auto battle, thanks to which we will see our characters fight alone without our intervention, and the fast forward which allows us to advance the time between one action and another in the fight faster. The difficulty of the clashes seemed quite balanced to us; at the beginning the fights are almost impossible to lose, as the adventure gets underway instead the difficulty will also increase even if, let us tell you, without ever reaching too high levels of challenge. The latter never becomes very high also because at the end of each battle the HP and EP points will be recharged automatically and also, not a small possibility, it is allowed to save at any moment of the game, without necessarily reaching pre-established areas. High Definition ANDenchanted Arms being the first jrpg to arrive on Xbox 360 is also the first that uses high definition. Technically, the From Software product is decidedly interesting, especially the polygonal models of the characters, including golems, are excellently cared for in every phase of the game. The scenes that take place during the dialogues are very cinematic, during which the two characters facing the discussion are presented in the foreground, highlighting the great quality of the details, leaving the area in which the meeting takes place as the background. During the fights, the animations of the attacks stand out a lot, the particle effects are also excellent during these scenes and in particular during the EX attacks, the variant foreseen in Enchanted Arms of the common ~summon~. The environments are also very well cared for, especially at the beginning of the game, losing some detail as the settings go by. However, the difference in care that exists between the objects and buildings present in the reachable areas and those more in the distance catches the eye. Inexplicably you can then find strange textures in low resolution, which really stand out on HD screens, and some uncertainty mostly in Atsuma's animations. Overall, therefore, a rather interesting product even if we are far from the true capabilities of the Microsoft console. The added value to the approximately forty hours needed to complete the game, in addition to the various sub-quests, the presence of a virtual casino, and the possibility of getting lost in the world of Enchnted Arms to look for all the golems, is given by the online fights. It is in fact possible to load your team and fight via Xbox Live against the rest of the world. It is certainly a direction that future RPGs will have to follow, giving a decisive input to the longevity of these titles. The real lack of Enchanted is that it doesn't have an Italian translation, not even as regards the subtitles, thus limiting its usability only to those who know a minimum of English. The dialogues are in fact completely in the language of Oscar Wilde while it is also possible to hear the original Japanese audio, much better than the western adaptation. Goals Enchanted Arms allows you to collect up to 1000 points, on average the objectives are around 25 points with more important rewards in the case of particularly difficult battles that give you the opportunity to get 75 points, up to the grand finale which will allow you to get 150 points all in once. The objectives always follow an important battle even at a narrative level, the crazed golems will never be easy to defeat. Comment Enchanted Arms should be taken for what it is, a good product that fills a gap that has been present for too long in the Xbox 360 line up. Oblivion in fact, despite being a masterpiece, is another way of understanding role-playing games and lovers jrpgs had nothing to do. From Software's game does not upset the genre, on the contrary it remains in the canons of tradition, presenting an interesting story and a good combat system. It is certainly not without defects, given the only partially balanced difficulty, the excessive frequency of casual encounters and the lack of an Italian adaptation. Overall, however, we have Enchanted Arms is what we wanted and we are in the presence of a game that will surely make its buyers happy. Almond-eyed RPG fans don't miss out on the first high-definition RPG. Pros Interesting story Good combat system Attention to detail Cons Lack of Italian translation Too frequent random encounters Some technical flaws Let's not hide behind a finger, there are some things that only some of us know how to create, or rather there are some works that take on other characteristics if they are produced by those who have always made them, a few examples will be sufficient to explain the concept. The pizza tasted in Naples, there is little to say but it really has a special taste, the sushi tasted in Tokyo has very little to do with that tasted in an Italian fast food restaurant, Nutella is Nutella and remains unattainable for any other copy , and so it is the same for Japanese RPGs, if they are not created by almond-eyed teams they cannot express their full value. For this reason Microsoft for the first jrpg to debut on its next generation console could only rely on a Japanese team for its creation, From Software is in fact the architect and creator of this debut of turn-based role-playing games on Xbox 360 .", "date": "2006-09-22", "grade": null}
