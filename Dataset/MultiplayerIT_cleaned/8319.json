{"name": "A caccia di bottino", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108508-borderlands-2-a-caccia-di-bottino.html", "text": "Borderlands was one of those successes that no one, developers included, expected. The Diablo of the FPS, capable of mixing first-person shootings, quests and profusion of loot collection, has conquered a large slice of gamers thanks to its mechanics that also draw from the world of MMOs, perfect for the long cooperative campaign. Borderlands 2 restarts from that experience, from which it differs very little, to try to repeat its success. The plot is quite banal: after the opening of the Crypt the world was filled with a new precious material and the usual multinational, the Hyperion Corporation, commanded by a fascinating and ruthless guy, Handsome Jack, decided to get his hands on it eliminating all competition. Moreover, the myth of a second Crypt was born and the planet Pandora has repopulated with hunters who want to find out if this time they will find a treasure inside or just a very powerful enemy like in the first episode. The player will then take on the role of a new Vault Hunter who has survived a trap. The aforementioned multinational has put a price on our heads, but we are not easily discouraged. Never as in this case so many enemies mean so many corpses to be left on the battlefield. Thanks to the help of a nice Claptrap we will be able to get back on track and our race for the Crypt will begin or, better, for the accumulation of loot, with almost all Pandora who will want to kill us. Character customization As soon as the game has started, the first action to be taken is the creation of the character. That is, you simply have to select one of them, choosing from the four available classes. Five if you have made a pre-order that will unlock the Mechromancer, which can otherwise be purchased as the first downloadable content. The only customization interventions concern some details of the external appearance of the avatar. Not even very many, in reality, even if it will be possible to increase the variety by finding new objects among the loot obtainable by carrying out the various quests. Even the growth of the characteristics by leveling up will be managed automatically, with the only exception of the skills that will be assigned manually; from level 5 onwards, no points are awarded before. The four basic classes are the Commando, Siren, Gunzerker and Assassin. As in the first Borderlands, each class has a characterizing skill, called Action Skill, which must be purchased first, and a series of secondary ones divided into three branches. The fundamental difference between the two episodes is the number of selectable powers, abundantly grown in number in the second episode, to the point of allowing greater customization and increasing the role-playing component. However, as in the past, each skill has five levels on which to spend the points earned. A peculiarity of this system is the fact that to access some, sometimes you have to spend points on others that maybe you like less, because you literally have to ~build~ the growth path of the character on the appropriate tree. In reality there is nothing dramatically complex and original. That said, there are several ways to improve our hero, almost all related to the loot collected. Thus we have the modules for the grenades, which enhance them by also giving them elemental effects, the modules that give bonuses based on the selected class, the classic shields and so on. Among the new features is the Badass Ranking, translated into Italian in Sfide Duro, which provides bonuses based on the fulfillment of certain game objectives (for example, hitting the head a certain number of times, killing a certain amount of the same enemy and etc). The main feature of Duro bonuses is that they are fixed, meaning they persist on all created characters. Thus, if after reaching the level cap with one character you restart the game with another, you will immediately find yourself with all the Duro bonuses available. Obviously there is no shortage of bonuses assigned by weapons, related to damage, weapon stability and rate of fire, but also to the type of extra damage, reload speed and so on. In summary, compared to the first episode, character customization has been improved, so as to ensure greater variety in the cooperative mode and in the online arenas. Furthermore, the great differentiation of the classes enormously lengthens the life of the product, but only if you have the desire and the patience to replay it in full with all of them. We are alone... From the point of view of gameplay Borderlands 2 looks like a photocopy of the first episode. It would almost be possible to copy and paste the review of that to have a precise picture of the game mechanics. Unfortunatelyit can't be done, what a bitter life. Pandora is divided into large maps with a varied design that contain enemies of different nature (the usual marauders, ferocious fauna and, later, more powerful than average organized groups, mechanical beasts and so on) and quests to be carried out. The objectives are assigned by non-player characters or from the classic bulletin boards and usually require you to go collect a certain number of items, to kill a particular enemy, to eliminate a gang, to deliver something and, yes, you get the idea, nothing exceptionally complex or articulated. Basically, the main missions advance the story, while the secondary ones encourage exploration. There are entire areas dedicated to side quests only. In reality it is useless to continue in the main mission if you do not carry out the side missions, partly because you need to level up to face the more difficult challenges, and partly because by carrying out secondary missions you get loot that is often better than what you found in chests or on enemies. For example, in the first part of the game, if you want to have a sniper rifle, which is really very useful, you have to carry out a secondary collection mission. At first the side quests won't be very many, but as the adventure progresses they will multiply, forcing the player to go back and forth in the maps. Obviously all this coming and going serves only one thing: to collect as much loot as possible, which is the real fulcrum of Borderlands 2 (as it was in the first episode). The booty Scattered across the Borderlands 2 maps are a myriad of loot containers. There are small ones, which contain some ammunition, and there are larger ones, which can provide new weapons, modules and various cotillons. The best items are found in the rarest containers, i.e. in the large chests that were also in the first episode. The only novelty of Borderlands 2 from this point of view is the presence of treasure chests, i.e. chemical toilets which can also contain very rare objects and which are always worth opening (despite the smell). As has been the case since time immemorial, objects can have five different colors that indicate the different degree of rarity. The rarest items are also the most powerful ones. Apart from the trinkets described above, the most coveted prizes are certainly the weapons. At the beginning you can equip a maximum of two weapons at a time, but as you level up you will unlock new slots and soon you will be able to carry around a decent arsenal. The idea is to let variety win, to be ready in all situations. For example, it is worth having a good elemental weapon to kill flesh enemies, but also a weapon with corrosive damage to take down mechanical enemies and vehicles faster. Still on the variety of weapons, the ~sight~ factor must be considered; there are many types and all are capable of enormously changing the potential of a rifle or pistol. Ultimately, from an arsenal perspective, Borderlands 2 is unbeatable. As already mentioned, to get better loot you have to do the side missions. In reality, to get the most out of it you have to play in cooperative mode, with enemies who become much tougher and assign more valuable items. Unfortunately in the latter case the loot is shared and, if you are not in a close-knit and communicative team, you find yourself having to run to grab the most coveted objects before the others. In short, if you are too slow or hesitate, you are left dry. Lasts life on Pandora. Simultaneously with the game's release, Multiplayer.it Edizioni will launch the official Borderlands 2 strategy guide. plus, developer recommendations throughout the guide. A comprehensive description of each character's personality, history, and specific skill evolutions. Comprehensive coverage for how the game plays.~ It will be available from 21 September at 19.90 for 400 pages. Play it with someone Let's face it clearly: Borderlands 2 exists only by virtue of the cooperative mode. The rating you see at the bottom of the review is largely determined by this, because if it were for the solitaire game it would be lower. Having a few friends to play with and, perhaps, chat on headphones, gives the Gearbox title that extra edge. It is not for nothing that the biggest innovations introduced by the developers all concern the multiplayer game, such as raids that require you to be in a group to affface powerful level 50 bosses. These are enemies that are impossible to beat alone, which once killed drop loot of exceptional value. Said out of the teeth, playing alone can turn into a fairly asphyxiating experience, which was also the major flaw of the first episode. The plot does not have that bite needed to keep you glued to the screen, despite the dialogues being very funny, while the game structure, with maps to travel far and wide, perhaps even several times, gets tired quickly, also due to the system of checkpoints. Paradoxically, it is precisely when there are more things to do that the biggest problems begin and the vehicles, also inherited from the first episode, help relatively. Of course, Gearbox has thought of a rapid transport system to try to shorten travel times as much as possible, but the problem remains and having expanded all the load-bearing elements of the first chapter has also led to the expansion of this not just problem . For example, in a secondary mission about mid-game we will be asked to return to a map already visited hours before where another character will give us a series of missions to carry out (we will not reveal any details so as not to spoil any surprises). Well, the whole chain of missions related to this character will take place in maps that have already been extensively explored, including the first, which must also be retraced in its entirety, therefore against very weak enemies and with useless loot because of a level that is certainly lower than that of the character . It seems like the classic quest-line set up to lengthen the broth: it takes more than an hour, but it's a wasted hour. However, it is not said that you will not enjoy playing alone (who are we to judge what an individual does or does not enjoy?), but we must warn you that played only in single player Borderlands 2 loses much of its appeal and does not allow you to experiment the best Pandora has to offer. Cooperative inside As was the case in the first Borderlands, also in the second the game experience changes from day to night in cooperative mode. It is true that having a good friend to play with has always been an advantage for any video game, but for the Gearbox title this becomes a real must. That the game is focused on the possibility of playing in multiplayer is clear right away. As already mentioned, the innovations introduced all concern online gaming and those little things that make little sense in single player, in a cooperative take on a completely different value. In short, in short the shootings become much harder, with the enemies that multiply and that go down only after many shots, the loot becomes better, you begin to evaluate the vehicles also based on their capacity, you can take part in already mentioned raids and so on. Even the judgment on the individual skills of the various classes becomes more important: if playing alone you tend to assign points on the skills that help you survive, playing in a cooperative you must evaluate the impact of each assigned point on the balance of the team. Let's add that walking the long stretches of Pandora together with other people relieves the tedium and also makes the process of retracing your steps over and over again bearable. In short, the cooperative mode is the feature that makes Borderlands 2 blossom and shows all its potential, really revealing the refined work done in the development phase. Unfortunately, obviously, games with a strong cooperative component pay the price of having a weak and, in fact, forgettable single player. Pandora gets dressed Borderlands 2 maintains the look of the first episode, that is, it focuses all its appeal on a cartoon style guaranteed by the massive use of cel shading. Graphically several improvements have been made, especially in terms of variety of environments and details of the three-dimensional models of the characters. The bosses are better characterized than in the past and those of the advanced part of the game are particularly large and spectacular (not to mention those of the raids). In general, therefore, a good improvement job has been done which is also reflected in the models of the weapons, in some special effects and in the construction of the vehicles. Of course, we are talking about improvements, not Copernican revolutions, so overall expect a feeling similar to that of the first episode, which was not bad at all anyway. What is missing, as is the case in the first chapter, is a basic unified vision, a factor to which one can easily be indifferent. That is, in the levels of Borderlands 2 there is a lot of functionality and little room for aesthetic design, despite the beauty of the individual elements. Not", "date": "2012-09-18", "grade": "8.9"}
