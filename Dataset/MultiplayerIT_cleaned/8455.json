The 2XL Games project entirely dedicated to the digital market has considerable numbers: 1080p native resolution and a graphics engine calibrated to sixty frames per second. Come to think of it, these are onerous characteristics even for a triple A title, if we then consider that the whole package is offered for about ten Euros, the interest in this ~small~ production is heated. On the other hand, by completely bypassing the distribution costs and relying on the visibility guaranteed by the Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network channels, less famous software houses are offered the opportunity to carve out their own space in an increasingly difficult market. The weight of speed Despite everything, those of 2XL Games are not really newbies: although born in 2005, the group from Phoenix already has several productions under its belt such as Baja: Edge Of Control, Supercross and ATV Offroad 2009. These were the basis for developing the 'physical engine that animates this Jerry McGrath's Offroad, taking advantage of the image of the famous driver, obviously present in the game. But what exactly is it about? It is easy to say: a dirt racing simulator along the lines of the recent DiRT by Codemasters, more based on arcade dynamics. Different categories of cars are available, from Buggies, Trucks to classic Rally cars, to unlock along the main career. This is represented by around twenty races of increasing difficulty, set on six circuits around the world. We go from snow to canyons, from the countryside to the desert, essentially all types of terrain are offered except asphalt. Career races come in two variants, the classic race against seven other opponents and the time trial; in the first case, several laps are covered on outlined circuits, otherwise the canonical stage structure of the rally is followed. The most successful aspect of this mode is the experience points system, very similar to an RPG, which awards XP directly in the race. We are not just talking about finishing in first position, but the most diverse actions are taken into consideration, from the destruction of trackside fences or billboards, to overtaking, jumps and so on. This system keeps interest alive throughout the various races, while the same points are essential for improving the performance of the cars, assigning them on four distinct parameters, from top speed to handling. No further factors are taken into consideration, but despite its simplicity, the system not only works, but manages to radically change the races. If the first competitions in fact present a soporific rhythm and a worrying ease, as the speed increases it is necessary to rework each curve and start using the handbrake for drifting, not to mention the breathtaking jumps. In addition to this, disturbing elements intervene on the circuit, such as landslides or hay bales, which make the races even more fun and frenetic. The career lasts a maximum of three hours, but it is possible to continue to accumulate points in single races, timed races and online competitions. Xbox 360 goals Jeremy McGrath's Offroad curiously doesn't support the score upgrade of Live Arcade titles, meaning we'll still be confined to the old 200 player points spread across a dozen objectives. To conquer the perfect score it is sufficient to complete the entire career, an operation which does not take more than three hours. Not a particularly challenging task. The weight of compromises Technically Jeremy McGrath's Offroad is characterized by its ups and downs, predictably showing the compromises necessary to run with the stated requirements. It's not easy to comment on the use of 1080p for the Xbox 360's ability to scale the image, but there's very little doubt about the framerate, smooth and free of any slowdown or tearing effects, definitely a rarity in this generation. Similarly, the circuits have pleasant views and some choreographic elements, such as airplanes or helicopters, capable of giving liveliness, while the presence of three shots will satisfy all tastes (there is also the one from the bonnet). On the negative side weigh the chronic lack of detail in the textures of the ground, at the level of a Nintendo 64, the sound effects of the unrealistic engine and the low number of polygons of the machines. The speed allows you not to dwell too much on the details, even if it would have been sufficient to increase the definition of the terrain in order not to give the unpleasantand the sensation of running on shapeless treacle. In terms of gameplay we are faced with a rather permissive production, which puts simplicity and fun above everything else. A factor to be taken into consideration in view of the purchase, as well as the rather elementary physics, closer to the last generation of consoles. Damage to the cars is completely absent and impacts have little repercussions, while you have to be careful with jumps to avoid rollovers. Curiously, the game reminded us on more than one occasion of an old Sony title for Playstation, Rally Cross. The online mode allows up to eight players to compete in competitive races. In this case, the host has free access to the entire game database, including cars, liveries and circuits. Our sessions took place without the significant presence of lag, however it will be necessary to see the user feedback to guarantee its use.", "date": "2012-07-05", "grade": "7.5"}
