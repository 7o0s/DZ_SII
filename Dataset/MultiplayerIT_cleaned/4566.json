Instead, Nintendo demonstrated that expanding first-party releases was actually a winning idea, because it allowed anyone to fully and thoroughly enjoy every single production landed on the platform. Even the games not directly produced by Nintendo but under its wing turned out to be historic successes for the console (just think of Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle) and an increasingly rich digital catalog has filled the few and sparse holes still present. However, the fear remained that Switch would have been snubbed by third parties, partly because after the failure of Wii U it was reasonable to expect hesitation from the main software houses, which in addition to a less performing console than the others were faced with the 'uncertainty of the numbers, and partly because very few relevant announcements had been seen. Of course, the arrival of FIFA 18 hinted at a glimmer of light, but it was Bethesda's announcement that raised the antennas of supporters. With the arrival of Doom and Wolfenstein, incredible glimmers opened up for two intellectual properties that would bring real hard-core shooters to an audience very far from the Nintendo imaginary: a leap in the dark, no laughing matter in terms of return on investment . However, today that Doom has finally arrived on our consoles, Bethesda has shown that porting to Switch is not only possible with the necessary filings but that, if done with care, can give experiences very close to those of other consoles. I'm in the right mood Needless to go around it, to get Doom to Switch, Panic button, the team that dealt with this version, had to make rather significant cuts and choices. We are not here to tell you that the Doom that you will find on the Nintendo console has the same visual quality as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One counterparts, nor the graphic cleanliness of the PC one obviously, but it would have been foolish to expect so much. Instead, we would have been satisfied with a decent port, with a successful first experiment, and the title we are holding manages to cross this finish line without great effort. Doom is in fact extremely enjoyable in this new incarnation despite having been visually dirtied to be lightened and having lost those 30 FPS which in many other cases have been the reason for pitchfork outbursts and crazy internet revolts. Halving the frames per second is certainly not a painless operation and in the most excited moments the lack of extra fluidity is clearly felt and perceived when demons crowd the screen and explosions saturate the open areas of Mars. Yet Doom lets itself be played pleasantly, transports us into a violent universe with music pumping the ball, distracting us from technical weaknesses thanks to a gameplay that just doesn't want to be bored, albeit castrated. In dock Nintendo Switch does not give signs of yielding, offering a solid and pleasant experience despite a resolution of 720p and an accentuated motion blur. We have a much lower definition than the other versions and also the effects are reduced by the less sharpness on the screen but the gameplay, the one that really interests us in the end, we reiterate that it exalts as always and manages to overshadow the technical flaws. Unfortunately, things get slightly worse when switching to portable mode, imaginable given that the resolution is not touched, but some sections are rather problematic, a sign that the optimization has not managed to smooth out all the bottlenecks to perfection. There is another important piece to talk about and it is the management of the controls: Doom is the first real FPS on Switch and the Joy-Cons are not entirely suitable for the required precision and frenzy on the move. With the Pro-controller the situation improves significantly and even if we are not at the point where the peripheral is essential to enjoy the title, it is certainly a recommended choice if you want to play optimally. The multi I want is not here The multiplayer part, evidently, has not received the same attention. We have never been able to fully appreciate the multiplayer component of Doom, which although it arrives on Nintendo Switch with all the changes and updates introduced on the servers to date. In fact, we find all the latest DLCs and the update to version 6.66 which includes nine new maps and three unpublished weapons but above all three new demons to use and customized games with BOTs that will allow you to continue playing in the frethical arenas of the Bethesda title even without connection. Unfortunately, however, the technical limits this time are much more evident with texture loading that becomes extremely slower and an even more marked aliasing. Furthermore, the precision required in the multi-player does not go very well with the lack of sharpness on the screen, overshadowing the whole competitive component compared to the single-player mode. It is also worth mentioning the lack of the integrated editor: not a great loss for many of the players but still a side element that is snatched from this version. There was no filing instead as regards the violence on the screen, with always very gory final moves, spectacular dismemberments and an animation sector still of the highest level.", "date": "2017-11-10", "grade": "8.0"}
