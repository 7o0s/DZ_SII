{"name": "MX 2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mx-2002-featuring-ricky-carmichael_a.html", "text": "As expected, we find the four original modes: Exhibition, Freestyle, Career and Multiplayer. There is very little to say about the exhibition mode as it is the simplest and fastest way to get on the saddle of a motorbike without too many intermediate stages. Freestyle is decidedly more interesting, a spectacular discipline par excellence that will see us engaged in time trials during which we will have to perform the greatest number of stunts (jumps, somersaults...) which in many cases defy the laws of physics, however improbable they may be. may seem to the uninitiated of motocross. For each evolution performed we will be given a score which, added to those obtained for all the other stunts, will allow us to compete in the general classification. In career mode, however, we have the opportunity to participate in an entire season by creating our pilot from scratch. It will be possible to choose clothing from a vast selection of overalls, boots and helmets (all the best brands are present) and the motorcycle model. The list of two-wheeled racing cars available includes the ~usual~ Honda, Suzuki, KTM and Kawasaki as well as the elusive THQ team bike. After choosing the equipment. we will be offered a hypothetical calendar of appointments which include freestyle or traditional competitions or training sessions. The latter will allow us to improve our technique and to know all the secrets of the motocross sport. Unfortunately the level of challenge is certainly not high and varies from ~non-existent~ to ~frustrating~. In fact, the first season at an amateur level presents a negligible difficulty while the following season among the ~pros~ becomes decidedly more difficult, so much so that we will end up asking ourselves ~but who made me do it~. Added to this is that the behavior of the bike is anything but realistic, not responding credibly to the stresses of the terrain. Not to mention the falls that occur with surprising frequency so that you feel like skating on slippery ice. A little better goes with the multiplayer mode which is quite fun in pairs and able to provide a good feeling of speed. From a technical point of view, I am sad to see that very little progress has been made compared to the PS2 version. The framerate is certainly more solid and stable but as regards the global aspect, the disappointment remains. The textures and landscapes appear poorly defined and sparse, so much so that it is to be thought that a similar visual rendering can also be obtained on the ~old~ PlayStation. XBox has shown that it knows how to do more, much more, and it is with titles like these that one wonders why undignified conversions that only cause bad results to the console on which they run. The sound is fortunately more than appreciable thanks to a very gritty soundtrack that gives the right energy even during the races. In conclusion, this MX 2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael is certainly a perfect conversion of the original and for this reason it should be considered disappointing. Motocross enthusiasts might still find pleasure in playing it but I doubt they will for very long. The hope is that sooner or later a motocross game worthy of consideration will arrive on our console. If so, we'd be happy to let you know :) Pros: Fast Fun multiplayer mode... Cons: ...but not for long Poor level of challenge Almost non-existent realism Few improvements over the PS2 version Motocross is probably one of the most underrated motorsports, at least in Europe. The popularity of its champions has in fact always been limited, especially when compared to the actual sporting merits of the strongest centaurs. In North America, fortunately, cross enjoys greater consideration, thanks both to the television coverage of the races and to the spectacular Supercross circuit. Just a month ago Ricky Carmichael was crowned 2002 Supercross champion (250cc class) by winning yet another race of the season. Carmichael himself is the protagonist of MX 2002, THQ's ~two-wheeled~ motorsport title for XBox. We are not dealing with a novelty, being MX 2002 conversion of the game of the same name that appeared some time ago on PlayStation 2. I anticipate that the novelties compared to the original version are unfortunately very few and this is certainly not a good omen.", "date": "2002-05-29", "grade": null}
