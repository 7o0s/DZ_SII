{"name": "Pendragon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pendragon-recensione.html", "text": "In recent years, the British team Inkle has distinguished itself for the creation of titles outside the box, focused on storytelling and reading as a backbone, such as the award-winning 80 DAYS and Heaven's Vault, although this time, with Pendragon's review we speak of a title that chooses a completely different game system from the previous ones. On the other hand, if there is one thing that Jon Ingold and his team are not lacking, it is precisely the desire to continue experimenting without limiting itself to repeating what has been achieved previously, while maintaining a single common denominator between them, i.e. the centrality of tale. Structure Pendragon is a strategic roguelike with a strong procedural narrative component, focused on the Arthurian myth. From this point of view, game system aside, Inkle has chosen to continue, as mentioned at the beginning, in the courageous and successful path undertaken with its previous titles, giving life to what is in fact almost an ~interactive novel~, in The broadest meaning of the term, as the reading of the dialogues and texts in general, constitutes a fundamental aspect and a cornerstone of the entire experience. The story is set in 673 AD, after the fall of Camelot by Sir Mordred, who with his conspiracies and deceptions has effectively destroyed the company of the Round Table. The time has come for King Arthur to face his final battle for the throne of Britain at Camlann. As the incipit of the game states, the gamer's goal is to ~gather the Knights of the Round Table (and not only them) to reach Arthur before he meets his destiny. Some will arrive at their destination, others will fall in an attempt to get there~. And here another of the key elements of the title enters the scene, namely a system of crossroads which, depending on the choices made by the player, will change the story and part of the events. Whatever decision is made, there will always be a consequence, not necessarily a negative one. And the incredible thing is that the game manages to keep the threads of the narrative well connected despite the many variables caused by this system. If due to one of these choices the main character used in that phase will meet a bad end, the story will continue with the other party members. In Pendragon everyone can die, even the best known heroes, but the team of knights and others who fight for Arthur will continue their mission undaunted, until it is completed or there are no one left standing. Every time a new game is launched, which on average can last about twenty minutes if you get to the end, the user can choose to play a member of Arthur's court, including Guinevere, Lancelot, the wizard Merlin, Sir Kay and so on. However, along the way, it is possible to recruit other characters, to be managed as in a normal RPG by enhancing them, arming them and healing them when injured. The gameplay From the point of view of playability, the title is characterized by the good combination of various genres, with a strong strategic RPG component. The main action, including the dialogues, in fact takes place on a small map complete with a grid and an isometric view, with the characters however two-dimensional, even if the positioning and way of moving and acting during the battles are somewhat reminiscent of chess (after having eliminated the opponent takes care of the square). In fact, the strategy prefers to favor the position, more than the weapons, so it becomes important to know how to move and place in the right boxes, attracting the opponent to a convenient box from a tactical point of view. In this case the player can only move his weapon linearly, while to do so diagonally he must first get back into his waiting position. Except if he has particular acquired skills. The scheme is quite simple, but in reality it offers a good level of challenge and, at least initially, a fair variety thanks to the presence of special moves, morale and a good number of opponents of different bills. It should be noted that even during a fight or an encounter with enemies (which may not necessarily turn into a clash: sometimes, after some verbal quarrel, the discussion ends there and the contender leaves the scene) the narrative component is very present, in the jokes , in the sentences, in the speeches that occur between characters. Being a roguelike, however, it is easy to die suddenly, perhaps due to an ambush or the attack of a pack of hungry wolves, and with a single blow. For this reason it is necessary to pay close attention also during the exploratory phases, useful for deepening some elements of the storia, but also to find rare items or allies. The technical part Furthermore, one must try to avoid wasting too much time: if you accumulate extra days to those required for the main journey to reach it, King Arthur could suffer, and without reinforcements suffer a rout. Sometimes it's better to flee than to stay and die. In addition to the escape system, there is also a state that causes a sort of blind rage to the characters, to the point of making them make a greater number of moves in a single turn. The condition, however, requires the killing of enemies on the screen, or the death of the character himself. Pendragon offers an essential but at the same time elegant and colorful graphic, which is very reminiscent of the illustrations present in some medieval texts or in the stained glass windows of period cathedrals. The scenarios are quite varied, with forests, monasteries, swamps and villages making up a mosaic of places that are decidedly in line with the setting. We find the same variety in the characters, especially enemies, ranging from human ones, such as farmers, knights, brigands and so on and so forth, to those of the animal kingdom such as wolves, wild dogs, giant spiders, snakes and mice . The sound effects are normal, but the music is nice, never annoying and in line with the sound and melodies of the era and the setting represented in the video game. Side note on localization: Pendragon is a game completely in English, and considering the amount of text that it is necessary to read, at least a sufficient knowledge of the language is essential. Otherwise, unfortunately, Inkle's production risks not being fully enjoyed and appreciated.", "date": "2020-09-28", "grade": "7.0"}
