Some situations seemed very familiar to us, to the point that we went to see the first two Cossacks again to verify that we weren't wrong. But no, Cossacks 3 is exactly the sum of the first two Cossacks, but with completely redone game graphics and more units on screen. In fact, the official description of the game speaks of a remake and not a sequel, which can generate a lot of confusion given the number three placed after the title. Out of curiosity we went to re-read our old reviews of Cossacks: European Wars and Cossacks II: Napoleonic Wars to discover with some disappointment that many of the concepts expressed then can also be applied to the latest effort of the resurrected GSC Game World. In short, the interface has remained identical, the missions are the same, with the same conformation of the maps and even the tactics are very similar, complete with buggy artificial intelligence that makes the same mistakes. The few differences are dictated by the renewal of the graphics engine, now completely 3D, which has imposed some small variations, but in general it is really hard to consider it more than a remastered edition. At this point it is legitimate to ask how to review it, given that the title hides a completely different nature from what one might expect. But before proceeding, let's spend a few words on the gameplay. We reviewed Cossacks 3, an old title that can be exciting Love for the Cossacks The Cossacks series was very successful. For the first two chapters, mentioned in the previous paragraph, we are talking about millions of copies sold. In particular the countries of Northern Europe, Germany above all, gave him an excellent welcome. The main reason for its success lay in the choice to focus on a greater realism of the battles, with thousands of units involved instead of the usual handful offered by Westwood school real-time strategy. Some dynamics were similar to those seen in the various Dune 2, Warcraft 2 and epigones, i.e. there were six resources to collect, buildings to build and improve, troops to hire or train and so on, but everything had much more rhythms slow, comparable to those of an Age of Empires, while the battles were more uncertain and played on the ability to manage armies and not individual units. To conclude one of the advanced missions of a Cossacks it could take even hours, given the time required to amass an army and to achieve the various objectives. The management phase itself was not very fast, but it allowed subtleties such as the erection of fortifications and a wider exploitation of the territory than the competitors. Individual buildings could be upgraded in various ways, to unlock advanced troops and better equipment, as well as to ensure more efficient and faster gathering of resources by workers. It must be said that the construction part was concentrated in the initial stages of each map, and then left room for the combat part, which occupied the rest of the mission time. In some cases you had to commit to building several cities, but in general the formula ~gather resources-construct buildings-train generate army~ was respected by almost all campaign missions. In short, fans had their reasons to love the GSC Game World title! New engine, old soul Now re-read the entire previous paragraph and do everything in the present, because Cossacks 3 is exactly what Cossacks 1 and 2 were. As already said the only substantial difference is the new graphics engine, which allows the training of a number of units greater for bigger battles. In reality, most of the game time is spent observing the battlefield with the widest possible shot, so the general feeling hasn't changed much since then. Closing the shot is of little use. At the beginning it is done to observe the new three-dimensional models of the units and the details of the buildings, but in the long run you almost forget that you have this possibility. Cossack battles have always been designed to be observed from a distance, also because there is no other way to manage such large armies effectively. Selecting individual units does not make much sense, except in very special cases, but fortunately the interface is designed precisely to facilitate mass movements, with the formation of battalions that can be selected quickly, by setting keyboard shortcuts, and recalled when needed. An army is made up of many different battalions, each onespecialized in a certain field. Victory comes to those who manage to deploy their troops better, trying to maintain an advantage over the opponent as much as possible. Too bad that, as already mentioned, the CPU is not exactly brilliant and often points to suicidal tactics, which once understood make it easier to deal with, except in the case of clear numerical inferiority. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems of Cossacks 3 is the interface, which has remained identical to that seen at the beginning of the last decade. If we can tolerate having maintained certain mechanics, already described, which in truth do not weigh much on fans of the genre, we are less inclined to justify the failure to update access to the various functions, which is all too cumbersome. It already was at the time, let alone today. In this case, one could look at the competition, which has made some steps forward. In short, the impression of modernity given by the new graphics engine is somewhat debased. Mind you that despite this Cossacks 3 remains a very playable title, also because the interface can be tamed with a little practice (the tutorial, which lasts an hour, helps a lot). Only that it is old in concept and could be an insurmountable obstacle for some players. Lots of flab! Don't get us wrong though, because Cossacks 3 really has a lot to offer and will especially appeal to strategy enthusiasts who know little about the series (those who have already played the old chapters will not discover any particular novelties). The reason is that they will be faced with hours and hours of excellent strategy, with five complete campaigns, dozens of units, land and naval, to manage, coming from twelve different nations. There are also dozens of technologies to discover and around one hundred and forty buildings to construct. In short, it is really a lot of meat, which if we add the multiplayer, which allows you to organize battles on procedurally generated maps between up to eight players, dramatically increases the potential permanence time of the game on the hard disk. The main thing is not to be frightened by the flaws described above. A final note deserves the support that the developer is giving to buyers. At launch, Cossacks 3 had several bugs, some of which were very annoying, which earned it a lot of criticism. However, GSC Game World is updating it with great frequency, solving them with great speed. In short, at present it is stable and perfectly playable both offline and online, so don't let some snide comments scare you that it hasn't changed since the patches.", "date": "2016-10-12", "grade": "7.0"}
