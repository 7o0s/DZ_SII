In the portable field, then, the situation has always been more complex, also due to the limited technical capabilities of mobile devices; and when this factor was not discriminating, the developers thought about making such questionable choices as to limit an otherwise enormous potential (who spoke of Gran Turismo for PSP?). In the motorcycle field, the speech is even more nebulous: it is to all intents and purposes a ~sub-genre~, with an inferior following and little competition. In short, what good is produced with regard to two wheels is due more than anything else to the passion and commitment of the development teams, who alternate simulation or arcade interpretations depending on the case, trying to return an experience as engaging and spectacular as possible. In the case of MotoGP 2010 for iPhone and iPod Touch, we have a number of elements that immediately give us hope for the best: the official MotoGP licence, seventeen real riders, ten motorbikes and eighteen circuits on which to compete. The game offers us only two modes (fast run and championship), which, however, between achievements and extras can keep us busy for quite some time. The fantastic accelerations of Street Hawk After selecting the mode we want to try our hand at, the game allows us to choose the rider from among those available (all of which really exist) and consequently the bike we will ride on the track. The sequence of races in the championship mode refers to that of the 2010 season, but from the outset we realize that in MotoGP 2010 there is very little simulation besides names, statistics and numbers. The bike's control system relies on a mix of accelerometer (the device needs to be tilted to tackle curves) and touch screen, the latter called upon to activate the brake (by touching the left side of the screen) and the boost (touching the right side). The ~standard~ acceleration is automatic, so you simply have to try not to go long in the hairpin bends and not to brake too much to avoid turning around (which, at first, happens very often). The boost, regulated by a bar that loads over time, is on balance the key element of the gameplay, given that thanks to the powerful accelerations it makes us capable of, it is possible to easily slip even groups of opponents, thwarting any intention of realism as well as the classic focus on trajectories and precision. Although it is possible to ~get used to~ this type of solution, after a few races the extremely arcade nature of the Digital Tales product (all-Italian team, by the way) turns out to be a double-edged sword, especially in terms of how it works~ digital~ of the brake, which must be activated at times due to the fact that it does not return a gradual deceleration. It is therefore not possible to ~dosage~ the braking, a factor that ends up transforming the races into a sequence of ~stop & go~ lacking depth and personality. Unfortunately, the technical component fails to put a patch on the limits of the gameplay: apart from a really excellent and stylish presentation, the actual graphics show the side to too many uncertainties in the frame rate and some too simplistic solutions. On the iPhone, in the field of courses, we have seen much better. The tested version is 1.0.0 Price: 2.99 App Store links", "date": "2010-09-02", "grade": "5.5"}
