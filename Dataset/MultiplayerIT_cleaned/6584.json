Few know about it, but it's been making RPGs for decades. Since 1994, to be exact. It began when the genre was tarnishing and changing due to new technologies and the expansion of the public, which literally razed the rich production of titles from previous years to the ground. Spartan? Exactly. But proudly. Faced with the bastardisation of the genre with titles such as Diablo, which injected it with massive doses of action and shifted the focus of the various productions towards the more folkloric and superficial aspects of role-playing games, Spiderweb Software kept the bar straight and, even for a very small niche of users, continued, reaching up to the present day, to produce titles with an ancient taste, rich in details and interactivity, despite their technical limitations which made them unattractive for the general public. Avernum 2: Crystal Souls is only the latest in a long series of works that over the years have almost defined a micro-genre, that of role-playing games at Spiderweb Software. Sequel to Avernum: Escape from the Pit, reboot of two previous trilogies always having ~Avernum~ in the title, Crystal Souls offers the usual, mammoth amount of content that characterizes every product of this small and prolific software house. In reality, the first Avernum trilogy consisted of four episodes, one of which was non-canonical, and was the remake of another series, the Exile series, the developer's first. But we read you confused. Don't worry: it's possible to play with the new Avernum even if you don't know the previous chapters. Avernum 2: Crystal Souls re-proposes the classic formula of Spiderweb Software titles. Let's find out! Complexity and coherence Describing a complex title, already from the setting, like Avernum 2: Crystal Souls in a few lines is not easy, because it really has many aspects that deserve to be explored. Avernum is an underground land formed by an infinity of caves. The game begins with a goblin attack on an outpost quarry where our party is working. This is an increase in intensity compared to the small raids the outpost defenses were used to, which were left short of men and resources. It will therefore be up to our group to find out what is happening, starting a long exploration of the entire nation, which will lead us to interact with countless characters and face just as many dangers. Vast and dangerous places Creating the party is not very complex. If you wish, you can use the pre-generated characters, or create new ones by choosing their class, name and portrait. The more savvy will also be able to use the character editor, which can be activated from the main menu, but considered a kind of cheat because it allows you to alter the values at will. It is a useful tool in case of difficulty, but obviously inappropriate for those who want to progress in the game without any help. Each character is defined by the points awarded in the three skill trees: warriors will have more points in combat skills, magical characters in those related to spells and so on. Once you've entered the adventure, you'll find yourself grappling with the text tutorial that will briefly explain the main functions of the interface. In reality, the interaction system is not as complicated as it seems and is very comfortable, especially for those who have tried other Vogel titles. There are some critical issues, but we'll talk about them later. In general, by clicking with the left mouse button you can do a little bit of everything, from exploring to interacting with objects, talking to other characters and much more. If desired, it is possible to use keyboard shortcuts for some actions, but in general the control system is run in to be as fluid as possible even with the mouse only, within the obvious limits imposed by the mechanics. The beauty of adventure Avernum 2: Crystal Souls has a distinctive beauty typical of many Spiderweb Software products. It immediately arouses in the player what we could call the ~fascination of adventure~, that is the mechanism that projects the mind into the dark stylized meanders that one finds oneself exploring, perceiving them in their dynamism, despite the meager graphic representation. The background is really very nice The world of Avernum is not only vast, with its more than one hundred places to explore and its questlines to follow to get to one of the various endings (it can easily be replayed several times to see all the possible evolutions of the story), but it is also layered, with hundreds of secrets to discover, including hidden niches, shortcuts, underground passages andetc. It's easy to get lost in these mazes full of surprises, thanks also to the wealth of descriptions that are made by the various characters. The fights themselves, which are activated automatically on the map when enemies appear, are designed not to break the exploratory dynamic. They essentially take place in turns, making one character act at a time and then waiting for the enemy's moves. At first the fights are not difficult (it still depends on the selected difficulty), but as you go on the intensity increases and you get to some really massive battles, which require great judgment and deep knowledge of the party members to be won, alternating that is, the use of active and passive magic, managing the warriors and maneuvering spaces available in the best possible way, and avoiding being surrounded. The growth of the characters, which occurs by accumulating experience points, is not very rapid as seen elsewhere. Let's say that it is in line with the classic models, the ones that made it hard even to get to the second level. In short, Avernum 2: Crystal Souls is a real applied role-playing game philosophy that will not fail to give joy to the admirers of the ancient formulas. Unfortunately there are also some problems, which prevent it from achieving excellence. The rejection of modernity Spiderweb Software should stop completely rejecting any new technology. No, we are not saying that it should start aiming for triple A graphics, because that would mean distorting the very essence of its production. It's just that it's starting to become difficult to justify the slightest effort to renew at least the more practical aspects concerning the technical side of video games. The game world map For example, inserting a dynamic zoom function would not be a bad idea, given that by selecting higher resolutions, such as 1920x1080, some unscaled details become too small to see. On the other hand, going down in resolution the problem becomes the interface, which covers large portions of the screen. Another small problem is the variety. New players won't notice it, but those familiar with Spiderweb Software's other works will feel a strong sense of deja vu in front of some enemies or some elements of the scenery. Don't worry, because the problem isn't you: it's often about recoloring of sprites already used in the past. Of course, none of the admirers of Spiderweb Software's titles are such for technical reasons, however some concessions to modernity, at least in its functional aspects, would be welcome. The decision-making system deserves a separate mention. Avernum 2: Crystal Souls requires you to make many decisions, both in the plot and in the individual actions to be performed. New players will be delighted with the possibilities offered and how versatile the game system is from this point of view. However, the few who have played other Spiderweb sagas, such as the Avadon and, above all, the Geneforge one, will discover in spite of themselves that from this point of view some steps have been taken backwards, justified by the reboot nature of the title. Obviously those who have already played Exile II and, above all, Avernum 2 (the first), will find several known situations and, despite some changes, will be able to anticipate part of the plot. This is a typical problem for similar operations, unfortunately unavoidable.", "date": "2015-02-06", "grade": "8.8"}
