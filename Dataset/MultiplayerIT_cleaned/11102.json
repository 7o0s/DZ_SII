{"name": "FIFA 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-09-recensione_b.html", "text": "The EA sports series have always been the fixed appointment of this period of the season for every video game enthusiast, and the flagship of the Canadian company's video game production since the days of the old 16Bit consoles in this sense is certainly, at least here in Europe, the FIFA saga. The 2009 edition of this popular football franchise returns to the public again this year, full of new features and improvements designed to fill the gaps of the previous chapter. In fact, do not think that this FIFA does not differ from its predecessor or that it is only a sort of slightly ~upgraded~ version, because you would be making a mistake, at least in terms of playability. Of course, as we will see it does not revolutionize the saga that much, but it certainly improves it and a lot from different points of view. In short, EA is focused on next-gen consoles but doesn't forget the old PlayStation 2 and its users. Let's see how. The game modes, many, have remained almost identical to the last chapter, with 61 competitions, of which 42 are official, for example contestable in the Tournament, but not the Professional one (Be A Pro). This has indeed undergone some important changes. First of all, the seasons to be played have become four, which means that it is now possible to develop skills in a particular role of the professional player that you have chosen to ~play~ (created from scratch or not) in the span of four years and not one , with the ultimate goal of always becoming a national football legend. Then you can play with three friends in your favorite team and compete in individual challenges designed to develop the characteristics of individual athletes. All topped off by the presence of a special camera called Be A Pro Camera, with which you can follow your player better and more closely. But it's once you get on the pitch and start playing that you notice the most interesting changes. First of all, a greater control over the players by the user, over actions in general, over passes and shots immediately catches the eye. These are more immediate and less cumbersome to perform thanks to a greater responsiveness to the commands of the athletes and an improvement in the physics of the game both in physical contrasts and in the movement of the ball, which now seems heavier. Of course, we are not yet at the levels of PES, but neither are we at the not so excellent ones of the 2008 edition of FIFA. The new collision detection and ball defense system represent in our opinion the greatest innovation of FIFA 09 compared to the past. This feature allows virtual players to behave in a very believable way exactly like their real counterparts, using their physical and technical attributes to protect the ball, avoid an opponent or win the toughest tackles. A powerful striker like Ibrahimovic, just to give an example, can go by force to a less athletically gifted defender like Criscito could be, while he has to sweat the proverbial seven shirts to get the better of people like Chiellini or Nesta or in any case of athletes of a certain tonnage. Among other things, the latter certainly won't stand by and can perhaps push the attacker by spreading their arms more than usual to gain the ball and position, but always paying attention to the referee and the intensity of the gesture. Add to it a smarter AI that greatly affects the movements off the ball by teammates and opponents (except in some cases), no longer static and ~asleep~ but participating in the ongoing action and patterns, and you will understand how the gameplay product can be satisfying for fans of sports simulations. The series FIFA is a series of football video games created by EA Sports, whose progenitor was released on the international market in December 1993, in conjunction with the Christmas holidays. Always characterized by a purely arcade and immediate gameplay, by the presence, except in the first edition, of the official licenses for the main international competitions and teams, an obsessive care for the graphics and the TV-style setting of the sporting event, the saga has been able to evolve gradually and in the last two years it has managed to get considerably closer, according to experts, to the simulative realism of the competitor Konami's football series, Pro Evolution Soccer. The latest editions in Italian make use of the commentary by Fabio Caressa and Beppe Bergomi. Simplified commands One of the most consistent novelties of this 2009 edition concerns the presence of an option called Smart Play created ad hoc for less expert players or in any case eager to try their hand at the games right away without having tofirst learn to master all the mechanisms that regulate the gameplay of FIFA. The presence of these new simplified controls according to EA's intentions should allow the user to focus more on offensive and defensive shots and actions than on other aspects, relieving him of those tasks such as calibrating a throw, for example, or placing of a shot, which would require, as mentioned, a certain mastery of the controls and skill in the combination of the keys (L1 plus Square and directional analog in the case of targeted conclusions, etc). Therefore, by choosing this feature with just two buttons, it is possible to play FIFA 09, just as it happened in the old cabinet football titles of a few years ago: with the X button for the pass, for example, depending on the movement of the teammate who shoots and the tactical disposition of the opposing defenders with the simple pressure you can make a low touch or a lob to override, while in the defensive phase with the same button you can sink tackles and recall players. With the circle, on the other hand, you shoot on goal in attack and slide in defense. The intelligence of the CPU handles everything else. Only shooting with R1 and dribbling with the right analog stick are left to the total management by the gamer. Comment The 2009 edition of one of the longest-running sagas in the world of videogames finally seems to be consecrated (for some late) on PlayStation 2 after the excellent results achieved by the 2008 edition on next generation consoles. We are not yet at the levels of the best PES (for the Monolith) but by now it is clear to all of us how the FIFA series, albeit still with some flaws, has made giant strides towards a more simulative gameplay in the last two years. Let's be clear: FIFA is and will always remain different from PES, as it should be since they are products made by two different development teams. What matters, however, is that both titles can now finally offer gamers that realism, that credibility that every enthusiast seeks in a sports simulation as well as the possibility of choice. Each in his own way, with his own style. And it is precisely here that FIFA has changed: it no longer tries to imitate, but seems to have found its own way. His effective way of simulating football. Pros: Great gameplay. Improved teammate and opponent AI. Credible general physics. Cons: Internal editor not up to the PES one. Too many uploads. Napoli, Genoa and some unlicensed international teams. Tonight on TV The graphics and sound have been among the strengths of the series for many years and also in this 2009 edition they are of excellent quality levels. Compared to FIFA 08, it is true that there are few changes, as it was perhaps logical to expect given that the PlayStation 2 has probably given everything by now in terms of performance and perhaps it is not possible to get more from a game, but there are still some tweaks here and there to improve both the aesthetics of the final product and the audio part. All the various surrounding elements that make up the match event, from the pre-match to the actual match are once again perfectly represented by the EA graphics. The menus are easy and quick to access, visually pleasing and accompanied by a well-crafted soundtrack. The stadiums, fields and footballers are well characterized, with a good level of detail for faces and jerseys and the addition of 500 new animations for the athletes. Same thing goes for the sound. The choirs are confirmed as last year on levels of absolute excellence. Almost all the big teams in Europe have customized them, in 90% of the cases sampled directly in the corners. The commentary is nothing short of fantastic and serves to perfectly recreate the atmosphere of a real game seen on television. Fabio Caressa, probably the best football commentator on our TV to date, appears in better shape than ever, assisted as always by his partner Beppe Bergomi, exalts and exalts us with always effective comments, especially after scoring an important goal, when the popular Sky journalist shouts the scorer's name as only he can.", "date": "2008-10-27", "grade": null}
