Not for the sweaty and tamarro fat man who bullied us in an attempt to steal a coin, nor for those who smoked in front of the coin-ops (equipped with a special ~cigarette holder~, which was generally used to deposit the piles of two hundred lire) making hard to see our character in the fog. No, it's a shame because it was the place where you could observe the progress of a sector, that of videogames, which for years now has been cleared through customs directly into our homes. We passed from Galaxian to Mario Bros., from Terminator (the huge cabinet with a machine gun!) and Street Fighter, and at each step we realized the gap that separated home electronic entertainment at the time (consisting mostly of home computers 8 bit) from ruthless but beautiful money-eating machines. Those were also the times of the ~wow~ effect, when we were left speechless in the face of something that upset our beliefs in terms of graphics and sound. Dragon's Lair, in this sense, is probably the game that made the most jaws drop to the ground ever, because it was really inconceivable for the time (we're talking about the early 80s) to find yourself controlling the character of a real cartoon animated. Portable laserdisc Of course, amazement and wonder gave way to a pinch (let's call it that) of disappointment when one realized that the creation of Don Bluth (a former Disney animator) was nothing more than an ~interactive film~ in the negative sense of the word. The player did not directly control a character on the screen, but rather interacted with a series of cutscenes determining the sequences. The protagonist of Dragon's Lair, Dirk the Daring, had the task of rescuing Princess Daphne from the clutches of the mighty Dragon Singe, and to do so he had to enter his castle full of traps and evil creatures. The gameplay therefore consisted in pressing a certain button at the right time: if the operation was successful, Dirk proceeded in his adventure towards the next test, otherwise it was game over. A trivial example: the room in which the knight is found is engulfed in flames, except for the door on the right. Pushing the joystick in that direction means saving yourself and continuing the game. Ultimately, a unique visual experience for the time, but very distant from the common concept of ~video game~. Despite this, the coin-op was a frightening success and conversions for all gaming systems flocked. The one for iPhone and iPod Touch is only arriving now, for obvious reasons, but apparently the wait for the nostalgic has been well rewarded: on a technical level, the product created by Digital Leisure is even superior to the original... Right or left? Dragon's Lair offers two game modes that are distinguished simply by the positioning of the sequences: in the original one the story is faithful to the 1983 game, in the unpublished one you find yourself facing ever new pitfalls and pitfalls due to a system that ~mixes ~ the sequences in random order. The substance does not change, in any case, and the gameplay is always and in any case based on memorizing the commands necessary to overcome this or that area. In addition, the developers have included the possibility (activated by default) to display instant suggestions on the screen on the buttons to press, and just follow them with a little reflexes to survive any test good old Dirk is subjected to. Clearly, longtime fans should turn off the aids and try to enjoy the adventure as if for the first time. Graphics and sound have been ~remastered~ and appear in splendid shape, with vivid colors and well-defined lines that alternate on the screen of our Apple device asking us to wait only a few tenths of a second between one scene and another.
