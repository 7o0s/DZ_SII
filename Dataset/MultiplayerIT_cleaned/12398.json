{"name": "The Sims 2: Seasons - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-seasons-recensione.html", "text": "White week or bikini? A seasonal cycle will have the duration of five days of life of the Sims, after which the following season will enter, with all the related climatic changes. However, it will be possible to manage the relative time settings as gods of our world. In this way it will be only up to our taste and our discretion to completely eliminate the cold of winter by favoring an eternally summer climate for our little California, or to create a rural environment with an autumn style, or still to favor the taste of the rigid snowy climate, with his snowmen, preferring the winter period. Monotonous choices, perhaps, limiting the dynamism that the expansion instead wants to bring to our management, but still free choices and therefore an element, potentially, of greater enjoyment of the expansion itself. Each season, of course, will have its own distinctive characteristics. We will have snowfalls, thunderstorms, sunshine and lightning and, if we really dare, we will be able to change the weather with a car not quite perfect. Attempting to stop snowflakes from falling may, in fact, cause fireballs to fall on us. If it has snowed abundantly enough, in fact, we will be able to wage snowball fights with our friends, make snow angels or puppets, which will be periodically visited by funny penguins that we will be able to pet. Don't forget warm clothes if you don't want to risk freezing. One of the novelties of the expansion is the introduction of an outdoor wardrobe, including jackets and coats, which once selected, as for the other clothes, will be worn automatically by our Sims when they cross the threshold of the house, to then return to discard them on their return. Indispensable to avoid nasty colds at least as much as sunburn, which we will run into if we spend too much time on our deck chairs in the summer, and which we must carefully avoid by checking our body temperature. And don't forget to consult the weather forecast on television, if you want to be prepared. Autumn, with its characteristic melancholy, will find us fascinated by the falling leaves. Our children may find it very amusing to jump into them and scatter them around the garden, so take care of them. In spring the plants will bloom again, the lakes will once again lose the ice that will cover them in the winter season and the trees will come out of the sleep of the previous season. But the seasons will not only exert their influence on the environment, but also on our social relationships. Isn't it really spring, in fact, the season dedicated to the rebirth of love, by tradition? The Sims will be no exception, and each season will feature a variety of relationship bonuses, such as faster friendship bar growth in the summer, family relationships in the winter, and so on. All this can be quite useful thanks to the possibility of managing the seasons, adding a minimal but useful tactical sense to the rotation or repetition of the same. The Little Gardener's Handbook Furthermore, one of the central elements of the expansion is certainly that relating to the care of plants. Of course, we must have a minimum of green thumb and certainly a good dose of patience, but we will be rewarded. And, at least, we won't find dirt all the way into the bed. A clean job, we give thanks. To begin with we will have to prepare an area of the garden to dedicate to our vegetable garden. At this point we will be able to plant vegetables and fruit trees, which will naturally have to be cared for and followed up, watered, treated against parasites, fertilized. If you have a demanding career you might want to consider a gardener. In fact, if plants are not treated, they will see their state of health drop radically, forcing us to treat them or watch them die. We will be informed of their health simply by hovering over them with the mouse: a description window will tell us what they need. And all this without forgetting to collect the products of our efforts, which we can transform into cash by selling them in the shops present or freezing them in the refrigerator, to then eat them. And if we really can't give up taking care of our garden, during the winter we can take care of it in greenhouses, provided that at this point our level as gardeners is expert. In fact, successes and failures lead us to somehow increase our skill level, obtaining medals that will unlock a series of abilities. In the case of gardening, for example, we will eventually be able to talk to plants. Similar processhard will happen for another of the novelties introduced by the expansion: fishing. The games that have adopted a fishing system are really many, on the current scene, crossing virtually every videogame genre. The Sims do not hesitate, and take out the fishing rods from the closet, engaging in relaxing afternoons of fishing with friends. Also in this case we will accumulate talent, which will allow us to fish in different types of bodies of water. Ah, and the best fish... they make nice trophies for walls. Or for the fridge, of course. As for the implementations to the careers, we have six new working paths to choose from, we will have a series of objects for furnishing our home, adapted to the seasons, and a series of minor implementations that add to the already vast baggage of options of the game. Conclusions In principle, we can say that this new Sims 2 expansion brings a series of interesting implementations to the plate of playability and renewal, especially as regards the climatic aspects and the related behaviors and accessories. The important innovations, which will be the ones that will keep us busy for most of the game time, are those related to gardening and fishing, as well as the inclusion of a new neighborhood, inhabited by its characters and their peculiar stories. Nevertheless, the novelties of the game are rather limited, the new objects and hairstyles, as well as the new clothing items, a little too few. Basically, this expansion doesn't engage the players as much as the previous ones did, ultimately reducing itself to making the game certainly more complete, but without opening real new possibilities for interpretation and challenge. In short, an excellent form but in terms of substance one could hope for something more.

Etchoo! Faithful to the tradition of a title that has always been enriched, periodically, thanks to the release of new expansions, the Sims are back to updating, this time with the introduction of a season system. Here we are, therefore, faced with a series of new possibilities that, as players, we find ourselves having to manage the world of our virtual alter egos. But what are the real innovations brought about by this expansion, compared to the previous ones? We had the chance to experience student life on a campus, as well as to start businesses. We dressed up for our late night outings, nurturing our relationships at elegant hangout spots. We raised our pets, taking care of their education and even their social and professional life. We now have the implementation of the cycle of the seasons, which will directly influence the life and environment of our Sims. But when will the long-awaited summer finally arrive?", "date": "2007-03-29", "grade": null}
