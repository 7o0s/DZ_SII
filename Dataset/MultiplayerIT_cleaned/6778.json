{"name": "As Dusk Falls", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/as-dusk-falls-recensione.html", "text": "One of the most frequent accusations made against contemporary video games is that they represent a dangerous form of escape from our reality, much more vivid than that offered by other multimedia works due to the interactivity factor, a unique quality of the medium. Who launches these cheesy TV living room arguments does so from positions of total ignorance and doesn't deserve a comment, but they're right on at least one aspect. No other form of entertainment can match the narrative video game in its ability to make us escape from the monotony of everyday life, because unlike movies and TV series, here we hold the keys to the story. The complete identification with a character, when his fate depends only and only on our choices, is a damn natural and spontaneous process. It will seem paradoxical, but for this very reason those who work on a narrative adventure are exposed to many more unknowns than normal . True, playful experiences centered on narration have the advantage of making that feeling of immersion typical of well-written stories much more overwhelming, but the flip side is that the thread that binds the player to the story in these cases is particularly tense and it tends to break when the narrative exposition loses quality. It's a risk that everyone runs, who ran Quantic Dream in the past alternating great successes with less inspired projects, and who today has every intention of running Caroline Marchal, veteran of the Parisian studio who after 18 years of experience in the field of interactive adventures she founded Interior/Night with the sole ambition of continuing to do what she does best: tell stories. The team is preparing to launch its debut title, As Dusk Falls, an interactive drama with a very particular graphic style, which promises to make us experience the painful events experienced by two families whose fates are tragically intertwined in an isolated motel of Arizona. After several editorial appointments, the time has now come to find out if the game will be able to establish itself in the landscape of narrative adventures or if it is destined to get lost in the dust of Route 66. Let's find out, in our review of As Dusk Falls. California hotels The Desert Dream Motel It's the south of the United States, the desert laps the edge of the horizon from any perspective you look at it and, even if the new millennium is upon us, life here is still as hard as it was seen in Sergio Leone's old films. Traveling to Albuquerque, Vince and his family took the opportunity presented by a move to Missouri to traverse a scenic route that takes them on the legendary Route 66. In the opposite direction, on the same ~dark, desert highway and with a cool wind hair~, the Holt brothers are fleeing after being caught robbing the house of the sheriff of Two Rock County, the town that is the stage for the events told by As Dusk Falls. The fates of the two families will collide at the Desert Dream Motel, a place that those involved will never leave, remaining marked for life by the dramatic events of that night. From these gripping narrative premises develops a lively interactive thriller divided into two books, the first that tells of the violent hostage situation that arises at the motel and the second dedicated to deepening the deep-rooted psychological consequences that still haunt the survivors. During a 14-year narrative arc we will have the opportunity to face all the repercussions of our choices and to experience the points of view of different characters, even if among these only three can be considered the real protagonists of the work: there is Vince, who desperately fighting for the safety of her family members, and then Zoe, her daughter, who will have to deal with everything she saw happening at the motel as an adult. Finally we find Jay, the youngest and mildest of the three Holt brothers, constantly torn between his moral sense and loyalty to his family. The unmistakable style of As Dusk Falls Throughout the first book the narration continues without any weak point and indeed, net of some clichs typical of detective stories, it even manages to be exhilarating by bringing into play many very high-voltage situations that have been able to keep us in suspense, slowing down only from time to time to offer narrative parentheses that reveal some crucial details about the lives of the characters and the relationships that bind them. The first cracks in the structure of the story began to emerge during the second book, which violently presses the brake pedal to conindulge in endless narrative detours centered on characters who have no real role in the core of the story. We liked the sections dedicated to Jay a lot, but the sudden disappearance of some protagonists and a subtle but very evident inconsistency between Zoe's behavior and the choices made in the first half of As Dusk Falls irretrievably deteriorated the feeling of deep involvement that we were rehearsing up to that point. Let me be clear, the plot of the second half of the game is not to be considered terrible from every point of view and is all in all enjoyable, but it struggles to drag the player even minimally and represents an unforgivable wasted opportunity if we take for example the excellent quality of the first part of the story. What really went sideways, however, is the inexplicable open ending that let the credits roll immediately after a sensational twist capable of distorting all the events seen previously. The studio has never made any reference to the presence of a third book and, while the idea of expanding the story of As Dusk Falls could fit, it would have been much more elegant for a new intellectual property to solve all the problems by the end of the game plots remained open up to that moment, to delegate each narrative revolution to a possible sequel. A unique graphic style Vince and his wife Michelle For its debut title, Interior/Night has chosen not to deviate from that classic gameplay system that characterizes most productions of this type, aware however that this would have risked making As Dusk Falls an anonymous drop in the ocean interactive adventures, often so similar to each other as to eclipse each other. To stem the problem, the studio decided to characterize the game with a particularly original graphic style, which combines 3D environments with two-dimensional images. The actors acted out their script in the flesh, to then be digitized within the game in a very faithful way, with a style similar to that of a graphic novel. We have to admit, we appreciated this solution across the board, as it is not only inspired and original, but also because it allowed us to immerse ourselves more in the fate of each character. Returning to the gameplay, As Dusk Falls uses the same intricate system of choices so dear to the productions of Quantic Dream, seasoning the flow of the story with a myriad of quick time events which in the case of the title directed by Marchal are never really challenging. In the course of the adventure we will have just made a couple of mistakes, and we were surprised to discover in subsequent tests that most of them in any case do not lead to new aspects of the plot. Destinies crossed by our choices The As Dusk Falls choices interface Simplicity and irrelevance of the QTEs, however, do not represent a hiccup in our opinion but the result of a specific creative vision within the development team. During the 7 hours of play that led us to the end credits, it was easy to realize that according to the author, a crucial point in the plot could not depend on the wrong pressing of a button, but only on a weighted choice of the gamer. In this sense, we do not feel like condemning the philosophy of Interior / Night a priori, also because As Dusk Falls has a particularly deep system of choices, at least by the standards of interactive adventures. As evidenced by the summary graph at the end of each chapter, the paths that the plot can take are truly innumerable and often the consequences of a specific decision materialize only years after it has been taken, presenting us with a very high bill. The influence of the player's choices on the flow of the story, in addition to giving us the impression of being the real architects of the fates of the characters, helps to dramatically extend the boundaries of replayability offered by As Dusk Falls, as we assure you that your first impulse once you get to the end credits will be to return immediately to relive some moments of the adventure to discover alternative developments. We also remind you that the title can be played from start to finish together with seven other friends, even via mobile devices thanks to a handy companion app, and we can't imagine anything more fun than reliving the junctures of the story of Vince, Jay and Zoe making together those decisions that will shape the future. The cooperative, local and online, is unquestionably a huge strength of the first effort of Interior / Night, and our invitation to Game Pa subscription holdersss can only be to organize a lobby as large as possible to enjoy As Dusk Falls in the company of some friends. You will not regret it. Technical compartment Zoe as an adult Considering the style it adopts, it would have been silly to expect technical problems from As Dusk Falls, but we were still pleased to find that everything is in its place and works properly. The game runs smoothly on Xbox Series X and there's really nothing we can report to you, except for a few small imperfections that closely concern the Italian localization. The game includes full voice acting of excellent quality, but suffers from obvious audio mixing problems, with some dialogue that is barely audible, while others are played too loudly. For the rest, the audio sector proves to be up to the artistic one, accompanying the story with a splendid soundtrack composed of some country tracks that perfectly match the desert atmospheres at the center of the game.", "date": "2022-07-18", "grade": "7.5"}
