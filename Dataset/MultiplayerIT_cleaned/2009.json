{"name": "Stuntman", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stuntman_a.html", "text": "The game is all here: you start a stunt, you make a mistake, you start again (after a long and annoying loading), you pass the first obstacle, you pass it, another obstacle, you make a mistake (loading, all over again), you learn, you avoid it, and so on until the end of the stunt, practically if the game was called Dragon's Lair and instead of cars we had to deal with castles, traps and dragons, and above all if we were in the mid-80s and not in 2002 , we will be faced with a masterpiece of playability, beautiful and innovative. And instead Stuntman is only a half-successful game, at first it seems to be a lot of fun, the first missions, or rather shooting, are undoubtedly good, a series of races against traffic between the London docks, aboard unequivocally old cars seventy, but unfortunately after a while the excitement and fun give way to boredom, and a general feeling of bitterness in the mouth. I understand that the cinematic setting imposes certain rhythms and certain repetitions, but we all know that Gran Turismo is not based only on the acquisition of licenses. Something is missing and unfortunately in this case it is the game itself. Everything is disconcertingly flat, absurdly one could finish the title even with one's eyes closed, it would be enough to time the seconds between one swerve and another and the game is done. Graphically then the title is certainly not a masterpiece, at times well done with numerous touches of class, it must be said, but more generally it navigates in a context without infamy and without praise. The damage that is inflicted on the cars is very beautiful, in other words practically everything breaks, and above all the behavior of the cars is heavily influenced by the condition of the car. The cars themselves are more than decently made: they don't reach the magnificence of the Poliphony masterpiece, but they are well made, well modeled and fairly detailed. It has been said of the numerous touches of class, first of all everything that can be broken seems to realistically live life right after the impact: pins, crates, bins roll and are thrown around the screen with a naturalness rarely seen lately. Practically the infamous interactivity with the seabed is expressed here at the highest levels. The same can be said for the film's extras present on the scene, who run away in hysterical fits when we find ourselves with the fender too close to their little girls. In this case, a hilarious team of masons who, once their scaffolding has been devastated according to the law, flee to safety in the throes of hysterics, running like madmen on what remains of the scaffolding. The qualitative level of the backdrops is discontinuous: first of all it must be said that they abound in terms of objects and details on the screen, given that the objective of the graphic sector was to achieve a sort of photorealism, which would allow us to clearly grasp the place of unfolding of the film. All of this has certainly conditioned the overall rendering of textured images, sometimes well detailed and sometimes flat and dull, especially on everything that remains in the background; moreover Stuntman in the most agitated phases of the action is sometimes prey to various slowdowns and jerks. The audio sector also stands at very high levels: first of all, the title is all in Italian, and what is unusual, the acting of the voice actors is of an excellent level. So what about the title Reflections? The excellent initial idea was not followed by an equally valid construction of the game, which more than a real title gives the impression of being an infinitely dilated demo, not very varied and supported by a game system that frankly is not very stimulating It is funny. Pros: many cars physics Cons: little fun boring laser game in disguise The cinema for you As per tradition, the Reflections, already known to the general public for the Driver and Destruction Derby series, rewrite the now highly inflated racing game genre in an unorthodox way. And they are doing it now by overturning the approach of the aforementioned Driver series: if before the game was clearly inspired by cinema or paratelevision, now the question has shifted not to cinema, but to how cinema is made. In fact, Stuntman allows us to create a whole series of stunts typical of a certain cinema and certain video games (Driver and Gta), with the only difference that skidding in the wrong place in the new Reflections title means hearing them scream ~cut!!~ by the director, and start the scene all over again. The main game mode is the classic one called career, in which our alter ego has the difficult task of leading toend of the scenes respecting parameters such as the route, the time available and the objects to be knocked down. If you make a mistake in driving, as I already said before, you start all over again. The scenes belong to six highly adrenaline action movies set around the world: Egypt, London, Bangkok, Louisiana, Montecarlo and the Alps will be the backdrop for skids, jumps and skids that have nothing to envy to films like Bullit and Ronin . In addition to the main mode there are others, which allow us to create stunts specially created by us by winning pieces of scenery, such as barrels, crate jumps and so on (Stunt Editor), or to try to perform perfect precision tests, speed and stunt (Stunt Trials). This is the Reflections game, a set of increasingly difficult trials set in decently crafted and realistic polygonal environments. Now let's go back to talking about Career mode: I said that you have to respect some parameters, time, paths and objects to knock down, but the real obstacle that confronts us is memorizing what we will meet in the scene to be interpreted. This is the secret of the game: as in a modern laser game, remembering the exact positioning of the obstacles is essential, otherwise you will have to redo the scene. If the scene is short, you can get over it right away, otherwise you learn it piece by piece, and then perform it all correctly by heart. That's it, clearly the situations are quite varied, as well as the physics of the many cars at our disposal that respond perfectly to the tortures to which they are subjected. Concentration more than skill becomes essential to perform the stunts correctly, it is not enough just to be quick with the pad, you need to have a good photographic memory and strong nerves.", "date": "2002-09-18", "grade": null}
