{"name": "L'oscurit di Capcom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/117652-dragons-dogma-dark-arisen-loscurita-di-capcom.html", "text": "There was more than one reason not to leave a title like Dragon's Dogma in the shadow of its flaws, even if they didn't stop it from becoming a classic among fans of Western-style RPGs. A genre tackled with surprising vigor by Capcom, which has not been frightened by the difficulty of the lens and has even managed to give its own characteristics that have marked its personality, as remarked in our review. The project was also of considerable size, with a team of 150 elements led by three prestigious names in the oriental videogame scene: Hyroiuki ~Dino Crisis~ Kobayashi, Kento ~Monster Hunter~ Inoshita and Hideaki ~Devil May Cry~ Itsuno. It was therefore foreseeable that the support would continue a year after the original release, so much so that the Japanese company has opted for an all-encompassing re-edition of the title. Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is therefore a stand-alone package that includes the main campaign, all the released DLCs and a new expansion full of surprises, naturally applying as the ideal and definitive experience for those who have not yet experienced the adventures of Gransys. Let's analyze the new proposals, remembering that it will be possible to import old saves by earning a series of additional bonuses. Welcome to Black Chasm The first feature that catches the eye is the presence of two discs (for the 360 version): while the first contains the main game and the expansion, the second allows you to install a high resolution texture pack and the Japanese language. Already such an addition shows that no expense has been spared for this ~remix~, the original language is certainly an interesting plus for enthusiasts, while the texture pack guarantees a considerable advantage which translates into a decrease in pop-in and uploads that plagued the original. To access the new adventure contained in Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen we must go to Cassardis, our hometown, head to the dock and talk to a mysterious woman named Orla, a dialogue that will allow us to reach the mysterious island of Nerabisso, scenario of the entire expansion. However, some prerogatives are necessary, Orla appears only at night and the developers suggest using characters not lower than the fiftieth level. The reasons lie in the high level of difficulty proposed by Nerabisso, designed precisely to satisfy those eager for ever more demanding challenges. For all those who start from the beginning it is therefore advisable to tackle the main adventure first, even if it is still possible to access the additional content after a few hours of play. Once you arrive at your destination, you immediately notice the decisive tone for the new content, oriented towards more lugubrious and gothic atmospheres. A choice that we appreciate precisely because it is detached from the idyllic atmosphere of Gransys. The technical realization bears witness to the period since the original release through more detailed and evocative structures. The island is shrouded in darkness, as soon as we land we are faced with a menacing manor that is not a little reminiscent of Konami's Castlevania and which hides a boundless underground area full of dangers. Xbox 360 goals As also written in the body of the review, Dark Arisen does not offer any additional objectives to those already present in Dragon's Dogma. A choice of Capcom that can be criticized and decidedly against the tide. Appointment with death The quotes do not end here, given that one of the unpublished enemies that we find in Dark Arisen is Death, the black lady in little flesh, many bones and the inseparable scythe, determined to prematurely end our adventure. As we had already had the opportunity to try in the preview code, this very powerful enemy is a sort of persistent boss capable of unleashing panic with each appearance. Particularly formidable is the ability to instantly kill a pawn, a move anticipated by the bluish glow of its lantern which must serve as an alarm bell for the player to recall the pawns to himself. Defeating death is not a practicable operation in the first hours of the game, this fact combined with the characteristic of appearing at non-pre-set moments really keeps the tension high, in addition to the fact that the pawns can only be recovered from the rebirth stone and their demise risks to leave us in uncomfortable situations. However, we are only at the tip of the iceberg, as the gigantic dungeon welcomes many other creatures created for the occasion by Capcom. Among these we mention the Gore cyclops, enhanced versions of those that we can find along Gransys, equipped with an armor that makes it difficultshear the climb to defeat them, the worms and the maneaters, annoying monsters that can spring from the chests by imposing adequate caution in the search for treasures. The clashes are really difficult, so much so as to repeatedly recall a title that has now made school in this sense: Dark Souls. Again in terms of novelties, new skill rings and decidedly powerful cursed weapons have been added, but which must be cleaned up by Orla before they can be used, an operation that will not make you regret the various backtracking of the case. Also worth mentioning is the presence of a new character, Barroch, a very experienced Arisen, functional in the role of shop within the adventure. Thanks to its services we can freely manage the inventory, carry out the buying and selling of objects and the change of skills. As mentioned, the Nerabisso dungeon offers a more demanding challenge than the base game and its structure facilitates the exploration of the environments, as well as escapes in the presence of enemies out of our reach. All this guarantees a duration of fifteen to twenty hours, depending on the completion of the side quests, an impressive amount of material for an expansion that also includes new skills, armor and objects; but that's not all. Fit for the summer As previously mentioned Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen also influences the basic adventure, essentially representing an improved version that also involves the graphics sector. The menu and opening song are brand new, new character creation customizations are offered, and the engine is reinvigorated by appreciable graphical refinements thanks to the installable package. The slowdowns are also greatly reduced and in our build we have not found any trace of tearing. Most important of all are the various tweaks made to the gameplay to make the experience less angular than a year ago, primarily the greater availability of crystals for rapid teleportation. Capcom has therefore taken the criticisms very seriously, inserting a whole series of benefits that will be mainly appreciated by those who start the adventure from the beginning. On the other hand, there are still technical limitations that are not tolerable, such as the impossibility of swimming, and the odious presence of the black bands, probably made necessary in order not to overburden the proprietary MT Framework engine. The active area is therefore still not fully exploited, with an annoying sense of constraint that somehow pollutes the gaming experience. Sadly, it looks like we'll have to wait for the next generation to enjoy a full-screen sequel. The total absence of extra objectives for this expansion also left us particularly dumbfounded, a demonstration of laziness from Capcom that we did not expect. Their presence would certainly have guaranteed greater appeal to the package, too bad.", "date": "2013-04-23", "grade": "8.6"}
