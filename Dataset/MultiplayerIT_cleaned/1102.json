The title developed by Sumo Digital Newcastle has now left behind the Early Access phase dedicated to those who had pre-ordered the title and has finally made its debut on the market. After spending a fair number of hours between blades and arrows hunting for treasures to offer to the people, we are therefore ready to tell you our definitive judgment in the Hood: Outlaws & Legends review. Robin Hood's Britain Hood: Outlaws & Legends - action and frenzy Before starting, however, it must be emphasized that the genre of belonging and the already announced post-launch support could drastically change the gaming experience in the future. In this case we will certainly be ready to offer you an overview of the change made to the title published by Focus Entertainment. The first element we want to talk about is the artistic side. Hood: Outlaws & Legends is a PvPvE title that does not currently have a classic single player PvE component dedicated to narrative and therefore leaves the story of the world of game and why you find yourself playing those characters in those situations. From this point of view, the game shows a truly excellent level. The proposed environments are of the highest level with nature that joins medieval buildings in an evocative and suggestive way. Each of the 5 maps available at launch represents the iconography to which the myth of Robin of Loxley aka Robin Hood is associated, but above all it superbly represents England in the 1200s. The imagery offered is therefore a point in favor of the work of Sumo Digital who wants to immerse the player in the context also thanks to the beauty of the game environment. Hood: Outalws & Legends: The gorgeous level of art The same can be said about the graphics level. The textures, the shadows, the lighting and even the density of the grass satisfied us given and also considering the price with which the game enters the market. Unfortunately, however, the same cannot be said of technical optimization. Especially on PC, we have repeatedly found ourselves in front of dancing sessions in terms of animations, character interpenetration and frame drops. Unfortunately, if the setting is full of interesting ideas, the characters conceptually well made on an artistic level suffer from disconnected animations which make, for example, the race extremely funny to see. It is not uncommon to come across State soldiers hitting you from under the ground or seeing grazed bodies being catapulted towards infinity and beyond. Problems that in our view the team of 60 developers brought with them by choosing a cross-gen nature for the game. On the other hand, in terms of sound, we underline how Hood: Outlaws & Legends supports the excellent artistic work with a good attention to audio detail. The footsteps punctuated by the dull sound of the armours, the sound of the arrows shot or the impact of the weapons with the different surfaces is as good as the work done on the ambient sounds. For the wallet or for the people Hood: Outlaws & Legends: the Sheriff Now that we've covered the ~minor~ issues let's get to the bone of contention: the gameplay. We used two specials to tell you how the four classes work: a tank, an assassin, a support and a long range dps. We will not dwell on the technical analysis of the combat system yet. From the very beginning of its announcement, the Hood project seemed full of interesting ideas. These ideas were then confirmed as the game was deepened with trailers and presentations and once we were able to try it, we actually found ourselves faced with an original and intriguing title. The idea of pushing two teams to use strategies and synergies to get the loot and the use of a small pool of characters continues to be a very fascinating path for us. Unfortunately, however, the implementation suffers, in our view, from serious problems of balance and structure. Let's start with the second problem. From this point of view, Hood has two big flaws: the matchmaking structure and the teams. The matchmaking is not skill based, in fact you could happen to be at level 1 and play with full team teams at level 60. This problem, probably dictated by a system that gives more importance to the stability of the connection than to the skill level of the players, guarantees an imbalance that in certain games can be very frustrating. Especially for those who want to approach the game in the future. Also, since there is no division between casual and ranked matches,but with only one online match system, players can't even hope for a newbie-only mode. Hood: Outlaws & Legends: John the Wrangler The second problem concerns the structure of the teams. The reduction of the pool of heroes available compared to other hero based games has prompted the developers not to insert a lock on the number of copies of the same hero. This decision, due to the problems that we will see below, negatively affects the games. Having a team of four Rangers stationed on the tower of the fortress and targeting your spawn point, killing you upon rebirth, becomes problematic, especially if playing alone a team composed only of Wranglers has happened. Now we come to the age-old problem of balancing. Hood is an extremely fun game when played in team, but extremely wrong in some of its mechanics. In fact, balancing is problematic in two ways: at the level of the heroes and at the level of the mechanics of the currently available mode. As for the heroes, the imbalance is clearly all towards the Ranger and the Mystic both, in our view, capable of inflicting too much damage, especially from a greater range than the other classes. The Monk has a heavy attack capable of keeping opponents at a distance that it is capable of killing in two shots, while the Ranger can with a single arrow to the head eliminate anyone. As for the mechanics of the Heist mode, the game currently contemplates the possibility that a team does nothing for the whole game and in the last 10 seconds wins. But let's go in order. Hood: Outlaws & Legends: The Ranger in action As we have repeatedly underlined, the proposed method is divided into three phases: the identification of the Sheriff and the removal of the key, the opening of the strong room in the fortress and the extraction of the casket. At present a team can make the opponents do everything, wait for the latter to bring the chest to the extraction point, start and almost complete the securing of the treasure and only when the extraction is almost completed intervene by killing all the opponents, completing the phase themselves and winning the match. This problem has occurred several times during the matches and could easily be fixed by restarting the extraction phase once a different team activates the safety of the chest. Hood then has many small pearls such as the possibility to customize the style of play with unlockable perks by leveling up with the heroes or the possibility at the end of the game, after a victory, to choose whether to pocket the loot or give it to the people for the increase of the camp level (i.e. the game hub/menu). We really liked the same characterization of the Sheriff (homage to Mr. X from Resident Evil Village). However, all these beautiful ideas are extremely obscured by a playful infrastructure that is currently problematic.", "date": "2021-05-11", "grade": "7.0"}
