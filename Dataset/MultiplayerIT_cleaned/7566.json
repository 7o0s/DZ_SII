Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Those who know the Adult Swim-branded productions know well what their prerogatives are, in this case a black humor and anything but ~politically correct~. Now in its third episode, the Amateur Surgeon series perfectly embodies these assumptions, putting us in the gown of a very particular surgeon, grappling with decidedly absurd cases, apparently desperate, to be solved using equipment that would be the envy of Dr. Frankenstein: a pizza cutter instead of a scalpel, a car battery as a defibrillator, a vacuum cleaner to suck up any scraps, a stapler to close the cuts, a pair of kitchen tongs to extract any objects and so on. Anyone who has played Trauma Center on Nintendo DS or Wii knows well what the type of gameplay of this kind of ~simulation~ is, in which there is a time limit available for each case and a degree of difficulty that grows from patient to patient , arriving at really complicated situations to solve, which require precision, speed and a certain amount of luck. Amateur Surgeon 3 takes us by the hand and accompanies us during the first interventions, explaining which tools to use and how, but then leaves us at the mercy of ourselves, as it should be, and supports us with a really well done rewards system, which releases stars based on the results achieved and also reserves a couple for bonus objectives, decisively promoting replayability given that the new scenarios are unlocked precisely in relation to the number of stars in our possession. Amateur Surgeon 3 is a very multifaceted and entertaining game full of absurd situations and characters Doctor, call a doctor The experience of Amateur Surgeon 3 is enriched by the presence of a series of absurd assistants: from the dog that ~licks~ the patient's wounds, increasing his vital energy, to the procrastinator robot that increases the time available to us, passing through shady figures that multiply the score, chain the combos and so on. The freemium aspects of the Adult Swim product materialize precisely in the availability of partners, who must be ~recharged~ or unlocked by spending coins that we can also use to enhance the tools of the trade. In reality, a little practice is enough to make the presence of the assistants mostly superfluous, and to be able to complete even the supplementary challenges without the need for extra characters other than the aforementioned little dog (useful when we are forbidden to use syringes for give back some energy to the subject we are operating on). In short, you can play quietly and complete the campaign without putting a hand in your wallet, provided that the three ~continues~ (the bags of blood) that recharge within a certain number of minutes are enough. As for the actual action, sometimes you run into some problems with the touch controls, which on the iPhone screen can find obstacles in the graphical interface itself, when for example this goes to temporarily cover a wound with a warning or with an icon, making us lose precious moments. Since it's best to play using your index finger rather than your thumb, it goes without saying that things work better on the larger iPad screen, even if it's ultimately a matter of nuance. What we have no doubts about is instead the goodness of the graphic characterization: on the operating table you will literally find everything from giant insects to crocodiles. In one mission our goal is even to ~operate~ on a chastity belt haunted by spirits, which gives you an idea of the madness of Amateur Surgeon 3. The only sour note is the sound accompaniment, which appears to be well made but generally ~off topic~.", "date": "2013-10-12", "grade": "8.3"}
