Zynga knows this perfectly well, since we are talking about the house he created Farmville; but he also knows that this trend saw an evolution when a second, strategic type was added to the management phase, with the use of troops in the field that users were busy developing and enhancing between collection and the other of money or fuel. Titles such as Clash of Clans, just to mention the best known. Well, Empires & Allies belongs precisely to this vein, and tries to diligently follow the path traced by its predecessors with the aim, however, of enriching certain aspects of the experience. The situation that is presented is somewhat Risk-style, with various geographical areas to be conquered with your own troops; troops which, however, must be made to grow gradually, taking care of the development of a base whose purpose is to gather resources and defend one's borders from the attack of other players, with a view to an asynchronous multiplayer mode which can sometimes act as a from a convenient reserve of virtual money and experience points useful for getting around the limits of the freemium model. Goal achieved? Yes and no: although during the first hours the Empires & Allies experience appears unusually free and without particular constraints, once you reach level ten the authors' attempt to monetize becomes evident, otherwise there will be an excessive wait between an operation and the other. The troops lost in battle regenerate quickly, this must be said, but facing certain clashes without adequate upgrades becomes really difficult at a certain point. Empires & Allies manages to deal with a very inflated genre and introduce interesting ideas Rogue strategy What is the difference between the new Zynga title and its many competitors? In fact, in the new management phase, we do not see any new features: we need to build a headquarters, buildings for the extraction of resources and their storage, some defense mechanisms (walls, mines, towers, landing areas for troops, etc.) and finally the paved spaces where the attacking units are organized. We start with simple soldiers, to gradually unlock light and heavy armored vehicles, planes and so on. As mentioned, the regeneration of the units is rather rapid (we are generally speaking of a minute to restore their original number following a defeat), but the same cannot be said of the upgrades, closely linked to the general growth of the base and then to the freemium aspects we were talking about earlier. Despite the slowness in obtaining specific progress, however, the strategic phase of Empires & Allies really makes the difference and convinces right away, although some limitations remain, such as the impossibility of piloting the movement of troops if not releasing flares on the map. Once a target has been selected from those available (with entire geographical areas to be ~liberated~, one piece at a time), we will be able to take a look at the disposition of the defenses and then eventually decide to proceed with the attack. At that point everything will take place by releasing the units and acting on the icons located in the lower right part of the screen, which activate the aforementioned signal flares but also and above all air attacks of various types, essential for destroying or at least ~softening certain defense positions. For the rest, everything depends on understanding which units are more effective against the various types of tower, so as to carry out a targeted attack, which leads to the conquest of the area in a short time and without losses. A gameplay with some interesting ideas, in short, which proves to be effective and which is accompanied by a technical sector functional to the action, with fluid and freely zoomable graphics, even if repetitive in the connotation of the scenarios.", "date": "2015-05-16", "grade": "7.5"}
