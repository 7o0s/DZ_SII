When it arrived on the market about ten years ago, the genre was in steep decline, but with just as much force it tried to experiment, also offering original and particular derivatives such as Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey. In that panorama, a Square Enix now deprived of some of its key points, lived the first strong phases of its confusion, the one we unfortunately still know today. Despite the past decade, it is more the smoke from the embers of the Japanese software house than a good roast. The Last Remnant perhaps represents one of the few examples of experimentation that are still worth the benefit of the doubt. A far from masterful title, however, it attempted to modernize and simplify (even too much) some exploratory mechanics, to focus on the innovation of the combat system. Reevaluated over time, like all extremely avant-garde works, it now arrives on Nintendo Switch, and we can only advise you to at least give it a chance. Yet another research story Let's start right away by saying that The Last Remnant lives two lives totally separate from each other. This element is found in practically every aspect of the game. This is why the plot is no exception and, if it initially starts from a strongly stereotyped situation, it manages to grow over time and give more than one surprise. The protagonist is Rush Sykes, Irina's brother and son of a couple of very important scientists who study the Remnant (artifacts of great power but also with great pretensions). The two boys are waiting to be able to reconcile with their parents, when a group of unidentified hostiles attacks them and kidnaps Irina. Rush now cornered, frees a dormant power in him and defeats his opponents, convinced to look for his little sister and punish those responsible. From this assumption, a campaign unfolds capable of occupying about thirty hours only as regards the main quest (the time can easily be tripled by wanting to complete each secondary task). The difficult element to digest is really starting with the handbrake on. The first hours of the game are characterized by a push and pull between dungeons of a disarming flatness and chatter within the main halls of the cities; it is almost unnerving to get out of this first phase, which is however able to give a very important and favorable sprint for the game, also thanks to a disproportionate amount of places to visit on the world map. As mentioned, the main quest, of discreet workmanship, is accompanied by a whole series of secondary tasks which, however, offer nothing more than small actions to be performed, totally forgetting to deepen the background of the game world narratively. And this element is a great pity considering the quality with which the cutscenes are treated, the acting in excellent English and a lip synchronization that is almost atypical for a product of that time (and certainly not with a huge budget). However, it remains a pleasant adventure that is able to relaunch itself right on the gameplay front. A jrpg like you've never seen before We have already said how The Last Remnant is an atypical product, and how much this detail unfolds in positive and negative elements. Specifically, it seems difficult not to realize the slowness of a campaign that struggles to mesh, dividing itself between long sections of dialogue and movement within specific dungeons. It is strange to think of this problem, if you then analyze the resulting gameplay, which reduces any possible waste of time inherent in the genre to the bone. If you were used to growing up with those classic elements of JRPG exploration: an open map of a gigantic world, made up of branches, dungeons, large cities and dozens and dozens of clashes between one point of interest and another, well, forget everything. The Last Remnant is divided into specific zones, which reveal themselves on a drawn world map, only when required by specific assignments. There is no possibility to explore, to wander or to take liberties in this sense. Even the cities are managed through a very particular 3D map which allows the selection of the ~district~, usually containing vendors and similar. Every delay, every exploratory phase and all those classic dictates that made the JRPG the genre as it was known, melted like snow in the sun in a totally different system. If we think back to the fact that, despite this, the duration of the title is respectable, it is easy to understand how we are faced with a respectable playful offer. It must be said that one of the elements that can raise the time of gioco, it is precisely the combat phase: always managed in turns, but without random encounters, The Last Remnant totally revolutionized the concept of combat in an RPG. The individuality of the elements of a team totally loses its meaning, to the point of not viewing your own number of life points but that of the entire union to which they belong. Customization is bare-bones and is essentially only possible for Rush. Even the classic level growth disappears, leaving everything to a general degree of power of the various groups, which can in turn evolve their attacks by dint of using them in battle. With these assumptions, the fights take place in a totally different way compared to what has been done in the past (and also compared to what has never been presented in the genre in the following ten years) making The Last Remnant a substantially unique title. What unfortunately doesn't work with this system is a certain learning difficulty, which leaves you dumbfounded and shaken in the early stages and which is practically never really explored with a successful tutorial, requiring the player to pay total attention to understand its depth. However, this does not exclude the goodness of a successful and fresh mechanics, which still today overcomes the obstacle of time and is capable of giving great satisfaction. When you learn the best use of arts of war, mystique, the right rules of engagement and encirclement and everything that completes the combat system, the game knows how to entertain with great capacity. Compared to ten years ago, another major limitation has also disappeared, that of the checkpoint. Precisely by their nature, the fights can be damned long (the more enemies you face together, the more resources you will get) and the possibility of resuming just before, rather than having to repeat entire sections of dungeons, is certainly a great godsend. Technical ups and downs The Last Remnant is powered by the now ancient Unreal Engine 3: a graphics engine that has however given us great satisfaction during the past generation. As far as the polygonal and texture aspect is concerned, the game still defends itself very well today against the protagonists and supporting actors, also thanks to a more than satisfactory remastered version. The same cannot be said for environments and dungeons, which live on that imperishable Japanese problem of the total lack of attention to detail. Everything is bare and dead, close to total desolation, so separated from the protagonist who visits the places that he always becomes an element forced into it with some strange reshuffling of the code. His perennial skating on the ground certainly doesn't help in this, with some glaring collision problems. Same sad speech for a soundtrack that doesn't even come close to the great lyrics of other important Square Enix masterpieces, but merely accompanies the adventure without infamy and without praise. On the other hand, excellent fluidity and rendering of this Switch version, which does not struggle at all in returning a decent version of the remastering. The game also enjoys a more than decent adaptation in Italian, which is never something to be underestimated.", "date": "2019-06-24", "grade": "7.8"}
