{"name": "Snk vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Ds - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/snk-vs-capcom-card-fighters-ds-recensione.html", "text": "No. The story tells of the card tower, a place in charge of the education of young card-masters, in which the whimsical headmaster/inventor has created a brand new system used to make the cards fight: a super-computer named MAX. Misfortune has it that the computer, with the progress of its programming, slowly wins, self-generates a conscience and decides that the time has finally come for him to conquer the planet. MAX thus decides to implement his plans of conquest by absorbing the soul of the principal - his inventor - and to hold all the students of the school as mental hostages with the exception of the three protagonists. The three will have to make their way to the sound of card fights against fellow school mates, to finally reach the top floor of the tower to stop the plans of the terrible computer. The story that gravitates around the game - it must be said for the avoidance of doubt - probably represents one of the weakest points of the game itself: it is specious, bland, without any bite and above all slow, often 'killing' those few moments of real play . In the rare moments of non-conversation, the player has the opportunity to wander through the various floors of the tower, fighting against classmates to remove them from the evil influence of MAX. The game plays out like the classic card-based video game, where between breaks in the unfolding story, players are required to fight against a series of opponents until they reach the final boss. The path established by the game develops, as mentioned earlier, along the card tower, with the possibility of choosing between different elevators to move from one floor to another, thus deciding whether to undertake a shorter but more difficult journey or vice versa. long but far simpler. Along the wandering between levels, the player also has the opportunity to stop at the shop to buy new, precious playing cards to insert in his deck (each deck contains a maximum of 50 cards, it is up to each player to personalize his own by meeting what he it's personal fighting style). The card tower The second weak link of Card Fighters Ds is undoubtedly represented by the combat system: a card game is appreciated by a small niche of players, a card game based on the capcom/snk universe narrows the circle even more, and a card game based on capcom/snk with a simplistic game structure and decidedly without solid rules and base zeroes the appeal altogether. Card Fighters Ds presents one of the most basic game systems ever seen in a card game, we are far from the complexity of a magic, or a yu-gi oh, the game seems to want to play down the difficulty of this genre, even trying to keep a serious approach. The entire game structure is based on strength points, elements that regulate the player's ability to place cards on the playing field. The strength points are divided by color (yellow, red, green, blue and neutral) and each card - based on its value - is associated with a certain number of strength points necessary to be able to position it. The moment you find yourself with cards on the bank, the tactics of the game drastically drop the tension, since the player is only given the option to attack, merge with a character of the same class or counterattack if you find yourself in a defense turn. The gaming experience -unfortunately- ends here, and the rest of the battle is decided by the slow scan of the life points (2000 at the beginning of the fight) which go down towards zero. And off to the next fight. Another point against the game is represented by the scarce use of the license of the characters in the game: although there are more than 400 cards (relating to as many Capcom/SNK characters), the value of the cards and their characteristics are in no way linked to the peculiarities of the card itself, almost making the character portrayed on the playing card an artwork of dubious utility. The card tower And since all good things come in threes, the entire audio/video sector should be forgotten. The game seems to have remained in the Neo Geo Pocket era, the settings are desolate and repetitive (not that the inside of a tower can be very detailed) and the animations of the card fights are reduced to a series of 4/5 effects in which these are struck by lightning, cut by swords, pierced by guns or punched. The melodies that accompany the adventures of the protagonists unfortunately follow the progress of the game, slow and repetitive, quickly tiring and falling into monotonous from the first fights.i on the ground floor of the tower. SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Ds is a very bad experiment. It manages to disappoint in all aspects of a card game and even fails in terms of the presentation of Capcom and SNK characters. The game is monotonous, with an oversimplified combat system and seasoned with a heartbreaking story at times, and it's a real shame considering the gold mine SNK Playmore is sitting on. Too bad the Japanese are currently looking elsewhere. Pros: Game system understandable to anyone... Cons: ...but far too simplified SNK/Capcom characters practically unused Story too invasive and very uninteresting What happens when you combine characters from the SNK universe with those from Capcom and pour them all onto the DS? No, unfortunately the answer is not the one you would like to hear, but rather something like: ~the result is a card game that is in fact a sort of remix of an old game for Neo Geo Pocket~. With SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Ds, SNK Playmore follows the wave of card games on Ds, with a product that 'older' gamers will remember well, updating it with the potential of the Ds and providing it with an improved game structure , may it be the right time to clear card fights?", "date": "2007-09-18", "grade": null}
