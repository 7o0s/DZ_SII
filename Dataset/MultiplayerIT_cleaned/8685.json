All thanks to an extremely simple mechanic but able to exploit the touchscreen interface of iOS devices in an intelligent and apt way, exactly as it was for Cut the Rope two years ago. Developed by Soap Creative and distributed by Chillingo, Diggin' Dogs is the first puzzle game which, clearly inspired by the mechanics of the Disney hit, tries to make them its own and transform them in a decidedly interesting way. The result is a lively and light-hearted mobile game, made up of treasures to find, underground labyrinths full of traps and a trio of extraordinary protagonists. Dog digging... As the title itself suggests, Diggin' Dogs puts the player in the shoes of three furry dogs who, having come into possession of a mysterious treasure map, begin to dig far and wide in search of the precious loot. However, the canine trio is not controllable directly, but in a similar way to Where's My Water? you can erase parts of the terrain by simply rubbing your finger across the screen. In this way, by creating an underground tunnel at the feet of each dog, he will slide inside it ending up deeper and deeper, collecting all the objects along the way and finally reaching the golden boot that allows you to pass to the next level. Obviously, the game gradually introduces new traps and new enemies that push you to ponder your every move, and even if with a touch on the screen it is possible to make the three dogs get out of trouble with a jump, and by tilting the device it is possible to move them slightly, the fact remains that a tunnel in the wrong place or with a bad slope risks causing the wagging gang to end up straight towards a bat den. As if that weren't enough, to get the most out of each level you need to collect as many gold coins along the way, keep all three dogs alive, and don't forget the three bones hidden here and there; considering that it is possible to go down but not to go back up, the player must constantly be careful not to leave important objects behind. Finally, bizarre hats give dogs special abilities: a hat with a magnet, for example, allows you to attract all the coins in the vicinity, while one with a spray repellent keeps all insects away. If desired, it is also possible to create links between enemies and traps so that they eliminate each other, and indeed, very often using the obstacles of the scenario to one's advantage will be the only way to bring all three dogs to safety. However, the most interesting levels are those in which the three protagonists are in areas disconnected from each other: through the use of hats or particular tunnels, it is thus necessary to make them interact with each other and understand which one to carry on first. Sometimes the impossibility of controlling the camera proves to be a very hindrance, but in general the game is deep and pleasant despite the almost excessive simplicity of the game mechanics. Already after the first few levels, being able to get to the end with all three dogs alive and well becomes a considerable challenge, since a very small mistake is enough to make one roll straight into the lava or, even worse, to create a chain effect that ends to drag them all away. With its sixty levels spread across five different environments, each featuring unique enemies and traps, Diggin' Dogs also ensures a challenge that can last for several hours, especially if you want to collect all the objects and get the best result in each scenario.", "date": "2012-03-12", "grade": "8.0"}
