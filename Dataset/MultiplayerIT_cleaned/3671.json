{"name": "Descenders", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/descenders-recensione.html", "text": "The time of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and SSX at the top of the charts has long since passed, video games based on more or less extreme sports have been reduced to being niche titles, but this also opens up the possibility of reworking concepts in order to build something truly particular, despite apparently very canonized subjects, in their genre. The small Ragesquid team, for example, had an excellent idea for staging a videogame about downhill, that is to say that particular discipline in which crazy mountain bikers launch themselves at breakneck speed down extreme descents, trying to avoid obstacles and perform tricks along the path to the finish line. Instead of proposing a classic simulation, anchored on real experience, with Descenders they have introduced strongly arcade elements, approaching imaginative interpretations such as Trials but still maintaining a certain attachment to the sport to which the game refers, as we see in this review. In this way it is possible to shape the sporting experience in a freer way, introducing additional elements and enriching the gameplay, making the game more multifaceted and stimulating - in a word: fun - and at the same time more attractive to a wider audience. The original expression of downhill is pushed to paroxysm but maintaining a certain balance, above all thanks to a management of the physics that does not go too far from reality, avoiding excessive drifts and in any case keeping the level of challenge high both in terms of riding the bike and aerial tricks. This regards the basic mechanics of the game, i.e. the driving model and the implementation of stunts, but the peculiarities of Descenders are not limited to these elements and invade the entire structure of the game, introducing roguelike, open world, multiplayer features and managerial skills in what turns out to be a very special downhill simulation. Free descent Freedom of movement is the basic element on which Descenders is built, something that emerges evident both in the central hub from which you access the game options, made up of a large map that can be freely explored by bike and equipped with various height differences and structures to perform tricks, both within individual races. The dynamics of the race remain substantially the same in the different game modes proposed, which at the moment provide for two practically corresponding career types except for a different way of dealing with the progression of the character and a multiplayer mode in which you find yourself facing in the company of other players on the screen the same tests present in the single player, but with direct competition between the cyclists in the game and with rules that can be established independently. During the races, a route is proposed to reach the finish line at the bottom of the valley, but there is no compulsion to follow it, with the possibility of leaving the path and independently choosing any path within the open world structure of the various settings. There are clearly incentives to stay on track, but based on the situation we find ourselves in, we can strategically choose whether to follow the set route or cut through valleys, woods and cliffs to reach the finish line faster, thus bypassing obstacles and the ability to perform the tricks arranged on the track. The balance between the simulation elements and the arcade components is reflected in the composition of the tracks, which alternate descents more focused on evolutions with others all brought to speed, but also in the control system, which allows very unrealistic evolutions but always maintaining a certain basic physicality, however imposing precision and timing in order not to crash into an obstacle or after a particularly complicated jump. The freedom of approach and interpretation of the track also entails a considerable opening to different styles of play, which can be enhanced by the selection of the races to be faced, according to the particular progression system with differentiated stages. However, within the limits imposed by the configuration of the setting, in this way it is possible to decide whether to stick more to the classic style of downhill and specialize above all on speed and riding ability, dedicate oneself to the wildest aerial evolutions or switch from one style to another in more eclectic way depending on the situation. Rogue-bike Sounds pretty weird, but Descenders is a downhill game with rogue-like elements. These are suggestions, rather than properly defined characteristics, but in the progression system it is possible to notice traces of the tradition referring to the storico RPG. In Career mode, every time we start a game we have four ~lives~ available, at the end of which we are forced to start over from the beginning, keeping the unlocked objects and the previously accumulated reputation level, as well as the possibility of opening passages towards the more advanced settings by overcoming some particularly demanding tests. To extend lives and therefore the possibilities of going further, special objectives come into play, which are set randomly at the beginning of each race, requiring you to reach certain performances before crossing the finish line (reach a certain speed, do not brake , perform specific tricks and other special requests). In this way, the choice of following the track and taking advantage of the obstacles to perform stunts, or leaving everything alone to run at breakneck speed towards the finish line, becomes somewhat strategic, in case you want to try to expand the reserve of lives or get to the bottom of the track as soon as possible. Staying on track and completing stunts correctly amplifies the collection of Rep, i.e. the ~reputation~ points, whose flow amplitude (higher by remaining perfectly within the track) however may not be as important as simple survival or achievement of the goal in the least risky way possible, therefore also in this case the best path to follow derives exclusively from a personal choice. Another bizarre feature, which helps to build the strong identity of Descenders, is the possibility of choosing which races to face within a sort of map, following one's own path that leads to the final test. Each setting offers a large number of possible races to take part in, each characterized by particular elements of challenge: to the different balance between steepness, tortuousness and acrobatics, which are the basic elements of each track, random modifiers are added such as different climatic conditions and lighting or more complex obstacles than usual. Once again, it's up to the player to decide which path to take to get to the ~boss~, which here is represented by a level placed at the end of each setting and characterized by a particularly demanding challenge, usually a crazy jump that defies the laws of physics. Once the boss is over, you enter the next setting, with the possibility of opening a persistent shortcut if you win the final challenge several times. Always in line with the hybridization between genres, the progression of the character also passes through the unlocking of real perks capable of modifying the cyclist's skills and characteristics of the tracks, in the form of new crew members with special characteristics. There are also hints of managerial management for the character, who can sign contracts with sponsors who can provide bonuses such as special and exclusive equipment by completing specific objectives. Ambitious but acerbic Descenders' biggest weakness is the solidity of its performance, with frame-rate instability being an issue in several instances. In a game entirely focused on the sensation of speed, the conspicuous drops in fluidity that one encounters in certain moments strike in a particularly negative way, also considering that the cap seems positioned on 30 frames per second, therefore not a particularly high standard for a racing game. On a standard Xbox One, the frame-rate drops with some regularity especially in the presence of online activity with other players, together with a visible variation of the LOD on the elements of the approaching track which can be annoying, even if it does not affect much in the gaming experience. These are problems that could easily be corrected with subsequent updates but return the feeling of a game that has not yet been optimized, almost at the level of an early access title, especially if the polygonal complexity of the scenarios is not exactly impressive. Ragesquid is a very small team and the idea is that Descenders is a game perhaps even too ambitious in some respects, which explains the presence of technical roughnesses that also derive from conceptual choices. The levels are built in a procedural way (even the level editor only allows the setting of the basic variables for a random construction based on the chosen characteristics) and this entails, in addition to obvious advantages in terms of experience variety, also some less convincing consequences: first of all the rather long and frequent uploads before the start of each race for the constructiontion of the setting, which break the rhythm of the game a lot in the face of descents that are resolved in flares of a few seconds. Then, which can be subjectively interpreted in a positive or negative way, the fact of not granting an accurate study of the tracks: their procedural construction makes each level a unique experience, which eliminates the study and refinement factor of the performances in favor of more immediate and improvised approaches to each game. On the other hand, the selection of songs used for the soundtrack is really interesting and pleasant, never predictable and able to create an excellent atmosphere around the gaming experience.", "date": "2019-05-15", "grade": "7.0"}
