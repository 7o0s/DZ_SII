The installed base of almost ninety million Wiis in the world would suggest the opposite, after all it would be enough for 5% of the owners of the platform to buy a specific title to make it an immediate success; yet this is not the case, most Wii users are content to shake the controller a few times for a game of Wii Sports and leave the console off for the rest of the time. The video game industry has evidently adapted to this philosophy, and specifically the Activision productions related to the Transformers franchise demonstrate this thesis eloquently. If on the one hand, in fact, the publisher has wisely decided to diversify the product according to the technical capabilities of the platform for which it is developed, thus allocating a certain type of game to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 users to offer a different one to owners of Wii, on the other hand, this operation has recently taken on the connotation of a ~throw in the towel~, and Transformers 3: Stealth Force Edition exemplifies the concept as best it could be. Indeed, how to define a video game dedicated to a group of transformable robots without this transformation being rendered on the screen? ~An absurd nonsense~, perhaps. Pessimus Prime The gameplay of this undoubtedly original tie-in is based on the passage of the characters from the vehicular form to the hybrid form of the stealth mode, in which in practice their structure changes to allow them to perform otherwise impossible maneuvers, as well as to attack enemies using machine guns and a missile launcher. The eighteen missions that make up the single player campaign see us perform this operation continuously, however placing it as an obligation rather than a possibility. In Transformers 3: Stealth Force Edition, in fact, the player is forced to move continuously within the scenario in search of energon, missiles and temporary upgrades, because without them he cannot in any way face clashes of a certain duration. The energy bar is flanked by an indicator that regulates the ability to assume the hybrid form, and which must be ~recharged~ continuously in order not to risk being ~trapped~ in vehicle mode and therefore at the mercy of enemies. The undoubted frenzy of the action cannot be considered a merit of the title developed by Behavior Interactive, given that it does not allow alternatives and which, for this reason, severely limits the enjoyment of the experience. And speaking of enjoyment, the control system also leaves much to be desired: having wielded the Wii-mote and Nunchuk, we find ourselves managing the vehicle form simply with the analog stick (acceleration and brake included), while in stealth mode we can steer at three hundred and sixty degrees using the d-pad while we open fire by pressing the triggers B and Z. Convenient, right? All without calling into question the infrared pointer (thank goodness, it would have been even more uncomfortable) or any of the peculiarities of the Wii controllers. The game dynamics are basically the same for any usable character: Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide and Mirage on the Autobot front, while for the Decepticons we have Megatron, Soundwave, Lockdown and Crowbar. Much less than what you see Transformers 3: Stealth Force Edition also suffers from obvious problems in terms of structure. The difficulty of the game derives above all from the numerous limitations of the gameplay, but despite this it is possible to finish the story mode in just over a couple of hours. The fact of alternating the guide of Autobots and Decepticons during the adventure soon proves to be a gimmick of little value, even annoying in its conceptual implications (first you do everything you can to oppose a certain faction, then you find yourself doing the 'exact opposite...), which could have been handled much better. Similarly, the six supplementary missions to play together with a friend are not enough to make the Activision product long enough; also because we are always asked to do the same things: eliminate all enemies, activate a certain number of devices, hold out for a few minutes until reinforcements arrive, and so on. All within levels that would also have the dimensions and characteristics to accommodate gameplay of a much different thickness, and which therefore appear badly wasted for this mediocre example of ~hit and escape~ in a robotic key. From a technical point of view, things aren't even that bad: the graphics appear relatively clean and dignified, albeit contando on a far from exorbitant number of polygons, but in fact all the ~outline~ animations are missing (you pass to game over with a simple and sudden screenshot, for example) in addition to the polygonal models of the Autobots and Decepticons in their real form, which is actually no small thing. The game is dubbed in Italian, but apart from the usual Marco Balzarotti there is little to be happy about.", "date": "2011-07-01", "grade": "3.5"}
