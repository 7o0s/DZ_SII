{"name": "Wario World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wario-world-2.html", "text": "The unbearable lightness of being... rich. Developed by Treasure on behalf of Nintendo, Wario World starts from an extremely simple narrative premise, as tradition teaches. In his boundless lust for riches, our (anti) hero dared to steal a cursed diamond, carelessly cramming it in the middle of his enormous mass of treasures: promptly the gem came to life and did its utmost to transform all Wario's possessions into monsters and thus forcing the plump protagonist to have to wander around the various levels in an attempt to recover them. The game looks like a ~two and a half dimensions~ platformer, in the sense that the shot takes up the action from the side like 2D titles, but it is also possible to move in the depth allowed by the type of terrain you are treading on. The different stages share a very similar structure: each one contains enemies to kill, coins to collect, keys (more or less hidden) to activate to bring up chests containing as many treasures and a series of trapdoors that lead to small sub-levels purely platform in nature. Furthermore, scattered within the scenarios, there are red crystals essential to unlock the way to the boss on duty and the fragments of a golden statue depicting Wario, which once rebuilt allows you to earn half a heart which adds to the stock life of our protagonist. It is a pity that this very rarely will risk extinction, due to the extreme ease of Wario World, an element which, combined with a truly reduced to the bone longevity, makes the life of the Treasure title very short. Short and not too intense, indeed. The game structure of Wario World demonstrates obvious limitations from the very first stage, primarily with regard to combat with the various enemies. In addition to a simple combo of punches and a shoulder, it is possible to throw some unfortunate person at the address of his fellows or make him whirling or even subject him to a painful pile-driver a la Zangief: all very nice, of course, too bad that the threat constituted from the various little monsters is really minimal and the continuous respawn of the same soon makes the various fights little more than a boring formality. On the other hand, the situation with the various end-of-level bosses is different, which, although far from constituting a real challenge to the player's skill, at least prove to be more stimulating targets for Wario's punches. HAR! HAR! HAR! In Wario World, however, one must not only lead one's hands, but it is also necessary to solve some puzzles and jump from one platform to another: however, these two activities too soon fall into the abyss of repetitiveness, both due to the not exactly diversified structure of the levels and for the already mentioned underlying ease of the Treasure title. Which is really a shame, because after all Wario World does not lack original ideas and funny situations, the latter mainly generated by the very funny protagonist and his hilarious exclamations. This does not mean, however, that the prevailing impression one gets when playing Wario World is that of a real B-series product, born and developed without great expense and consequently without great effort. This sensation is fomented both by the already criticized gameplay and by a technical realization decidedly not up to the hardware on which the title runs. Graphically Wario World presents simple polygonal constructions, sometimes even cheesy, and very little exciting textures: the only fully satisfying element are the animations, especially those of the protagonist, amusing and fluid enough. On the sound level, however, only Wario's speech rises from the general mediocrity, evident above all with regard to the musical accompaniment, anonymous like few others. In short, Wario deserved much more Comment Despite the development by Treasure, Wario World is seriously struggling to establish itself as a game to recommend for purchase, primarily due to the very unbalanced play/price ratio. In fact, if it is true that there are many titles whose duration settles on the poor five-six hours as in this case, on the other hand not all of them also have a weak and repetitive game structure such as that of Wario World. The Nintendo product is developed through (few) levels with an extremely fluctuating design, characterized by a series of objectives that are always the same and moreover not very demanding. Just the obvious ease of Wario World and its almost unsettling simplicity in terms of sgame structure and cosmetic realization make it a title fully appreciable only by younger users. Pros: Simple and immediate gameplay Some original and fun ideas Wario always gets more than a smile Cons: Repetitive game structure Very poor longevity Mediocre technical realization Especially in the last period, the name of Nintendo has been accompanied by very unflattering statements (mainly - but not exclusively - made by users of opposing factions) regarding a serious loss of originality by the historic Japanese software house, which matured into a substantial fall of the much-vaunted Nintendo Difference. Certainly this vision does not faithfully reflect reality, and even if it is true that GBA and Gamecube have based a large part of their line-up on sequels, remakes or ports of various kinds, however the original products are certainly not lacking. Last in chronological order was the spectacular Wario Ware on the Nintendo handheld, a real tornado of fresh air that literally silenced the various detractors. And now the mustachioed arch-nemesis of the equally mustachioed Mario is now trying to coup on the Gamecube too", "date": "2003-07-18", "grade": null}
