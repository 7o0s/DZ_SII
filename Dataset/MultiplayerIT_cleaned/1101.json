A kind of test to determine what our ideal character could be. Instead, it is much better to create your own alter ego by first choosing the clan among the 7 available (belonging to the Camarilla: Brujah, Ventrue, Malkavian, Tremere, Toreador, Nosferatu; independent: Gangrel), choosing their gender and name and then distributing the few experience points initially available. Especially in this last phase, be careful: a balanced character risks being able to do everything but rather badly, a specialized character will excel in certain fields but could be inadequate in some moments of the game, making them more difficult for you. You are warned. Bloodlines But let's skip ahead. The thing that initially amazed and involved me the most was the fact that the characters we interact with are able to recognize the clan we belong to and react accordingly. In short, a dialogue carried out if you are a Malkavian is profoundly different from the same one, for example, of a Nosferatu. What might seem like a minor fact instead contributes to ~feeling~ one's character; seeing another Cainite frown and shake his head to show annoyance, because he cannot understand what is being said to him (it must be said that without the Source certain visual outputs would not be possible) is an experience never experienced before in a video game. the characters with whom you interact are able to recognize the clan to which we belong Bloodlines This first leap serves to make it clear, and here it is necessary to go back to the initial speech, that the developers (Troika) have taken a courageous and very problematic path to give life to their product: that of interpretation. The ecstasy of experience The Troika had already demonstrated its ability to create worlds that react to player inputs, i.e. worlds that can be lived in in different ways according to the will of those who pass through them (see box at the bottom of the page) but with Vampire the challenge was much higher: how to combine the few basic rules with freedom of action? How to avoid wasting the potential of the source? How to avoid the temptation to insert action elements almost everywhere leaving out everything else (a fear also expressed by many players when it was understood that Bloodlines would be in first person)? But let's take another leap and go back to character creation (which is examined in detail in a box that you will find located in these pages). When you choose the clan you belong to, the basis is laid for what our behavior will be throughout the game. Distributing the experience points initially available is not an action to be taken lightly, because whatever value we increase, this will directly affect what happens during the adventure. It would therefore be appropriate to think in advance about our ~non-life style~. Having created the character, having passed the initial film which introduces us to the vampiric society, explaining in part also the functioning of one of the two sects, the Camarilla, having also passed the tutorial, very complete, never boring and perfectly integrated into the story (basically you will have to be able to escape from the clutches of some members of the other great sect, the Sabbat), we find ourselves in our own ~shelter~ with a task to perform, assigned to us by the Prince of Los Angeles. From the beginning we will be able to experiment with the skills of our character: in our residence there is a laptop where we can enter using the password left written on a piece of paper next to it, or using our hacker skills (if we have any); immediately outside our apartment there is another that we can enter if we are skilled burglars; if we have good values in the investigation we can see the collectibles glow etc. In short, we haven't even set foot on the street as it is already evident how characters with different skills can perform different actions in the same places. But without getting lost in preliminary considerations, let's start by going down the streets of Los Angeles. Underground warfare The beauty of the screenshots and footage released in recent months has not deceived. Bloodlines is a visually excellent game (let's remember that the graphic engine, already mentioned, is the same source as Half-Life 2), this not only because it benefits from the inclusion of all the most recent graphic effects (although it must be said that physics is not exactly excellent), but also, and above all, because the overall representation of the various environments in which we will moveemo is designed and in complete harmony with the characters who live there: a rainy and gothic Los Angeles, where huge skyscrapers stand next to abandoned hovels; in which the alleys seem to whisper the presence of an immanent evil and in which the night is scarred by the deceptive light of neon signs. The characters trudge through the streets crowded with hookers and cadaverous figures. The creatures of the night are indistinguishable from the humanity that populates this hell. Nothing seems left to chance. Exploring the streets of the city (not very big actually) is pleasant, as is discovering the innumerable facets that characterize it. ...a rainy and gothic Los Angeles, where huge skyscrapers stand next to abandoned slums; in which the alleys seem to whisper the presence of an immanent evil and in which the night is scarred by the deceptive light of neon signs. Underground warfare In such a context, one manages to feel prey or predator, a feeling that is exacerbated when one begins to interact with the key characters in the story, who gradually reveal some of the secrets of the World of Darkness to us, making us understand how it is regulated and what power plays it they keep alive. Gradually the stereotyped, however fascinating, image of being simple pawns in a large-scale game that embraces not only Los Angeles, but the whole world, and takes place not only in the ~today~ in we live in but it began millennia ago Troika, a true philosophy of game design If Fallout (the Troika was born from the team that gave birth to the Interplay title) was already widely weaned in this sense, it is with Arcanum that the concept of a reactive world reaches its peak. In Arcanum it was possible to go on practically without fighting, facing long dialogues and using the other skills available to the character. The intricate and very well written story however allowed the implementation of a truly exciting non-linear narrative. Although ignored at the time of its first release, due to the graphics not keeping up with the times and, here in Italy, the lack of localization, Arcanum has become a cult game much loved and appreciated by role players. The next title of the Troika, The Temple of Elemental Evil, returns to a more combat-oriented setting, also because it is based on the Dungeons & Dragons license. The theater of life The gradual narration fascinates and captures, some memorable figures among those we will meet (I would like to mention them all to you but in some cases I would have to reveal some secrets that would spoil the surprise for those who have not yet tried Bloodlines) are among the most beautiful characters ever to appear in a video game (this is also thanks to the background formed over the years for the paper version). The power of the Source graphics engine has made it possible to see clusters of vectors covered by pixels play out and here, more than in Half-Life 2 if I may say so, these expressive possibilities come to communicate something that goes beyond the simple game or follow the story: here we participate in the damnation of the Cainites, we get to understand their melancholic and desperate immortality, the paradox of a life immersed in the deepest night but yearning for the light of divinity. All without bombastic dialogues or text screens that explain in points what we have to try. One has only to come into contact with the drama of weak-blooded brothers or the highly controversial nature of anarchists to realize what I am saying. And if you allow, this is an extremely important, almost essential added value, which alone is worth applause. Disciplines The game mechanics, on the other hand, are apparently very similar to that of Deus Ex: Invisible War or, better, to that of the first Deus Ex and System Shock 2. You wander through the streets of a city that isn't too big, you talk with various characters, we explore the scenario in search of some secrets, we carry out the missions assigned to us. In short, the sources of inspiration are quite illustrious and it is soon possible to understand that Bloodlines has nothing to envy to the titles mentioned above, managing to place itself on the same level (when not on a higher level) while maintaining an excellent degree of autonomy. The view of the Troika title can be in both first and third person (the third person is mandatory when fighting), the game interface is very simple and very reminiscent of an FPS except for the presence of an inventory, a log book and character sheet. To characterize Bloodlines and make it unique compared to other products of the same genre, we think the so-called ~disciplines~ which are, without too many words, thepowers donated by the blood of Cain (and not magical powers as some are claiming). Each of the clans has three disciplines that all start at the first level (except one that can be improved with an initial experience point). Learning to know and use the disciplines is essential to be able to move forward in the game. The Nosferatu, famous for their ability to infiltrate any place, should choose to improve their value in Obfuscation, the discipline capable of making them invisible, while a Brujah could be a better fighter than others thanks to the Speed and Power disciplines. Obviously the choice of one approach to the missions, rather than another, is at the total discretion of the player who, moreover, could find it pleasant to re-approach the game by trying different techniques. Multiplayer.it translates Vampire This box is a kind of reminder given that the news has already spread widely around the net: the Multiplayer.it team that takes care of the translation of the official guides is working on creating a patch that translates the Actvision title into the language of the beautiful country. Led by the intrepid Salvatore Cutaia, they are working (but why am I speaking in the third person? I'm also working on the patch... uff) to make the huge amount of text in the game intelligible to everyone. So even if you have never spoken to Eminem in English you will enjoy this wonderful CRPG. (Lines of) Blood But let's come to another central node inextricably linked with the disciplines and with our non-existence: blood. On the left of the screen is a long flask filled with the red liquid button. Blood represents the source of the brother's strength, the lymph that keeps him alive but, at the same time, his damnation. In short, to survive you have to suck the blood of some mortal being careful to take some precautions. In the first place, one must not be seen by humans while feeding. This would be a violation of the Masquerade, an ancient tradition of brothers belonging to the Camarilla that attempts to preserve their identity from humans. During the course of the game, the Masquerade can be violated a maximum of four times: the fifth violation is game over. But let's get back to the blood. Almost every discipline consumes a certain number of ~blood points~ to be used. The need for new blood soon becomes primary and you have to work hard to get some. Blood represents the source of the brother's strength, the lymph that keeps him alive but, at the same time, his damnation. (Lines of) Blood The quickest ways to do this are to hunt for rats (the sewers are full of them) or to buy bags of blood. Obviously you can also use the more classic (and already mentioned) method which is to suck the neck of some human. There are many ways to do this without being seen. The simplest is to walk around the alleys waiting for some unwary passer-by. Another way is to pay a prostitute, take her to a dark area, and jump on her. Whichever method you decide to use, you must be very careful not to kill the victim: you would lose a humanity point (these indicate how close your brother is to the ~beast~). Zero humanity points mean game over (lasts the life of the vampire). If you want, later in the game, you can also get a ghoul from which to draw vitae without taking risks. Defects Unfortunately the game suffers from some obvious flaws that should be mentioned. In the first place, the Source gives us again the annoying problem of clicks due to loading audio tracks. Since the system requirements on which the game was tested go beyond the recommended ones, it is impossible not to consider this a big flaw: every time a dialogue starts you will see a click, every time a new sound effect will be loaded while walking around the city the same will happen. There are a few tweaks I could try to fix the problem but, at least in my case, they only mitigated it. Probably, as with Half-Life 2, many will not have sound stuttering. So be warned: if Half-Life 2 snapped at you, Bloodlines will probably do the same too. Another rather annoying defect is the disappearance of the subtitles. It's already, while you're talking to a character it can happen that the subtitles decide to go for a ride who knows where. The defect would not be very serious if there weren't the next one: the lack of localization for both the text and the dialogues. It makes you laugh a bit thinking that the official excuse for the absence of translation is the presence of numerous action moments. In truth these are few and are avoidable, while some long dialogues are obligatory", "date": "2004-12-07", "grade": null}
