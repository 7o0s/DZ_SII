For the rest, all those critical issues that afflicted the computer version (stability aside) are there, but those who like to venture into a huge world, to kill everything and everyone in search of the perfect sword and spear-proof chain mail fiery they will find bread for their teeth in the Ascaron title, moreover lying comfortably on the sofa, which should not be underestimated given that the game has the bad habit of shamelessly stealing the time of those who play to the cry of yet another level! the civil war has begun Pure hack'n'slash Sacred 2 takes us to the land of Ancaria, in the midst of war for control of T energy, a sort of blue oil that serves as the lifeblood for the country's livelihood. There is little to say about the story told in the game, also because the narrative part that should link our deeds (ie the main quest) is really labile and badly told. Suffice it to say that at the origin of everything there are the High Elves unable to manage the power released by the energy that once out of control began to devastate the world. We are given a simple choice, to heal Ancaria (path of Light) or bring it to the brink (path of Shadow). This doubt is posed to the player immediately after choosing his alter ego: there are six characters to choose from and they represent the made in Ascaron version of the classic fantasy stereotypes. There is Serafina, the typical ~medium~ choice, an angelic warrior versed in both edged weapons and magic, the same thing goes for the Inquisitor, a High Elf who is a bit of a wizard, a bit of a warrior capable even as a good necromancer of evoking died to assist him in battle and to follow the other decidedly more specialized ~actors~, namely the Shadow Warrior, that is the classic barbarian thug, the High Elf expert in magic, the Dryad, sorceress and skilled in weapons from a distance and finally there is also the Guardian of the Temple, a pure soul clad in a sort of cyborg-like exoskeleton. Once our character has been decided, we will only have to choose the alignment and the patron deity. The first brings changes to the plot, but not to the way we relate to the inhabitants of Ancaria, while the second gives us a particular ability, very powerful but with a long recharge time. The recharge of skills is one of the peculiarities that differentiates Sacred 2 from many similar titles. There is no mana to administer, spells and special hits once performed need a certain amount of time before being ready again. We talk about seconds, but that can make all the difference when you're faced with a dozen skeletons equipped with poisoned arrows or flaming swords! The equipment system is the usual and overtested one: helmet, breastplate, leggings, robes, pendants and rings are looted from the bodies of the enemies, this also happens for weapons, swords, hammers, halberds, energy guns or enchanted stirrups. Special abilities, on the other hand, have their own very particular system, each character can study some doctrines, each of these brings magic as a dowry. The latter can be enhanced and modified, going to work on their duration, on the recharge time rather than on the damage or on the range. It is also possible to combine spells in different macros, useful for carrying out devastating combos without waiting for the recharge time of the single skill. Search and destroy All this customization work is carried out by spending experience points upon leveling up, points that are given with extreme parsimony, knowing how to use them in the best possible way is therefore essential for the correct balancing of one's alter ego. And here we come to another unresolved criticality since its first release on home computers. The game feeds us all this (and much more) without an iota of explanation with a series of impressions of screens full of values and statistics, the player will only have to try to understand how this deep and complete editor works. blindly in the first moments, and only over time will we know how to use the runes, balance the attacks and forge the right weapon. However, all this does not affect a gaming experience which, in the wake of the ~kill and loot~ canon, turns out to be very fun and full-bodied. Dozens of weapons and clothing pieces are found around the map, the combinations are endless in light of the fact that, as it should be, manyItems can only be equipped upon reaching a certain level. Precisely this wandering around the map, in complete freedom since next to the main mission there are dozens of secondary missions, unfortunately often too similar to each other which are limited in fact to the classic ~kill that, escort this other~, from the the to a fundamental question inherent to the genre to which the game belongs. With a sketchy plot, without any particular twists, many may find the raids through Ancaria particularly boring and repetitive. This is certainly a calculated risk, hack'n'slash is basically this, but in Sacred 2 one is truly at the limit of the mechanical, almost as if the player were in those shooting ranges with the fake houses and the silhouettes of bad guys with a gun suddenly getting up. Mind you, the game is a lot of fun, it works very well, the mechanics and gameplay are perfect and well thought out, but there is a lack of something that binds everything together. There's a lack of strong story underneath just killing and looting, which Diablo has and Sacred 2 lacks. Added to this are also considerable land navigation problems, Ancaria is vast, endless and immense, the map that should help us is at least basic, there are marked roads, paths and cities, but often thanks to a considerable work of diversification of areas and construction of a truly varied and credible world, you find yourself taking a mule track that leads to a thick forest or an impenetrable mountain range, these roughnesses that are only noticeable when they are within the visual range of the mini-map. We must therefore be prepared for a lot of back tracking, which if useful for the purpose of experience and level advancement, makes the fly fly to the nose when for the umpteenth time the path to follow is wrongly chosen or for the countless invisible walls that dot the playing area. This basic gameplay, tested by several similar games on PC, has found a perfect method of control on consoles, and for this we must give due credit to Ascaron. It is safe to say that the pad is better than the mouse and keyboard. The pointing to move and attack has disappeared, your hero moves as if we were in a fighting game with a top view. The left stick is responsible for movement, the right one for camera management, free and zoomable at will, while the front keys are used as slots where you can place your equipment, weapons, spells or combos. Not just four slots since L2 and R2 act as modifiers to activate another eight. Easy, convenient and immediate, each function is immediately accessible, without risking getting lost among the usual and uncomfortable keyboard shortcuts. Playstation 3 trophies The game offers 48 trophies, of which 9 are silver, while the others are divided between the bronze ones and the secret ones. The most common are linked to the achievement of particular levels, while the most interesting trophies are obtained by overcoming some missions, or by discovering secret areas or by completing the collection of epigraphs or secret tomes. Postcards from Ancaria From a graphic point of view, the game is at good levels, but unfortunately it is still plagued by frame rate problems: not that the game clicks or freezes in the most agitated moments, but it tends to slow down dramatically in some situations. This does not affect the enjoyment and enjoyment of the game, but with the extra time we had for this port, we would have expected a greater and more accurate optimization process. The most striking thing in the work carried out by Ascaron is, as previously written, the great attention paid to building a credible and lively Ancaria, in which each area is significantly different from the other, both from the point of view of the flora and fauna present , both from the purely geographical one. Lakes, deserts, mountains, caves, woods, small towns, farms, plowed fields and large cities dot the large game map, each region has its own distinctive features, each city has its own unique architecture. From this point of view, one does not get bored in admiring the places visited. Going to look at the technical component in more detail, a good job is also appreciated here: it certainly does not cry out to a miracle, the effects of the spells unleash discreet pyrotechnic effects, while the animations and textures applied to enemies and our heroes are decidedly good . Definite thumbs up for the general character design, never dull and rather original and varied. Ultimately Sacred 2 gives us an extremely pleasant glance, and a decidedly original general look even if in the wake of the classicism ofgames with a fantasy setting of this genre, pity only for a dancer frame rate. Another strong point of the game is the possibility, if connected to the PlayStation Network (or Xbox Live) to be able to enter and exit a game in progress fluidly, up to a maximum of two people, while on Xbox 360 this number rises to four. A local cooperative with shared screen is also inevitable, here too the user limit is set at two people with the same console. In addition to the main campaign, it is possible to play the game in free mode, unrelated to the main storyline or focus on alternative modes based on PvP or PvE. Playing with other friends seems to be the best way to deal with the vastness of Ancaria, it is impossible not to appreciate what Ascaron has done for the many possibilities offered. A final consideration deserves the price with which the game is placed on the market. On PC the game is offered at a budget price, while on consoles at full price. It is essential not to take this into account in the judging phase also because the game is completely similar in content to its first release, and apart from the control method, it is virtually indistinguishable, strengths and weaknesses included, from the version released last autumn. In short, a slightly lower price would have been desirable, and this alignment above with completely new productions is certainly not very pleasant.", "date": "2009-05-22", "grade": "7.5"}
