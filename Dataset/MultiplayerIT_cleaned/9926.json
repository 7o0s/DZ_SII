{"name": "Il ritorno di Sparkster", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/78504-rocket-knight-il-ritorno-di-sparkster.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3Youngest gamers probably won't remember or recognize Sparkster, the cute opossum invented by Konami in 1993 for 16-bit consoles which, while unable to rival the excessive power of Sonic or Mario, earned a fair number of aficionados . At a time when platformers and animal mascots were all the rage, Sparkster was perhaps one of the most original. Armed with a sword and jetpack, Sparkster fought an army of pigs, wolves and giant robots... a truly bizarre image, but one that has remained in the hearts of many gamers. A good seventeen years later, Konami has decided to fish out its old glory and propose a sequel (to be precise, Rocket Knight Adventures 2, Sparkster for SNES seems to have been ~forgotten~) that all owners of PC, PlayStation 3 and Steam can download for 12.99. Here comes the rocket mouse The premise of Rocket Knight is very simple: the kingdom of Zephyrus is besieged by wolves and our hero must leave his quiet bucolic life, don his armor and jetpack again to face the invader. The story is told through simple cutscenes from stage to stage, as Rocket Knight is, at its base, a very traditional platformer. Our hero has some peculiar abilities, such as a long-range attack and a fearsome slash or a prehensile tail that allows him to hang from special handholds, but the jetpack soon becomes the essential gadget for overcoming the levels, thanks to the possibility of dash briefly in any direction, allowing Sparkster to reach seemingly inaccessible places, perhaps smashing an obstacle in the way. So each stage compulsorily requires you to reach the opposite side by avoiding or defeating the enemies we will come across, but the player also has the option to explore every nook and cranny in search of precious gems that will guarantee 100% completion of the level, in order to unlock Trophies or Achievements. Rocket Knight can therefore be played in a hurry, and it is possible to complete it in just a couple of hours, or it can be savored more slowly following the now ancient tradition of the platformers of the 90s. After all, Sparkster's new adventure is incredibly simple: most of the stages we will face and the related bosses, however imposing, are really linear and almost harmless; the difficulty curve then undergoes a sudden surge in the latest schemes, which also limit the use of the jetpack when the polar cold will freeze the engines, forcing us to recharge them at special heat sources: a very pleasant variant that would have been better to implement a little ' in each stage, rather than just the final ones. Fortunately, Rocket Knight is not a particularly monotonous title anyway, thanks also to the various shooter sections that interrupt the repetitive hopping, really basic stages in which we will have to move around the screen shooting at everything that moves. Playstation 3 trophies Rocket Knight offers 12 Trophies: 7 Bronze, 4 Silver and 1 Gold. To get most of them, just complete the game at various difficulty levels, but some require you to pass special tests, for example by earning a certain amount of points or by defeating the bosses with particular techniques (as in the case of Gold). Four wolf cubs for one possum However, Rocket Knight offers a good variety of challenges beyond the mere completion of the adventure, such as collecting every gem or completing the stages in the shortest possible time, for example, which give the Konami game a vintage aftertaste that could be greatly appreciated by the most nostalgic . Even the graphics sector maintains this peculiar retro feature, but it is decidedly pleasant: Rocket Knight is actually completely polygonal but the level design is basically two-dimensional, as are the various bosses. And yet the care taken in the creation of each level or enemy is decidedly over the top: Rocket Knight is a colorful platform full of details, which does not distort the original series in any way, paying homage to it with its old-fashioned setting and some surprises, as in the case of some huge end-of-level bosses. The variety and breadth of the settings is truly remarkable and the pace of the action is always tight. It is therefore a fairly modest experience but not at all taken for granted or a victim of the limits imposed on most low-budget games. Too bad that the music is rather anonymous and easily forgettable.", "date": "2010-07-06", "grade": "7.5"}
