In this Dragon Raja review we are faced with what can be considered one of the most advanced points of this new trend, given the level reached by the Archosaur Games team, with the support behind - needless to say - from the giant Tencent. From the first glance, Dragon Raja appears quite stunning, if you think that it runs on smartphones: entirely based on Unreal Engine 4, the technical level reached has very little to envy to the most famous PC and console productions, even if the style adopted is a bit cheesy of Asian productions of this type. Certainly less incisive than Genshin Impact, however it can compete with the latter in terms of extension and variety of scenarios, at least from what can be seen from the early hours and could become something really big in the mobile sector. It is certainly one of the most technically impressive games that have recently been seen on smartphones and it is no small feat. History: between fantasy and cyberpunk Some characters from Dragon Raja The story of Dragon Raja tries to stage something epic and in some moments it even manages to be emotional, but it is quite difficult to follow it seriously when you are faced with a sort of cringe fair, between stereotypical characters and inconsistent dialogues . However, it is at least an eventful narrative, which already takes us in the short span of the first hours of the game to a total reversal of perspective, also managing to be engaging. We avoid going into detail, but let's say that the sugary start in what appears to be a Santa Claus village does not last long and soon we will be faced with thorny situations that will lead us to have to fight against a colossal threat to all humanity. The protagonists of the story are young fighters who have been fed with dragonblood, dragon essence that gives them immense powers, but also a rather short and dangerous life, but they will be the keys to the final fight against the gigantic dragons that await, dormant in the shadows, to regain control of the world. Classes and characters Character classes and editors are very complete and well done The 10 classes from which to choose your character represent a good source of variety for the gameplay, given that specialization determines very different fighting styles: among these we find the classic archetypes such as tanks or ranged fighters but there are also several original nuances, with each class having some pretty spectacular special abilities. There's also a character editor that's impressive in depth, allowing for numerous modifications to the 3D models, from the most obvious physical ones down to the smallest make-up details. Also note the possibility of having three different variants for each class: no, we are not talking about a progressive decision to include non-binary characters, but the fact of adding the ~girl~ typology to ~male~ and ~female~ it should perhaps satisfy some particular taste in the public, but it can leave rather dumbfounded. Gameplay: automatic action RPG The initial setting is somewhat bizarre in the sci-fi context, given that we are in a snowy village The gameplay is very similar to that seen in several other mobile MMORPGs, in particular in the meaning closest to the PC tradition that we have seen for example in Lineage 2: Revolution, perhaps the most important progenitor for this trend on smartphones. The objective difficulty is to insert all the characteristics of a complex online RPG in a small screen, made to be used on the move and for not too long sessions and the solution found is certainly not for everyone: while maintaining the typical elements of the MMORPG in terms of quantity and diversity of quests and settings, Dragon Raja also delegates a large part of its gameplay to autoplay, which is optional, but becomes practically mandatory when it is difficult to understand exactly where to go and the interface cannot be very clear. However, the system combat manages to be quite engaging with a good mediation between the direct control of the character and the waiting rounds forced by the usual cooldowns of the special moves, which are decidedly spectacular and satisfying to use, with good variations based on the class of the character and the evolutions performed . Progression, PvP and gacha A fight in Dragon Raja The ideal is probably to find an intermediate solution between automation and direct control, in order to govern the boredom that would otherwise surely arriveand to catch us. The progression between the quests is certainly more comfortable with a bit of automatic movement, but the flip side is that all the construction of the world and the quests is extremely simplified by the fact that everything can be played practically by itself. The advice is perhaps to use at least the manual combat system, considering that this is still quite fun, focusing rather on total autoplay to do some grinding. This last aspect is obviously present given that Dragon Raja aims widely at PvP, which combined with the usual free-to-play drifts most likely lead to pay to win. This risk is accentuated by the presence of gacha elements in the form of allies that can be ~equipped~ in combat and are obtained through the usual random systems that we have seen in many other games, or by spending a little money.", "date": "2021-10-29", "grade": "7.0"}
