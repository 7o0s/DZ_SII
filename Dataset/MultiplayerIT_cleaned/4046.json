In fact, PCs and home consoles force us to remain confined to the home to play, where instead having a game like FIFA 19 at hand would be a godsend for those who often travel by public transport, or simply would like to use the football simulation to take a break during the lunch break spent away from home. Put in these terms, the version of FIFA 19 for Nintendo Switch is one of a kind, placing the user in a position to enjoy the aforementioned possibilities. It does so with some inevitable compromises, dictated by the differences between the living room consoles and the Nintendo one, both in terms of hardware and philosophy. Considering that the main competitor, PES 2019, is unfortunately not available for Nintendo Switch, the presence of FIFA 19 represents the only football alternative of a certain level for this platform: let's find out what it feels like once you pick up the Joy- With. The modalities: no Travel The compromises made by FIFA 19 to arrive on Nintendo Switch start from the absence of The Journey mode. This is certainly not a novelty in this sense, given that the second chapter of the story dedicated to the talent Alex Hunter was already missing in FIFA 18. A choice motivated by the impossibility of using the Frostbite engine to bring FIFA 19 to Nintendo Switch, given the limitations of the console in terms of hardware. While we understand the need from a developer's point of view, as gamers we can't help but feel a little bitter about the lack of this mode. Those who love online gaming can still console themselves with the presence of Ultimate Team, but before embarking on building their own squad, it is good to know that there is no shortage of sacrifices even in this case. In fact, to carry out the conversion the Squad Battles were sacrificed but above all the new dynamics called Division Rivals, which in the ~major~ version have replaced the old Divisions this year. The latter we find instead in FIFA 19 for Nintendo Switch. Still with regard to FUT, the incompatibility with the companion app should also be noted, both in its web form and as an application for mobile devices: a significant lack, given the importance covered by the application for managing and improving squads . On the other hand, obviously the Champions League could not be absent, introduced just this year by EA Sports: the charm of the competition remains the same also on Nintendo Switch, allowing the user to play in the maximum European competition also in the Career mode, for the rest always similar to itself. Also present is the renewed Kick-Off mode, where you can get busy between rules that distort the game of football: if you want to deepen the discussion, we have already talked about it in the review of the PlayStation 4 version of FIFA 19. The gameplay: more arcade than simulation Once you take the field, the sensations you feel with FIFA 19 for Nintendo Switch bring to mind those felt at the time with FIFA 16 and its predecessors, that is to say the last chapters that saw the use of the Ignite Engine on consoles housewives. The absence of the Frostbite engine means not having the new Active Touch System for ball control and the 50/50 Battles, introduced this year by the developers to have a more realistic experience in tackling. Compared to last year, however, there is an improvement in the fluidity of the action, evidently enriched with some more animation. From the other versions of FIFA 19, the one for Nintendo Switch still inherits the Timed Finalization, through which it is possible to increase the accuracy of a goal shot by pressing the shot button a second time at the right moment. In general, between arcade and simulation, the balance needle of FIFA 19 on Nintendo Switch leans towards the first aspect, favoring the speed of the action over a reasoned football. Fast footballers thus know how to be more lethal in shots and changes of direction than what we have seen on PlayStation 4, probably responding to the desire to impress a more immediate philosophy on the Nintendo Switch version. However, we would have liked a more realistic pace for the development of the action. As for the controls, the small size of the Joy-Cons are felt on more than one occasion, especially for those used to playing football titles with the pads of other consoles. From this point of view, the possession of a Pro Controller in the configuration can undoubtedly helpand Nintendo Switch housewife. As far as matches on the move are concerned, unfortunately we must take into account some inaccurate passes or shots due to the incorrect movement of the left lever. The artificial intelligence can still be improved, not at the level of the other versions of FIFA 19. Graphics and sound Like its predecessor, FIFA 19 focuses on fluidity and the ability to quickly switch between Nintendo Switch configurations. Playing on the home screen it is possible to count on a resolution of 1080p, absolutely stable in the amount of frames per second and improved in the management of aliasing compared to last year. However, some compromises remain evident, softening in the transition to the console screen with a resolution of 720p. While it's clear that FIFA 19 for Nintendo Switch was designed with mobility in mind, having the ability to come back from away and complete the Champions League at home without worries is undoubtedly the point most in favor of this version of the game. In general terms, obviously, one should not expect the depth of detail appreciated on PlayStation 4: the most famous players are still made quite well, unlike the lesser-known ones which in some cases look nothing like their real counterpart. However, this is a historical problem of the series, and not of the Nintendo Switch version. The sound also sees in this case the return of Pierluigi Pardo and Stefano Nava to the commentary, accompanied by phrases that directly bring into play the characteristics of the game on Nintendo Switch, bringing with them the usual list of strengths and weaknesses.", "date": "2018-09-27", "grade": "7.8"}
