{"name": "Cannoni per tutti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/129328-tower-of-guns-cannoni-per-tutti.html", "text": "Despite being a first-person shooter, playing Tower of Guns Spelunky comes to mind first. In other words, the roguelike structure that characterizes titles such as Spelunky and many others comes to mind, with randomly generated maps, power-ups that must be unlocked by overcoming objectives over several sessions and an underlying unpredictability that makes every game different, at least until there he realizes that even chance is subject to stringent rules in the world of video games. There is no shortage of bosses At the beginning of each game, a task is assigned, linked to a kind of story to be followed through screen writing that can be safely ignored or deactivated. These are very simple tasks that only serve as a motive to enter the tower and start shooting at the turrets and robots that want to kill us. Let's say that reading the texts is fun until you run out of them, after which they become a tinsel that you won't pay attention to while playing, also because between bullets to dodge and pools of lava to jump there's really no time to do anything else. The real goal to pursue, what after yet another death you begin to consider a mirage, is to reach the top floor of the tower without dying. Yes, there are no saves and there is no way to continue where you left off. Once dead, goodbye, greetings, a kiss to the puppets: you have to start over from the beginning, losing all the power-ups collected. Difficult? Yes, but it's a roguelike and it couldn't be otherwise. Starting each game you have to choose which weapon to take with you, taking one of the unlocked ones. Initially you only have two, but by playing you can unlock eight more. So you have to choose a power, even in this case at the beginning there are only two available, to help us not feel alone. For example, it is possible to immediately have the triple jump, or you can decide not to suffer damage in the event of falls and so on. The important thing is to have clear how you want to fight and, above all, the pros and cons of some weapons compared to your tastes. A game where you have to reach the top of a tower while smoking cannons. Ahem, you misunderstood! Finally in the game As already mentioned, Tower of Guns is a roguelike, therefore, apart from some fixed areas, placed at the beginning and at the end of each level, all the other areas will be randomly generated drawing from some predefined models. This translates into gameplay oriented towards the development of the player's skills, in order to be able to survive in any situation. Enemies sometimes unleash incredible firepower The typical enemies encountered in the areas, made up of platforms, a few corridors, traps and ramps, are the cannons that give the game its title: there are of all shapes and types, from those that shoot large spiked balls, to others that fire volleys of missiles, to some more futuristic ones that emit energy projectiles that chase us until they run out. There is no shortage of flying robots that can shoot or mow us down with circular blades mounted on their circumference and, just to like, there are also kamikaze robots that blow themselves up when they are close to us, stealing part of our precious energy. Every enemy you kill drops items. Normally these are colored spheres that are used to enhance the selected weapon, to recover energy, or to increase the pecuniary loot. In the luckiest cases, in the midst of the junk, however necessary to survive, we will also obtain special tiles that will give us additional powers (for example the possibility of jumping higher, or a shield, or even increasing the difficulty of the game ), or others that will give us extra weapons, both primary and secondary. Among the latter, a slow and powerful missile stands out, capable of destroying almost everything it touches, or a sprint that makes us much faster. Another way to get bonuses is to spend the money you collect on the various boards scattered around the maps, randomly distributed like everything else. At the end of each level there is a boss to be defeated in order to move on to the next one. These are usually gigantic robots full of turrets. Fire gameplay The gameplay of Tower of Guns is some of the fastest we've played in recent years. After a few initial interlude areas, you quickly find yourself surrounded by enemy fire. If you are not careful, it only takes a few seconds to see your entire energy bar drained and find yourself inexorably dead. From this point of view, the title of Terrible Posture Games is truly ruthless and does not leave much room for improvisation. Althoughnot beautiful, the graphics can offer pleasant moments Hence one of the main problems of the game. We clarify that Tower of Guns is a lot of fun, but this does not mean that in some cases confusion reigns supreme. Roguelikes are usually very difficult, but they are also fair to the player, who always knows exactly why he lost and the mistake he made. In short, Spelunky or Rogue Legacy, to give another example, always make it clear what is happening on the screen. In Tower Of Guns this is not always the case: either for a mere matter of perspective, or because the randomness of the appearance of enemies in areas often leads to finding yourself surrounded without warning, sometimes you find yourself in a panic because you are unable to immediately understand where the attacks are coming from. In short, it happens that it is difficult to decipher what is happening on the screen, at least until you know each area inside out. Let it be clear that the criticism does not want to demolish the game, which still has many virtues on its side, but the problem should be noted. For the rest we are faced with a small independent game capable of giving hours of healthy action between rooms to clean up and secrets to find (there are many in each map and finding them yields bonuses). Graphically, while not reaching the same level of detail, Tower of Guns reminded us of the Borderlands for the use of cel shading. In reality, the first areas are ugly to see, due to a monotony in the various elements certainly not helped by the random generation of the maps (it is one of the problems of all roguelikes, after all). Luckily the advanced levels are more enjoyable and offer good glimpses and effects, although nothing to jaw-dropping should be expected. On the other hand the guns are very imaginative and have reminded us of some of the best exponents of the genre for variety and ability to involve in the mere act of shooting. In short, considering that it is a small production, one certainly cannot complain, also because, trust me, when you have to dodge dozens of bullets at the same time, you won't have much time to admire the textures.", "date": "2014-03-11", "grade": "7.5"}
