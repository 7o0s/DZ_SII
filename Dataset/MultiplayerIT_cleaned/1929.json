{"name": "Eternal Darkness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eternal-darkness_a.html", "text": "I don't know Raccoon City The events narrated in Eternal Darkness open with the mysterious and gruesome discovery of a man's body inside his villa; determined to find out the reason for this crime and tired of waiting for the inconclusive police investigations, the victim's niece, Alexandra Roivas, decides to enter the mansion to look for clues that clarify what happened. Thus the Nintendo production opens, but it is only the tip of the iceberg for what is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best storyboards that the video game industry has witnessed in recent years. And it is precisely on this element that Eternal Darkness rests the vast majority of its charm; the unpredictability of the plot, its ability to keep the player glued to the screen is what elevates the title from the crowd and gives it its own identity. Far from the ~explosive~ fear of Resident Evil and not even comparable to the ~implosive~ fear of Silent Hill, Eternal Darkness finds its reason for being more in the beauty of the story than in distinct single and precise elements. Precisely for this reason, the effort of Silicon Knights proves to be a title to be discovered - and which lets itself be discovered - step by step, involving and exalting in a slowly but constantly increasing measure. In this context, the sanity meter appears to be of fundamental importance, the only real innovative aspect of the gameplay but whose implementation deserves applause from the programmers; Simply put, it is represented by a gauge that decreases as you encounter monsters and enemy creatures. Shooting down these aberrations and killing them with a coup de grace recovers a small part of sanity, but after a couple of hours of play maintaining a high level will be a difficult task. The effects that a reduced level of sanity meter can have on the controlled character are many, but in all cases they represent expressions of an increasingly weak mental health. We're talking about visual and auditory hallucinations, the number and quality of which is high enough to be a surprise even once you get into the game a lot. Will 10 drops of valerian be enough? That the plot is the real cornerstone of Eternal Darkness, that's clear. But a game worthy of the name also needs solid gameplay, and the Silicon Knights title can boast good quality from this point of view as well. Nonetheless, the involvement dictated by the desire to continue and discover new implications in the events narrated acts as a ~filter~ hiding some playful aspects of slightly lower quality than the rest. The game mechanic of Eternal Darkness is basically that of a rather lively adventure game, with high rhythms and a high rate of action. The phases of exploration of the settings and of combat are in fact interspersed with decidedly simple puzzles, the resolution of which should not represent a problem for any user with a minimum of familiarity with the genre. Furthermore, more generally, the path to follow is traced in a rather marked way, effectively ~guiding~ the player in his movements and actions almost as if the title itself wanted to witness the events with the same curiosity as the user. From a different point of view, however, this indisputable linearity could leave more than a few perplexities in those who do not like having to limit themselves to following a well-defined path. The combat system is pleasant, which allows you to hit different parts of the monsters' bodies to carry out mutilations that are also useful in practical terms: decapitating a zombie means depriving it of sight, with the consequence of seeing it attack everything that comes within range, allies included. Nonetheless, eliminating the upper limbs with a clean cut prevents the victim from offending, relegating him to the role of a horrible and bloody puppet. This well-chosen combat system would certainly have been enhanced by an artificial intelligence worthy of the name; unfortunately, the enemies present in the Nintendo production seem to be subordinated to a few simple routines that deprive them of any method of attack other than the direct one with their heads down. The limited variety of the same is also disappointing, which in fact reduces to having to deal with only 4-5 different species for the entire duration of the game. The introduction of spells is decidedly interesting, the evocation of which is subject to the collection and subsequent union of some of the runes found within the levels. Each spell can also be linked to 3 different elements, which collide with each other with a system entirely attributable to the classic paper-forbici-stone. More generally, however, the presence of 12 different controllable characters - each with slightly different physical characteristics and weapons - represents the real trump card for keeping alive and satisfying a game mechanic that otherwise would have sinned by being excessively repetitive. However, the marked drop in tone of Silicon Knights' fatigue in the final stages should be noted: without wanting to reveal anything, we limit ourselves to noting how the last 2 hours of play appear so repetitive in the tasks to be carried out and not very rewarding compared to the rest of the adventure make the hypothesis of a hasty conclusion in order to respect the release date in stores much more than a suspicion. I come from sixty-four From a technical point of view, Eternal Darkness stands out as an excellent product, while revealing its 1964 origins on more than a few occasions. The excellent quality of the textures, the excellent color palette and the superb effects - excluding the mediocre representation of the flames - counterbalance some architectures that are slightly too simple and boxy, animations that can be improved and polygonal constructions that are not ~128 bit~. The work of American programmers with regard to the graphic aspect is therefore overall fluctuating, capable of going from good but nothing more to excellent within a couple of locations. In any case, the inclusion of the 16: 9 mode is to be commended, capable of making every owner of a widescreen happy. The sound is fantastic, atmospheric like few others and to which the credit goes for a good portion of the feeling of the game; the situation is enhanced by the implementation of Dolby Pro Logic II, which completes the picture for what is a further blow to those who questioned the Gamecube's sound capabilities. The longevity is appreciable, with the adventure ending in about twenty hours but equipped with a fair number of extras capable of encouraging its replayability. In conclusion Eternal Darkness turned out to be a real surprise, especially for those who believed that a group of American programmers was not capable of creating an adventure-horror game worthy of the name. On the contrary, Silicon Knight has succeeded in giving life to a product of high thickness, endowed with a strong character and above all accompanied by a plot among the best in recent years, capable of attracting the player's attention and even hiding some indisputable flaws in terms of gameplay. Unfortunately, the last steps of the adventure leave a bitter taste in the mouth, decidedly subdued and able to significantly replace the judgment of the entire product. Ultimately, while not perfect, Eternal Darkness is a title that should be recommended to anyone and which lays excellent foundations for what can become a saga of sure success. Pros: Excellent plot Great involvement Sound at very high levels Cons: Not perfect playability Basic repetitiveness Marked linearity Really subdued final lines Although born under the best auspices and on the strength of the experience gained with Nintendo 64, Gamecube has had to deal with a rather limited software park since its debut in Japan, especially compared to that of the competition Sony and Microsoft; nevertheless, to the cry of ~few but good~ and with the halo of the ~Nintendo Difference~ always eligible, the cubic console continued undaunted on its path made up of names of the caliber of Pikmin, Resident Evil 0, Mario Sunshine and so on. Eternal Darkness, a multi-delayed horror game born on Nintendo 64 and then diverted to Gamecube, also wanted to be added to this group of large productions responsible for keeping the fame of the big N high, very high.", "date": "2002-11-19", "grade": null}
