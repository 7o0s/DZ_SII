{"name": "Pyramid Bloxx", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pyramid-bloxx_a.html", "text": "As can be guessed from the title, the new production by the American team finds its setting in ancient Egypt, in a period in which pharaohs, hieroglyphs and -precisely- pyramids were the order of the day. The fulcrum of the game lies in building these enormous funerary monuments, transporting the blocks necessary for their construction. Despite being similar to its predecessor in many respects, Pyramid Bloxx is not a trivial clone created to take advantage of the long wave of Tower Bloxx's success. Of course, in this case too it is a one-button game, or a game that is based on pressing a single button, and in the same way the fulcrum of the gameplay is contained in the timing with which this key is pressed. But instead of having to line up the floors of a building that fall from above, in this case you have to bring a colored block from below, throwing it from hand to hand among the slaves arranged on the various floors of the pyramid. The latter, moving from one side to the other, obviously make the passage more complex, especially if you want to throw the block in a perfectly precise way into the arms of the following worker. A misaligned throw can in the worst case lead to losing the block, or to seeing it swinging in the arms of the unfortunate slave with relative greater difficulty in executing the next stroke. Developing a series of perfect passes also allows you to increase your score and earn various multipliers. But it is the ~build an empire~ mode that represents the fulcrum of Digital Chocolate production, as well as the most valid starting point to allow Pyramid Bloxx to guarantee the many hours of fun it is able to offer. In this case it is in fact necessary to build three pyramids, obtaining the necessary colored blocks. The beauty lies in the fact that there are different blocks, of different colors and different values; however, the most valuable ones in terms of guaranteed score are also the most difficult and heavy ones to transport, and which also require the presence of other adjacent blocks in order to be positioned. The possibility of repeating the levels, replacing the blocks and therefore increasing the score is a really consistent stimulus, capable of literally gluing the player to the screen. From a technical point of view, the guys at Digital Chocolate confirm that they know perfectly the platform on which they are now used to working, and also in this case we are in fact faced with a refined product, well designed and simply beautiful to look at but at the same time at the same time functional and without too many frills. The use of color, the various settings and special effects such as earthquakes and sandstorms guarantee those little touches of class capable of giving something more to the overall package, which also makes use of a spot-on and never annoying sound accompaniment .
