The first two chapters were a success, considered by the press of the time the ~true~ version of Ultima IX. The third also made a lot of talk about itself, but for one of the most controversial case histories of the video game industry. It is the star of Gothic that with its light continues to illuminate the stage of the German software house, forcing it to a life in the spotlight. A limelight that does not let Bjorn Pankratz and his historical collaborators work in serenity: it is undeniable that with each new production of Piranha Bytes the bar of expectations is always very (too) high, in the hope that it will be able to repeat the glories of his first work. He had tried in vain with the Risen trilogy, welcomed with affection only by the hard core of the base, and he tried again with ELEX, a new intellectual property presented to the specialized press in 2015. The release was initially scheduled for the autumn of last year , but the works were completed only a few days ago: the time has come to write our impressions. A bit of history The beginning of the script has always been an Achilles heel of the team based in Essen and ELEX is no exception: a comet hits the highly advanced planet Magalan, bringing with it, in addition to the destruction of civilization, also the powerful material (Tiberium ?) hence the title of the game. The populations are divided into four clans that fight for supremacy: the Berserkers reject all types of technology to follow a lifestyle close to nature by which they govern the magical properties; the Clerics forbid taking Elex in pure form but exploit its properties for the creation of powerful weapons; finally, the Outlaws are anarchoids who do not preclude any possibility against the substance arrived from space. The Alba faction is the most powerful, as it includes a small group of the chosen ones who manage to consume Elex without being overwhelmed by its devastating side effects: the only consequence is the loss of emotions that make them similar to robots. These supermen are about to plan the final attack for control of Magalan, when the raider piloted by Commander Jax is mysteriously shot down. The cruel code of honor of the Alba provides that, in case of failure, the person responsible is eliminated, but something goes wrong in the moment of execution and our protagonist, stripped of both the equipment and the skills conferred on him by the Elex, has the opportunity to rewrite your own history from scratch. Trailer that passes you If you too, watching the trailers that Piranha Bytes has released in the stages of approaching the release, have started to feed more than a few doubts about the goodness of the project, you are justified: the emphasis (inevitably, considering the few minutes of video) was placed on fights and environments, two of the less successful aspects of ELEX. The biggest breaking point with past productions concerns the setting: a mixture of fantasy, contemporary and post-apocalyptic elements that thrives on few highs and too many lows. Despite having avoided the risk, rightly underlined in the preview phase, of falling into the most tacky kitsch, the work absolutely didn't convince us. Paradoxically, the feeling is that the designers were afraid of treading too much, with the result that the four regions (as many as the guilds) are devoid of truly characterizing elements. The Edan, Berserker's hunting land, is a typical fantasy ecosystem where instead of the classic huts (however present) there are abandoned industrial complexes, hydroelectric plants, some remnants of asphalt: but there is nothing that tells more in depth the life before the disaster. The Clerics live in Ignadon, inside the crater created by the impact of the comet, in a context in which stylistic elements belonging to the Warhammer 40,000 universe can be recognized. The most successful area is that of the Outlaws which refers to the post-atomic visions of Mad Max and the large crowd that was inspired by him (Wasteland, Fallout), where however the presence of characters in sword and shield is even more striking. In short, there is a considerable variety of situations, but the illumination of a harmonic view that would certainly have benefited the entire production is missing. The game map, while not reaching the exaggerations of certain sandbox titles, is really large (about one and a half times that of Gothic 3 according to the programmers' estimates) and the only way to explore it is on your own legs. Of course, the fundamental teleportation portals cannot be missing, which are however positioned in points that are not exactly ~obvious~ and rethey require a lot of exploration (or an appropriate skill) to be found. The level of interaction with the environment is only fair: most of the action takes place outdoors but there are only a few more buildings that can be searched than in the past. The jetpack is an important element of the gameplay that has allowed a decidedly unusual vertical development by the standards of the German company (although in some cases it seemed almost excessive to us); on the other hand, there are watercourses but it is not possible to immerse yourself in them. So much variety does not find the right match in the park of enemies, consisting mainly of other picturesquely decorated human beings, robots, a sort of zombie resulting from the Alba experiments with the Elex and some creatures mutated by radiation among which the newborn species stands out dei Marcinghiali and the return of the velociraptors. Comfort zones The main reason why Piranha Bytes has chosen to move away from the comfort zone is above all to be able to boast the title of RPG with the greatest variety of weapons: these premises have in fact allowed the developers to bring together broadswords, shields, axes, grenade launchers and rifles at the plasma, bows and magic. This consideration allows us to analyze the other aspect on which strong perplexities have arisen, that of the combat system. Visibly modified compared to that of Risen 3, it is now closer to returning an experience similar to that experienced in the first Gothic and therefore rougher and cruder, but in a certain sense also more functional to the deep role-playing cut given to the video game. Proof of what has been written is the return of stamina, which is consumed both to escape with the classic somersaults and to rage with white weapons. There are two types of attacks: the first, light, is done with the left mouse button, while the heavy one with the E button. Once a good combination is reached, a special one is activated that allows you to inflict even more significant damage. The biggest problems above all concern the coupling of the camera, which automatically ~glues~ itself to the enemy displayed: during single battles it does not create any problems, but can lead to various headaches when there are multiple enemies to attack the player. Furthermore, the feeling of distance from the enemy is often lost, with the result of empty slashing or, worse still, making parries useless. Defense is the other Achilles' heel of the combat system, because in fact evasion by somersault is unusable due to the high consumption of stamina and the slowness of the protagonist in completing the maneuver: thus one runs the risk of being hit (with painful consequences, unlike what we complained in Risen 3), right in the middle of lateral jump, with the result of no longer having the strength to counterattack and the health bar dangerously low. The use of the jetpack in combat, much sponsored during the presentation videos, in practice is marginal and does not significantly affect the dynamics of the clashes, while on the other hand it is very useful in case of evasion. Futuristic and contemporary weapons deserve a separate discussion, whose damage rate has been deliberately weakened: this paradox was necessary in order not to create excessive imbalances between the armaments. A further indication confirming that we could easily do without this minestrone setting. As should be clear, Elex's combat system is far from pleasant and immediate, yet it is extremely functional to the Piranha Bytes project, according to whose philosophy it is not necessary to have great skills in using the keyboard (or joypad) since if the level of the enemy is too much higher than that of Jax, the only way forward is that of escape (or the loading screen). Eliminating a pack of raptors from which you had to flee at first is rewarding: a satisfaction that cannot be appreciated in a few minutes of gameplay, and which consequently can only be enjoyed by a hard core of old school players. Old school ELEX is a role-playing game from yesteryear, in which the focus is primarily on the characters, on the dialogues, on the growth of the protagonist even before the fights. The plot starts, as usual, a little with difficulty, but it starts to get interesting from the first hours of the game. The dialogues flow pleasantly and, despite having lost the ironic cut of Risen, they are often pleasant, with tangible ramifications and consequences also in terms of the development of other quests and of the character, whose alignment depends precisely on the answers given. Certainly there is no shortage of clichs typical of the genre, but the key figures are equipped with onegood personality and an attitude that changes according to the opinion towards the player. The first impact is a bit unsettling: you find yourself lost near a dilapidated shed and only the help of Duras, a Berserker warrior, will give an address to the epic of Jax, dedicated to finding whoever hit him and moved him from the desire for revenge against those who were once his brother and who then tried to kill him. The incipit, however, exposes one of the many weak sides of Piranha Bytes' RPG, that of balancing, as it forces you to take a warrior path even if the player's intentions could be different. The camps of the other factions are in fact very far from the initial base and to reach them it is necessary to travel roads infested with enemies that can only be faced with a good dose of strength and sturdiness. If we add to this that the specialization of the other two races is not as clear as in classic RPGs (in which, for example, the elves are excellent archers and the dwarves are tough warriors) the result is that, at least in the first game, it is not easy to understand direction develop Jax. As usual, it is not possible to act on the aesthetic aspect of the protagonist, who resembles Jason Statham without unfortunately approaching the charisma of the British actor, while his physical characteristics can be increased which, as in the best tradition, are five: strength, constitution , dexterity, intelligence, cunning. At each level increase, both points are assigned to be spent to enhance these items, and skill points which prove to be equally fundamental for refining the effectiveness in using a specific talent. There are about 70 of them divided into six categories, and they can be learned from the masters scattered throughout Magalan. The difficulty level, set to a normal value, is high: the first few hours are spent trying to complete all those quests that don't take us too far from the safety of the base. As soon as the adventure requires you to enter the woods, an unlikely challenge begins: even the clash with the most ramshackle giant rat becomes a struggle for survival and very often the only option is to retreat, given that, fortunately, the level of difficulty is not dynamic. From here also arises the need to get help right away from Duras (he is the first, but not the only one among the possible allies) and to send him to the massacre trusting in his statistics (decidedly higher than those of the player), while trying to assist him at least worst. The programmers argue that almost all non-player characters can be killed, with even heavy consequences in the development of the plot, but this does not happen with the companions who can still be knocked out for a few minutes. The quests are many and often branch out, and many of these also have consequences in the development of the main story. Obviously, the most significant decision concerns the choice of the guild with which to ally, since from that moment on the other two will become enemies. This is an element that recurs in all Piranha Bytes titles and which continues to have a bite even though it can no longer be defined properly innovative, but there are also many other dialogues that change the course of events and whose outcome is clearly highlighted by messages on screen. Many weapons, few weapons Growth is slow and penalized by another style we've learned to live with since the days of Gothic: the shortage of items dropped by enemies. Killing a Cleric armed with a hammer or an Alba firing a laser rifle will be absolutely useless for the purposes of the equipment since it will never be possible to recover the weapons with which they attacked. There are no armor around even if you look for them with a match and the magical relics in the lands of Magalan can be counted on the fingers of one hand. It goes without saying that the only way to enhance the embarrassing initial inventory is to turn to the shops of the inhabited centers, but this choice clashes with the great variety heralded by the programmers, given that the merchants charge high prices and then you continue for long stretches of the game always with the same weapon. Speaking of inventory: we didn't like the screen at all, it appeared too dispersive (also because the graphic rendering of the objects that are equipped is missing) and with cumbersome navigation especially when selecting the quests to follow. The fact that Jax's bag is like St. Patrick's well and that therefore you can carry an indefinite number of objects with you then seemed like a poorly guessed choice.
