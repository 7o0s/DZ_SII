{"name": "Gore", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gore.html", "text": "THE RETURN OF THE BUZZICONE Gore is a decidedly vintage title, at least in the concept and charisma of the character. Let's see what the plot offers us: In the mid-21st century, the planet is prey to urban gangs that control the suburbs and sometimes entire cities. In an attempt to recover power, the US government (Editor's note: Arieccoli...but think about your public finances...) designs a sophisticated machine called GORE intended to train soldiers for combat, forming them for war in a very short time. As it is easy to understand, many would want to turn the page if it were a paper magazine, in our case click elsewhere. For many others, however, it could be the egg of Columbus of their base instincts: a problem-free shooter where the brain is used as much as the brush by Pantani. Once the priority was action action action and here there is certainly no shortage of it, don't worry. So much so that right from the start the game becomes direct, impactful, with precise missions and without giving rise to doubts. Read linear plot that takes place through a series of levels established a priori, with continuity solution. Through it will be you precisely, the buzziconi slapped by neighborhood bullies, who did badly in school, you who put your bike down for a moment to get a cone with fior di latte and when you came back you only found the chain. The nerds of the moment catapulted to the sound of steroids into the heart of the mass of rioters. WALKING AND CRIVING Whistling and drooling from the desire to slaughter we will wander among the seventeen singleplayer maps prepared for us by the 4D Rulers. One thing we notice almost immediately is that there are no buttons to interact with the environment. We're back in a nutshell, to the time when doors opened by themselves, if right. So there are no problems finding the route, much less devising particular strategies or diversions by trying alternative routes. The interaction is in fact reduced to the bone, since you can only destroy a few objects in the play area. A partial help comes from the high number of weapons available, about eighteen, many of which have an alternative fire. A nice example? The futuristic counterpart of the shotgun, which as an alternative fire has a magnetic beam shield that materializes on your arm for a certain amount of time. Spectacular in furious melees! WALKING AND CRIVING Also noteworthy is the fatigue indicator, which significantly reduces our reactivity if brought too low. In fact, however, the game remains a shoot and kill without restraint and the pun GORE is welcome which, as we said before, is not only the name of the simulator but in English it also means something similar to gruesome, bloody and the like. Practically rivers of blood, with bodies riddled with fury by our mouse strokes, even when the corpses remain at our feet. No gibs anyway, I think it's a precise choice dictated by technical reasons. Be careful not to overdo the trigger though, because the specter of running out of shots is just around the corner, and several times you may find yourself scrambling towards the next enemy to retrieve his (often almost empty) weapon. AN ENGINE THAT (A) (M)AND (P)I LIKE Ok, another pun to say that the AMP engine gets along very well on all configurations, making it extremely scalable. I found it really fluid, in every situation. Clearly we are not at graphic levels of extreme complexity, typical of today's latest productions, but in any case we can have fun also thanks to the third person view, very nice to fully enjoy the forms of our digital alter ego, which also varies when we play in multiplay without any particular performance issues. Another graphic gem is that every power up we find we will see it worn by the character. I have to say that as soon as I saw the words character classes on the back cover my ears pricked up. In reality this is limited to singleplayer, however it represents a pleasant decision to be able to bet on impersonating a drunken biker, rather than a lethal punk girl, going from the perfect soldier to the hacker with bottom glasses. The thing is that it's not just about changing a skin, but also about having different game characteristics. Obviously we are not like an RPG where the statistics are precise down to the thousandth, but we still have different styles for firepower which is generally inversely proportional to the speed and size of the character. Pwhereby multy scrums get a little more interesting. A JUDGMENT ON METHADONE In my opinion, one of the first objectives that a software house that intends to produce an FPS must set itself is: the game must not be a clone of the usual FPS. Gore can't do it but maybe he's so anachronistic in our day that he could even succeed. In fact, its strong point is immediacy, which could make newbies of the genre happy for hours and hours. Alas, it's true that we all find it hard to believe that there are still newbies in the FPS genre who haven't already seen everything, but that's not said, I can always be proven wrong. As far as the game itself is concerned, it's not bad, if for you what counts mainly is violence and massacre, the counting of frags to be clear... via one and under another. Which maybe could be totally positive in a dedicated Unreal Tournament, so to speak. The problem is that here we have a super-heated minestrone and the seasoning barrel has been scraped properly to bring out a game that lives exclusively on its clichs. Mind you, it's not a bad game; in the end the graphics engine does its honest duty on all machines, even the less updated ones, without however surprising us as we are used to lately. A nice retro sberlone which, however, I feel like promoting if the goodness of CTO will bring it to your shelves at a reduced price, in order to balance the value for money. Man forewarned, half riddled. DONE, OVERDONE, COMPLETELY UNDONE I get up in the morning, I start banging my head against the wall, I let out a terrifying scream, so much so that the whole room turns around in amazement, I put myself in a plastic pose and look at the biceps, the pectorals with ~I love Myself~ tattooed on them, and attack to inhale some drug, just to please. I'm kicked out the door, into the pale light of the coming day. I inhale the air, double over under a coughing fit. I rear up angry like an unseasonal woodchuck and sprint madly towards the obstacle course, while firing revolvers with my right hand and throwing knives with my left at the silhouettes of those filthy street scraps of MOBs leaping out of the walls. Eventually I find myself dirty, sweaty and panting. It's only half past five in the morning and I start laughing heartily, a laugh that echoes in the air and seems to go on forever...", "date": "2002-07-25", "grade": null}
