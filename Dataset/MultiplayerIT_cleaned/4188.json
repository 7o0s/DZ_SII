{"name": "Cultist Simulator", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cultist-simulator-recensione.html", "text": "Cultist Simulator is a strange title: it's full of problems, it can lead the player to exasperation, but at the same time it's a deep and important experience that doesn't leave you indifferent. At the end of each game we feel inexplicably relieved, but at the same time we feel a certain unease, because almost without realizing it we have committed more or less atrocious acts, participating in a multifaceted and exciting story. Cultist Simulator is also an extremely complex video game, while being incredibly simple to play. Alexis Kennedy, the author, is not new to experimentation. Already with Sunless Sea, made with Failbetter Games, he had managed to push the very vision of narrative video games to its limits, using minimal means to create a coherent and structured story, albeit open to the player's initiative. After all, he had tried to do something similar with his previous titles: Fallen London, Machine Cares! and Dragon Age: The Last Court, he just couldn't take his ideas to their extremes. Game mechanics and gameplay At the beginning of Cultist Simulator you are faced with two cards: a verb and an object. By clicking on each one you can read a short description, unusually well written. There isn't a tutorial to explain what to do, but understanding that you need to associate the two cards to produce a certain action in a given time isn't difficult. The beauty is that the game mechanics are pretty much all here. The item cards used with the verb cards produce other cards and unlock other verbs, which open the game to a myriad of different combinations, necessary to pursue our main objective, which is to found a secret cult and make it operational. At the beginning you are a bit lost, because you don't quite understand what to do and because in a short time you find yourself really full of papers whose meaning you don't understand. Moreover, some disappear after a certain period of time, apparently without giving us any explanation. What happens? Let's say that the first game of Cultist Simulator should be understood as a way to experiment, understanding the nature of one's actions. It's like being faced with a table full of elements and being invited to combine them together to see what happens. With experience, you naturally find yourself making thoughtful decisions, following the flow of the game. The aura of mystery that surrounds our actions during the first hours disappears and we begin to conceive the gameplay no longer in terms of cards to match, but of choices to be made to obtain certain results. The cards become commands of a kind of big management in which we have to be able to expand our cult by organizing research expeditions, studying occult books, hiring new followers, stopping, even violently, those who want to oppose us and so on, all balancing necessities economic, mental and physical (represented by numbers at the bottom of the screen). Exploring all the available options reveals deeper mysteries, which lead to unimaginable arcane knowledge, which in turn open up to new situations, increasingly dark and interesting, all interspersed with events that create moments that are as intriguing as they are morally hard. In the end, we realize that we have lived a real narrative experience, the story of which has been told to us card after card, description after description. We have led it, but at the same time we have been led. It's hard to put into words the intrinsic beauty of Cultist Simulator gameplay. Let's imagine that looking at the images you see only a card game. The deceptive appearance is part of its rhetoric, i.e. of its having been conceived as a title for initiates that rejects anyone who does not nourish the desire to experiment and delve into its secrets. If you think about it, anyone who wants to join a cult must make the effort to understand its nature and rites and cannot expect a tutorial explaining what to do. In short, what many would perceive as a defect can instead be considered as a real design choice, which aims to give greater awareness of the game and what is being done. Graphics and defects So far Cultist Simulator can be considered a conceptual masterpiece. Unfortunately it has some flaws and it is also serious. We don't care much about the technical part: the game is what you see in the pictures, nothing more, nothing less. It works for what it's supposed to do and doesn't pretend to be what it isn't. The problems that afflict him are purely mechanical in nature, so to speak. Meanwhile, the system of pop-up windows that characterizes the interface is not very convenient andtends to accumulate warnings in case of errors or particular events. Especially in the beginning when you tend to try harder, it can be really annoying. The verb windows then often end up overlapping the cards, forcing you to move them continuously. As mentioned, with the hours the problem diminishes because the right automatisms are developed, but it is clear that something better could have been done to increase readability and reduce disturbing elements. However, the most serious problem of Cultist Simulator is not even this, but it is due to the very nature of the game, which tends to create negative loops from which it becomes almost impossible to get out. By negative loops we mean all those situations in which it does not seem possible to save yourself from a certain slope, no matter how many attempts you make. For example, during a game our character completely abandoned himself to madness and there was no way to get it back. In another case we ran out of economic resources and we weren't given the chance to recover, not even starting from the minimum. It is true that similar situations happen above all when one has little experience and can also lead to interesting moments, but often they seem to be limits to the conceptual strength of the game, limits that hold back the player precisely in what he is invited to do: experiment.", "date": "2018-06-26", "grade": "7.0"}
