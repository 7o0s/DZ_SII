Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a cent. letters were stamped instead of numbers. At each game, the dice were simply shuffled and placed randomly in the boxes, so within a time limit it was necessary to form as many words as possible, writing them down on a piece of paper and then taking into account the score based on the length of the compositions . The Boggle concept has obviously been translated into videogames, both in official form and in the guise of more or less valid clones, the best known of which is currently undoubtedly Ruzzle (which we reviewed a few weeks ago). Characterized by an asynchronous multiplayer mode that allows us to challenge friends or perfect strangers, the MAG Interactive title has the advantage of not only being very simple and fun, but also of relying on a structure that loops the matches seamlessly, accumulating challenges and then making us face them when we have some time. Even Microsoft has decided to join the fray with a similar product, and so here is Wordament, available not only on Windows Phone and Windows 8, but also recently landed on the iPhone. Unblock me this The title recalls the word ~achievement~, and it does not do it by chance. In fact, the game connects to our LIVE account, displaying any gamertag avatar and giving us the possibility of unlocking real Achievements during the games, which also take place in a sort of cross-platform that puts the users who use the game in the same ranking. experience on WP terminals, on PC and, of course, on iOS. Wordament's gameplay doesn't consist of direct challenges, which inevitably diminishes its appeal. We engage more than anything else with a continuous search for improvement, through two-minute sessions in which we have to find as many words as possible on the table, paying attention not only to the numerical value of each letter (the higher it is, the more precious the possible composition) but also to the ~thematic~ indications that may appear at certain times, and which particularly reward the terms pertaining to the topic. You start from the bottom of the standings and, from game to game, you can improve your position and get back on top, perhaps referring to players who are just a little ahead of us through a simple touch of their name (in this way they will become ~frenemies ~). The action takes place exactly like in Ruzzle, that is by dragging your finger on the touch screen to compose the words (the commands are immediately quite precise), but with the small novelty represented by the button to rotate the table, while in the upper part of the screen the time indicator runs inexorably. There is a pause of about thirty seconds between one attempt and another, and in this period of time Wordament allows us to analyze our performance with a list of terms found and not found, even on the basis of individual boxes, before making see our new leaderboard placement. As already mentioned, ten Objectives can be unlocked, obtainable for example by completing ten rounds, finding a thematic word, using all sixteen boxes on the board, composing the longest word and so on.", "date": "2013-01-19", "grade": "7.0"}
