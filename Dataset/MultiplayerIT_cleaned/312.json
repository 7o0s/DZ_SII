{"name": "Lumines Live! - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lumines-live-recensione.html", "text": "The announcement of the creation of Tetsuya Mizuguchi, already successfully launched on the PSP, considerably surprised the gaming community, astounded by the idea of playing a substantially new and full price title on the Live Arcade platform. Today the promises have been kept, Lumines Live! it is in fact freely downloadable after a substantial outlay of Microsoft Points, in a significantly revised version for online support. The possibility of multiplayer games on the big network, the objectives and the world ranking are in fact not indifferent additions for a game that is not lacking in appeal even in solitary use. The more relevant problem appears rather in the form in which Q? Entertainment has decided to sell the product, since the basic version (1200 mp) is devoid of numerous modes listed in the main menu, as well as being devoid of many skins that characterize the counterpart for the Sony laptop. To date, only one pack has been released containing additional themes (basically real levels) and the advanced challenge mode, at a cost of 600 mp, but this does not complete all the menu items. Our judgement, therefore, remains suspended between the indisputable goodness of Lumines Live! and the feeling that, even if you buy the most expensive title in the entire Live Arcade, you are still dealing with an incomplete game. Yeah! Lumines is a bizarre interpretation of the classic puzzle game son of the timeless Tetris, also in this case we have an incessant rain of bricks, which we will have to stack scrupulously to prevent them from reaching the upper end of the screen, due to the fateful game over. The substantial difference lies in the very nature of the bricks, rather than compact and immutable blocks, those of Lumines are nothing more than constructions composed of single square elements, prone to separation in case they find an obstacle in their path. The player is given, just like Tetris, the ability to rotate the composition to form contiguous colors, and their subsequent erasure by a timeline that spans the screen. It is therefore important to develop a strategy suitable for placing squares of the same color, and it must be done in the shortest possible time, as the speed at which the bricks fall is progressive, while the timeline decreases its efficiency as the levels pass. Acting with timing and precision is therefore essential. The main mode is the challenge, but there are many others, such as a split screen game against the CPU (which, however, consists of only one level even if you buy all the packages now available), timed sessions and puzzles to complete (also these limited in number even if you buy the two packs). Another peculiar feature is represented by the audio sector. Lumines is of a dynamic and interactive nature, just like Rez (not by chance by the same author), since every action, from the rotation of the bricks, to their placement, up to the combos, is underlined by a sound, which is inserted elegantly with background music on the theme of the skin in use. The genres are very eclectic, ranging from techno to soul, to Latin American, without prejudice to the electronic attitude of the soundtrack. Everything works surprisingly well, so much so that further packs with songs by famous artists are planned in the future and, this is the biggest news, even related videos instead of the usual skins. Comment Lumines Live! is a faithful transposition of the PSP title in the comfort of your living room, enriched by the added value of online multiplayer and rankings. Precisely on this aspect, however, the major flaws arise, the games are afflicted by an annoying lag, which prevents you from enjoying the frenetic pace of the game. Offline however, it is a highly addictive title, equipped with simple but intriguing mechanics, which risks causing the player to become easily addicted. Unfortunately it is currently impossible to fully evaluate the product for the distribution policy adopted on XBLA. There are still several modes missing, which can be purchased in the future in the form of additional packs, and which risk, however, excessively raising the cost. The final vote is therefore affected by the aforementioned shortcomings, it being understood that it is a title to be taken into serious consideration, if you love puzzle games. Pros Simple but immersive Excellent audio environment Online support... Cons Currently plagued by annoying lag Despite the price, it's not a complete product Goals The 200 points of Lumines Live! they are easily obtainable, but only once you master the game mechanics. Completing the basic mode will take less than an hour egr those who have already played on PSP, while greater dedication require the most advanced timed challenges and the achievement of at least 500,000 points in a single game. Blessed bricks Technically Lumines is a product with a great personality, clearly designed for handled use, sacrificing details for minimalist and futuristic graphics, but certainly not without care. It is certainly not the title to show off the capabilities of the hardware, but in the excitement of the matches there is no time to dwell too much on the details. The idea of dynamic skins is to the full benefit of the variety, and each of them stands out with its own peculiar colors and sounds. There is also a funny animated avatar, selectable from a vast collection, which reacts dynamically to the player's actions. In the end, aesthetically you can't ask for much more from a game like this, but the full support for 16:9 of modern liquid crystal televisions is certainly commendable, which gives life to some genuinely creative visuals. The main driving force is online, especially the constantly updated world rankings on all modes, which considerably fuel the impetus to try to achieve ever better scores. Unfortunately, the online games we played were all afflicted with consistent lag, a flaw that completely ruins the experience in a title like this. Pending desirable corrections, it is impossible to evaluate this aspect positively.", "date": "2006-10-26", "grade": null}
