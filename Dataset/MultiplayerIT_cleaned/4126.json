Once we have started a new game we have to create our avatar, a young hopeful driver who wants to make a career in the passenger transport business and we have to learn the basics of the trade, which start from the ignition of the bus itself and go through a minimal series of details , such as having to put the arrows to indicate the arrival at the stop, never touching the sidewalks with the wheels, not exceeding the speed limits, stopping at red traffic lights and much more, which make the job particularly demanding. Basically Bus Simulator 18 asks us to draw lines connecting different points of the city in which we are working, to then walk them personally in a reasonable time, stopping from time to time at stops to pick up and drop off passengers. The goal is obviously to transport as many as possible to make money. In addition to driving the bus, we also have to learn to handle some situations endemic to work itself, such as: opening doors; printing tickets to those who request them, learning to give the right change; scold the most unruly passengers, such as those who stop at the doors preventing them from closing, or those who listen to loud music disturbing others; observe the stop to see if there are any disabled people in wheelchairs and, if so, extend a ramp to let them go up. At the end of a section we will receive a report of our performance. If we haven't committed too many infractions, the gain will be assured. Obviously the longer a line is, the more passengers and the more money you can earn, but with a greater risk of committing infringements or excessive damage to the vehicle. Gameplay and graphics From a strictly simulation point of view, Bus Simulator 18 works just fine and offers many options for customizing the experience, both in terms of gameplay and in terms of bus aesthetics. For example, it is possible to completely eliminate some delays, such as starting up and putting the vehicle on the road or returning to the garage at the end of the journey; you can repaint the buses with different decorations; vary the weather conditions in which you drive (day, night, in the rain, at sunset and so on) and activate some simplifications in driving. If we want, the level of difficulty is determined precisely by these choices: it is obvious that driving with the maximum simulation level set is more difficult than doing it with a simplified one. So far Bus Simulator 18 does its job and is also enjoyable, showing a great love for the object it simulates. The Unreal Engine 4 also thinks to enrich it which has allowed the developers to create a city that is beautiful to look at and very varied in the environments, although repetitive in some elements such as human beings, all the same. The same traffic-forming vehicles are a handful that repeat themselves to boredom; not bad, given that we are certainly not dealing with a multi-billion dollar production. After all, it is also one of the most beautiful simulators to watch among those on the market, much superior to its predecessor Bus Simulator 16, or to direct competitors such as Bus Driver Simulator 2018 or City Bus Simulator 2018. Moreover, the buses are made really well, both in the exterior and in the interior, and abound with details on the dashboards, in the seats and in the trim itself. It is evident how the work of the graphics has focused on making the vehicles driven directly by the player at their best, more than in the rest. Of course, there are some technical problems, such as collisions between vehicles, which are practically non-existent, or the behavior of the traffic itself, which is often unnatural, but let's say that we are still a cut above other bus simulators, so the complaints they are very relative, unless you want to force the comparison. Problems Where Bus Simulator 18 is enormously flawed is in all the surrounding aspects of the simulation, which give the idea of a hasty, if not incomplete, product. For example, the single player campaign is made up of a series of objectives to be achieved which are assigned arbitrarily by the system and are not organic at work. Pursuing them serves to make money and unlock the seven areas of the city, but often we find ourselves struggling with paradoxical and unclear requests, such as forming meaningless lines just to please who knows who. The game also has a management part, but extremely poor: it is possible to hire drivers and buy new buses, so as to assign them to the various lines... a pity that to make them pproducts it is necessary to drive on those lines after the assignment. The reason for having to do this is not clear, but it becomes quite frustrating when you own many buses, have hired as many drivers and can therefore cover many lines. It should be noted that if you change a line already covered with an assigned driver, you will still have to retrace it to make it productive again. For the rest, the management part does not exist, in the sense that it is all here. Unfortunately, the lack of content characterizes all aspects of Bus Simulator 18: for example, the buses are well made, but there are few of them and to be able to buy them you need to accumulate the right experience and level up. The same goes for the city: as mentioned, it is beautiful and full of interesting areas, but there is only one and, after having traveled it far and wide several times, it is not a little tired. In short, a more articulated campaign and a greater number of buses would have been good for the gameplay, giving it more breathing space. To compensate, the multiplayer side could have thought of it... too bad it doesn't work at present. In theory it would be possible to invite friends to share the transport activity, but in fact we have never been able to play online for more than a few minutes. A quick search confirmed that the problem wasn't us, but the game itself. Hopefully the developers will fix it as soon as possible.", "date": "2018-07-27", "grade": "6.5"}
