{"name": "MX Vs ATV Untamed - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mx-vs-atv-untamed-recensione_a.html", "text": "Although it can be considered as a niche series, at least in our area, the brand linked to MX and related sporting events based on mud, jumps and speed has been continuously supported by THQ for several years. Started with TV: Offroad Fury, the series then settled in the current MX Vs ATV conformation, in order to condense two different specialties and make the lovers of one and the other happy in one fell swoop, as well as giving greater content depth to the game (similar operation to what happened with Smackdown Vs Raw, also by THQ among other things). For those who absolutely do not know what to expect from the cryptic title full of acronyms, with MX we mean Motocross, or rather those off-road circuit races on motorcycles, while ATVs are something decidedly similar, but carried out astride a quad, or a kind of four-wheeled motorcycle. This MX Vs ATV Untamed is the first installment in the series to reach the Nintendo DS, having crossed over to a plethora of other platforms, and considering the relative dearth of racing titles on the Nintendo handheld it could have been quite an important release, in the current portable gaming scene. Beyond Mario Kart and a few other games in the genre, there are not many racing simulations on the dual-screen console, and the immediacy of the driving style on which this THQ title is based seemed to be able to fit perfectly with the needs of the audience of this platform, on which complex driving simulations are unlikely to perform at their best. However, the game seems to be above all a good starting point on which to develop the series in the future, rather than a product that is already complete in all its parts and fully satisfying. The developers Tantalus, in charge of this version, have some precedents in the genre with Top Gear and ATV on Game Boy Advance, and with the same PSP version of MX Vs ATV: they have therefore been able to build an excellent game structure as regards the core of the gameplay, i.e. the actual racing, but they failed to build a lasting gaming experience around it. Rhythm is key The game is at its best in the core of the action, once you are ready with the motorcycle or ATV on the track. Of course, you need to have a minimum propensity for the racing genre, to be able to fully appreciate the game action: it is not an arcade like Mario Kart, nor a racing simulation on a track like Race Driver can be. Here, as in reality, it's a question of racing on dirt and bumpy circuits, with curves and jumps placed in such a way that they have to be tackled perfectly, catching the right rhythm to repeat in each lap of the race. Keeping the accelerator pressed constantly and simply correcting the trajectory we won't get great results: on the contrary, we need to understand how and at what speed to tackle the various curves, and set up the jumps perfectly by positioning ourselves well on the ramps and directing the bike for an optimal landing. By persevering, and trying to smooth out every imperfection, the best results are obtained, in a race that in the end is based on the rhythm to be found for each track. The latter have been excellently designed by Tantalus in this Nintendo DS version: the level design is certainly one of the strong points of the game, with always technical races that give little to the confusing action, and tend to concentrate the player as much as possible on the best possible performance , perfecting every turn and every jump, lap after lap. It is good that this is very clear to those who want a purely arcade racing game: this is perhaps not the most suitable title, and even those who are not familiar with the structure of MX racing will have to immerse themselves in the atmosphere, facilitated in any case by the excellent response to the commands that characterizes the title in question, and the discrete variety of tracks available. The feeling of a ~race against yourself~ is highlighted not only by the characteristic structure of Motocross, but here also by what can be considered a major flaw of the game: the lack of opponents. There is no trace of mass departures, and overcrowded tracks, since Untamed allows the simultaneous presence of only 4 drivers on the track, a decidedly small number for a racing game. Without side dish In addition to the scarcity of opponents, the real weakness of MX Vs ATV Untamed is the paucity of modes and options present, which fail to vary the gaming experience sufficiently. There are two main game modes: X-Cross Tournament (i.e. the actual race) and Stunt Challenge (a competition based mainly on the ~numbers~ to be performed in flight, during jumps), which in turn can be performed on MX, ATV or both. There are three tournaments, with progressive difficulty, in which we will have to face the 10 circuits that constitutescone all the repertoire of races available in the game. Therefore, it will not take long to strip everything that MX Vs ATV makes available, with the possibility of finishing the game in a few hours, and offering very few attractions to return to it for a long time. The multiplayer, which could have been the real cornerstone of the game action, is actually badly exploited: there is no online mode (which would have been extremely feasible, moreover with only 4 opponents on the track), while in LAN via wireless it is necessary to have multiple copies of the game, lacking the possibility of ~game sharing~ that nowadays one could expect to see in every title with multiplayer mode. Of course, with four Nintendo DS and four cartridges it is possible to face any specialty and track you want in multiplayer, but it is a situation that is not easily recreated in reality. Mud and engines In a game based on Motocross, graphics hardly assume a first-level role: the settings are usually not particularly suggestive and do not require extreme care in their implementation. In fact, MX Vs ATV Untamed adapts to the situation in a dignified way, without representing anything memorable. Below, a track made up of different shades of brown and bordered by signs; above, a sort of motordrome hinted at by large bleachers filled with a typically ~spixellated~ audience. In the middle, the one that stands out the most in the graphic sector of the game: the pilot and his vehicle. These are definitely reproduced with some care, and the animations of both elements play the imposed role very well. Adding to this a great sensation of speed that pervades the action, thanks to the fluidity with which the track flows under our wheels, we can conclude that, albeit minimalist, the graphics of this THQ product perform its duty perfectly, also considering the limitations of the hardware which certainly would not have allowed a more realistic simulation of the mud, the only element that can be missed. As far as the sound is concerned, anonymous electric guitars and the inevitable high-pitched and humming sound of the engine represent practically all that can be found. Comment The good game structure, which it is possible to savor in the heart of the action of MX Vs ATV, is definitely not enough to fully satisfy, and the general judgment is invalidated by the almost total lack of content that characterizes this title. In a few hours it is possible to master the 10 tracks made available, and conclude all the various tournaments that make up the small play offer proposed by Tantalus, so much so that this game seems like a sort of prototype of what may come in the future. The lack of online multiplayer is felt heavily, as is the obligation to play in LAN exclusively with multiple cartridges, effectively making the chances of being able to enjoy the action in multiple players scarce. A promise remains for the next episodes, after this clearance of the series on Nintendo DS, which hopefully can fully develop the unexpressed potential in this first chapter. An opportunity only partially realized. Pros: The driving system is fun and well done Good animations of vehicles and pilots There are not many alternatives of the genre Cons: Short and with major content shortcomings Lack of online multiplayer and ~game sharing~ Only 4 pilots on the track", "date": "2008-04-22", "grade": null}
