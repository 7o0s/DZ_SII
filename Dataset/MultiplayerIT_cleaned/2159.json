{"name": "Nei Dungeon Microsoft!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nei-dungeon-microsoft.html", "text": "The first step Creating your character begins with some basic choices like name, gender, physical appearance, and clothing. No choice is placed on the class to play: one of the many innovations is that you will forge your character based on the actions you perform most often. In DS there are only three primary attributes (strength, dexterity, intelligence) and 4 combat skills (melee, distance, nature magic and combat magic). Each of the combat skills is improved based on how you fight: if you decide to use the sword you will earn points in the hand-to-hand combat skill, if instead your preferred weapon is the bow, you will increase the ranged combat skill. The attribute system works in a similar way: by fighting hand-to-hand you will increase strength faster, less dexterity and very little intelligence, using magic skills instead the primary attribute that will enhance the most will be intelligence. By increasing the primary attributes and the levels of the four combat skills, you will be able to use ever more powerful weapons, armor and magic. The creation of the character therefore takes place without deciding how to distribute the skill points (classics of RPG games), but in a much more natural and realistic way (you improve in what you do more often). This character growth system is applied not only to the main character, but to all eventual party members. During your journey you will find PCs willing to join you (for money or just to be able to solve quests) and it will be your task to decide who to include in your group and how to make the other characters evolve (choosing for them which weapon to use, keeping in mind take into account the fact that the characters you will meet already have their own characteristics and their own armament). The first step From the early stages of the game you will have to have in mind what your ideal group will be (if you want to have one: this is the beauty of the game, you are very free to choose). In the first ten hours of the game (the beta I played a month ago) I had decided to limit the number of party members to a minimum in order to maximize the level of the main character (a wizard) (remember that experience depends on the number of enemies killed, if the party is large the experience for each character will be less). The second time, however, I bet on the strength of the group: two warriors, a defense mage (a healer) and an archer. Game and tactics proved to be profoundly different in the two cases. This in my opinion is one of the best features of DS. The only flaw of this whole system is that the creation of a multi-class character (warrior with good mage skills or other combinations) is completely discouraged and not very profitable for the development of the game (you'll find yourself pumping a only ~capacity~). The types of characters will therefore always be substantially 4 (warrior, archer, a defense mage, an attack mage). While DS is deeply action-packed, some other attributes would have added depth to the game. It moves DS unfolds through nine chapters, each of which has a couple of primary quests and some subquests, obtainable by talking to the characters you will meet (mostly) in the cities. For almost all of the game the path will be linear and only rarely will you leave the main road to complete the side quests. Two locations, on the other hand, definitely escape linear development (precisely the swamp and the Ehb castle), break the ~follow the road~ scheme, showing how behind the game there was a great study to make the experience compelling and never boring. Each chapter introduces you to locations completely different from the previous ones, new enemies and new drops (everything that enemies leave you when they die). One of the strengths of DS is that once you start you won't be able to stop playing, but you will remain on the constant search for new areas to explore and new enemies to kill (the areas are many and all very diversified, like the rest of the enemies , which in addition to having the most disparate features, will use different tactics each time). The plot of the game does not offer particularly interesting and new ideas; the background is however pleasant and enriched by the dialogues with the NPGs and by numerous manuscripts that you will collect during your adventure.The fights The strong point, however, is the management of the fights. From the early stages of the game it is known how the efforts of the programmers have been aimed at facilitating the management of the party without renouncing a complete customization of the tactics and behavior of the members during the fight. The formations, tactics and weapons to be used can be saved and recalled with the simple pressure of the keys; for example, you can start the fight with the wizard who casts offensive spells and then change his style using him as a healer. For each member of the group you can set the degree of aggression (defend, attack freely, do not attack), the selection criterion of the enemy (the closest, the strongest, the weakest) and the freedom of movement (stay united to the group , move freely). Artificial intelligence that moves party members is very good and has been programmed so as not to make fights a boring series of clicks on enemies (does anything diablo tell you?). An example above all are the mules, which if attacked will run away, and only if put on the corner will they not disdain to defend themselves by throwing a few kicks at their enemies. The fights The player's task will not only be to decide when and who to attack, but above all to set the tactics before the fight and coordinate the latter by intervening by ordering the members to use the health and mana bottles or by changing from time to time the target or set up defensive or escape maneuvers. If you don't like frenetic games with the use of the pause (similar to what we saw in Icewind Dale) you can set each action with all the necessary calm even during the fights themselves (in truth I have never found it necessary to use this function). The enemy AI is good; not infrequently you will witness ambushes, attacks on your least defended character (usually the wizard) and attempts to kill your mules (I noticed that wolves have a certain ~love~ towards them). If in the first levels of the game it won't be very important how you attack, later it will be essential to learn how to deal with an enemy group with the right tactics, especially if it is numerous and made up of different classes. Further information But how will you set up tactics? All very simple and immediate. On the left of the screen you have rectangles depicting your characters. For each character that joins the party, you will see its icon appear at the bottom. The order of these is very important, as it establishes the position within the formation. Naturally the order is changeable, and therefore you can move the melee fighters ~up~ so that it is always the character who engages the enemy first. You can keep the archers in the second row, then the wizards and in the back the mules. But as mentioned it often happens to fall into ambushes, or meet enemies who will attack your most defenseless members. Here, precisely in view of these events, you can decide to arrange your party in a different way (for example, keep warriors in front and behind, and keep the weakest within the group). After choosing the relative positions within the group, you can set the formation (among the 5-6 available) and the behavior of each character (there are 3 settings for each member, as I already said above). Further information In addition to these settings, to have full control of the party, you will have to form character selections (control+F1/8) which you will then have to recall during battles to quickly choose the characters to move and send on the enemy (F1/ F8). It may happen that, for example, a wizard is under attack, then you will need to select a part of the warriors to direct them to the defense of the wizard, you may need to be able to select all the fighting party members, to quickly bring them to a single enemy, that you are interested in killing immediately (usually those who do the most damage, or wizards who cast spells, or even worse, sorcerers who summon monsters). Another opportunity to customize the combat is given by the possibility to decide during the combat which weapons to use for your group. Each character has 4 usable slots (close combat weapon, ranged weapon, and two spells). You can save and recall weapon settings character by character, or save group configurations. Let's take an example to clarify how this works:At the start of combat, when the enemies are far away, it might be convenient to set up ranged weapons (bows for warriors and ranged offensive spells for mages). Once the enemies get close, it will be advisable to reset the ~melee~ weapons for the warriors who have specialized in close combat. During the fight you will be able to change the weapon settings for the third time, switching the magic of the wizards, who could serve as healers. If at the beginning of the game the enemies are weak and it will not be necessary to make the most of these features, later on the enemies become really difficult and it will be necessary to save the mana and health potions (you will have to think before attacking). Interface The immediacy of Dungeon Siege is impressive from the early stages of the game. Certainly thanks to the interface, which achieves a perfect compromise between simplicity and power. From the screenshots around the review you can see how well built it is in its various parts. At the bottom right is the part relating to the management of the formation and the ~behaviors~ of the characters. With two clicks this part of the interface disappears almost completely, like the compass at the top right. On the left is the part of the interface that concerns the management of inventories and character statistics. Perhaps the most innovative and successful part is the inventory and the automatic ~sorting~ option. By pressing a button, the objects of the selected character will be sorted, in order to maximize the free space. The management of object exchanges is also successful (there should be some screens that show you inventories of four characters side by side during an exchange phase). I didn't like at all the way in which the properties of the objects are shown: in practice a box appears when you pass the mouse over the object. The box that appears is placed on top of the other objects and blocks the view of the inventory. To understand how brilliant that little man named Chris Taylor (who is President/Designer of GPG) was, I can't help but spend a few lines mentioning the presence of mules as characters who can be part of your party and who will be the answer to what happened to you very often during the other RPGs: having too many objects and not being able to carry them all with you (and therefore having to leave something on the ground). With the introduction of mules this problem occurs much more rarely (of course depending on how many mules you get in your party). Taylor, Technique and Multiplayer That ferret Taylor has clear ideas and in the various interviews I've read, when it comes to Dungeon Siege the attention is almost always brought to the immersion research carried out by Chris. Says Taylor, ~What we wanted to do is build a world, where once you enter, loading screens will never appear again.~ At the basis of this is the desire to ensure that the player is totally taken by the game and nothing distracts him or makes the experience less engaging. In fact, you won't see loading windows during the game; the passage from one location to another will be continuous (at most a few small clicks when there must be an invisible ~loading~: the memory of the PC and of the video card is unfortunately limited). Great idea, done really well (all games should be like this). The engine: It's 3D...what do you want to know more than what you can't see from the screenshots? The ~official~ minimum requirements (which I think speak for a 400 MHz) are clearly underestimated. My Pentium 900 and my Gforce2 often suffered with too many enemies to render (especially at high resolutions). I imagine that with a more recent system the game doesn't have annoying slowdowns and the framerate remains much higher. To test this graphics engine with your system, the only solution is to try the demo released a few days ago. A name for the music: Jeremy Soule (players of Icewind Dale surely know him, for which Jeremy composed the music. Another game whose music is by this composer is Giants: Citizen Kabuto (although honestly I don't mind I remember the music - if you want to listen to some mp3s by this author go here). Taylor, Technique and Multiplayer The music of Dungeon Siege are, in my opinion, very successful and characterize the various phases of the game in a unique way (often you will stop at a change of music, as this informs you", "date": "2002-04-22", "grade": null}
