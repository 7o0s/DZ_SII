{"name": "Golf Blitz", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/golf-blitz-recensione.html", "text": "The Canadian team Noodlecake Studios is back on the green with Golf Blitz, a new arcade interpretation of the well-known sport. The title revisits the Super Stickman Golf approach by giving owners of Android and iOS devices a free-to-play arcade game experience with in-app purchases. The approach is multiplayer only, so you can take part in matches involving up to four players in a very stylized and colorful 2D playful context. In this sense, the starting discipline only acts as a pretext to introduce us to something that actually goes quite clearly beyond the traditional approach one would expect once you put your feet on the green with a club and bags on your shoulders. Here are our impressions in the review of the Android edition. Fight against time After creating your character, all you have to do is access the lobby and within a few moments you will be associated with three other users to participate in the first meeting. Unlike traditional golf, Golf Blitz is above all a race against the clock. Each competitor must try to reach the green by pocketing his ball before the others, but the game structure does not present a real division of turns between the competitors. There is a short waiting window between shots, but there is no strict order. Dwelling too long on the choice of the ideal trajectory therefore ends up being counterproductive because ultimately the game rewards above all improvisation and instinct. To load your shots, move your finger to the right or left: the shot direction will appear on the screen, which can be adjusted in width and height by moving away from or approaching the center circle positioned in the lower part of the display, with management of the trajectories that remember Angry Birds. Each path is quickly shown at the start of the game, but then you have to go a bit by feel since the shot only takes up a portion of the field you are crossing. On paper the participants in the challenge are not able to hinder each other as they would in other party games. There are therefore no power-ups that you can exploit to your advantage, nevertheless there are a series of power-ups that must be exploited at the most appropriate moment and can prove decisive for the final victory. On the other hand, it is possible to use some enhancements to be applied to your ball, which in fact improve the quality of the launches in specific game situations. The basic skills first of all include the sniper ball, useful for improving the precision of the shots in order to be able to insert the ball into the bottlenecks. Then we have the Super ball, equivalent to the loaded shot, which becomes indispensable for trying to burn opponents in time with very long shots in strategic points of the course. Alternatively there is the Veloce ball, which improves the speed of the shot to catch the other competitors on time. Since there is no rigid turn-based structure, as would happen in real golf, it often happens that we end up hindering each other, especially if we arrive in a group near the hole. More often than not you end up seeing your ball sticking to the backs of the others in the vicinity, and thus it happens that you perfect your shot in ~traffic~ situations, where it is simply impossible to bring your ball to its destination. In doing so, you inevitably end up facilitating someone else's pocket, since the only shot allowed on the green is a low shot. At first you will have only three upgrades available, while the others will be unlocked after unlocking the subsequent tours. The level structure is overall simple but quite varied. In some cases you start from one side of the map and have to head to the opposite side, while in other situations you start racing from an elevated position and it is necessary to descend progressively downwards. Clearly the conformation of each track is full of ups and downs, bottlenecks, bunkers and other elements that can hinder progression, making it more frenetic and fun to enjoy. On this front, the pay to win structure that is the basis of the game is grafted. Golf Blitz provides for the purchase of currency through real money. The gems can be obtained for sums ranging from a minimum of 1.09 euros to a maximum of 109.99 euros. Through the purchase of the packs you can get new golfers and items, but also improve the golf more quicklyeffectiveness of the upgrades unlocked, with clear advantages in online challenges. Card packs can then be obtained by spending 500, 1500 and 3500 gems, depending on the rarity of the items they contain. These materials can also be forfeited with the normal game progression, albeit very slowly to entice the user to invest his money and shorten the times. A free basic package is activated every two hours, while by collecting ten stars with victories on the field you can access a special package at no additional cost. In a title of this type, the leaderboards obviously could not be missing, based on seasons that last for several days and with scores that take into account both the performance of individual users and entire teams. In Golf Blitz it is in fact possible to create a new training from scratch, or request to join one of the existing ones, up to a maximum of fifty people.", "date": "2019-05-11", "grade": "6.5"}
