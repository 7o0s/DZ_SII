{"name": "3d Real Billiards 2007", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/3d-real-billiards-2007.html", "text": "3d Real Billiards was developed by the Qplaze group, founded in 2000 and now increasingly linked to successful brands, from Playboy to more classic titles, such as this one based on the world of billiards. Maximum realism in the game is ensured by an excellent control system that allows you to perform all kinds of shots with precision. The system is completely three-dimensional, placing the player's cue in the foreground as well as the game balls, a player who never appears on the screen to give way to a direct view of the scene. The view is freely adjustable and the green table can thus be rotated (and therefore faced) from every possible shot. To all this we can add very cinematic shots that will allow you to fully enjoy every single hole made, giving the impression of being inside a real game. Through the buttons of our numeric keypad we will therefore be able to change the shot and interact with the effect to be given to the ball, the power of the shot and activate or deactivate the information on the screen, such as the match points or the number of each ball. The sensitivity of the shots is guaranteed by the pressure dedicated to the now inflated key 5. All popular American and Russian game variants are featured in the title published by Nomoc, such as pyramid, little pyramid, 9 game or straight pool. Each of our successes on the green table is emphasized by an excellent replay, which highlights the movements of the ~colored balls~ up to the point score. The main modality is undoubtedly the Tournament, in any case both training and quick competitions against the computer or against another opponent via bluetooth are possible, in which we will face an increasingly stronger opponent from time to time, up to really challenging levels. at times slightly frustrating given the almost infallibility of certain AIs. Without a doubt we were impressed by this game that every fan of the genre cannot miss, we assure you that you will spend hours with it. PRO Technically very good Very deep and with many game variations AGAINST In the long run it can be frustrating", "date": "2007-05-23", "grade": "S.V."}
