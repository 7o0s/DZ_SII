{"name": "Fuga da Monkey Island", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fuga-da-monkey-island.html", "text": "The Story So Far After having fulfilled his dream of marrying the beautiful Elaine Marley, governor of Melee Island, returning from a not too eventful honeymoon, our hero discovers that both he and his beloved wife have been declared dead and that an evil and Mysterious Aussie is driving Melee to ruin by beating them in cheating taunting contests. Hence the pretext for this further adventure that will even lead you to learn Monkey Kombat and the Definitive Insult! Question of command In the preview of the game, I wrote that there is no more point and click in these new LucasArts adventures. Maybe I should have said, better still, that you don't use the mouse anymore. And this is a tragedy, especially if the character's control system is faithfully borrowed from Grim Fandango. It goes without saying that it is often a feat to run along a straight trajectory, be able to easily turn around in confined places and basically simply use the joypad. Then forget the analog control! A sense of frustration and helplessness will haunt you throughout the unfolding of the story, often suddenly turning off that demented smile that will be printed on your face after one of Guybrush's many irresistible gaffes. Fortunately, in part, the relief comes from the faithful keyboard, also because in Escape from Monkey Island it is necessary to use more keys. However, the actions that will be fundamental for the continuation of the adventure are the usual ones: examine, collect and use / combine. The rest of the commands are mainly used to use the inventory, to skip dialogues and to run. Graphics aren't everything! Graphically, the game is well done. The scenarios are painted in a cartoonish style full of nuances, never cloying and indeed often relaxing and bewitching. The animation of the characters is also excellent, with their gestures emphasizing the sense of the dialogues, giving them further realism. I wrote further, because the localization in Italian has, if possible, enriched the adventure. The dubbing of the characters is perfect, making use of a skilful mix of local dialects, never an end in itself and always well implemented. Particular credit must therefore be given to the CTO and its voice actors who worked hard to avoid a punctuated and clearly recited dubbing, which would have ruined the sound enjoyment of the adventure, as unfortunately often happens with localized games also in the dialogues. The background music is the usual, which paradoxically represents a good thing, because they have always been one of the strong points of the saga of the self-styled pirate Threepwood. The sound accompaniment masterfully changes with the events, enriching the dramatic scenes with pathos (???) and relaxing the gamer in moments of exploration. A note should be made on the interlude skits, the quality of which is often burdened by an approximate rendering, with visibly multifaceted polygons and a general lack of fluidity. It could have been done better. A 250,000 Playstation makes my PC with geForce2 pale for the quality of its movies (Diablo 2 is a happy exception to this rule). Do I buy or don't I buy? I've thought a lot about what to write at this point in the review. If I say that the game deserves to be bought and played (elsewhere on an Italian site, which is excellently made, I even read that we are dealing with a game that you absolutely must own...), I would say something that goes against my beliefs. So I'll give you just one piece of advice: try it before you buy it, perhaps by downloading the localized demo and thus tasting a slice of cake. If you like it you can eat it all, otherwise swallow the bite and goodbye and thank you! Deja Vu Electronic Arts and LucasArts: what do these two Software Houses have in common? The fact that they are both American? The word Arts? True, but not only. Take a 10-year-old game with a huge following of nostalgic enthusiasts, eager to experience the same emotions as many years ago, when, indoors in their bedrooms and with a very modest Amiga 500, they challenged the fearsome pirate LeChuck with insults. Then take a rich American video game production house, add the Grim Fandango graphics engine, a ton of demented jokes, a series of puzzles that can only be solved with a lot of nonsense and after spending your 100,000 lire you will have: Escape from Monkey Island. In other words, you will have a product that differs from the prequels only because it has a new little story, silly like the others and therefore certainly fun, but still deja vu. At this point allow me a little vent: enough! Let's stop compalways the same things and we will see that they will stop offering us. Why do people complain that PC games don't have that something that permeates and enriches console games? Why do our very expensive graphics cards always sit idle from one generation to the next? Why, in the end, millions of people buy Fifa 2001 and so many will buy this Monkey Island episode? As you will have understood, the approach to this review was not easy for me. I had to finish the whole game to be able to write it and I assure you it was a titanic undertaking. Several times I refrained from throwing the joypad at the screen. Only my stoic courage and numerous anesthetic bottles of Grog got me through to the end. I mean the end of this episode, of course!", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
