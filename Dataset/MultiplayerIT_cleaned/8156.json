{"name": "Ikai", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ikai-recensione.html", "text": "Many Westerners are fascinated by Japanese culture. This is testified by the large number of designers who try to copy the manga style (mostly anime) or the quantity of video games set in the archipelago, written by people who perhaps have only seen those places in books. The first work of the Spanish studio Endflame, essentially a very classic first-person horror made up of objects to look for, puzzles to solve and enemies to avoid, is exactly a typical product of this trend, in truth not too original, if we think to the late 19th century Japanese shops. It is therefore inevitable that Ikai's review also turns into a reflection on it. Japan for dummies Drawing seals is one of the recurring mechanics of the game Ikai is set in feudal Japan at the beginning of the last millennium and tells the story of Naoko, a young priestess who finds herself having to stop an invasion of yokai, spirits who live between the human and demon worlds, after that her uncle, an older and more experienced priest than her, has not returned from a trip made to reassure and bring protection to the inhabitants of the nearby village, in a panic due to the sighting of some evil spirits. What is happening? Why this massive invasion? What does Naoko have to do with all this? The entire narrative apparatus of Ikai is based on very classic solutions, with the story of his appearing thin, even if exciting, as long as you are able to follow it. To tell it are documents, which can be found by exploring the maps, or Naoko herself, who on some occasions launches into short revealing monologues. In reality there isn't a real linear story, but we need to reconstruct what happened in the young girl's past by putting all the pieces together, as they say. Unfortunately some documents are missable and, if you are not careful, you risk reaching the end of the game with some confusion in your head. The very nature of the yokai you meet is important to understand what happened (the game provides real cards on the yokai you meet), but it's easy to lose some details along the way. Naoko and the player Naoko, the protagonist of Ikai What gave us more to think about is how the developers have decided to make the relationship between Naoko and the player alienating, we don't know if voluntarily or just for lack of meditation on certain choices made in the game design and narrative construction phases. The adventure takes place entirely in places that the protagonist should know by heart, because she grew up there: the uncle's temple where she works, the neighboring forest, the village near the temple and so on; yet the player always finds himself with a lack of awareness and every time he has to try to understand where he has to go to do what the girl seems to take for granted. Paradoxically, some game sequences are based precisely on the search for the right path, with Naoko providing only enigmatic clues on the path to take or taking it for granted that the player also knows it. An example of this strange way of conceiving the entirely narrative relationship between the character and the game space is immediately at the beginning, when you have to go to a nearby river to wash some clothes, with Naoko providing clues as if she were first time seeing those places. In reality something similar happens several times inside the temple. It is true that Ikai does not last very long and that making Naoko's point of view agree with that of the player, therefore giving him his own awareness, would have shortened the experience even more, but in this way absurd situations are created which are counterproductive for the involvement , because they always refer the player to his condition of external agent and Naoko to that of mere avatar. Furthermore, we are talking about a game with a very low price, which therefore certainly does not need to last dozens of hours to satisfy the public. The puzzles The yokai are well done Another big problem of Ikai are the puzzles, the other fundamental element of the gameplay. During the game Naoko will find herself having to solve several, often without having clues on what to do. Not bad, one might say, except that sometimes not even the context is given, making the presence of the puzzle itself quite mysterious. The result is that rather than thinking about what needs to be done, it happens that we proceed by trial and error, assuming that sooner or later the right solution will be found. In reality some puzzles are not bad, such as that of the well or those that require you to draw seals quickly before being killed by demons, to give two examples, with the second being a mecrecurring song that becomes more and more complex as the adventure progresses; but others are really terrible, like one placed towards the end of the game that we solved practically at random and that blocked us for several minutes, ruining the narrative rhythm a bit. Be careful because we are not talking about difficult puzzles that require some thinking to solve, such as those of point and click adventures (the ones done well), but some that are introduced so badly that they are difficult to frame. The suspicion is that, as already mentioned, certain complications arise from the fact that Ikai can be completed in less than three hours on the first attempt (much depends on how much time is spent on the individual puzzles) and that therefore everything has been done to lengthen the possible broth, including tripping the player. Souvenirs Ikai is very short From a technical point of view Ikai is done quite well, especially in some really successful dream sequences. There are few places to visit (basically two macro areas), but they are full of details and show the love of the Spanish developers for Japanese culture ... perhaps a little too much. Unfortunately Ikai has the same problem as all the other titles set in the East, but developed by Westerners (Ghost of Tsushima, Sifu and so on): it looks like a postcard. The setting and story are so strict in wanting to be as Japanese as possible that they appear fake and lifeless. Let's say that if aliens descended on Earth after the apocalypse and had to reconstruct Japanese culture in a video game, starting from the various documents available, they would certainly create something similar to Ikai, while a Japanese would choose a completely different path to represent his culture. Just recently Ghostwire: Tokyo was released which gives us a perfect idea of how the Japanese love to rework their mythology, while, to stay in the horror field, think of Forbidden Siren or Fatal Frame, i.e. two deeply Japanese titles, which however seek to limit clichs as much as possible. Not that Ikai is bad to look at, for heaven's sake, because in some moments he can even be attractive, but he never goes beyond the surface of things, limiting himself to being a classic declaration of love and nothing more.
