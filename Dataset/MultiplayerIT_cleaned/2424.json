{"name": "Bloody Roar 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bloody-roar-3_a.html", "text": "Audio/Video Let's get straight to the point and talk about the technical components of the title, graphics, sound, playability and longevity. Visually, the title is very discontinuous: we go from objectively scary and incredible levels of detail to gross errors. Let me explain: on average the number of polygons does not seem to be very high, but the counterpart of this are the excellent animations and textures applied that make you cry out for a miracle for choice of colors, cleanliness and sharpness. In some cases you can see details that are really difficult to reproduce such as the iris, the contours of the ears, and also teeth and lips. In short, if we put the title in Practice mode and we pause to calmly see the characters we notice are smaller than those of the Tecmo and Namco titles. But not everything is splendid in this title: excellent fighters are matched by a creation of the backdrops that are often scandalous (see the stage of the aircraft carrier), and as if that weren't enough afflicted by a chronic lack of antialiasing. Even whole polygons often disappear, such as walls and walls, and not to show what is on the other side, but to show us a beautiful black background. Thankfully, some stages are flawless, but it seems that the programmers have spent most of their time only on the models of the protagonists. The same goes for the light effects that accompany the execution of particular combos, as well as during the super, which can be carried out after the transformation after reaching a bar that grows depending on the blows inflicted on the opponent. Summing up, it can be said that Bloody Rooar 3 graphically speaking, touches peaks and abysses with extreme ease, as if suddenly the development team ran out of time, without being able to make truly essential tweaks. The sound is attested to more than good levels, that is to say that it does its job honestly, without infamy and without praise. Animals you become... But the real crux of the matter is playability, so talking about it exhaustively is a must. The immediacy of the title is a positive factor, but at the same time it also represents a limitation. The sample of strokes at our disposal is not very varied, in short, we do not go crazy trying to perform dozens of moves and also thanks to a clever mix of key combinations a la Street Fighter and Tekken, in the blink of an eye we will be able to master our alter ego. This is the limit: the strategic component of the clash, studying the opponent and then hitting him with the best you have, goes down the drain. The clashes result in furious tinkering that has nothing to do with a real match. All you do is wait for the moment in which, having transformed into an animal, you can create the super choreography. The technique takes a back seat, whoever presses the keys faster counts much more, hoping to catch the opponent unprepared. In short, if in Tekken, Dead or Alive or Virtua Fighter it is not enough to know a thousand combos by heart, but you need to master all the evasive techniques, think and plan the matches almost tactically, in the Hudson title this is taken for granted or perhaps better said poorly implemented in the economics of the title. In short, if you play B.R. 3 thinking that you are facing a simulation, you are very wrong. 2 is always better... It is undeniable that in the short term the title is still fun, but once the surprise effect is over, in the long run we will turn to something deeper if we are also looking for the substance behind an encounter fighting game. A peculiarity of this title that directly influences the outcome of the meetings is the structural, non-cosmetic realization of the locations. Some of them have narrow rings, closed by boards, railings and various palisades, where to fight, which greatly limit the movements. Slamming or being slammed into them will gradually give way, revealing the entire stage. This is the only moment in which the keys of the pad will not wear out by pressing them in a whirlwind at random: placed in a corner with no way out we will take a lot of beatings without being able to do anything other than look. This also introduces the question of the level of difficulty: the game is quite difficult, and even at the normal level (more or less the 4th) it sometimes becomes frustrating and a source of uncontrolled swearing. In short, it is better to play in two. Ultimately, the title suffers from a somewhat simplistic setting that will make those who expected a simulation turn up their noses. Those looking for a simple and immediate title will find Bloody Rooar 3 a good product, but nothing more. Comand as usual the problem is always the same: it is not always possible to mediate between 2 approaches or philosophies, and the result is to have in your hands a hybrid product, no longer original, which risks nothing, but also wins nothing. Pros: Good graphics Original Funny Cons: Some graphical glitches Shallow depth There's better out there... The beauty and the Beast! Bloody Rooar 3 is, without beating about the bush, a good product that differs from its direct antagonists, Tekken Tag and Dead or Alive, not so much for the gimmick of the ~bestiality~ of the characters as for a more immediate and geek approach, in short, less technical and celebrate them, if you allow me the term, of the other two titles. The possibilities that the Hudson title gives us are few: Arcade, Survival, Practice and Vs Battle. Importantly, it must be said that in Survival mode, if you pass a meeting, the energy spent is not partially regenerated, a custom now established in titles of this genre. The roster of fighters, except for the secret ones, consists of 12 wrestlers, men and women, including the unborn, which makes 24 if we also count their animal counterparts. Most of the animal kingdom is represented in the title: bats, wolves, moles, lions, rabbits, chameleons, tigers, insects and panthers will crowd our screens in a blaze of animations and colours.", "date": "2001-08-08", "grade": null}
