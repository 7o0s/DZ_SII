Konami knows this very well, which on the last two occasions has been caught unprepared for the arrival of the new platforms, taking a few slips with its football simulation. The review of eFootball PES 2021 Season Update (which for convenience we will call in its abbreviated form from now on) comes with the awareness of the choice of the Japanese publisher to make an update of the previous chapter to the season that is starting, preserving the bulk of its efforts for the edition that we will see arriving in a year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X. A choice that we imagine Konami has been pondering for a long time, considering all the possible risks in discovering the attacking flank of EA Sports' competition with FIFA 21, destined to arrive in the classic form of all years on both old and new generation consoles. However, a choice made also with the strength of those who know they have broad shoulders, thanks to a chapter like eFootball PES 2020 capable of returning the football series to its former glory with gameplay undoubtedly worthy of praise. A few days after the arrival of eFootball PES 2021 on the market, here is our verdict. Mode: all the same Having made the necessary premises on Konami's choices for eFootball PES 2021, let's take a concrete look at what the developers have included in this update package. As for the modalities, we could simply limit ourselves to referring you to the review of eFootball PES 2020 written a year ago, as from this point of view it changes very little. Practically nothing, if we look at the possibilities made available to us by Konami from a higher level. In fact, the Matchday mode is identical, just as the MyClub is proposed again in a perfectly specular way to the one seen previously. Ditto with potatoes as regards Become a Legend. A slightly different discussion deserves the Master League, renewed by Konami a year ago with the arrival of some avatars dedicated to real managers such as Diego Armando Maradona, Ruud Gullit and others. Compared to the previous edition, Konami has added the possibility of choosing other coaches, accompanying those already present with figures such as Pep Guardiola, Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard. The novelties of the Master League, however, stop at this point, because everything else remains as it was: thus we will see our coach involved between the various games in some intermission scenes with some dialogues with the possibility of multiple choice, which already years ago they gave us the impression that they might lose their long-term appeal. Twelve months later we confirm that this is undoubtedly the case, hoping that for eFootball PES 2022 the developers can improve and expand this component of the Master League. However, this mode remains the heart of the franchise's offline experience. Gameplay: something is moving Once you take the field, the game mechanics of eFootball PES 2021 appear quite similar to those of its predecessor, with respect to which, however, it is possible to notice some differences after a few games. Nothing particularly striking, please, but just enough to improve and refine what was and remains the best football simulation experience seen on the current videogame generation. Compared to a year ago, the gameplay of eFootball PES 2021 appears more fluid, above all thanks to Konami's intervention on the behavior of the players who in too many cases were watching the ball pass a short distance from their position. There is now a sense of greater reactivity from the twenty-two on the pitch, thus allowing more space for changes of pace between a slower and more reasoned kick and one played instead at speed. We note some changes also regarding the management of cards by the referees, rightly less severe than last year in punishing some interventions with yellow cards. However, the management of some tackles still needs to be reviewed, which leads match officials to call a foul even when the defender's intervention ends up hitting the opponent's body after catching the ball. The same goes for the management of the advantage rule, which can certainly be improved. For everything else, what was said in the review of eFootball PES 2020 is broadly valid, in particular as regards ball physics capable of satisfying even the finest palates between rebound shots and various types of rebounds, benefiting from the greater reactivity of the players to make the ping-pong situations encountered in the past less frequentor. Where is the update? The gameplay of eFootball PES 2021 therefore integrates that of its predecessor, but obviously for this edition it is not the main aspect. The Season Update conceived by Konami should in fact bring the game into line with the 2020/2021 football season, strongly influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. While the main European leagues are starting in these days, the transfer window will in fact end on October 5th, thus also forcing Konami to find a way to adapt to this situation. Tackling a historically hot topic of roster and competition updates for the PES series, the Japanese team chose to wait until next month to complete the rosters and championships. The result is therefore a proposal for content halfway between last season and the one that is starting, with updates to the latter made patchy between the various leagues. Unfortunately, our Serie A is one of the leagues furthest behind from this point of view. view, with the total absence of promotions and relegations. We therefore still find Lecce, Brescia and Spal in the top flight, while Benevento, Crotone and Spezia are in Serie B. The only updated elements are the aesthetic ones concerning the Juventus and Roma shirts, i.e. the Italian teams that have sold in exclusive name and coat of arms to Konami for their representation in eFootball PES 2021. Considering that in the ballet of licenses the series however loses this year the exclusive ones of Inter and Milan (together with San Siro), the balance compared to the previous chapter is unfortunately to be this negative point of view. The final package that will bring eFootball PES 2021 to the 2020/2021 season is expected for October 22nd, until which we will therefore have to wait to virtually experience the Italian championships. Unless you decide to use an external options file, but that's another story. The same goes for the Spanish Liga, while the French Ligue 1 and the English Premier League can already count on the updated participating teams thanks to the patch published a few days ago. In such a situation it is difficult for us to consider the strategy adopted by Konami for the publication of updates satisfactory, especially in an era of ~perpetually connected~ like the one in which we find ourselves. An extra effort to give real-time updates to leagues and squads would undoubtedly have given eFootball PES 2021 more appeal than it currently has. In the event that this had not been possible, a postponement of the release date towards autumn would probably have been wise, a solution also adopted by FIFA 21. Under these conditions, even if at a reduced price compared to the classic editions, the Season Update does not justify an immediate purchase, but it can be postponed until Konami releases the full data package in more than a month. Graphics and surroundings As with the other aspects of eFootball PES 2021 that have been touched little or nothing with this Season Update, we limit ourselves to some brief considerations on the technical sector. The graphic part looks identical to that of the game from a year ago, but we would have expected something like this even if the game hadn't been presented as a Season Update. In fact, having reached the end of the generation, it is difficult to think of the possibility of further improving what we have seen so far, which we remember is in any case of excellent workmanship: beyond the top players with attention to every detail, Konami has in fact long accustomed us to a more than good representation even for less famous players. We remind you that the UEFA Euro 2020 license will be present again this year, after the competition was postponed to 2021 due to the pandemic. If maintaining the graphic quality level is acceptable, the same cannot be said for the sound. The commentary entrusted to Fabio Caressa and Luca Marchegiani is in fact completely identical to that of eFootball PES 2020, already not very convincing a year ago. Twelve months later, hearing the same phrases again is decidedly unpleasant. How much do you cost me? Even if presented as an update, eFootball PES 2021 Season Update is sold separately from its predecessor, with which it can therefore possibly coexist on the same console. The price of the basic digital version is 29.99 euros, which becomes 34.99 euros in the case of the Club Editions dedicated to the Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Manchester United and Arsenal teams. If you already own eFootball PES 2010 (also in the Lite version) you can get a 20% discount on your purchase, provided you make the purchase before 29 October 2020. Those who instead choose to buyeFootball PES 2021 on physical media must spend 39.99 euros.", "date": "2020-09-17", "grade": "7.8"}
