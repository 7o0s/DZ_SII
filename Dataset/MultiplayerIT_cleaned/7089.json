{"name": "Il grande fratello", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/132428-watch-dogs-il-grande-fratello.html", "text": "Watch Dogs is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious titles ever made by Ubisoft, a potentially explosive mixture that stands as a synthesis of the experiences made with Splinter Cell and Assassin's Creed, and which naturally also draws on the sandbox mechanics of Grand Theft Auto. After reviewing it in depth in the next-gen console version, now the time has come to focus on the PC version. We will therefore try to focus more on the differences and peculiarities of this conversion, while for all aspects of the plot and gameplay, we refer you to the other article. The story of Aiden Pearce, a destroyed man seeking revenge, therefore ends up opposing a background jam-packed with things to do, with missions that can arise almost by accident, ~spying~ on passers-by in search of a possible crime that is about to be perpetrated; or by reaching one of the many points indicated on the map, which play the variety card and also allow themselves to experience absurd situations thanks to ~psychedelic trips~. The latter put us in command of a huge robotic spider with the aim of destroying everything that comes within range, make the character fly from one flower to another in a vertigo of acid colors, or place us driving a car to asphalt monsters, and so on. Needless to say, the developers have indulged themselves on the creativity front. Thanks also to a structure that proves to be able to withstand any circumstance well, from frenetic police chases to stealth operations, from firefights to the original strategic component introduced with the ability to hack any electronic device, whether it's a camera, of a forklift, a lock or, of course, a computer. Precisely this feature acts as a cornerstone for the construction of an interesting playful scaffolding and a harbinger of great satisfaction, given that it is possible to manage, for example, the clash with an armed gang by detonating charges close to each enemy, creating diversions for have time to come out into the open and open fire, or - why not? - climb over a net and cut the rope as fast as possible. The lack of an obligatory linearity is appreciated more as you proceed in the countryside, which is also a harbinger of many different situations. Not all the gears appear perfectly oiled, but as a debut for a new intellectual property, one really cannot complain: driving the vehicles seems inconsistent at first, but then it gives satisfaction and even allows fine manoeuvres, especially when you learn to take advantage from the hacking of traffic lights and bollards; the gunplay is perhaps the weakest aspect of the offer, but it works in a more than discreet way, thanks also to opponents moved by a relatively lively artificial intelligence, who often come out of their ambushes to surprise us up close, an eventuality that unfortunately suffers a bit of ~Splinter Cell Syndrome~; finally, stealth is well implemented and fast in its dynamics, without downtime and indeed with some nice ideas (see the exploitation of the guards' mobile cameras). Watch Dogs is an excellent sandbox, particularly long-lived and engaging, full of things to do The Italian version The protagonist of Watch Dogs always has his smartphone in his hand, so get used to GTA-style chats, even and especially while you're driving a car. We know Rockstar's policies regarding the localization of games well, but Ubisoft does not deal with these problems and has delivered us a completely dubbed version of the game in Italian. As has already happened for the latest productions of the French house, the dialogues in our language were very well recited, evidently thanks to a direction worthy of the name, and the comparison with the original interpreters is therefore not merciless (although Aiden's voice in English is decidedly hoarse, a solution that we doubt could have been rendered well in Italian). Downgrade? When it was shown for the first time, during the 2012 edition of E3, Watch Dogs had an extraordinary visual impact and there were accusations, not too veiled, of having made a substantial downgrade of the graphics so that the game could run on current platforms, even the so-called ~next gen~ and the PC. Let's take into consideration the Windows version in a context with hardware up to the situation, as can be our test configuration. Was there really a downgrade? Yes, and this video shows very well what has been lost along the way. In fact, the E3 demo boasted a volumetric fog similar to that seen in the recent Batman: Arkham Origins, which resulted from the use of NVIDIA's PhysX technology, but was inexplicably removed. Likewise, a large amount of shadows have been eliminated and, in general, the lighting system has undergone some downward adjustments. How did this influence the result that is before our eyes today? As already highlighted in the review of the console edition, the graphics of Watch Dogs have an excessively ~flat~ appearance during the daytime phases, precisely due to poor management of shadows and lights. It is probable that the use of software like SweetFX could partially solve the problem, however we are not fans of ~external~ solutions and we would rather have liked Ubisoft to deliver us a product capable of maintaining the same technical consistency at any time, rather than transforming, literally, when the sun sets. It is in fact at night that the game gives its best, enhancing the detail of the buildings and the abundant visual distance very well, in a mix of lights and shadows that is not particularly advanced from a technical point of view but certainly effective in surrender. Superior version Another issue that has held the table for months concerns factors such as resolution, frame rate and effects. Watch Dogs runs on PlayStation 4 at 900p and on Xbox One at 792p, in both cases at 30 frames per second, and it is therefore quite clear that the PC version of the game places itself as the absolute best. In fact, on the test configuration the title runs at 1080p and 60 FPS, even if the frame rate in our specific case often proved to be a dancer, subject to evident stuttering and unexplained drops. Unfortunately, it is the usual problem of the AnvilNext, the same one we talked about in the review of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, or the lack of exploitation by the engine of multicore processors in favor of an ~old school~ approach that focuses on power brute of single threads, and which of course clearly and substantially benefits Intel CPUs. So if you own a medium-high-end i5 and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770, you probably won't encounter these problems; if instead, like the writer, you have chosen an AMD product... start putting money aside for an i5 or an i7. You can alleviate this by using double-frame v-sync, which effectively locks at 30 frames per second and thus runs the game at about half capacity, while keeping output constant and eliminating tearing. However, there are many options available to scale the experience on less demanding configurations: in addition to the resolution, Watch Dogs allows you to select the type of antialiasing you prefer up to the exclusive TXAA 4X of NVIDIA cards, opt for variable quality textures (we used le Ultra) and finally make fine adjustments to the level of detail, shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion (in our case HBAO+ high), motion blur, depth of field, water quality and of the shaders. In short, the requirements to enjoy the 1080p experience to the fullest are certainly not sparing, but considering the discussion made above, we believe they are not even impossible, and in any case they are very close to those of the aforementioned Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag .", "date": "2014-05-28", "grade": "9.0"}
