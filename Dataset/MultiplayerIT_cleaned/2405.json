Just after we realized we were the only survivor of the crash of an airship, shot down by flak on our way to a foreign land to seek our fortune. What? And I'm supposed to believe the words of a madman who approaches me and says: ~I mean... do you know who you are? You are the reincarnation of an ancient and powerful elf wizard! My religion venerates you!~ Nahh! Let's leave it alone... or I could get some benefit by humoring this guy! Ok, for now let's get involved in his ramblings, then we'll see. Here is the first example of one of the classic decisions that we will have to face in the game, and that like many others will influence the events during the game. Arcanum is a true RPG in style, and you immediately understand it from the first moments that we look at it: simply the most varied and detailed character creation ever seen. You can choose to ~be anyone~ within this world. Of course I mean: take on the features of one of the races in the game, be a ~technological or a magical~, be a thief or a scientist, a warrior or a slum refuse ... the distinction in classes does not exist a priori, you are you who decide how you want your alter ego to develop by distributing the points as you like through the skills made available by the game. Of background then, there are galore. And the entire game is damn replayable! And it's not the usual bait and switch that some games boast... it's really true: tackling Arcanum in a different way will lead to discovering secondary quests with respect to the plot, often long and different in substance and in the way of completing them depending on the alignment and attitudes of our character. Example from me: I decided to make a cruel character, an elf necromancer/summoner, who made a deal with a demon to sell his soul to get more magic power. Once in town, I contacted the boss, who asked me to help him defend the bank from a gang of thieves. I accepted. In the evening at the inn a drunk guy approaches me offering me to collaborate in robbing the bank!! I agree to split the loot in half in exchange for the combination. The next day I enter the bank and massacre the girl at the counter and a guard. I hide the bodies and steal the money. In the evening I go back to the guy, I give him the money, I complete the quest... but be careful! As he comes out, I pawn him and kill him, recovering the money. The next morning, nice and quiet, I introduce myself to the boss and together we vanquish the band of thieves, who have not yet entered the bank, even getting the reward and the quest! Ok, now none of you will want to go out with me for a beer for fear of turning your back on me, but what a satisfaction to be able to carry out those heinous actions in complete decision-making freedom!! But Arcanum isn't just deep and beautiful to play... it's also expandable! Thanks to the presence of MODs, new levels can be played by selecting them from the starting menu. A powerful editor is present with the game, and the many possibilities to implement scripts mean that the already high longevity of this title can be extended beyond measure. Not to mention the online mode, which basically suggests deathmatch... but we'll see if the community will be able to take advantage of the opportunity to ~surprise~ themselves with new campaigns, missions, etc. Technique and prediction The game technically proves to be quite valid, and in my opinion it represents one of the last RPG bastions in pure 2D style. The graphics of the environments and objects are very detailed, the same characters are characterized by period clothes and different features. Perhaps however, the characters occasionally suffer from somewhat jerky animations, and the game occasionally swaps abundantly from the hard disk for a few seconds, ~freezing~ the video images (this regardless of the power of your machine) but it is a detail on the which you will pass over after a while, or get used to it anyway. The audio department is a bit poor sincerely, some more evocative music would not have spoiled. One thing that I absolutely recommend is to install the official patch of the game, which in addition to making some minor improvements, adds the possibility of playing in full screen mode by pressing F10. some screenshots testify to the goodness of this decision, given that by popular demand from the people the Troika has realized that the game interface is useful in all its parts, but sometimes it is a bit too cumbersome. I would also like to point out a nice paper manual supplied, with news colside on the races, on the science / magic of Arcanum and several good level illustrations. A purchase that I would recommend to anyone eager to enter a new world, but without distorting the basic concepts that are so dear to us. Levels, experience points, magic and technology. But also well done dialogues and too intrusive hands in the gameplay. A gem not to be missed, especially if you are a fan of well-made 2D and want to witness a small masterpiece of innovation of its kind. Other pictures! 19 Locomotives and flaming darts Hell! I've been trying all day to concentrate on developing this prodigious alchemical formula I've just discovered... and I can't! It is possible that by now the positive magical energies emanating in this area have completely vanished due to that damned steam engine, the work of that dwarf... who plays with his ridiculous gimmicks! I wonder if I will be able to find refuge in the elven community of forest mages. Does this dialogue seem out of place to you? Nonsense? Then let yourself be surprised by Arcanum, which makes its setting something innovative, and simply refreshing in this sea of games often branded by us as sterile photocopies of already consolidated successes. Set at the time of the late industrial revolution, the world of Arcanum is populated by all the races that made the fantasy genre famous: humans, dwarves, half-orcs, elves, halflings, gnomes and half-ogres! Imagine the effect of a half-orc taking tea in a tie and waistcoat, snapping his fingers to warm up the water... how how? Yes! Magic exists strong in the land of Arcanum, and coexists in a delicate balance as technology advances. Different schools of thought for a world to be discovered, and which will leave us amazed by the variety of situations and fortuitous combinations in which we will get involved.", "date": "2001-09-11", "grade": null}
