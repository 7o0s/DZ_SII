{"name": "Avo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/avo-recensione.html", "text": "Avo was born from a simple but fascinating intuition, which brings together the world of augmented reality with that of so-called interactive films, a branch of productions that spread in the 90s with the customs clearance of optical supports and full motion video sequences , and which seemed to represent the future of video games, only to be quickly archived due to the clear limitations of their predetermined formulas. Well, the mobile game by the English team Playdeo doesn't make the same mistake, on the contrary it tries to take advantage of the good things offered by new technologies and combines it with a sort of small film filmed in a professional manner, with nice actors and partly good at enhance the narrative. The protagonist of the game is precisely Avo, a sentient avocado with arms, legs and a pair of big eyes, created in the laboratory by a young scientist, Billie. The girl has several very innovative projects in mind but she needs our help to be able to realize them, therefore in the eight chapters that make up the campaign (which however include a prologue and an epilogue, both short) our task will be to help her by going around for the scenario to collect green beans but also and above all key objects for the progression of the adventure. However, Billie's research is being monitored in secret by an unscrupulous businessman, and when the latter tries to take possession of it we will have to bring out all our determination, overcoming obstacle courses and avoiding traps in order to support the young researcher and obtain the longed-for happy ending. Gameplay and structure The idea behind Avo therefore lies in the use of filmed sequences as background for an augmented reality that projects the character we control and the objects with which he can interact into the scenarios. The framing changes according to our position, a bit like in the classic episodes of Resident Evil and in the unforgettable Alone in the Dark, with the difference that the scenography in this case moves, is ~alive~ and provides continuous cues of 'interest. Exploration is the key to a gameplay that in the end is very simple, and that asks us to draw trajectories on the screen that Avo will immediately start following, walking with his funny gait or proceeding more quickly if one collects one of the special beans. There are several secrets to discover that lead to the replayability of the missions, new devices to deal with (see the teleporter) and the count of the aforementioned beans, which act as virtual currency for unlocking the individual episodes of the countryside. Unfortunately, here the proverbial donkey falls a bit: the game can be downloaded for free, to access the first three missions it is possible to use the ~money~ already in our possession and with a little effort you can raise more beans, but it becomes practically a must shell out the 6.99 euros needed to get enough credits to unlock four more levels in order to complete the adventure. In theory it would in fact be possible to obtain the beans without cost, but the stages would have to be replayed at least ten times, without the possibility of skipping the predetermined cinematic sequences. As a freemium formula it's not bad, it makes sense, but the final price seemed a little above the average for the products available on the App Store. In any case, we are talking about an affordable amount, which you may be happy to spend to accompany Avo on his adventure and discover its secrets, accompanied by an excellent mix of graphics and videos, the contagious smile of the actress who plays Billie and a audio perfectly functional to the action.", "date": "2019-03-08", "grade": "7.5"}
