{"name": "Idol Manager", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/idol-manager-recensione-gestionale.html", "text": "When we started Idol Manager, we imagined a light adventure in the entertainment industry: a business simulation, sure, but simplified to make room for what seemed to be the main thing - the young idols and our relationship with them. Maybe that's why the first game ended in bankruptcy, because we underestimated a far from simple game, in which the ~dating sim~ component is a small part of a much more complex and layered system, where even the smallest mistake can have huge repercussions. It may have been the idea behind it that misled us, having to manage a group of idols in their climb to success, the fact is that within a few hours we had to start over and put our heads in a game as challenging as it is addictive. This, of course, if you are passionate about management and have several hours to spend on it. If not, it's not really the best starting point to dive into the genre. Let's find out the game in detail in our Idol Manager review. The vortex of the star system Idol Manager: Maintaining the right relationship with idols is important As the name suggests, Idol Manager simulates the management of an agency focused on finding talent, with the aim of transforming very young girls into idols. After choosing the gender of our avatar, as well as that of the antagonist who will put a spoke in the wheel in our long climb to success, we will receive a small capital investment from a strange and not exactly reassuring benefactor. From now on, every day, we will have to work to find the most promising idols, train them to improve their strengths, create a team that covers their weaknesses, shape the public image of these girls, create a fan base loyalists distributed according to a specific demographic, up to the highest point: the possibility of representing the whole of Japan on the world stage of the entertainment industry. If this seems like many things to keep in mind, know that they are not even all. We warned you, Idol Manager deceives with its simplified management air in favor of a dating sim mechanic (present above all for business purposes), only to present itself as a surprisingly complex game from which it is then difficult to detach. You know the classic promise ~five more minutes and then off~, only to find yourself there again hours later? Perfect, if we wish we could summarize Idol Manager in this concept. Difficult, yes, yet so engaging not only because you want to avoid bankruptcy but also to see the idol group grow and meet the deserved success. How to succeed in such an enterprise? Idol Manager doesn't suggest the best way, in the sense that we can take our work and the girls who will be part of the agency to heart, or think only of profit: translated, this means that we are free to make them work until they drop, even point of getting injured, physically and emotionally overtaxing them for profit alone. A disgusting person, in short, who nonetheless paints the difficult world of (and of) idols in a potentially realistic way. There is also the possibility of opting for a more calculated growth, with a fair distribution of work provided one accepts the slow progression of our company and girls. Or again, balance the two extremes in the best possible way, asking for sacrifices where they prove to be really necessary and avoiding exceeding when instead there is a way to take things more lightly.Each choice will have its consequences and we greatly appreciated the facets of Idol Manager in this sense: after the initial failure, we focused on trying these three approaches - reasoned, balanced, aggressive - to discover, of course, that the role of ruthless manager leaves a lot of discomfort in its accuracy. Idol Manager, Choosing the position of individual idols in the lineup is very important to the performance With this we do not mean that the oriental entertainment industry, in this specific case, is all like this: we do not presume to know how it works behind the scenes but there was a particular moment that reminded us of the case by the k-pop group Momoland. In short, the game asked us at one point whether or not to make our idols wear so-called ~safety shorts~ - with its advantages and disadvantages. Choosing not to reminded us when, in 2018, Momoland performed several times in exactly the same conditions, arousing the anger of fans and non. For the uninitiated, the lack of safety shorts is seenas a kind of exploitation, as it makes the performance very unpleasant for the idols, who are forced to constantly make sure that their underwear is not seen. Being faced with the same situation, with the proverbial knife on the side of the handle, made us realize how much Idol Manager can prove to be all too accurate in its revival of this kind of industry. It doesn't try to sweeten the pill, it doesn't make everything ~kawaii~, preferring to present things as they potentially can be - or have been, thinking back to the Momoland case. From an apparently trivial game important reflections can arise and this is clearly a point in favor. A layered and unforgiving gameplay Idol Manager: an overview of our company Patience is the key word in every management game and Idol Manager is no exception. If we have no idea where to get our hands and, above all, we don't build solid foundations for our future empire, bankruptcy is around the corner. It matters little that the game gives us a second chance in case of failure: if we don't know how to move and we insist in the wrong direction hoping that things will settle down sooner or later, we will throw away this opportunity too. If we had to list every single operation required by the game, space would not be enough: from the construction of dedicated environments, whether they are administrative offices, dance halls, recording studios or other, up to the hiring of key figures for our business (we certainly cannot hope to carry on all alone), obviously passing through the search for talent, Idol Manager does not make us waste the slightest time. Idol Manager, there are many steps required to make a disc and they all need to be carefully evaluated Having built the above foundations of the agency, we are ready to take the first steps in the entertainment industry and that means making every single decision regarding all employees, even choosing to replace them with more capable ones - and this goes for the idol. At the beginning it will be difficult to obtain highly qualified personnel, even if it were for a question of image and salary: on the one hand, who would ever want to get involved with a newborn company? On the other hand, our coffers may not be sufficient to pay the due salaries of people of a certain importance. With the idols there is a little more leeway, because luck could smile on us and get us a very talented girl right away, but even here we must not rest on our laurels: one does not make the whole group and in putting the girls together we have to evaluate every single feature (and there are many) but above all their distinctive character trait. Let's take a practical example with the image below: Imamura Miori is a very talented idol but has a tendency to snitch, spreading gossip in the event that our relationship with you is not optimal. Which means giving it priority in a sense. Is it worth the risk? Are we willing to adapt our strategy to the character in order to have his talent on stage? Idol Manager: The choice of the idol is essential for the well-being of the group This is just one of the many choices that the game gives us. Group dynamics are also taken into consideration, any disagreements to be resolved immediately and which can even arise from the role occupied by idols in training. Behind the objective of finding the correct balance between personal profit and the general well-being of the company, accurate planning is hidden: sometimes we may be forced to spend a lot of money to receive the same amount back, others instead we just need to give our idols the right rest so that come back more energetic than before. Vital, in Idol Manager, is not to focus too much on a single aspect because you run the risk of losing sight of all the others and wasting precious time. As pleasant as it may be to spend time with our idols, whether for the possibility of building a relationship (not all of them will accept advances!) or simply to understand them better and frame them precisely within the group, we must not forget the constant exercise , promotion, search for sponsors, and so on. Idol Manager, commercial proposals are essential to increase the fame of our group (and to earn) For this reason, the pause button is our most precious friend: the days can flow more or less quickly but, unlike real life, we can stop time to reflect and evaluate our current situation. With practice you can find your own pace to get to the end of the day with all goals completed: from performance onstage to training in the studio, from spa treatments to relax the idols, to coffees taken with them to chat and get to know them better, passing through the equally delicate marketing department where you can manage commercial proposals taking care not to go against the clauses contractual; every aspect of Idol Manager will slowly find its place in our routine. It is important to understand that the game cannot be accelerated, there are important assessments to be made from time to time knowing that our actions could have repercussions in the future. For example, all the staff accumulate research points daily which will then have to be spent to create new songs, choreographies or improve the marketing side. Idol Manager: It is our job to resolve disagreements between idols in the best possible way This provided that the people in charge are not engaged in other activities, such as training idols. It is therefore necessary to find the right balance between profitable inactivity, aimed at collecting research points, and keeping staff members busy with the tasks that are their responsibility. This is precisely the beauty of Idol Manager: it's not just about dealing with a promising group of young girls, there's a whole company to run. Which segment of the public do we want to target? In what age group? What genre is more appropriate? How can we handle a possible slip by one of our idols, which has attracted people's dislikes? We wrote it in the beginning, the game could have easily focused only on the idols and our relationship with them, automating everything else. Instead he chose to fully invest us with the role of manager, with all the responsibilities that follow. Especially when we want to manage more than one idol group - because yes, we can. Thinking about the flaws of the game, we cannot deny that it is too easy to go bankrupt, even on the lowest difficulties: some aspects should be rebalanced, without get to the point of oversimplifying the game, but there is no doubt that some adjustments would be useful. Furthermore, it is a bit of a pity not being able to create a male idol group, or even a mixed one like K.A.R.D and Triple H: after all, the romantic aspect of Idol Manager is neither easy to conquer nor has a net weight in the economy of the game; introducing the possibility of managing more varied groups would instead have been a natural option for a management system of this level.", "date": "2021-08-07", "grade": "8.0"}
