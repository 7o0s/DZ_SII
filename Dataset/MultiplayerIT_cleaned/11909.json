{"name": "Nervous Brickdown - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nervous-brickdown-recensione.html", "text": "After years, the surprise Usually, the formula for reviving a decades-old concept is always the same: reproposing the same gameplay with an aesthetic reworking in step with the times and, in the specific case of Nintendo DS, also adding support for the new touch screen controls. Nervous Brickdown follows this formula but goes even further: in fact, only the first levels can be considered a mere revival of the old Breakout in a modern sauce, from the tenth onwards, in addition to a graphic design that becomes more and more original, a sort of experimental elaboration of the classic game structure, applied to several other genres. The ten ~worlds~ of which the game is composed, in turn divided into 9 levels plus a final monster, are actually digressions on the main theme of the wand-with-bouncing-ball, which overlook completely different styles of play. In the aquatic world, the wand is a submarine, which in addition to eliminating blocks by bouncing the ball, must also save a series of men who fall from the platforms above; in ~Curve~ the game takes on the appearance of minigolf, in which the wand is actually a club intent on throwing the ball through various paths to reach the hole, while in ~Ghost~ the structure of Breakout mixes with some reminiscences mariesche, of the classic levels with forced scrolling in which we are forced to quickly find the escape route in order not to get stuck; in ~Shoot~, as a last example, the wand is even a spaceship, capable of shooting as in a typical shoot'em up. Nervous Brickdown is a continuous digression on various videogame themes, constantly keeping in mind, however, the basic structure on which the game is based After years, the surprise In short, the whole game is configured as a cauldron of different gameplay modes: much more than a simple collection of mini-games, Nervous Brickdown is a continuous digression on various videogame themes, constantly keeping in mind, however, the basic structure on which the game it is founded. And with this, the main strengths and weaknesses of the title in question also emerge: control via touch screen is in fact rapid and precise, with good variations applied to the original structure (such as the possibility of freely moving the wand across the entire lower screen in some worlds, without the classic limitation of movement on the horizontal axis), but all the new introductions do not completely remove the historically negative aspects of the game, first of all the inevitable monotony of long-term action and the poor control over action, which often involves the interminable wait to be able to hit the only small block left in a corner at the top of the screen (and here the excellent pun that serves as the title of the product in question comes into play). Avant-garde vintage The most striking aspect in Nervous Brickdown, at least at first glance, is the technical sector. Although it doesn't actually need a top-level graphics and sound accompaniment, the minimalist and particular style of the Arkedo game immediately fascinates. The ten worlds that make up the game correspond to ten different styles, pleasant experiments on different themes: the first levels are essentially an up-to-date elaboration of the original Breakout, with graphics enriched by simple movable three-dimensional figures so as to give a futuristic yet austere look to the game. From the second world onwards, things begin to change radically: the paper world leads us to play first with lined school notebooks, then within evocative Japanese squares and finally within primitive pastel-tribal drawings, with the possibility of designing the wand to be used in the first person (and here the design plays an important role, since it can influence the bounce of the ball). And these are just examples, since the game is full of radical changes in style, bringing to the limit the new trend, now quite ingrained, of re-proposing old classics under a new, unexpected and disruptive guise. Even the musical accompaniment is at excellent levels, with an extensive use of synthesizer music that seems to come directly from the 80s, but with absolutely modern polishing and taste (such as the particular use of sampled voices distorted in different levels). Comment Nervous Brickdown is a small jewel of design and manufacturing technique. Given a well-known and well-established concept, as well as tens of years old, all that needed to be inserted, to make sense of the game, was a captivating aesthetic and new introductions well inserted and harmonized with the structuregeneral hue. The Arkedo title meets all these requirements, and fully succeeds in giving meaning, in 2007, to a new clone of Breakout and Arkanoid, and in all probability fascinate (or at least amaze) even those who hear these names think they know already exactly how to evaluate the product in question. The fundamental problem therefore is represented only by the intrinsic limits in the structure of the game, which offers a fun puzzle game in small doses but shallow compared to other similar games, with a high probability of making you nervous on more than one occasion due to a design of the levels sometimes too complex. If you are looking for a quick and easy pastime you will find an excellent answer, otherwise evaluate well, even if it will still be easy to become fascinated by Nervous Brickdown.Pros Fascinating to see and listen to Instant fun Excellent implementation of tactile controls sometimes too complicated. If you hate the underlying structure, it is poorly indicated Nervous Brickdown is available for Nintendo DS It's easy to say that certain concepts are eternal, in the videogame field, but in fact, a puzzle game from almost thirty years ago can hardly still be as interesting as it once was. Let's take for example Breakout (or its clone Arkanaoid): a horizontally movable bar, a bouncing ~ball~ (actually a square, most of the time, at the time of gigantic pixels) and a pile of blocks to knock down by throwing it on them . The controller was often represented by a simple Pong-style potentiometer, and most of the fun lay in the simple fact of being able, in a sci-fi way at the time, to control an object on the screen, causing visible reactions. Eons later, audiences are accustomed to something else: even the relatively modest hardware of the Nintendo DS can deliver performance that makes Breakout a kind of rock painting of the caves of gaming prehistory, and mere human-machine interaction is not enough more to amuse the user. For this reason the thought of a new Breakout in a modern sauce does not seem very exciting, at first, at least until you get to the heart of the action in this Nervous Brickdown by Arkedo/Eidos", "date": "2007-10-22", "grade": null}
