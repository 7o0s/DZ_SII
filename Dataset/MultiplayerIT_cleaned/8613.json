It was the beginning of a new genre, which can perhaps be summarized with the term ~draw lines~, which placed the casual player in nothing less than the shoes of the men with the highest responsibility linked to the world of air transport, i.e. the radar men, silently at work from control towers around the world. The ingenious idea of controlling the routes of the various flying vehicles up to their natural landing place using only a finger was so successful that a sequel, inevitably, was easily imaginable. Flight Control Rocket therefore represents the natural evolution of its predecessor, also in a literal sense: from ~normal~ civil aircraft, in fact, we now move on to driving much more technological spacecrafts. How do you park a space ship Although the context in which to imagine one's flight controller activity has radically changed, the heart of the gameplay that characterizes Flight Control Rocket has remained substantially unchanged: by ~plugging~ a spacecraft of a certain color, one must trace a optimal route, in order to guarantee its landing in complete safety. What changes in this incarnation is above all the landing site of the aircraft: here it is a majestic and enormous flagship, with three docking decks distinguished by the traditional colors of the series (pink, yellow and green). However, this is only the first of a long series of innovations; the same ships to be made safe are now even of 15 different types, each with well-defined characteristics. By way of example, in addition to the standard type ships, it is possible to mention at least one that carries a series of even smaller mini aircraft, to be landed quickly in succession, or one that, once directed towards its natural landing place, unfolds in a sort of snake of flying means, all connected to each other. On the other hand, the specific aircraft is very annoying which, while trying to reach the pertinent bridge, releases other small ships stationary behind it which in turn need guidance; just get distracted for a moment in this case to find the screen full of dangerous unidentified flying objects, lethal if bumped. In a short time, therefore, the familiar chaos of routes and means well known to lovers of the series will be created in the atmosphere-free skies; this time, however, fortunately the dreaded Game Over does not implacable at the first collision but three ~lives~ are available and therefore as many opportunities for error; in case of ~death~ to continue and accumulate very high scores you have to invest at least 500 game coins, under penalty of having to start over. The introduction of currency is another novelty, actually a little less welcome, of Flight Control Rocket: with these coins, in addition to the aforementioned additional credits to continue after a death, it is possible to unlock new modes (even if at the moment they are only two, i.e. the traditional Infinity and a kind of story called Odyssey) but above all the latest innovation added, i.e. the support Bots. These are essentially small automatons which, if activated, can help the player in some way in carrying out his mission, for example by increasing the experience or the money accumulated, reducing the probability of impact and even guiding some ships alone to their landing. To be kept efficient, the Bots need maintenance, in particular new battery packs that can always be purchased from the same well-stocked shop, and with each success they increase their level of experience; Needless to say, thanks to microtransactions, the opportunity is given to ~cheat~, so to speak, by buying virtual gold coins with real currency to spend in the shop. Very good, considering the particular category to which the game belongs, also the technical sector, thanks to the support for high definition on iPhone and iPad and the excellent colours. Finally, the complete online statistics system via Game Center and Origin as well as obviously the usual objectives are useful for increasing longevity.", "date": "2012-04-06", "grade": "7.8"}
