{"name": "LEGO Star Wars: La Saga Completa - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lego-star-wars-la-saga-completa-recensione.html", "text": "Invest in the brick The structure of LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga takes up the one already seen in The Classic Trilogy, therefore we will find ourselves using two characters at a time with the possibility of leading one or the other at any time, approaching the piloted companion from the AI and pressing the X button. When the group is enriched with further elements, we will be able to recall them by touching the icon on the touch screen. Also in this case we will be faced with an action game with numerous platform elements and some simple puzzles, together with alternative sections in the form of vertically scrolling shoot 'em-ups. The starting point is always the Mos Eisley tavern, and it is from there that we can access the various episodes (each divided into five stages, generally) as well as the extras, in this case the minigames in which you have to use the stylus. When we have completed a level, we can then replay it in free mode and use the newly unlocked characters, with the aim of completing the section 100% (ie collecting all the objects and opening all the doors). As you could imagine, the game exploits the peculiarities of the Nintendo DS in a rather marginal way: the movement is assigned to the d-pad, while the Y button is used to attack (with the lightsaber or the rifle, depending on the case), the B button to jump and the A button to activate the switches or use the Force (the latter can also be activated via the touch screen, but in a somewhat cumbersome way). Finally, the back keys allow us to scroll through the available characters instead of having to ~tap~ on their icons. Use the Force, Luke! Right from the start, LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga proves to be a strongly arcade product, in which the action takes place very quickly and without particular hitches: the immediate and essential control system, the connotation of the locations but also the medium difficulty some ~puzzles~ fit perfectly with the portable nature of the game and lend themselves to short but nonetheless engaging sessions. All the elements that characterized the prequel are present, so we will find ourselves using the Force to activate switches or create structures that allow us to reach certain areas, collect LEGO coins and assemble the loose pieces that we will find on the ground and which will go to build devices of various kinds. The alternative sections, done really well, see us pilot a ship and face (with a top view and vertical scrolling) a series of enemies, with the possibility of reversing the direction of our vehicle if necessary. Technical realization It's true that you learn from mistakes, and The Complete Saga on Nintendo DS embodies what The Classic Trilogy should have been, at least in intention. The characters are very well represented, have good animations and move within well-designed scenarios full of elements, which never appear bare. Everything moves with a stable frame rate of thirty frames per second, so it's really an excellent result and perhaps the only flaw lies in the creation of the cutscenes, which are really disappointing and not made up of movies: a choice made to save memory, an all in all fair reasoning but which limits one of the strengths of the game, namely the humor based on the relationship between Star Wars and LEGO bricks. There's not much to say about the sound sector: John Williams' music speaks for itself, in fact, and is really reproduced with great quality, as are the effects that refer to the original ones of the films (with all the limitations of the case). . As anticipated, the control system is rather classic and has little reliance on the specific characteristics of the Nintendo DS, but it works well and there is no reason to criticize it. Finally, it is possible to play together with a friend in cooperative multiplayer mode if you have two game cartridges. Comment LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga is truly an excellent title, which finally brings to the Nintendo DS the quality that we have already been able to see in The Classic Trilogy on other platforms. Technically excellent, immediate and fun, it almost completely takes up the mechanics of the prequel, refining them where possible and adding interesting shoot'em-up sections (the quality of which should be reflected on, because perhaps something ~fresh~ could be created in this sense) . The combat system is certainly limited and naive, sometimes ~slippery~, but in the end it does its job without any particular problems. Sure, if you've already completed The Classic Trilogy on another platform, longevity issues could arise as there are no substantial differences between the two products. Butif you are fasting on LEGO Star Wars, it is really worth taking advantage of it. Pros: Excellent technical realization Immediate and fun Quite long-lived Cons: Almost identical to The Classical Trilogy Takes very little use of the touch screen Perhaps too linear LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga is available for Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii, PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360. The tested version is the one for Nintendo DS.", "date": "2007-12-21", "grade": null}
