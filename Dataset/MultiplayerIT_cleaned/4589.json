{"name": "Ghost Song", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-song-recensione.html", "text": "On the desolate planet of Lorian, a Deadsuit awakens from a long sleep, with no memory of what its mission is or memories of the place around it. She's not even sure what she is, in fact: a humanoid? An android with artificial intelligence? The only way to get answers is to start exploring the planet, inside the long and winding dungeon that is gradually revealed as in any good self-respecting metroidvania. Ghost Song's review can basically proceed like that of any of the many games of this genre that are coming out in recent years, yet let's immediately say that this title has something different from many others: not necessarily better, because there are better balanced games or featuring a more intriguing combat system, but its strange atmosphere and graphic style drawn in 2D immediately manage to capture the player and drag him into the mysteries of Lorian. It is quickly discovered that the planet is inhabited by hostile creatures and is fraught with obstacles and traps of various types, but everything is immersed in a melancholy atmosphere which, in some way, makes even the most disturbing and obscure features that are discovered in its meanderings fascinating. The drawing, the strange light that pervades the caves and the audio accompaniment make up a sci-fi framework that recalls the legendary Super Metroid on the one hand and a certain tradition of author sci-fi comics on the other, managing to assert its own specific identity and unlike any other emulator of the historic action adventure Nintendo. In addition to this extraordinary atmosphere, Ghost Song also tries to enrich the hybrid formula with some rather peculiar thoughts, which look towards the souls-like genre and which convince only up to a certain point, but they certainly manage to characterize the game with an original touch , while clearly showing various derivations from the models taken as a source of inspiration. Between exploration, discovery and introspection Ghost Song: The awakening of the Deadsuit at the start of the game The protagonist is not animated by great ideals or by a specific mission in the history of Ghost Song and this is also a very particular element. The beginning of his journey is a simple wander to discover the surroundings, then it becomes the answer to a call for help which he takes charge of almost automatically, but without ever understanding precisely why and without a real emotional drag towards the enterprise epic. Everything becomes a kind of journey of self-discovery, because the main character, who doesn't even have a real name, has no idea what it is or if there really is anyone inside the Deadsuit. It is a ~new~ and bizarre creature, capable of using lethal weapons against enemies and then marveling at the most fascinating aspects of the alien environment, dissolving tension in more emotional and delicate moments, even if always lived with the detachment of a probably not very human entity. In short, the ~mystery~ of the protagonist is an element that works well and above all is cohesive with the way in which the whole world of Lorian is represented, halfway between profound restlessness and melancholic beauty. On the other hand, it is a construct which is also useful for explaining the typical structure of the metroidvania, with the Deadsuit progressively obtaining additional powers and tools to advance in new parts of the map, conquering (or recovering?) Weapons and equipment that give rise to new possibilities for movement and attack. In short, it is the classic scheme of these games, which provide backtracking as an integral part of the experience, once the conquest of the double jump, the sprint or the weapons capable of breaking down walls can open up new paths that were previously precluded. In the case of Ghost Song, the lack of clarity on the uses of some instruments and the repetitiveness of some scenarios do not make navigation easy, which is sometimes even frustrating, when, for example, fast travel is precluded or we are forced to look for one of the rare ~ statues~ that allow armor to be repaired, but all of this can be said to be ~part of the game~. A suit for every eventuality Melancholy charm and horror often merge in Ghost Song Equipped with a cannon mounted in the arm with different types of fire, the Deadsuit is a highly skilled tool for combat, with the protagonist who can alternate between various types of attack switching at any time from ranged fire to melee shots. In this regard, an interesting mechanic should be noted which represents another peculiar feature of Ghost Song: the repeated fire overheats the cannon making it less effectivein the long run, but at the same time this problem can be used as an advantage, because it makes melee attacks more powerful, adding a small but interesting tactical element to the fight. To this must also be added the study of the equipment to be used, given that there are various possibilities in terms of arsenal and support objects to be activated but there are limits to their use. In addition to the choice of secondary weapon, the management of equipment is based on the activation of modules that change the protagonist's statistics and his abilities. The modules are conquered by advancing in the game, but their activation requires energy, which can only be supplied in limited quantities by the suit: this forces you to choose which ones to activate, thus also allowing a little customization on the construction of the character. Increasing the level of the Deadsuit also expands the energy capacities, allowing for the activation of a greater number of modules at the same time, but a selection is always necessary. Metroidvania and souls-like Bosses can appear quite unexpectedly in Ghost Song If the general setting and also some characteristics of the protagonist clearly recall Metroid, various aspects related to combat and character progression are more reminiscent of Hollow Knight, but here we also see some new and interesting ideas. In addition to the high level of challenge posed by the enemies and above all by the various bosses encountered on the way, the souls-like elements have to do with the level advancement system and the management of the protagonist's death. Each enemy eliminated allows you to conquer various quantities of ~nanogel~, a substance that can be used as a sort of currency, capable of allowing you to level up, buy items from a kind of merchant or repair persistent damage to the suit . In short, it works like the runes of Elden Ring, for example, and exactly like in FromSoftware games, the death of the protagonist involves the loss of all the conquered nanogel, which can however be recovered by returning to the place of elimination. The growth of the Deadsuit, beyond the tools that are found by advancing in the game, it is largely linked to the conquest of the nanogel, therefore the fights become indispensable in this sense: the investment in ~force~, ~decision~ and ~firepower~ can be done only in the presence of some ~statues~ (ancient and mysterious half-extinguished androids) scattered around the map, which also allow fast travel and repair. Ghost Song: one of the ~statues~, i.e. mysterious androids, which allow for level-ups and repairs This last element is linked to another original Ghost Song dynamic, namely the presence of permanent damage. With each awakening after death, in addition to the zeroing of the transported nanogel, the armor is damaged and reduces the total amount of life points available, being able to be repaired only in the presence of the statues, which however often require demanding journeys to be reached . It is an interesting and original mechanic, which enriches the game and increases the level of challenge even if it can increase the frustration in the most demanding moments, such as when facing repeated deaths against the bosses. It is also a further additional insistence on backtracking, which in some cases can quite shake the player's nerves, especially within the more challenging and enemy-filled areas. Drawn sci-fi The dialogues in Ghost Song are never banal Level design remains the fundamental element on which a metroidvania focuses, and Ghost Song from this point of view does not disappoint, staging a world that pushes discovery thanks to its wonders and mysteries. The Old Moon team also seems to have adopted a less obvious rule that unites several great games belonging to this genre: the presence of some small moments and particular encounters scattered around the map, able to surprise the player with unexpected situations and bizarre characters. The graphic style adopted recalls the tradition of science fiction comics of the 70s, between the French South American school, all built in 2D and with a truly unique trait and continuously oscillating between horror and melancholy, diluting the disturbing tones with some figures grotesques and creatures that are almost tender, in contrast with the oppressive sense of decadence that pervades the planet of Lorian. This tone halfway between lugubrious and romantic is also well underlined by the audio accompaniment, composed of electronic pieces that intervene at times to underline various moments of the game.and far too artisanal, not to mention a little rough in some respects, but it has a truly extraordinary charm. Unfortunately, the use of bitmap drawing is clearly expensive in terms of asset creation, which is why the repetitions are many in the construction of the scenarios, with some areas that are much more accurate and pleasant than others. A Mysterious Clash of Ghost Song The construction of the map, another main element of a good metroidvania, is convincing even if with the aforementioned moments of bewilderment and frustration that can emerge in some situations. Ghost Song also takes up the tradition of Metroid and Castlevania as regards the secret passages: these are hidden behind apparently anonymous walls to be demolished, even if often, on closer inspection, there is always some detail that suggests the possibility of a passage.", "date": "2022-11-28", "grade": "8.0"}
