{"name": "Starship Troopers: Terran Ascendancy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/starship-troopers-terran-ascendancy.html", "text": "Johnny Rico and his companions The game is based on a 1959 novel by Robert Heinlein, an American science fiction writer, which narrates the deeds of fearless men and women who make up the Mobile Infantry, a kind of space Marines ready to sacrifice themselves for their own honor and that of the Citizens . I don't know how many of you have read this book, but surely there will be many more who have seen the excellent film by Paul Verhoeven. Well, the game fully resumes the themes covered in the film, and even the first missions tell and integrate the plot from the attack on Zagama Beach (only mentioned in the film) to the capture of the first Brain-Bug (in short, the thinking scarrafone) . From here new and intriguing missions are grafted that see us fight on many planets, even in the solar system, in an attempt to stem the heavy offensive produced by the Insects. So are we ready to step into the role of Johnny Rico, Dizzy Flores or Carmen Ibanez? I see a hint of consent! Well fasten your seat belts that takes you on a path 25 missions long (5 of which are training) and full, indeed, jam-packed with insects. The quality of these is decidedly remarkable, and it could not be otherwise given that they represent the only resource available and that will see us engaged in escort, disinfestation, search and rescue operations and so on. The performance of each of these missions is preceded by a classic briefing followed by the choice of men or equipment. And here we find the first big news. How to make a career quickly? Join the Mobile Infantry! Let's go back to the movie for a moment. If you remember Private Rico soon becomes an Officer, not only on his own merits, but also thanks to the incredible ease with which the graduates (like all other soldiers) die of causes that are not exactly natural (unless consider it natural to become an Arachnid's snack). This aspect is reproduced very well in the game, and indeed the advancement of rank turns out to be one of the fundamental aspects, also because only by progressing in the career will it be possible to use the best weapons and exoskeletons. How to make a career quickly? Join the Mobile Infantry! Let's go straight into the details. We can equip our Marines absolutely completely. At the top you choose the exoskeletons or armor, on the left the weapons (we find rifles, flamethrowers, missile launchers, grenade launchers and anything else that can destroy) which can also be two, while on the right there are accessories that improve our abilities . At this point it is evident that the higher the rank of our Marine, the greater our skills and the weapons we will be able to use. So it is evident that our men are our greatest resource and we will have to try to bring them all home if we want to see our volume of fire increase. I didn't tell you that the death of one of our men will be replaced by a recruit, who obviously won't have the same characteristics as the lost man (or woman). But let's take a look at our handful of Marines. How to make a career quickly? Join the Mobile Infantry! Here they are!! As you can easily see, we can pilot a maximum of 27 men divided into 3 teams of 7 soldiers and three specialists. Each mission will give us the possibility to choose a certain number and we could only use those. On the left we see the selection from the briefings page, while on the right we can have a glimpse during the action. The most observant of you will have noticed how, in addition to viewing the men, it is possible to see the weapons they use. This is especially useful when using different weapons. Then you see that cross of the soldier of the 2nd squad? In some missions the Medic has references to the Medivac, in practice even if our man were to be fatally shot, we still have a chance to bring him home (but he won't buy points for rank advancement) thanks to a collection unit that he will be able to load our wounded man on board and remove him from the hell he is in. Darling pass me the DDT! But now let's talk a little about our fearsome adversaries: the Arachnids. We will find all those present in the film (the Hoppers are particularly fearsome, which are the flying Arachnids) as well as some never seen before. The AI is on good levels, also because it is not difficult to recreate the AI of a couple of quintals of insect whose sole purpose is our elimination. In any case, the behavior is extremely realistic and fully convincing and makes this aspect excellent contribute good animations. What stands at decidedly superb levels is the idea of an anthill which is rendered in a very convincing way. When we land, we find ourselves in a living, pulsating world. We see the Workers (the worker Arachnids and totally harmless) working hard up and down the fields or the Warriors patrolling the areas, or the incredible Plasma Bugs shooting their deadly broadsides into the sky. Interface and graphics The graphics engine sparkles for speed and performance. There is a remarkable care down to the smallest details such as the clouds of dust raised in the desert bottoms or the breath of men in missions carried out on icy surfaces or even the torches that emit an extremely choreographic beam of light. I must say that in the Beta in our possession there was the possibility of enabling T&L acceleration, which is not possible in the final game. Now we don't know if this is automatically set when a compatible hardware is detected (the version supplied to us lacked technical documentation). In any case, both 32bit and 16bit the speed is always very high and on my PC (Celly2 566@850 with Geforce2 MX and 128Mbyte of Ram) you can easily play at 1024x768. And if you want to find a flaw in it, I must tell you that the polygons that make up the characters are a bit small, even if the textures are excellent and therefore make up for this lack. In the press-releases we read that the landscape was deformable, well it's not really like that. There are walls that can explode or collapse, but they are strictly related to the execution of the mission, as well as the appearance of the Arachnid lairs. The interface is excellent and takes the best of titles like Homeworld and Ground Control and improves on them. A praise also goes to the path-finding system that reaches unmatched levels. Conclusions What to say? On the one hand we are faced with an exceptional technical realization with a scary plot and playability, on the other hand the absence of Multiplayer and a level editor leave a bad taste in the mouth. In any case, I really liked it, above all because it manages to perfectly recreate the atmospheres of the film and the book from which it was born. I remind you that the game will not be translated into our language. A throwback Let's make one thing clear right away: Starship Troopers: Terran Ascendancy) is a great game, indeed it's a small masterpiece, but it has features that may not appeal to everyone and which represent a real return to the past. Which ones are they? If I told you that Multiplayer and a level editor are completely missing, how would you take it? Bad? Well then this is not the game for you! Don't you give a damn? Then we are faced with a small cameo, a real gem in terms of playability and programming. Having made this necessary clarification, we can devote ourselves to the game that recalls in structure the revolutionary Myth The Fallen Lord or the more recent Ground Control but with significant variations and a first-rate technical realization.", "date": "2001-04-29", "grade": null}
