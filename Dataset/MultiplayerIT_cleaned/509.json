{"name": "Marine Park Empire - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/marine-park-empire-recensione.html", "text": "Create your own park Before tackling the pitfalls that MPE offers, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the game system through the 6 tutorials, which allow you to get used to all the features of the game quite effectively, from the basic ones to the advanced ones, offering the player a valid support to learn in a short time the fundamental characteristics to move forward successfully especially within the campaign mode, where the objectives set by the game must be achieved. Thanks to the aforementioned tutorials, the game interface is immediately familiar to the player, thus giving him the opportunity to pursue the game objectives without wasting time. Whether you are in a campaign or taking part in a free game, you must therefore roll up your sleeves to build your own park and, possibly, make it successful among visitors. The introduction of the various animals into the park does not just involve picking them up and placing them on the ground, but careful planning of the area where they are to be placed is required, both in terms of fencing (an elephant for example could easily knock down a simple fence) and as regards the ground, vegetation and accessories, all really numerous and diversified in such a way as to make visible the differences between the areas dedicated to different species. The animals, for their part, demonstrate whether or not they like what is placed inside their enclosure through various comics that allow our park manager alter ego to take the necessary measures in the event that any of them should be unhappy. But if on the one hand we must necessarily take care of the health and mood of the fauna that populates the park, we cannot fail to take care of the visitors as well, since in the end it is they who carry in our pockets the liquids necessary to carry on the barrack . It is therefore equally essential to pay attention to their nutritional needs through various food kiosks as well as to offer them a wide range of entertainment which, in the case of a particularly ambitious park, translates into train and boat stations but above all in VIP animals , i.e. those trained to hold shows in special structures which will also guarantee the sale of gadgets dedicated to them. To promote the park it is also possible to advertise through all the media channels available in modern society, choosing the budget to be allocated to each of them, even if to tell the truth this ~spot effect~ is not felt that much, leading the player to focus their economic resources more on the structural improvements available for their park. Another resource not to be underestimated is research, through which it is possible to obtain new animals but above all to cure the diseases that threaten the health of those already in our park, thus avoiding serious losses. despite Enlight's efforts, MPE's main flaw is mainly the lack of competition Create your own park Despite Enlight's efforts, MPE's main flaw translates above all into the lack of competition, given that there are several rankings and special prizes available, but this does not translate into the competition that would be necessary to offer that ~more~ to the game , consisting precisely of the bite offered by ruthless competition, which could have been introduced in both game modes, thus giving a significant benefit in terms of involvement. What has just been expressed therefore also affects the longevity of this game, given that once you have discovered all the available animals and have completed the park in the free game, you will inexorably end up losing interest, even if it must however be said that the players occasional players may appreciate the choice not to exasperate the game excessively unlike those who eat bread and management. Visiting the park Although the graphic quality is not excellent, especially as regards the number of polygons, the effort made by Enlight to reproduce an animal park in all its aspects is evident, even the least significant ones that can distinguish an area from another another: in fact we have different types of vegetation, soil, rocks and various objects that allow the complete differentiation of the enclosure of one animal species compared to another, as it should be. An effective terrain modeling system is also available which can provide an excellent tool to implement your project in a simple way. for how muchWhen it comes to human beings, however, we find a slightly less realistic representation that is very reminiscent of the so-called ~super deformed~. The sound also stands at good levels, offering a wide range of very realistic verses of all the animals and a speech in English that is quite understandable even by non-English-speaking people. However, the subtitles are available for everyone, with some small writing errors to tell the truth, while the game interface is completely translated into Italian. analyzing all aspects of MPE, we can say that the final product is quite good, but suffers from some shortcomings Final comment Analyzing all aspects of MPE, we can say that the final product is quite good, but suffers from some shortcomings that older players and various Tycoon enthusiasts will not like. First of all, we find a competition that on balance ~is there but isn't there~, taking away from the game the appeal it could have had by introducing instead a deep system of competition between parks, therefore more noticeable by the player: if there were state we would certainly be talking about a much higher level game. Secondly, despite the efforts of the development team, the two modes introduced do not offer an excessive possibility of replaying MPE a second time after the first, which all in all translates into a not excessively numerous number of hours of actual play . MPE is therefore advisable to the so-called occasional players and to those who intend to approach the management world without having to deal with ruthless competitors or exaggerated levels of simulation, focusing their attention on the beauty of the park that is being built and on the possibility of creating areas for very realistic animals. However, if you liked Zoo Empire, you will also like this new Enlight title, otherwise the advice is to try it a bit before buying it. Pros Quite nice graphically No particular stress ... Cons ... but calm down too flat. Nothing new in gameplay Managing is my job The trend opened several years ago by Theme Park has been able to count over time on countless titles, which have obtained fluctuating results, often presenting gaps in terms of originality and longevity due to games that are too repetitive and sometimes not very deep in gameplay. In this panorama, the idea of Enlight, with Zoo Empire first and Marine Park Empire (MPE for friends) now, presents itself as a potential breath of fresh air, placing the player in charge of a natural park, which with this new title finally has the opportunity to become complete thanks to the presence of aquatic animals. In MPE we therefore have the opportunity to use all the animals and structures of the first game, to which are added fauna and water constructions for a total of 28 species of marine animals, 60 types of animals in general and a set of over 450 between buildings and various objects. The game modes include scenarios in which the player must move, achieving pre-set objectives within the context in which he finds himself, for a total of 21 ~missions~, which make up the three campaigns divided into park of water, land and mixed. The alternative consists of the classic free game, in which to set the size of the area where you intend to build and the money available to launch into the creation of your own dream park, without any objective but only for the pure pleasure of admire your own work making it grow little by little.", "date": "2006-05-03", "grade": null}
