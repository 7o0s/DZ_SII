{"name": "RIDE 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ride-4-recensione.html", "text": "The review of RIDE 4 confronts us again with the approach adopted by Milestone for its flagship racer: a lot of thickness and respectable numbers applied to a traditional mold structure, to give life to an experience that, however, has not yet manages to stand out from an exquisitely technical point of view. If in fact last year we witnessed the appreciated introduction of the 60 fps performance mode, with this edition comes the long-awaited adjustable dynamic weather, but the visual quality that the game manages to express is still very far from the best exponents of the genre. Three years after the adoption of Unreal Engine 4 by the Italian team, it was reasonable to expect more. Structure Right from the main screen it becomes clear that the core of the RIDE 4 experience is the Career mode, once again reinvented by Milestone. The path in this case appears extremely full-bodied, and goes from the regional leagues (Europe, Asia, America) to the world league, finally passing through the final two leagues, Superbike and Endurance.Each single league presents first of all a series of tests which overcome to obtain the license, then four events divided into single races or mini championships and, in parallel, exhibitions that can contribute to the total calculation of the experience and credits earned. The latter must be used from time to time to purchase the motorcycles we will need to compete, as well as to upgrade them. It takes a few hours to understand exactly what the ideas behind RIDE's structure are, but then the situation becomes clear. In fact, the path designed by the developers of the Italian team appears wide-ranging, it is terribly full-bodied and becomes more interesting as we unlock new leagues, even if for the time attacks linked to obtaining the various licenses a fairly clear choice was made and questionable. We are obviously talking about challenges in which we are asked to complete a lap under a set time. The problem is that the slightest off-piste is enough for the attempt to fail, forcing us to try again until we have perfectly memorized all the peculiarities of the track: a terribly frustrating approach, even more so given that it is an obstacle that we find start of each league. In addition to the Career, it is possible to try single races by choosing bike and track, as well as modify the event options to set the number of laps and opponents (up to eleven), the position on the starting grid, the degree of skill of the other riders and the wear or tear of the tyres. There is also a multiplayer mode with dedicated servers which, however, will fill up with players only after launch. Finally, the editor is available, which allows you to customize the liveries of the bikes and the rider's clothing in various ways, to then save your own designs online and share them with the community. A database that will quickly be enriched with new elements, as well as events and content will be added to the package via DLC. Gameplay So let's come to the gameplay, which in no way revolutionizes the already solid system that we had appreciated in the previous episode, adding further nuances which, however, can only be fully appreciated with a little practice. Of course we are talking about tire wear, which significantly influences our driving style, especially in longer races, as well as changes to the physical model. There are also traditional settings and driving aids, which allow you to shape the experience according to your needs, perhaps starting with slow opponents (but watch out: they are never too slow, the degree of challenge has been increased on average), ideal trajectories in sight, Rewind button and even automatic brakes, to then quickly give up some of these assists and switch to more advanced physics without much effort. There are unprecedented reactions following collisions, with the bike starting to skid furiously when we suffer contact, and rather spectacular accidents, although there are some glitches in the ~jumps~ of the riders. The artificial intelligence gives its best at the highest difficulty levels, but already in the intermediate area it is possible to appreciate peculiar behaviors and even sensational errors of evaluation in place of perfectly coordinated sad little trains. Also in this case it takes a while, but at at a certain point you get to fully appreciate the gradual management of the analog inputs, the gentler braking as opposed to the sharp and insistent ones, the complexity of keeping the bike firmly on the ground in some situations and the fundamental contribution of the gearbox whenor you have to gnaw on those extra tenths on the lap that can make the difference. Reactions that are obviously exacerbated when the weather conditions change, with a greater or lesser frequency depending on our preferences. Thus we go from clear to cloudy to rainy, with the possibility of compressing the weather so that the situation varies even within a few laps, leaving the occurrence of certain scenarios to chance or deciding precisely when they will come into play. Finally, there is the novelty of Endurance races, which offer the opportunity to experience something different from the usual: the riders start on foot, climb up and kick off the competition, which at a certain point will require a pit stop. There we will be able to decide to change the tire compound and the quantity of fuel to take on, hoping that the advantage built up to that point will be sufficient to get back on track ahead of our rivals. Playstation 4 trophies RIDE 4 Trophies are mostly obtained by completing specific actions for the first time: obtaining the first driving licence, the first bike purchased, the first livery created with the editor, the first completed race. There is no shortage of achievements linked to individual victories in certain track categories, as well as the collection of all the cups available in the various Career leagues. Technical realization As anticipated at the beginning, in terms of technical realization RIDE 4 disappoints a bit. The game certainly has some good moments, especially in the rain, when the bikes are reflected in the puddles, but it is precisely in these situations that frame drops occur rather conspicuous installments, a sign that certain innovations have not been implemented adequately. The generally flat aspect of the scenarios on the one hand is the result of their actual features, which the developers have not rightly distorted in order to enrich them with elements of fantasy, but the yield final unfortunately appears very distant from the best racer in circulation. In full resolution mode, however, the 30 fps do not communicate fluidity, on the contrary they wobble, also influencing the enjoyment of the gameplay, and this makes the performance mode practically mandatory. A discreet but fairly predictable job has been done on the sound, without any extra aspect to the beyond the traditional selection of songs for the menus and well-differentiated roars of engines (also with a different rendering for each view) depending on the bike we find ourselves riding.", "date": "2020-10-05", "grade": "7.8"}
