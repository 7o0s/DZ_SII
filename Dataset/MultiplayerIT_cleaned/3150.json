For better or for worse, it was one of the most desired, discussed and controversial games in the history of this medium, regardless of what the original 1997 title meant for all those players who perhaps discovered JRPGs thanks to it. Ever since its announcement, Final Fantasy VII Remake has been its own enemy. How do you retell a story that almost everyone knows? The nostalgia factor works up to a certain point: if you decide to divide the work into several parts, the spell will sooner or later break even for the most diehard fans. Square Enix therefore had to find a solution to this dilemma, and it did it in the most honest way possible, reiterating in every interview that we would be faced with a new game, a Final Fantasy VII redesigned for a new generation. For our part, while the end credits were rolling at 5 in the morning, we found ourselves wondering, with a furrowed brow and an unsuspecting desire to carry on despite our tiredness and the impossibility of doing so, what will happen to those heroes we have met many years ago and that we have found again in dazzling form. Remake... or Rebuild? Twenty-three years ago, while the Squaresoft dream team was developing Final Fantasy VII for the first PlayStation, the success of Neon Genesis Evangelion was consummated in Japan, an anime that was also a turning point for the respective medium. Years later, the director of Evangelion, Hideaki Anno, would relaunch his masterpiece, telling it anew in a series of cinematic feature films that began on the same notes and then suddenly took a different path from the original, shocking and intriguing fans. Hideaki Anno called this new episodic work Rebuild of Evangelion. And perhaps even Tetsuya Nomura should have called this remake of Final Fantasy VII that, because we are faced with a very similar situation. Screenwriter Kazushige Nojima had warned us: something would have been different in the story that many already know, if only because twenty years have passed, the public has changed but above all the technology and methods have changed. The incipit is always the same: the eco-terrorists of the Avalanche recruit a super mercenary named Cloud Strife to attack the reactors of Midgar, a gigantic city that the Shinra Corporation has built by drawing on the vital energy of the planet. Reluctantly involved more than necessary, Cloud finds himself coming to terms with his past and with a much more disturbing and dangerous threat. The plot of Final Fantasy VII was already particularly innovative in its day, but today Nojima has put technology at the service of storytelling to better define every aspect of the story, telling it to an audience that asks many more questions than in the past. Thus the activities of the Avalanche, for example, take on more blurred outlines and it becomes more difficult to justify them: Nojima's writing focuses on the chiaroscuro of the characters thanks to more incisive and realistic dialogues, expressions and attitudes. Characters like Barret come out significantly more characterized, but Final Fantasy 7 Remake also allows more time for supporting actors such as Biggs, Wedge and Jessie, establishing even stronger and more experienced bonds in the cast. The cinematographic cut of the direction obviously has a merit of primary importance. Final Fantasy VII Remake abandons the restrictive confines of the original JRPG for a closer approach to the third-person adventures that defined this generation such as Uncharted, God of War, Tomb Raider. It's a setting that will make purists turn up their noses, we're sure of it, but which elevates the story to undeniable levels of involvement, thanks to a choice of rhythms, pauses and high-class shots. Difficult to describe in words what it means to relive some of the most iconic moments of Final Fantasy VII after having compensated for so long with pure and simple imagination, finally hearing certain dialogues or certain lines. In this regard, let us open a brief parenthesis on adaptation. Those who have played the demo will surely have noticed the discrepancy between the English dialogues and the Italian subtitles, a discrepancy that we can also confirm in the final release of the game. While it's possible to play with the Japanese voice acting set to Japanese, we played most of the time with English audio because we know the language and wanted to understand how far the two adaptations differed. The two linguistic registers are actually different, if only because Final Fantasy 7 Remake appeared to us in Englishor much more foul-mouthed and irreverent: some dialogues change radically, while maintaining the same sense, but it must be said that the English-language dubbing gives the game a Hollywood blockbuster brand, distancing itself from the more calm and moderate tones of the Italian adaptation and , suppose, of the Japanese script. It therefore remains a matter of pure and simple preference, although we have to admit that the English dub really convinced us thanks to its intensity. Something is changed On balance, in short, Final Fantasy 7 Remake is really a rethought Final Fantasy VII, same soul in a different body... or is there something more that Nomura and associates have kept silent from us so far, perhaps hiding it at the end of the game? We knew that this first episode would only tell the prologue set in the city of Midgar, and we wondered for years about two factors in particular: the duration of a remake that is based on the first five hours or so of Final Fantasy VII and the number of releases totals they should have covered. We finally have an answer to the first question. We finished Final Fantasy 7 Remake in about 40 hours of play, completing all the side missions and spending some time with the minigames and the arena. Once the adventure is over, an additional difficulty level is unlocked that allows you to freely replay the chapters to find each collectible, and you can also access new combat challenges in Hojo's laboratory. In short, the contents are there, and Square Enix has not forcibly expanded them as we feared: the progression, which goes hand in hand with the narrative, is organic, also because the player rarely has total freedom of exploration. Midgar is not an open world, of course, and you have to imagine Final Fantasy VII Remake as a set of consecutive scenarios, so much so that Nomura and company have divided it into eighteen chapters. Often it is not possible to retrace your steps, and you will have the opportunity to move from one sector of the city to another only towards the end of the game, practically in the vicinity of the inevitable point of no return. All of this is consistent with the writing and narrative, and the experience opens only at certain junctures, when the player is granted partial freedom to wander around, shop and undertake some side missions. These missions, which may initially seem quite trivial, have the undisputed merit of intertwining with each other, almost completing or unlocking each other: they better define the world in which we move and the minor characters we will have to deal with, and of course they reward us with consumables, accessories, materials and so on. If we exclude these momentary deviations, however, Final Fantasy VII Remake is an extremely linear title that continuously directs us from one goal to another. In general, the remake follows the sequence of events in the original, changing something here and there to give more space to the various characters or to introduce someone new. Obviously we have observed with great attention one of the most famous sequences of Final Fantasy VII: the scene in which Cloud disguises himself as a woman to infiltrate Don Corneo's lair. We knew it would be different, because replicating it today, in a realistic setting, would have been extremely difficult, and we were pleased with the overall result. The entire segment has changed a lot, but Nojima, Nomura and company have managed to keep the irreverent tone and erotic overtones without falling into vulgar sexism. We're pretty sure this choice will divide fans, but we appreciated the grandeur of the staging, decidedly Nomurian in direction and extravagance. However, it is in the final stages of the adventure that we begin to look at that Remake in the title with greater caution. We don't want to anticipate anything, except that in the coming weeks there will be a lot of talk about the future of this Square Enix operation, for better or for worse. Guaranteed. We suspected that Square Enix would be able to win new fans more easily, but also that it would be tough to satisfy the most die-hard fans of the original Final Fantasy VII, and perhaps that's why the creative team took some liberties, for so to speak, that will split the fandom in two. We, for our part, were positively impressed by the intentions of Tetsuya Nomura and Kazushige Nojima, a little less by the execution itself, but we are already unbuttoning ourselves too much. We'll come back to this issue when the time comes, however we tell you this: while we know Final Fantasy VII practically by heart, we can't wait to find out what the future of the Remake holds for us. And this, for us, was an important meritvery much. Technical compartment: the new look In truth, there isn't much to add on the technical sector of Final Fantasy VII Remake that hasn't already been abundantly reiterated after each trailer and, above all, after playing the demo available on PSN for a few weeks. In a word, Square Enix's latest effort is sumptuous, and justifies the two Blu-ray Discs or the almost 100 GB of downloads already with its painstaking, careful and detailed reconstruction of Midgar. We got acquainted with the city in the form of static screens and pre-rendered backgrounds in 1997; we find it completely in 3D, all new and at the same time familiar, with its sectors that represent the different strata of society, the terraced houses in the placid suburbs that contrast with the slums where we live day to day, the sparse patches of green that they remind us of the nature that was between a landfill and an electrical plant. Despite being a single city, Midgar is a microworld that reflects an enormous variety of scenarios and situations: for this reason, the long corridors and the almost total absence of interaction with the environment are forgiven, limited to opening doors or use of levers and switches. One cannot help but be amazed by the reconstruction of the Walled Market in Sector 6, now more similar to the real Tokyo Kabukicho, with its realistic maze of alleyways, the open kiosks, the lights reflecting on the puddles, separating the opulence of the mansion of the raw libido Don Corneo in the alley that leads to the Dolcemiele nightclub. Such sophistication helps to forgive the spots that dirty one of the most beautiful titles we've seen running on PlayStation 4, spots that exist and that don't go unnoticed, especially when the shots shoot them close-up: some very low resolution textures, images grainy bitmaps that form the background in certain passages, anonymous inhabitants that repeat themselves even within a few meters to save memory. It should be emphasized that we are talking about uncertainties that are easily forgotten, but which unfortunately are noticed: nobody gives a damn that the billboard outside a shop is very grainy and illegible, or that a doorknob is more angular than the cheekbones of a Angelina Jolie in Maleficent, but the gaze also falls on these details. Everything else, everything that really matters, is wonderful. The polygonal models are proportionate, realistic, highly detailed, divinely animated. Cloud, Tifa, Aerith and the others seem like actors who play the heroes many of us grew up with, at times indistinguishable from the CGI movies that, for the avoidance of doubt, exist, punctuate the most important moments of the narrative and reach levels absolutely stratospheric. A riot of graphic effects breaks out in the fights, without the game ever losing a frame, and the Square Enix artists have managed to realistically redesign some of the game's most bizarre enemies without betraying its goliardic and markedly videogame spirit. If in this respect, Final Fantasy VII Remake is a success, net of the aforementioned small reservations, on the musical side we are talking about a masterpiece without ifs and buts. Masashi Hamauzu has rearranged the famous music of maestro Nobuo Uematsu, and not only the ones we heard in the Midgar prologue, but many others that we can hear on jukeboxes scattered around the city and that we can collect in the form of records. An appetizer of Cosmo Canyon, Costa del Sol, Tango of Tears, Golden Saucer and so on, if you like, while the stellar rhythm of the new and already unforgettable Let the battle begins resounds in our ears. Hamauzu's soundtrack gives an extraordinary charge to the most important scenes, making some fights even more engaging. Playstation 4 trophies Final Fantasy 7 Remake trophies are 54 in total: 44 bronze, 7 silver, 2 gold and 1 platinum. Following the story you will automatically unlock some of them, while for others you will have to work much harder, for example by completing all of Chadley's requests or completing each side mission, fighting in the Walled Market arena or finding all the music discs. Fighting in the Remake Which finally brings us to the gameplay and how Final Fantasy VII Remake managed to entertain us for 40 hours, even if it sometimes made us curse loudly. This happened above all when fighting against flying enemies indoors, when the camera went crazy and, although we had locked onto the target, it forced us to move it manually to understand what was happening.
