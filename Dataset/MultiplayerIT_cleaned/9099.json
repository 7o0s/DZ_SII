In fact, in 2002 it came out on PlayStation 2 with a game called Ico, a platform adventure that made a huge impact on critics and, unfortunately, a little less on the public, receiving very high votes and also the coveted 10 on the pages of Alternative- Reality.com, one of the two pillars of Multiplayer.it that you see today. Not content with having hit the target on the first attempt, the shy Japanese developer (and of course his entire team!) gave us Shadow of the Colossus in 2006 and again on PlayStation 2, another small masterpiece but perhaps less unanimously than the original project. On the other hand, 2011 is the right year to re-propose these two jewels on PlayStation 3, in a revised and corrected version from a technical point of view, with the benefit of high definition and in an attempt to lay the ~cultural~ foundations for The Last Guardian , the next title from Ueda which is actually taking a little too long for our tastes. Since the two titles are treated separately within the Blu-Ray Disc in terms of menus and sets of trophies, we will do the same for this Collection, leaving an overall judgment to the comment at the bottom of the review. ico We are in an unspecified historical period, a boy with horns is transported by some inhabitants of his village inside a boundless castle to be sacrificed, boys like him are the tribute to be paid to maintain their safety from who knows what dark evil that hovers over these lands. However, for a fortuitous event, Ico manages to free himself from his imprisonment and shortly after meets a girl imprisoned in a cage, who gives off an almost ethereal light. Yorda is her name and she speaks an incomprehensible language for the boy, who after having freed her decides to take her with him to escape from that castle as huge as it is disturbing for what it hides within its walls. These events form the backdrop to a platform / adventure that focuses a lot on the atmosphere and game mechanics, precursors if we also want to titles like Uncharted as regards the use of the camera and the basis of the control system. The first thing that is missing in Ico is the interface, everything that happens on the screen is in fact clearly explained without the need for indicators. The interaction between Ico and Yorda plays a fundamental role and creates an alchemy between the player and the protagonists: it is possible to hold her hand with R1 or call her with the same key from a distance. Yorda otherwise has its own intelligence and behaves according to the context. Playstation 3 trophies In Iko there are sixteen trophies, of which nine are gold, four are silver and two are bronze. It starts from completing the adventure in less than four hours or two, going through the ~extended~ ending that can be obtained the second time around, discovering some secret weapons and so on, all things that can be obtained by completing the title at least on two occasions. Lots of atmosphere Obviously his athletic skills are inferior to Ico's and it is precisely here that the heart of the gameplay is hidden, exploring the castle there are several platforming and physics-based puzzle sections, more or less complicated. To help Yorda too, it is therefore necessary to create passages for her that she is able to face, reach out for her in small jumps, unblock any obstructed passages, also because she has a strange power that allows her to activate some doors that seem to be blocked with magic. Another danger is represented by the dark shadows that appear during the adventure with the aim of grabbing Yorda and swallowing her in some black holes on the ground, if you fail to save her in time or avoid her being captured, the result is the release of a strange force field that immediately petrifies the main protagonist. Ico can jump (with the triangle) and initially has a wooden stick in his possession with which to fight (square button) but also to solve some puzzles, as it can be used as a torch. We told you about atmosphere, there's a lot of it in the game and the camera is its queen, because during the platform sections it always gives beautiful glimpses, sometimes suggests the next platform to reach (hence the link with Uncharted) and in general it's really excellent in every situation of the game. The music is bare-bones, more often than not there are only ambient noises and rare dialogues (subtitled in Italian, the language of the characters is fictitious in any version), in Ico everything plays for eskip the identification and the fate that binds the two protagonists. All set in a gameplay calibrated to perfection, with an exceptional game design that shows all the inspiration of Fumito Ueda as it is well balanced between backtracking and ever-new puzzles, up to a sensationally beautiful ending in terms of music, direction crowning of all that symbiosis that was created during the adventure. The title is relatively short, we are talking about six to seven hours to complete it the first time, but this does not mean that it is so well packaged that it has earned all the praise it has received. The high definition facelift has brought to the PlayStation 3 version a more stable and higher frame rate, higher resolution for textures and some technical tweaks here and there. Obviously the impact is not very high but to compensate in part we have the artistic direction, the aforementioned camera and the size of the castle itself, which survives the inexorable passing of the years. The contents are identical to the original title and fortunately to the PAL version, which at the time enjoyed several extras compared to the American version, listed in the appropriate box. In any case, it is the gameplay that has aged really well, we completed Ico with great pleasure and without complaining too much about mechanics and atmospheres that maybe after nine years are no longer as fresh as they once were, the magic and atmosphere of the game leave truly an indelible mark after experiencing them firsthand. Once the game is completed you get a save thanks to which you can start over with some extras, which you will find in the options menu. First of all, the possibility of controlling Yorda with a second controller (but obviously limited by his physical characteristics and the view on the screen), selecting five unpublished background music and applying a ~granular~ film to the graphics in the style of period films. Yorda's dialogues will then be in English during the second adventure while there are secret rooms which, among other things, allow you to receive two new weapons for the main protagonist, the second of which is absolutely crazy! Shadow of the Colossus Fumito Ueda's second creature once again leverages the alchemy between two characters, the enormous atmosphere and gameplay where game design is a bright star that shines in the firmament of videogame productions. The release of PlayStation 2 in old age has allowed the Japanese developer to significantly enhance the technical sector, with even more beautiful glimpses, spectacular lights and particles for the period and a decidedly more present musical sector as a background and incredible for realization, among the most beautiful we've ever heard in a video game. There was one serious problem related to the original title, which affected some evaluations and which contributed to not getting the maximum rating on these pages: the frame rate. In fact, Shadow of the Colossus often had a fluidity well below thirty frames per second together with a graphic cleaning that was not exactly excellent, a real shame for how much beauty there was on the screen. This HD version made it possible to solve all these problems and, in addition to the higher resolution, we are faced with a title that still stands up for itself today in terms of impact and artistic level, a real pleasure for all fans of the original title who now they find in their hands what they would have wanted together with the first release of the title. Wastelands In Shadow of the Colossus the protagonist is a boy named Wander who, riding his inseparable Agro, reaches a forbidden land in an attempt to bring a mysterious girl back to life. Inside an imposing temple he meets Dormin, a supernatural entity (?) who claims that it is not due to mortals to be resurrected, even if with the sword in Wander's possession this thing might not be impossible: to succeed in his purpose, however, he will have to face , in sequence, sixteen giants who personify the sixteen statues inside the temple in which the protagonist has ventured. But what will be the price to pay? The giants are scattered across the vast lands that populate the game: on foot or riding Agro, you have to cross these impervious challenges, in the more classic dualism of David against Goliath. Some behemoths are extraordinarily large in height or size, while Wander is there, small and seemingly unable to prevail. The sword in his possession will lend a hand in finding them: raising it to the sky it will emit a beam of light that will indicate to the main protagonist the direction to follow to reach the next ~enemy~., as well as its weak points (after all, the myth of Achilles has taught us something). Between one colossus and the next there is a whole world to explore, right from the start, just waiting for the player. If in Ico the action was concentrated inside a castle, with labyrinthine environments that hinted at the vastness of the surrounding lands, in Shadow of The Colossus it is possible to explore them far and wide and at any time. Look out towards the sea, dive into a waterfall, cross the desert or face the rain, walk along a bridge that seems to have no end: it's up to you to decide what to do. This sense of smallness in the face of the world that surrounds Wander is rendered in an excellent way by the artistic component of the game, truly excellent: the reproduction of the environments and their characterization, the alternation of atmospheric events, help to identify the player, and to restore that sense of loneliness that we have already experienced in Ico. In particular, the creation of the Colossi is truly commendable: they are large in the true sense of the word and for their realization the development team studied various architectural structures, and tried to re-propose them in different versions in the form of these living creatures. Playstation 3 trophies Shadow of the Colossus instead offers thirty-one trophies, of which eighteen are bronze, six silver and six gold. They are obtained by completing the game on normal and hard modes, completing time trials, discovering the secret room, maximizing energy and stamina bar. And again, interacting in all ways with Agro, killing all the lizards scattered around the game map and collecting all the fruits. Good luck! Exploration The sound sector expands the game atmosphere with birds chirping, the sound of waterfalls, strong winds and sandstorms peeping over the horizon. The actual music arrives during the combat sequences, accompanying the different moments of the challenge with tones that change in intensity, but which are all united by an extraordinary realization (it is no coincidence that they were composed by Mr. Kow Otani, a well-known Japanese composer ). The gameplay is focused on exploration (actually at the discretion of the player) and the clash with the Colossi represents the focal part of the action. These fights combine action, puzzle and platform elements, as you must first understand how to find their weak points (by observing their behavior or the surrounding environment), then dedicate yourself to achieving them and finally inflicting mortal damage. At Wander's disposal there are two weapons, a bow with relative arrows and a sword, indispensable depending on the occasion. The way to deal with the Colossus and their weaknesses change with each encounter, and a tactic adopted for one will be completely ineffective for the next. Also in terms of conformation and characteristics they differ visibly, including flying Colossi that must be faced at a gallop. In Shadow of the Colossus there is in fact a strong connection between Wander and his horse, which develops throughout the adventure in an extremely fascinating way. The interaction between the two is delegated to the X key and Agro is equipped with an independent artificial intelligence: it is possible to recall it with the voice or with a whistle, jump on it and direct it in one direction instead of another by pulling the bridle, but these for example, he will refuse to run near a cliff or in front of insurmountable obstacles, finally sometimes it won't be necessary to call him back to see him run to our rescue, he will act on his own. Compared to Ico, the protagonist does not automatically cling to the ledges, but it is possible to do it with the jump key (triangle) in conjunction with R1, a practice also necessary to go up the Colossi and find their weak points. The right timing is therefore necessary to avoid falling and to reach the affected body part of these immense creatures. To complicate things, in addition to the canonical energy bar, another indicator relating to Wander's resistance is present; when it runs out completely (following a prolonged hold over time), the protagonist will no longer be able to hang and will inevitably fall to the ground. A real gem Dulcis in fundo it is possible to increase the energy and resistance bars, literally going on the hunt for small lizards scattered around the game map and by dropping some fruits present on part of the trees that populate the forbidden land. After Ico Ueda and his team have packaged another little videogame jewel, an experience that, in all its facets, rarely happens to try elsewhere.
