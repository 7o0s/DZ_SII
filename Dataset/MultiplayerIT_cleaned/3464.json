{"name": "Hot Lava", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hot-lava-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Hot Lava, the new title by Klei Entertainment, confronts us with a series of rather bizarre solutions from a narrative point of view, which mix suggestions and 90s cartoon atmospheres to finally present a parkour-style platform gameplay , which clearly recalls the mechanics of Mirror's Edge without boasting its refinement and dynamism in any way. The protagonists of the game are in fact a strange team of heroes for children, real action figures that we can select from a special shelf and control within six different environments, each characterized by the presence of increasingly complex paths. The idea starts from a childhood pastime, ~the floor is lava~, and transforms it into a series of challenges in which contact with the ground must be avoided, under penalty of game over. To succeed in the enterprise we will have to jump from one object to another, take advantage of rods and ropes, perform a bit of wall-running where possible and identify the necessary maneuvers from time to time to collect all the crystals and cross the finish line. The time taken to complete the challenge, the collection of collectibles, the fact of being able to do everything in a single attempt and other variables determine the quality of the performance, which consequently rewards us with one or more stars that are needed to unlock the subsequent paths, within the context of a decidedly well-tested progression, which potentially entertains for quite some time. Especially considering that the scenarios created by users on PC are also beginning to appear: should this take hold, we would be faced with a virtually inexhaustible source of new missions. Controls and gameplay Hot Lava is available both on PC via Steam and on Apple Arcade: the game is exactly the same, although on Apple devices it includes a touch control system which unfortunately does not appear in the least up to the promptness and precision necessary to play, especially in more complex levels The default configuration uses the accelerometer to adjust the view and the edges of the touch screen to move forward and backward, with a swipe right to jump, but this way it's already a lot to be able to take two steps, let alone complete a series of jump to the limit. The all-touch alternative works better, thanks to a virtual stick on the left side of the display and camera management with a touch on the right side, but the jump is made with a guilty delay and often the commands are activated involuntarily, making it even more frustrating falls into the lava. The use of a Bluetooth controller is therefore mandatory, which also places a clear limit on the portability of the experience. With a joypad for Xbox One, the game becomes very pleasant: the sticks are used for movement and view, and the back buttons for jumping and sliding, in a mix of maneuvers that takes very little to get going and produce excellent results. Of course, even with the physical controls the game over is around the corner and so the burning frustration of a stretch to be repeated again and again, which underlines once more how the touch controls implemented by Klei Entertainment are inadequate for this type of gameplay.Unfortunately you never manage to enter a flow of fluid and spectacular movements, as in the aforementioned Mirror's Edge: the approach in this case is slower and more reasoned, often cumbersome, and it's a shame because the starting idea it had some potential. A similar argument can be made for the online sector: several players find themselves sharing the same moments but without really interacting, and this too is a wasted opportunity. From a technical point of view, we note the clear stylistic evolution compared to the first builds, for a project that has matured over a long period in Early Access on Steam. The idea of the action figures and the 90s atmosphere, complete with a long cinematic introduction and interludes for each character, is captivating although a little out of place with respect to the experience itself. However, a good job has been done: the aesthetics of the game appear to be fairly recognizable and are accompanied by a good quality sound sector, with various dialogues spoken in English and subtitled in Italian, supported by a set of captivating music.", "date": "2019-10-02", "grade": "6.8"}
