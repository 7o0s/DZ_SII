{"name": "Il rimedio contro l'influenza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prototype-il-rimedio-contro-linfluenza.html", "text": "The sandbox is that type of feature typical of titles that provide a fairly large game map that can usually be explored immediately, in which it is possible to take part in various missions and perhaps tackle them without a pre-established order, for everything that does not concern the main plot. Prototype falls into this particular category and offers a reinterpretation of Manhattan, and a type of genre strongly oriented towards action, the exaggerated powers of the main protagonist and the extreme spectacularization of the fights. It is no coincidence that the title is developed by Radical Entertainment, the same as the Incredible Hulk and, both for the setting and for the films released to date, has aroused various interest and diatribes in the gaming community, in a period that offers two apparently similar exponents, between this one and obviously Infamous. Our comparison between the two ends here, also because Prototype is more oriented towards pure action, without really making any concessions to the rest. Manhattan has gone crazy! Alex Mercer, our alter ego, finds himself in a Manhattan quarantined by the usual federal government, due to the continuation of a virus that is rapidly infecting the population of the city, and of which, apparently, we do not know the origins and care. Prototype begins on the eighteenth day of the epidemic, with the main protagonist, clearly modified but not overwhelmed by the virus, possessing several highly destructive powers, and in the midst of total chaos. When the appetite grows, the game ~reverses~ to the first day of the infection, where Alex Mercer has recently realized that he is a real bioweapon and that his memory of past events has completely disappeared . Thus he finds us immersed in the game map, freely explorable right away, and among huge buildings that can be climbed without a fight, even ~ridden~ to quickly reach the summit. In fact, there is no platform component intended as a skill, the powers in Alex's possession also, almost immediately, allow him to climb any building, glide and more without paying too much attention to precision. To reveal the implications of the plot and to begin to regain his memory, Alex has the ability to literally absorb people, directly or stealthily. In both cases this ~practice~ allows you to recover part of the energy and acquire memories in the case of key characters, only in the second case it is also possible to also take the appearance and voice, in such a way as to infiltrate military bases rather than go unnoticed in the areas under control. During the continuation of the adventure there are also areas controlled by the hives, which act as the heart for the infected districts, and others controlled by military bases. When a despicable action is performed, such as absorbing a civilian rather than attacking an officer, the enemies enter a state of alert (symbolized by a bar at the bottom left) and attack Alex in force, calling support squads, tanks and helicopters. The alternative is to annihilate them before reinforcements are called, sow them or hide in such a way as to reset the above bar. Then when you want to walk undisturbed without being noticed, just disguise yourself as a soldier himself (after having absorbed it) or as a citizen, in such a way as to devote himself with less worries to game missions, except to run too closely into some infected hive. The game progression therefore sees main missions, to be tackled in sequence, and several dozen secondary ones, available as you progress through the game and complete those related to the plot. We also said that absorbing key characters allows you to discover new elements of the story, according to a dense branch of intrigue told with a sort of flashback, some very interesting to find out what really happened and to deepen the character of the secondary characters. There are 131 of the optional ones, and the various characters to be absorbed gradually appear on the game map, also present in the lower left of the screen. Dulcis in fundo, each killing in a state of alert and infected enemies, or a completion of missions, returns a fair amount of experience points, which can be spent to acquire and enhance the numerous powers available to Alex Mercer, who will gradually have with an arsenal of attacks that rivals any superhero in gaming history. Frequently Asked Questions Where is Prototype set and what is the main character's namecipal? Manhattan, you will take on the role of Alex Mercer Who is the developer? Radical Entertainment, the same as The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, Simpsons Hit & Run and Scarface: The World is Yours How long is the game? 12-16 hours, depending on the number of side quests completed What language is the dubbing in? English for audio, Italian for text and manual How many missions are there? 31 those of the main story, several dozen secondary ones How is the gameplay? Monothematic, we can say, Prototype makes this feature its strong point. Little space, as mentioned, to the platform phase in the strict sense, the map as a pretext for wandering here and there in search of missions without paying attention to exploration, full attention towards the real action, and towards increasingly spectacular and macroscopic dimensions. Radical Entertainment have in fact been very good at making the gameplay of the game well thought out, where the repetition of clashes (almost) never leads to frustration and where facing the hordes of opponents, gradually exploiting the powers that are acquired, is always rather fun. Alex Mercer also has some of the coolest powers ever seen in a video game, and his gliding and building-climbing abilities always come in handy at all times. Without forgetting the possibility of taking possession of the most disparate weapons and governing vehicles such as armored vehicles and helicopters, which certainly represent some of the most satisfying phases. To support this structure there is a rather interesting narration of events, which perhaps ends up being a bit banal in its ending, but is told in a convincing way. The secondary missions offer a fair variety, ranging from jumping from one building to another within a certain time limit, gliding to a precise point, eliminating the greatest number of enemies with the indicated weapon, destroying the hives or infiltrating the enemy base. Perhaps, however, they are too many, and as the adventure continues they begin to be quite repetitive. Either for the nature of the game, or for precise artistic choices, the artificial intelligence is quite basic, as is the level design reduced to the bare minimum, on the other hand, the numerous firefights that also take place between the military and the infected make a good scene, and some decidedly spectacular boss fights, which revive the final part of the game, after a slightly more subdued central one. We did not like, however, the distribution of part of the most lethal powers in the possession of Alex Mercer. In fact, there are some called destroyers, which are extremely lethal and visually spectacular, but which can only be used when the energy bar reaches a certain value close to the maximum allowed. The problem is that Prototype is a game where there is deliberately a lot of chaos and close quarters, so it becomes quite difficult to use them without being hit in the meantime, or having a good amount of energy for a sufficient period, given what is happening on the screen. In our safety comes the Adrenaline power, which allows them to be used in other conditions as well, but in general we feel this lack of balance which limits their use in an incisive way. Prototype offers 3 difficulty levels, with the highest available after beating the game. Once the title is completed, it is possible to continue to roam around Manhattan in order to finish side missions (called events), unlock trophies or complete the plot of intrigue. Personally we finished our adventure in 16 hours and 20 minutes, with about 90% of the side missions. Playstation 3 trophies Prototype provides 41 trophies, of which 9 Silver, 4 Gold and 7 secrets, linked to the performance of some plot missions. Finishing the game once, also completing most of the side missions, allows you to access only 30% of the trophies themselves, and to get the hard-earned platinum you have to complete it a second time on a higher difficulty level, mostly without losing a single life. The other trophies are related to side missions rather than repeating certain actions, such as infiltrating military bases. Technique The technical impact with Prototype, it must be said, is not the best. In fact, it is noted that the detail of the buildings and textures is rather low, even in terms of variety and artistic level. Fortunately, the situation improves a bit in the advanced stages and it is understandable how the programmers have preferred to keep the fluidity of the game always perfect and high in any situation, as also happenshe in the case of fights with dozens and dozens (and dozens) of people and vehicles. It is precisely in these situations that the best things are seen, it must also be said that the number of pedestrians rather than cars scattered around the game map is really high, which goes well with the type of game, messy beyond measure. Sure, the graphics engine could have offered the best in all its details, but that's another story... The dubbing has audio in English, which really didn't drive us crazy, and texts in Italian. The music does an honest job, underlining the action without intruding and proposing some interesting tunes.", "date": "2009-06-15", "grade": "8.0"}
