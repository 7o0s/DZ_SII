In the specific case of Arcana Heart 3: Love Max!!!!! (with five exclamation points, please) we are faced with the extended edition of a title released in Japanese arcades back in 2009 and ported to consoles two years later; a product that draws liberally from the tradition of two-dimensional fighting games, offering us a respectable roster, made up of no less than twenty-three elements, together with the possibility of mixing characters and ~avatars~ (the so-called ~Arcana~, in fact) to obtain different combat and further increase the variety of gameplay. Do you prefer fire, ice, metal or stone? Your choices will substantially affect the resources available during each encounter. The story of the game revolves around an organization that aims to destroy Japan by using the power of a series of mysterious crystals. To prevent this from happening, a group of fighters heads towards the epicenter of the crisis, even if some of them are motivated by different interests. Arcana Heart 3: Love Max!!!!! is a solid fighting game with a nice roster, but technically old Methods and peculiarities The story mode, which represents the main mode of Arcana Heart 3: Love Max!!!!!, unfolds through six stages that correspond to the days until the massacre, followed by a double final boss. During the first stages of the story it is possible to select your opponent from a rose that changes according to the background of our warrior, then face the fearsome Scharlachrot, a girl with very long red hair who can control various devices and make us pass a bad quarter of a now, following the example of many classics of the genre in which the final showdown presents a surge in the degree of difficulty. By the time we have defeated Scharlachrot, however, it won't be over yet: we will have to grapple with an alternative boss, in which the game mechanics are in some ways revolutionized, and destroy the energy sources of the enormous Ragnarok, the weapon of destruction mass that threatens the country. Precisely this epilogue seemed to us a bit of a fall in style compared to the solidity of the standard gameplay, given that you are asked to operate as in an action platformer, defending yourself from the attack of two drones and jumping on various platforms, while remaining anchored to the limits of a combat system designed for a one-on-one context. Beyond this blunder, however, we can only confirm the good ideas put in place by the developers, in particular the aforementioned correspondence between any of the characters on the roster and the Arcana, a sort of mystical avatar who draw on elemental powers to allow us to perform various devastating special moves. The result is precisely a greater variety, as well as the possibility of determining the repertoire of our favorite warrior, giving her skills that go hand in hand with the desired style. Playstation 3 trophies There are 56 Trophies in Arcana Heart 3: Love Max!!!!!, including Platinum, and to get them you need to actually get to master the game, its characters and the various maneuvers available. In addition to the achievements that are unlocked simply with the completion of the story mode, there are many others that involve the execution of particular finishers, access to online multiplayer and a thorough test of all the modes present. In short, to get all the Trophies it will take us quite a bit of time. Old style Arcana Heart 3: Love Max!!!!! it is confirmed to be very interesting from the point of view of the gameplay, traditional (it is still a question of performing combos and crescents) but solid, with a good rendering of the impacts and highly spectacular situations when using the specials. The roster is rich but very well differentiated, without clones or excessive similarities, indeed with some examples of great originality and imagination: the girl who fights on the shoulders of a sort of shape-shifting animated drawing, the samurai armed with a katana which recalls the dynamics of Samurai Shodown, the super-gifted martial arts expert, the girl who moves aboard a robot and then the inevitable winks at a fan service that can easily appear out of place. In short, the offer is attractive for fans of fighting games in ~old school~ meetings, even if it must be said that in terms of technical realization the gioco does not shine at all. Firstly there hasn't been an adaptation of the view for wide screen, which means that the graphics keep the old 4:3 ratio with two vertical bands on the sides, featuring artwork of the characters involved, for just to say something. Secondly, the sprites are low resolution, with traditional jaggies, and the quality of the animations often leaves something to be desired. Finally, the scenarios sometimes offer beautiful landscapes but are completely static, with no animated elements in the background. The artwork itself, irreproachable as regards the faces of the protagonists, did not seem equally mature in outlining their bodies, but here we enter the field of personal tastes. Certainly the offer fielded by Arcana Heart 3: Love Max!!!!! appears substantial for those who appreciate this type of product, enriched by secondary modes which however do not convince about their ability to actually increase the duration of the experience: beyond a few surprise clashes, the After Story is nothing but a long sequence of static dialogues, the survival classic has nothing new to say and the online multiplayer is difficult to test due to the lack of users.", "date": "2014-12-05", "grade": "7.0"}
