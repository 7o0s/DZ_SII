{"name": "Viking Rise", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viking-rise-recensione.html", "text": "IGG's approach to mobile games is now known: the team re-proposes well-tested formulas, optimizes them, adds a pinch of accessibility and attention on the monetization front, and decorates them through the insertion of characters clearly inspired by the protagonists of other famous series. There is little to discuss: numbers in hand, it is a strategy that works. And so, after the great success of Lords Mobile, the Singapore studio has seen fit to fill a gap in its catalog by exploring the world of Vikings and their reference myths, which many have come to know thanks to the Vikings television series and, in the videogame field, to Assassin's Creed Valhalla. The end result of these efforts has turned into a title that is making a splash in the rankings of the most downloaded games on the App Store and Google Play, and which was therefore difficult to ignore: we talk about it in the Viking Rise review. Structure: tradition with something extra Viking Rise, the opening lines of the city building The structure of Viking Rise is that of the most traditional of mobile strategy games, with its city building mechanisms, the long list of objectives to complete as you complete the chapters of the campaign, the characters and improvements to unlock, the buildings to build and upgrade, and of course the combat phases which are decided by the strength and number of units involved. There is really nothing revolutionary about what you will find yourself doing during your first hours with the game, but at the same time you will notice a certain attention towards monetization and paywalls, which clearly exist and are concrete, but at the same time they can be circumvented without even having to have who knows how much patience, given that the expectations for the completion of the tasks are never excessive. Similarly, in Viking Rise we will be able to recruit a large number of workers to collect resources around the map and proceed with the various constructions, without therefore encountering the limitations of many similar games, which precisely on this aspect tried to place fundamental microtransactions for be able to accelerate the progression and avoid that the experience is dotted with dead times. Finally, after a few hours, we will also be able to discover the inevitable territorial multiplayer component, another highly tested element of productions of this type but in our view substantially less interesting compared to the situations that develop within the map, as well as subject to a greater risk of pay-to-win implications. Gameplay: unoriginal but solid Viking Rise, troops in combat Viking Rise belongs to a very specific genre and does nothing to revolutionize its schemes, on the contrary it surgically re-proposes a very traditional and very unoriginal, but undoubtedly solid, gameplay. If you've tried mobile strategy games before you know exactly what to expect, but you can't help but appreciate the way this is presented, especially in the early stages of the campaign. that sense of satisfaction which in the end has always been the key to the success of these products on iOS and Android, but which at the same time appears extremely guided and limited where you want to try your hand at more complex and multifaceted mechanics, devoid of all these automatisms . Viking Rise, night harvests The interface gets a bit crowded after a few hours and it becomes more difficult to navigate the various menus and the huge amount of rewards and different currencies that you get as you complete the tasks, but the system always remains very responsive and this allows you to quickly recover orientation, carrying out the missions alternately depending on the timers and available resources. Even the presence of some somewhat cumbersome solutions, such as for example the obligation to return to the settlement to reform the group with the units that we have trained in the meantime, and without which we could never face the next battle, are compensated by a good speed of action: precautions that help streamline a formula that by now has nothing new to say. Technical realization Viking Rise and its characters... already seen Viking Rise boasts some notable sequences from a technical point of view, and in general the graphics of the game appear quite accurate and detailed, although they tend to repeat the assets after some time. There is a day / night cycle that shuffles the cards on the table, at least on a visual level, and the animations of the various units appear discreet, both in collection operations and whento fights. Of course, the presence of ~cloned~ characters from other series, such as Eivor's twin brother for example, cannot be seen as a merit for a production that from this point of view is extremely ~smart~, but the level is high compared to the genre of belonging and also the mix of music and dialogues (interpreted in English) proves to be solid.", "date": "2023-04-30", "grade": "7.0"}
