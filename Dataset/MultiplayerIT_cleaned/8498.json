However, it's still a novelty on the App Store, so the release of The Sandbox for iPhone, the latest production created by Pixowl for BulkyPix, was accompanied by a lot of healthy enthusiasm. The prerogatives of the game are quite simple: we are given the power of a god and a scenario, a sandbox, to be shaped as we see fit, within two different modes: a story mode consisting of thirty missions and a free mode in where we can indulge ourselves in creating our world, then sharing it with the community in a virtual showcase of great value, from which we can learn how to put certain elements together as well as vote for the best works with a view to a global leaderboard. To reward our desire to experiment, a large list of unlockable achievements will take care of it, each of which will give us an extra amount of mana, or the ~currency~ of a title which, we remember, is distributed in the now well-known freemium format. As far as the story mode is concerned, there is no real plot to guide our actions, but simply the indications of a divinity that allows us to ~replace~ it for as long as we wish, and that in each stage will ask us to create something new, starting with simple elements to finally arrive at complex structures and real ecosystems. Divine tools A few games are enough to realize that, in essence, the story mode included in The Sandbox is just a small tutorial to get us familiar with the philosophy behind this software, which is more like an editor than a proper video game said. In fact, the touch interface allows us to quickly access a large number of tools placed in a sort of upper bar: the first selects the element we wish to introduce into the environment, which is drawn from a very vast list, to be unlocked during of the main mode; the second defines the ~shape~ of our action, like a brush; the third is a simple eraser, which eliminates what we have ~drawn~; we therefore find a magnifying glass to go and make precision changes point by point; the ~undo~ command to undo the last operation; the pause key which, in fact, stops the passage of time and any transformations that this implies; the button to adjust the weather, in terms of day / night cycle, light intensity and temperature; the button with the world icon, which allows us to save our creation; the indicator of the amount of mana available; and finally, an icon useful for saving an image of the screen. The controls are simple, but it's the very nature of the product that requires a lot of experimentation to figure out how to create fire, water, sand, stone and so on by combining two or more elements. In short, the possibilities are extremely numerous and lovers of this kind of application will be dazzled by its potential. There's only one problem: it's almost impossible to play without paying, in the sense that unlocking new items involves consuming mana and this will inevitably end at one third of the story mode, forcing you to resort to an in-app purchase to get some more. The freemium productions on the App Store are now quite numerous, but they rarely ~force~ the user to dip into their wallet in order to continue the experience, while generally they pose a question of a temporal type, i.e. ~if you pay, you will complete this operation in a few seconds, otherwise you will have to wait a few hours~. Finally, a few words on the pixel art graphics: it's very nice for the illustrations and the interface, but in our opinion it does very little in what is the real action.", "date": "2012-06-13", "grade": "7.0"}
