{"name": "Freedom: First Resistance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/freedom-first-resistance.html", "text": "bad guys? No... Despicable! At this point I would like to make a small consideration that concerns the whole way of entertainment of the Stars and Stripes culture and in general of the Anglo-Saxon culture. In films, books and obviously also in games there is a clear and marked distinction between good and evil, almost as if one does not want to confuse the spectator/player, and indeed these differences are marked beyond belief. The villain is not only very bad but he is usually also ugly, he has no high positive, in short, the worst of the worst (or as they would say in Naples, 'Na crap). As we all know, real life offers us much more (if it were that easy!), there is not only black or white, but above all many shades of gray. In my opinion, this way of making screenplays, especially for our culture, makes the simulation experience not very real, in short, one does not identify very much with the character and the story. I would like to bring a striking example of how games change when things are approached differently, making them take on a totally different dimension: Final Fantasy VII. Anyone who has played SquareSoft's immense masterpiece knows very well what I mean. The plot is ~adult~ and incredibly articulated, but above all good and evil mix in an extremely complex and fascinating way. Not only is there the death of Aeris at the hands of Sephiroth (this episode alone is already incredible in the obvious world of videogames, in short, it's like killing the Princess of Mario Bros mid-game), but everything else, from the planet dying to the tangled vicissitudes of the characters is absolutely fascinating. Sephiroth himself is not only an executioner, but also a victim and is represented with a unique and disturbing beauty. Sorry for this dissertation, but it is clear that we are no longer satisfied with the usual soup made of bad Aliens or of freedom to be achieved, even if this is made by a successful writer. Or not? After all, are we talking only about video games? Let's go back to Freedom which is better... But how is the plot then? And the rest? I would not like to be misunderstood for what I have just said, on the other hand the plot of Freedom is very interesting and represents one of the most beautiful aspects of the game, only that it is articulated on a Background that smacks of Dej-V. I believe that gamers deserve something truly original and that quality video games are not only those where there are the latest 3D effects, but above all those that have a notably thick texture. I still haven't told you what kind of game Freedom is. If we really have to place it in a genre, I'd say it's a 3D Adventure/Arcade. We command our character thanks to the mouse and the keyboard and we see it from a third person view that is so fashionable today (Severance, Rune, Heavy Metal FAKK2, Oni and so on and so forth). The control method needs a certain period of adaptation especially for what concerns the use of the mouse. There is, as was more than reasonable to expect, an inventory and a map that shows us, in addition to the locations, also the information on the missions that we must complete. With the continuation of the game there will be the possibility of also commanding other characters, and of bringing them together in a team, even the AI behaves in a dignified manner, fully fulfilling the purpose. Like any good adventure, there is the possibility of choosing the answers in the dialogues and the whole course of the game will depend on these. The combat sections are interesting, but most of the time it's best not to engage in a fight and go unnoticed like black cats in the night. From a graphic point of view there are some considerations to make. It immediately catches the eye that the graphics engine is that of Rainbow Six, adapted to the occasion. The result? Well the game has good graphics for a 2 year old product, certainly not up to today's standards. I didn't like the locations too much either, but above all the textures needed more care. Conclusions Unfortunately, the game is entirely in English and this, together with a certain global difficulty, may keep some buyers away, but otherwise it will not fail to interest the entire large group of fans of games of this type, even if there are much more titles on the market. funny. In any case, hurry up before the Catteni have finally won! One beautiful morning... An extraordinary event happens, at least for the world of videogames: the earth is invaded by Aliens! Of course this is one of the most recurring events ever, even if one would wonder why the universe is teeming with civilizations whose sole purpose is to enslavezarci. In any case, the feat succeeds this time to the Catteni, who are the bad guys of the moment and who in no time at all enslave us, thanks to a fast but lethal attack to which we are unable to put up an appropriate resistance. We play Angel, one of the survivors, who now lives in a ruined city together with other humans, but who sees a resistance movement as the only way out for her and her people. These and others are the exploits narrated in a trilogy by a well-known science fiction writer called Anne McCaffrey's and from which this new Red Storm game takes its cue.", "date": "2001-09-24", "grade": null}
