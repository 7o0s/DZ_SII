{"name": "S.C.A.R.: Squadra Corse Alfa Romeo (PC)", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scar-squadra-corse-alfa-romeo-pc.html", "text": "The ~tiger effect~ allows you to go back for a few seconds Butterfly effect The possibility of rewinding time is ideal given the behavior of the AI during the most agitated phases. The opponents initially prove to be competitive, even going so far as to cut on the curbs to overtake you, but after the initial detachment, there will be one or two who will try to keep up with you. Every now and then the computer makes risky maneuvers or goes off the track causing sensational accidents. Certainly they are not monotonous behaviors, above all in function of the KO factor: when an opponent unloads the bar he starts to skid and gets overtaken beautifully. The problem is that the ~tiger effect~ key is used to correct your mistakes but most of the time it will be because you will hit your opponents inadvertently (if you hit one of them, prepare for the worst) or because of the various moments of loss of control of the half. By improving the experience, progress will be noticed but this penalizes realism. The cars differ quite a bit in terms of driveability (the Giulia is not like the GT) but unfortunately there aren't many. The most annoying thing is having to run the many initial races with the same cars, perhaps only with the most powerful engine capacity (and in dynasty mode you can't even choose the color!). In fact, cars and tracks must be earned slowly. 80 percent of the latter will be set on Italian roads, from Tuscany to Sicily, from Milan to Florence, passing through the usual circuits such as Laguna Seca and Hokeneim. All circuits are in short or long version, and do not shine for the number or for the non-existent climatic conditions. It runs only during the day: no evening, no rain. Milan, Florence, Salerno The game's graphics have been a source of careful consideration. Graphically, the game proves to be a little inferior to Racing Evoluzione by Milestone themselves, released more than a year ago on Xbox. On the good side there is the total absence of clipping, which allows you to see the very distant horizon; the realization of the cars stands at more than discrete levels but there are several inexplicable choices that bring the title rather behind compared to Gran Turismo 4. For example, the cars reflect the surrounding environment but strangely using the view from the hood you can only see this last in one color, giving us the nostalgia of the first flat textures (yet on Racing Evoluzione the bonnet was spectacular to see). The visible damage on the cars is limited to the cracked windshields and the two bumpers that are only partially detached; the lights that break then give way to a gray texture that simulates breakage. Evidently Alfa wanted it this way but at least some damage to the bodywork could be done (Project Gotham 2 docet). As per Milestone tradition, the graphics make use of a very varied color palette, giving very colorful but in some cases rather angular environments with the same textures. Example above all Milan, which boasts the same two shops on every street corner! If you then compare Florence with that of Project Gotham you will see abysmal differences... Far more serious is the absence of a rear-view mirror (you will use the uncomfortable front view to look back) and the difficulty of playing using the first external view (the one behind the car ) which is too low and does not allow you to observe the road well. No latest generation effects have been implemented, not even bump mapping on asphalt. This allows those with older computers to enjoy the game in maximum detail without problems. Smoke this exhaust! The audio part is also a victim of ups and downs: the noises of the cars do their job, with gear shifting and tire squeezing in the right place (and diversification for all cars), even the accidents are decent. The musical accompaniment is totally absent in the race (there are those who prefer it this way) but a virtual car radio was expected (remember Screamer?). The music of the menus and replays remain anonymous and forgettable. Travel with me Unfortunately the multiplayer only allows the excellent split-screen, ideal if you are with the usual friend who watches you play. It can be tackled in a classic race, in pursuit mode (in which you have to catch up and overtake your opponent) or in clean driving, where you don't have to damage the car. Although there is the ~online~ item, this one relies on the usual Gamespy only to download the ghost cars of other users, with whom it is not possible to compete. Let's hope for a patch that allows this. Comment While SCAR introduces a couple of rather unusual innovations in a driving game, it is also true that the innovations can be seen as a lack of realismor, after all, the movements of the cars are certainly not arcade. Milestone, which has always been used to offering games of a certain level, comes up with a subdued title, inferior to its previous one and to the competition. Technically, more could have been done. Recommended for Alfa Romeo fans (even if they won't have all the cars) and for those who want to experience something new. Hardcore gamers might not like the rpg system and time travel Pros: Innovative driver experience system A number of almost all Italian tracks 25 Alfa Romeo cars Cons: Graphics inferior to the competition Unrealistic innovations Some tracks and cars in there could be more Overalls, shoes, helmet... Proceeding in the game it is also possible to win objects that will improve the conditions of our virtual pilot. At the beginning we will receive junk from the worst brands, later, with the increase in experience and victories, we will receive more valuable prizes which will contribute greatly to making our alter-ego an almost infallible driver. S.C.A.R.: They're quite stiff rides Basically SCAR offers the classic modes of a driving game, but the main one, i.e. the ~Dynasty~, involves overcoming competitions, tournaments, timed special trials and in which particular skills are required (eg: follow the ideal track, keep a certain speed, etc.). All this offers a certain variety and also the longevity proves to be prolonged. An innovative feature for a simulator is the inclusion of an RPG-type points system, where, based on passing certain tests, it will be possible to improve the skills of one's virtual counterpart, increasing factors such as resistance, driveability, ability to accelerate etc. Very important is the one concerning intimidation, or rather the ability to ~scare~ the opponents. The drivers of the game have two visible bars placed above the cars, one for damage and one indicating the KO factor: when the latter reaches zero the driver tends to make mistakes and in the player's case, to see everything blurred and hear the beat of your heart. The introduction of the experience system is indeed innovative, but it could make purists turn up their noses who only want to run between settings and simulation fidelity from a driving game. Here we have a gradual increase in skill which is rather frustrating at the beginning: every now and then you lose control of the vehicle and have to resort to another innovation (already seen in Prince of Persia): time rewinding. The ~tiger effect~ allows you to go back for a few seconds and thus correct a sudden maneuver or an accident. Very helpful but totally unrealistic.", "date": "2005-06-09", "grade": null}
