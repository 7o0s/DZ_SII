Questionable statements, such as his belief that role-playing gamers were depressed people locked up in dark rooms and exclusively lovers of slow stories. But also rather audacious market advances: according to him, jRPGs would not have had a long life and would have gone towards extinction in a few years. Yamauchi, however, was an analyst; Iwata, the current president, is instead a player, and it shows. To the admiration of every audience, today's Nintendo stood up to champion the genre, welcoming and financing its developments and publications on three continents, on multiple platforms. His problem, unfortunately, has always been the timing of localization. Shin Megami Tensei IV was released in May 2013 in Japan and July 2013 in the USA; given the masterful media effort of Operation Rainfall - a petition from fans to bring the trio of Nintendo first and second party jRPGs to the USA on Wii - we Europeans are evidently lazier and less sanguine if we have kept silent in the face of the almost 18 months that Nintendo of Europe and Satoru Shibata have taken it upon themselves to bring the title to the Old Continent. Shin Megami Tensei IV has therefore been transformed into a sort of paradox: postponed several times, separated from the additional contents, distributed only digitally at  19.90, the all in English only. Moreover, in a period in which the communication channels are focused on many other mainstream titles and the retail sector is inevitably out of the game. Excluding the third episode for PlayStation 2, the main series has historically been the preserve of Nintendo consoles and for this reason alone, the title would have deserved a different timing and attention to elevate it from the niche. Patience, that's how it went; now let's open the gates of an oppressive demonic Tokyo together. Shin Megami Tensei 4 finally arrives in Europe: beautiful, deep, rich but so anchored in the past Kingdoms and cities The setting of the Shin Megami Tensei has always had a very mature dark edge; the numbered chapters, the Devil Summoners and the Digital Devil Saga are all exponents characterized by a certain crudeness of themes, color palettes, messages and designs. Only the Personas have been able to carve out their own colorful and more cartoonish school frame, but no less fascinating for this. It is with enthusiasm that we applaud Atlus for how it has remained in line with the historical quality of the plot, crafting a title capable of captivating from the first moment and releasing only after dozens of hours spent in its company. It is no coincidence that, after 22 years, Kazuma Kaneko, legendary writer, game designer and co-founder of Atlus, is once again holding the narrative helm, the same formidable author who has glued his fans to the screen throughout the entire world. arc of the venerable jRPG saga. The fantasy world that welcomes the protagonist and his three supporting characters is only one of the two sides of the coin: soon the team of heroes will find themselves involved in an all-out war between angels and demons located between Mikado, the realm of light and peace, and Tokyo, a metropolis deprived of its light and made a battlefield for monsters. Tradition still reigns supreme: to underline even more the dichotomy of the setting, the progress and navigation differ according to the place. Mikado, the kingdom above the sky, makes use of sections, images and static PNGs in which it will be enough to move the cursor over them to navigate or dialogue. Tokyo also provides polygonal characters and an isometric view macro-map in which to move the pawn, perfectly conveying the message of a place at war, where one must be constantly ready to fight the demons that infest it. Both areas provide sections in three dimensions in which the dungeons alternate, the structure of which incorporates the design style of the Digital Devil Saga, while completely eliminating the procedural component. Excluding the Demon Domains, story dungeons are pre-determined, static in geography and hostile fauna; structured to promote immediacy, they are ideal for carrying out the immense backtracking typical of every Shin Megami Tensei. It's a job for Samurai Shin Megami Tensei IV places the emphasis on missions very often, sometimes even too much. Burroughs, the trusty Artificial Intelligence that accompanies us in the mechanical glove of wonders (the same from which the Demons are summoned), also uses the term ~Quest~ in the narration of the main plot, a sign that the concept of mission is the one on which rests the whole structure of the title. Advancement, parallel stories, friends and enemies will compete to fill the list ofand quests with the most typical Japanese tradition offers: killing demons, collecting objects, discovering places and so on. It is an evergreen system that has continued to fascinate since the dawn of jRPGs despite a double-digit age, yet the feeling is that by now the whole system, so stoically linked to the past, is affected in the long term in terms of appeal. After the umpteenth extermination mission with incremental difficulty or the discovery of a certain set of items, the taste for discovery and the relative interest rely almost exclusively on that everlasting desire to see one's alter-egos become more powerful, leaving any narrative connotations. Atlus chooses to maintain the bond with the twenty-year personality of its brand, without risking the little that would have been needed to rejuvenate it and make it easier for new, potential buyers to digest. The design of the dungeons and maps is basic but studied for the objective already mentioned: basing the entire saga on returning dozens of times to the same territories, the size and richness of the labyrinths are balanced, easily assimilable factors, which therefore do not weigh down the player when, for the most disparate reasons, one chooses to tread its surface again. A minefield but well shaped by the Atlus experience, which still manages to maintain sufficient bite, difficulty and rewards despite the nostalgic and fan-oriented weight that the title carries on its shoulders. The 3D effect In Shin Megami Tensei IV, parallax is purely an aesthetic factor to amplify or not the depth of field of the artwork. Despite the exclusivity for Nintendo 3DS, the title does not offer particular ideas to justify raising the side lever; the advice is to completely disable the function so as not to burden your eyesight unnecessarily and increase battery life wisely. Demon Weaknesses The combat and demonic creation system is the closest to what the saga can offer. It's not a bad thing, but those who already know it might have appreciated some new features. The role of demon summoner makes the protagonist a narrative and only partly playful fulcrum: everything is based on creating, mixing and studying in depth the team of up to three demons that we will be able to deploy on the field together with our character, plus a supporting actor who randomly - based on quests - will give additional support. The first-person view of the battles combined with a fast dynamic lighten the flow of the battle, allowing - especially after having mastered the automatic melee hit setting typical of the Shin Megami - to enjoy a quick and never boring combat system. Each active demon guarantees an extra turn at the next round of commands, but be careful of the strategy: the world of Megami Tensei bases the war system on elemental weaknesses, so having more companions at your side is not always a good thing. The use of skills and spells has the purpose, in addition to inflicting damage, to stimulate the specific fragility in the enemy, which will thus guarantee us an extra turn. The same favorable treatment is reserved for critics, but since the argument goes for both sides, it is precisely here that depth and difficulty come hand in hand. There will not be rare occasions in which having even a single weak point in the team will inevitably lead to helpless witnessing of one's own extermination. Shin Megami Tensei IV is a difficult title, and in most cases objectively frustrating. A strong trial & error mixed with a sometimes completely unexpected string of critical enemies can lead to Game Over in an instant. Of course, you can always pay Charon to bring you back to the second before the fight, but given how rare the game currency is, saving often is perhaps the wisest solution to avoid bitter disappointments. Fu-sion The Atlus product provides an endless number of demons to merge together to create new ones, which will inherit part of their fathers' abilities; for this reason the roster will necessarily have to be constantly evolving, so as to best intercept and cross the elements of strength necessary for each situation. Never become attached to a friend because perhaps he will be the next one to be immolated for a just cause; dozens of potential demons drive up the number of hours to invest for the most determined fans to complete. The enemies faced can be brought to our side through multiple-choice dialogues, or used to find new quests; in addition, in conjunction with specific level-ups we will be able to choose to learn specific skills from demons, thus ensuring a good replayability value in the cobstruct or reshape your own style of play. A somewhat hardcore point is represented by the Apps, as expensive as they are fundamental skills of the protagonist, which bring considerable advantages but at a significant cost: each level guarantees 10 App points to spend, but most of the lines of increase require huge tributes, and Shin Megami Tensei IV is certainly not the game where experience rains in buckets. Fortunately, a preemptive attack element typical of Personas comes to the rescue: in navigating in three dimensions the character can exploit the right timing to attack enemies lurking in the dungeons, allowing the fight to start with initiative and some damage immediately distributed among the opponents. Time has passed Unfortunately yes, the 18 months after its release in Japan can all be seen. Artistically Atlus never disappoints, on the contrary it amazes with the very high quality of each artwork, environment, map and atmosphere. The problem is related to the polygonal mass and textures, really at the minimum that can be questioned. Perhaps a year ago we could have turned a blind eye to an already dated technical sector, but evaluating it today is really anachronistic, and there is no design choice that holds up. The internal environments are completely bare, characters and enemies have insufficient modeling, the external areas could have given much more in terms of transmitting the claustrophobia and the post-apocalyptic accent of the setting, however they do not help a convincing identification. On the sound the judgment is more lenient, but only in part: some very inspired music alternates with other anonymous, less convinced, more routine than not really fitting for the moment. The absence of Shoji Meguro weighs heavily, the highly appreciated composer of the most recent Atlus titles who contributed to giving a touch of freshness and originality to the Megami Tensei. The sound profile is just above average, which is disappointing for a saga that has also made audio a distinctive element and for which it would be right to have at least excellent expectations.", "date": "2014-11-11", "grade": "8.2"}
