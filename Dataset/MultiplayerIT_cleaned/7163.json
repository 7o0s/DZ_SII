A bit like Cavandoli's La Linea, sometimes even a silhouette or a barely sketched character is enough. Indeed, in some cases it is sufficient to limit oneself to a few simple colored shapes. With his cast of quadrilaterals, Thomas Was Alone was among the most apt examples of this type, but while Mike Bithell's red rectangle manages to go on in the adventure thanks to the help of some friends, David is and remains alone against a series of huge Goliaths. In the game by Texan Andrew Armstrong, the little square protagonist has to face fierce bosses armed only with a slingshot, in what the author describes as a personal blend of ideas stolen from Angry Birds, Shadow of the Colossus and Limbo. David is a personal blend of ideas taken from Angry Birds, Shadow of the Colossus and Limbo The square and the giant However bizarre or pretentious the combination may seem, David. takes from Fumito Ueda's triumph the ability to shift all attention to a huge, articulated enemy, capable of influencing the mood of an entire scenario and which requires an ever-changing strategy to be knocked out. We start from the first level, the one called Greed, in which you have to avoid the charge of a gigantic beast made up of many small triangles. You move, jump and attack until all the pieces that make up the boss's body have been destroyed. The idea behind it is more or less always the same, but the US developer has managed to give each challenge a different flavor. In the level called Brood, for example, you fight against an underwater entity, thus having to lure it into the open while at the same time seeking shelter on small floating islands. Flee is an anomalous stage, in which you have to go through a path full of obstacles, carefully avoiding edges and traps, and only at the end can you face a floating boss. One of the most difficult, however, is Anxt, a level in which you have to overcome a sort of maze while holding off huge square projectiles launched by an annoying enemy placed at a safe distance. What David. it is deliberately difficult as the author himself admitted, but to complicate each clash there is not (or at least there is not only) the devastating fury of the Goliaths, but above all a fairly controversial control scheme. Using virtual buttons you can move David left and right, while the jump button allows you to flutter around the arena if pressed continuously. The problem arises when it comes to attacking with the slingshot, since you have to drag a finger from the protagonist to the enemy, load and let go of the shot. boom! And immediately it's back to running and jumping. It must be said that slow-motion helps to aim calmly, but it is clear that in the most frenetic moments it becomes quite difficult to be able to have the whole situation under control, having to constantly switch from the jump button to the slingshot attack. And when it becomes necessary to do everything together, the hands begin to intertwine on the iPad screen like a crazy Twister for the fingers. The author gives the possibility to change the controls from the settings, but don't bother: in a game like this, having to tilt the device to move isn't an inaccurate solution. He's downright masochistic. Especially on the higher difficulty level, where you die with one blow, there are a few moments where David. it becomes quite frustrating, but on the other hand the satisfaction of having eliminated a tough enemy pays off the various attempts. Too bad that the levels available at the moment are only nine. Difficult, of course, but still few. In order for the player to have something to do even after finishing the main scenarios, Andrew Armstrong has added an Arena mode. It's a mix of RPG and survival, in which you face ever-increasing waves of opponents and use the points you earn to strengthen your edgy alter-ego. Maybe by increasing its health, giving it a shield or boosting its attack. If you put in the effort and manage to get enough points to spend, things get even more interesting, in fact being able to unlock a new and more devastating type of projectile, or the ability to teleport from one part of the scenario to another.", "date": "2014-04-25", "grade": "7.5"}
