The inevitable Season Pass also finds its place in the package, which guarantees a lot of extra rewards and faster growth, but which at the price of 9.99 euros finds itself out of the market compared to the aggressive approach of a subscription service like Apple Arcade, to date still unmatched for the relationship between cost and content. Speaking of content, the starting endowment of Shadowgun War Games is unfortunately not extraordinary in numerical terms: despite being very well characterized, the heroes that make up the roster are few, just as the modes are extremely limited, just two: deathmatch and capture the flag. It's true, we're talking about an open construction site (even the version of the game is 0.1), an experience that will inevitably grow from now to the next few months thanks to the release of characters, maps and stipulations; however, perhaps it would have been the case to push a little more on consistency in order to give more value to the launch of the game. Gameplay and structure Clearly inspired by productions such as Overwatch, with an emphasis on characters and their skills rather than fast-paced and realistic Call of Duty: Mobile-style action, Shadowgun War Games does not currently support Bluetooth controllers but boasts an almost perfect touch control system, which by default uses automatic fire to allow us to better manage movements and aim as we move within the scenario. As highlighted in the trial, with some heroes we tried to trade this immediacy in favor of damage and effectiveness, using a separate fire button which, however, is inevitably cumbersome and breaks the dynamism of the gameplay. On balance, however, this is probably the right limit compared to sniper shots or rockets that can kill with a single bullet. The roster, however small, boasts a certain personality and is very well characterized: there is the balanced character, Slade, with his assault rifle and grenades; or the unstoppable tank Revenant, armed with a shotgun and able to ~terrorize~ his opponents; or even the elusive acrobat Jet, who with his speed and teleportation is perfect in Capture the Flag. Then we have the gynoid SARA, a support unit that activates energy barriers but hits hard with a rocket launcher; and finally the sniper Willow, who places lethal precision shots. Unlocking all the heroes doesn't take long and there are no limitations dictated by the freemium model: this must certainly be recognized by the title of MADFINGER Games. The developers have done a great job in balancing the equipment and the two special abilities accessible from the bottom of the screen, thus creating fighters that are very pleasant to use, even more so considering the solidity of a gunplay that draws on the past experiences of the series. And then there's the graphics, really of console quality: you can set it to increase details and frame rate (in the case of our iPad Pro up to 90 fps), so as to scale the experience if you have an older generation device. and the show offered sometimes leaves you stunned, especially for the goodness of the design and for a use of colors perfectly similar to the atmosphere of the game. Matchmaking is also very good, very fast and only rarely afflicted by problems related to latency, although there are still some youth problem, with connection errors or the impossibility of changing nicknames due to some catch in the servers.", "date": "2020-02-14", "grade": "8.0"}
