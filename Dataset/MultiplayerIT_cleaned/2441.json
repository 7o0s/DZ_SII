{"name": "Conflict Zone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conflict-zone_a.html", "text": "The media? Oh no here too! The idea that underlies CZ is that public opinion has a decisive weight in the progress of the conflict. How? If you are the ~good guys~ and you ~accidentally~ raze a civilian village instead of evacuating it, then public opinion will be outraged and as a direct effect the high command will cut your funding, even providing you with less advanced units. In fact, in CZ there are no resources to obtain, but you will have a constant flow of credits that will be provided to you based on your degree of approval by public opinion. The tech tree itself is linked to your endorsement. The more people will love you, the more it will allow you to use ever more fearsome and effective tools in killing people. Clearly winning on the field will also increase your approval. As the Ghost, however, you can take it easier, and the only thing you'll need is to bring a cameraman unit with you (really!) to film your victories. If he films your defeats, your approval rating will go down. This is certainly an interesting concept but in my opinion it has a fundamental flaw: it is based too much on the alleged freedom of information. It is useless to deny how information can be manipulated, after all history has always been written by the winners. And therefore who among you does not agree in saying that in case of conflicts, what we learn about is without a shadow of a doubt what the ~higher levels~ want us to know? Striking cases (in reality) may be the famous question on the documentary of the effects of chemical weapons in the gulf never broadcast on television. Not to mention all that we don't know because the various ~men in black~ have been very good at covering up who knows what obscure events... If we lived in an idyllic world like that of CZ, where good people are supposed to be good, then... fortunately the whole game is imbued with a certain degree of irony which masks these observations. Too much politics, but the game? CZ presents itself as a rather ordinary 3D RTS, without offering anything really revolutionary that makes it stand out from the crowd. Indeed, there are instead some things that bring CZ several steps back from what the perfect RTS of today should have. For example, it is not possible to build your bases anywhere on the map, but only in some areas used for this purpose, which takes away much of the fun due to the tactical / strategic development from the game. Graphically, the engine is of decent quality, but it is not up to the level of competing titles (a random one: Emperor). The landscapes in which you will find yourself fighting are quite detailed: you will find civilians roaming the towns, or sheep grazing in the plains (or camels, depending on the setting). Perhaps more variety in the terrain would have benefited the overall look of the graphics - as it is, the terrain looks like a fairly uniform mass. Not that you're looking for who knows what in sandy or grassy expanses, but as you can see from the screenshots, the textures used only make the units stand out: they appear decidedly distinct from the ground. Due to this, the units, which are decently made as models, suffer from the typical ~slip~ effect, in fact they seem more to float in the battlefield than to move on it. Instead, I hope that the ~death sequence~ of the tanks is a bug: when they are about to explode, they turn over and begin to rotate on themselves, like a top before exploding... However, the setting given to the game is very arcadey, so there will certainly be no need for great tactical acumen. Conflicts are therefore often resolved by whoever has the largest group of best-matched units (point in favor of the game: with 10 tanks you will still go very far, but with 10 tanks and 4 ~bazooka men~ you will go even further clearly.. add 2 anti-aircraft tanks...). However, there are many negative points that you will have to live with in the game: for example there is no Fog of War at all, and enemies will appear out of nowhere when you least expect them. In the sense: there is not the typical halo of shadow that obscures the part of the map where it is not possible to know if there are units or not, but instead there is the radius in which your sensors will detect enemy units. If these are included in the detection area, they will appear (out of nowhere, because there is no graphical difference between areas with radar coverage and not). An innovative feature is the introduction of so-called ~commanders~, i.e. special units that can be assigned to automate asome parts of the game. You can, for example, leave the task of building the base to one of your commanders, or leave units under his command, so that he can try to organize sorties. Naturally each commander will have their own personality and the areas in which they perform best. Even if in the name of my dignity as a human being, I would never trust to let AI fight for me.. not even if it had Skynet as its name. Also CZ played as a base building simulator is not very fun. CZ's factions are uncharacterised, but are in the style of games from the Dune 2 era, where each faction had the same units, under different names, and with few ~signature~ units. Same thing for CZ (moreover the units in common have the same audio comments...), furthermore some units are too similar to Command & Conquer.. not that the ~Commando~ is an intellectual property, but that it works the same identical way both in C&C and in CZ... The missions in which the game will allow you to try vary from the usual annihilation of the enemy base to the evacuation of the civilian village. There are no Harkonnen bases to destroy, or Dark Templars to escort inside Xel'Naga times... Another criticism that can be leveled at CZ is that of not enthralling the player in the game's events. Unfortunately the conflicts are like saying, a little too generic and distant. In fact, at the same time as we write there are many wars that are being fought and yet the media, in fact, have desensitized us to the issue, given that it does not threaten us closely. It's bad to say, but if the programmers had instead inserted a UN building exploding in the intro, or the White House being destroyed by a satellite gun, or to stay on topic, the Eiffel Tower being torn down, they would have certainly aroused more interest. In conclusion... Conflict Zone isn't a bad game, but it suffers from flaws that any RTS wishing to compete in today's market should have overcome by now. For example, in these same days Emperor: Battle for Dune was released, which is also receiving conflicting opinions, but it is enough to put them side by side to notice how the experience of Westwood programmers (who after all invented the genre) has served to make their product more playable. Of course, in the end Emperor is the usual RTS, presented however with exceptional graphics (if nothing else), whose defect is that it becomes repetitive in the long run. In CZ instead there are some design choices (perhaps due to the inexperience of the programmers) which, in my opinion, hinder the player from having fun. Conflict Zone can also be considered a good game, but for it to be, you'll have to forget that titles like Starcraft or despite everything, Emperor, are out. Starting every time from scratch, pretending that no other RTS has ever come out, you will always arrive a few steps behind the titles that have instead learned from the mistakes of others and have improved what was already there, maintaining the winning characteristics of the previous titles. If MASA has not yet ~discovered~ how to implement the Fog of War or how to allow the player to build bases where, how and when he wants, it is not that the player is forced to resign and ~meet~ the programmers. But indeed, the best answer he can give is to turn to the competition... The French War You should know that this title was one of the triggers of a mega flame war on international newsgroups dedicated to strategic games. The announcement of the fact that SSI, known for having published many of the most famous PC wargames, had been bought by the French Ubisoft, sparked a real fight between Americans against Europeans to the tune of ~If it hadn't been for we, now you would all speak German!~, ~the USA is on the verge of collapse, Washington will end up like Rome and Moscow!~... The initial object of the criticisms was the ~honoured~ historical tradition of the warlike attitude of French troops, particularly in the period of the world wars... thus assuming a certain incapacity of the French to produce ~war games~... We are now faced with Conflict Zone, an apparently revolutionary and above all French RTS! Will the Yankees be right in their prejudices? We'll see! I was saying, this CZ introduces a truly innovative feature (at least on paper) and that is the ~media~ element placed as arbiter of conflict resolution. Of what conflict? In the near future (2011) the world will be aligned in two large blocks, the ICP ~International Corps for Peace~ (UN and NATO), and the ~GHOST~ a grouping of large megacorporations and independent countries. You will therefore be able to choose between two different campaigns: with the ~coupons~, the ICPs you will be called to appease a rebellion that arose in Chechnya , where General Karpov is trying to oust the ~tyrant~ Vladko from the chair of the president.With the Ghosts instead you will find yourself financing and directing Nigeria's attack against Niger, an African nation in whose borders there are numerous oil wells , which if they were to fall into the hands of an enemy power could destabilize the world economic order. A bit like if China invades Alaska.. or Kuwait. Or as if the United States invades Europe!", "date": "2001-07-19", "grade": null}
