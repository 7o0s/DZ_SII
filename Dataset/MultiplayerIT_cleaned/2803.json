After having already told you about it a few days ago, today is finally the time to give you our definitive judgment through the review, having also played it on Xbox Series X, as well as on PS5. The quality of the game itself is so obvious that it would be almost superfluous to tell you not to peek at the vote at the bottom, but we decided to keep the same vote only for a matter of consistency, although there is no doubt that this is, to all intents and purposes , the best version you can find on the market! They are stories of demons If you haven't played Devil May Cry V, before anything else, whip yourself. If, on the other hand, you are respectable people who have experienced the last chapter of the adventure of Dante, Nero, Trish and company in due time, then you already know what we are talking about. Five years after the events of the fourth chapter, Nero has finally managed to open his own agency, which he runs together with his girlfriend. The quiet is interrupted by a shady hooded figure who one day shows up at the agency and rips off Nero's arm, disappearing immediately after having opened a passage, probably towards the underworld. Nero then heads to Redgrave to find out more about what is happening. The city is dear to the legendary demon hunter Dante and here the latter is in search of the truth together with V, who hired him. On these premises, a campaign of about twenty missions opens, all of different duration and entities and during which we will be able to play with all three protagonists. There where Dante and Nero, with their iconic swords and firearms are both already known to the general public, the new entry V has managed to be appreciated more than expected. The sickly and pale caster, accompanied by his three companion demons, represented a major turning point in both the narrative and the gameplay of the fifth chapter of Devil May Cry. It goes without saying that if you are expecting a thrilling story full of twists and turns, perhaps you have the wrong series but also the wrong genre. This does not mean that the exaggerated look, the tamarraggine and an important technical and sound level are important details for the general enjoyment. Vergil Let's go back to the core of this Special Edition, as well as to the only element that will be added as paid DLC even for those who own only the stardand version: Vergil. Dante's brother is forcefully inserted into the gameplay, effectively becoming the most playable character in the entire title. In spite of the other three, in fact, Vergil can be selected for the entire duration of the campaign, as well as for the Bloody Palace and for the Void. As we had already mentioned, his inclusion in the narrative does not change anything substantially, even leading the game to skip a large part of the cutscene if they do not see him as the protagonist. To be completely honest and precise, there are some differences, but we don't want to and we can't spoil the surprise for you, so we'll leave you the pleasure of discovering them. Always keeping in mind that, barring strange revolutions, these are non-canonical events, we imagine inserted to avoid making too many spoilers for those who want to start directly with Vergil. Virgil and the blows Moving on to the actual gameplay, Vergil is undoubtedly the strongest and most dynamic character among all. Immediately equipped with all three of his iconic weapons, he has the ability to teleport in an instant towards the grappled enemy or run away in a hurry when the situation is not the best. The mixture between the two swords and the beowulf, if well amalgamated with each other, they are capable of creating crazy combos, so as to dramatically raise the style level counter, so dear to those who play Devil May Cry. If these elements weren't enough, a sort of summoning of a doppelganger takes care of it which multiplies the firepower to give further strength to a very well characterized character. The last of the features is then the Sin Devil Trigger, through which Vergil unleashes his nature and leaves behind a trail of slain demons. Unfortunately, all that glitters is not gold, and we cannot fail to highlight a couple of elements that are not exactly extraordinary. Vergil is splendid, fluid and damned fun to use, but at the same time it is very clear that it is very far from a sensible balance, both for its intrinsic strength and for the skills that can be purchased, and on the contrary for the forced insertion in non-missions togive to him. Let's try to explain ourselves better: all the implementations of this Special Edition seem to point strongly to spectacularization, which is the trademark of the series. Devil May Cry is not Ninja Gaiden and we know this perfectly. The idea of Stylish Action was born from here and it is clear that it would be stupid to expect otherwise. This does not mean that the degree of challenge is significantly reduced to Vergil's control, then colliding, on the contrary, with some sections designed specifically for V which, quite obviously, do not go well with Vergil's characteristics. This problem is mainly encountered with the bosses, sometimes really annoying and frustrating, but without ever really compromising the whole experience. Turbo Mode and Dark Night Mode A brief mention of the new methods that we also had the opportunity to discuss in the previous trial. As already mentioned, this Special Edition really smells like a show and these additions are just the emblem of the work done by Capcom. We have not hidden that it almost seems to be faced with two official mods, created solely and exclusively to highlight the power of the technological leap of this new generation. In short, the Turbo Mode does nothing but increase the game speed by 120%, making everything even more frenetic and obviously shortening the completion times. In fact, it would not surprise us to see that it will become the reference for speedrunners. The Dark Night mode, on the other hand, is, in our opinion, the least successful and balanced, capable only of showing the bones of the hardware and which does nothing but put us in front of dozens and dozens of enemies, exponentially multiplying the initially foreseen amount . This element has two very simple consequential aspects: on the one hand, the possibility of farming red spheres and style points as if there were no tomorrow; on the other, the characteristic of making what happens on the screen incomprehensible and ruining any ounce of known balance. It is still an extra feature and for this reason we don't feel like penalizing it more than expected, but it certainly could have been done much better. The technical leap Let's talk about the technical jump. As we anticipated a few days ago, although Devil May Cry V Special Edition should arrive on the market with a native 4K mode, this did not seem possible on PlayStation 5. A series of investigations has allowed us to discover the cause, unrelated to the game itself and related to the firmware of the console still to be updated. For this reason we have put the judgment on this aspect on hold, however also moving to the Xbox Series X, so as to better test this version as well. Net of these problems, what we can tell you is that Devil May Cry V allows, through a management that is not exactly very clear for the user, to start the game following a series of settings that give light to different scenarios from a technical point of view . The fundamental variables are ray tracing and frame rate, as well as the game modes chosen. Once ray tracing is activated (which could certainly be used better anyway) the game can run at native 4K and 30fps or otherwise, choosing the performance at 1080p and 60fps. Likewise, by deactivating ray tracing, we are faced with a 4K at 60fps. As a last option it is also possible to choose a variable resolution which, starting from 1080p, can bring the game up to 120fps. It should be noted that this last option never really generates such a high number of frames, which is unlikely they reach the hundred on both consoles. Net of some very slight differences and a general better response in favor of Xbox Series X, the two versions are substantially identical, and our advice is to play without ray tracing and at 60fps, undoubtedly the best compromise. As we said, the two new modes also affect the technical aspect: in fact, by activating Turbo Mode or Dark Night Mode, ray tracing will still be automatically deactivated.", "date": "2020-11-11", "grade": "9.0"}
