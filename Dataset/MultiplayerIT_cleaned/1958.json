Although in fact the game mechanics are practically the same seen in the classic Subway Surfers, with a rhythmic and at first not too frenetic, as well as a clear division of the lanes unlike another extraordinary exponent of the genre, Temple Run, the title developed by King presents levels with a beginning and an end, and more. Structure Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! allows you to choose different skins for the character. The rich campaign of Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! starts from the usual narrative assumption: Doctor Cortex is trying to conquer the world with the help of his minions and a sophisticated technology linked to portals. Against the backdrop of the splendid landscapes of a tropical archipelago, our goal will clearly be to stop these threats... by chasing them. production of objects, a marked backtracking (if we want to define it that way) for the collection of the necessary resources and a large hub with sections that can be unlocked as the adventure progresses. Crash Bandicoot: On the Run!, here are the three lanes and some of the obstacles to avoid. After the first few hours, the formula developed by the developers becomes very clear and reveals itself, in its own way, honest: by purchasing packs of gems we will be able to speed up the operations needed to be able to continue challenging Cortex's lieutenants, otherwise we will have to wait for a some time and maybe deceive him by trying his hand at the aforementioned resource collection or some alternative method. Among these, the multiplayer-based survival competitions stand out, for the moment little frequented (we have often happened to face simple bots) but certainly endowed with great potential, given that they are group races in which the one who succeeds wins to go further.

The goal, moreover, is not to establish a distance record on the dry attempt, as happened in the aforementioned Subway Surfers and Temple Run, but to reach the end of the course and face a real boss fight, albeit simplified in the dynamics: the opponent will throw his attacks at us and we will have to avoid them until we reach him, or return fire by collecting objects on the street. Crash Bandicoot: On the Run!, the schematic of one of the campaign bosses, in this case an evil clone of Crash. The touch controls are extremely simple and intuitive: by swiping left or right we will be able to make Crash change lanes, jump with an upward swipe and slide with a downward swipe, while touching the screen will allow us to perform the traditional rotation of the character, essential for destroying the inevitable crates and eliminating any enemies. The level design opens up to fairly varied situations thanks to the presence of switches, alternative passages, raised platforms, dungeons and more. Inevitably though, grappling with harvest runs again and again feels pretty repetitive. Furthermore, the cadenced rhythm can actually make the experience a bit banal and quite distant from the frenzy typical of the genre, however the daughter of different assumptions. Technical realization There is no doubt that Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! both a great sight, thanks to a technical realization that gives its best on the latest generation terminals, offering an extremely fluid and consistent frame rate.
