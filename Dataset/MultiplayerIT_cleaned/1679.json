{"name": "Tennis Master Series 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tennis-master-series-2006.html", "text": "One shot, one point Even the tennis players themselves are more than decently made although perhaps they all look a bit too much alike, except in some cases. Without infamy and without praise instead the sound. Not that you can invent much in a tennis game but it seems to me that the general quality is not excellent, despite doing its job without major problems. The customization personalities in the title are enough and mostly concern the tennis player in various aspects. We will be able to choose his physical appearance, clothing (shirt and shorts), the racket to use and above all spend 100 points of additional characteristics in the 8 'specialties' ranging from backhand and forehand to volley passing through power. Alternatively you can also choose one of the 3 pre-set profiles, i.e. Attacker, Baseline or Net. It is easy to understand that a tennis player set up to play on the Net will have a very high value such as Vole and not excessive power, vice versa a high-ball Attacker will be poor both in Vole and in speed that will be very powerful and capable of sending missiles both forehand and reverse. There are 10 tournaments and they practically concern all those of the SuperNine, the circuit of nine tournaments of great importance that tries, however without much luck, to compete with the 4 immortal Grand Slam tournaments, namely Roland Garros, Wimbledon, Flushing Meadows (open USA) and Australian Open. Let's move on to gameplay. Given what has been served up to us in recent years, I would say that here too we have made some decisive steps forward. The pace (the Americans call it 'pace') of the match is quite reminiscent of a tennis match, though perhaps slowed down too much at times. Also from the point of view of the animations we are on excellent levels. Our heroes in shorts move in a sufficiently realistic and calibrated way and only in the case of the smash does the tennis player assume awkward and unnatural positions. Unfortunately, the historical defects of titles of this genre also remain. First of all, the AI of the opponents, even if discreet overall, suffers from the Perfection syndrome, which allows him to miss 2-3 shots per game (against the net perhaps a few more). But the sad thing is that it happens to our tennis player too; seeing is believing, throwing the ball OUT will be really difficult. It seems much easier to put it at the intersection of the lines than outside. Too bad because it's a flaw that ruins the fun of the game a bit which, with a little more effort, could have turned out to be much greater. Also sometimes it will be hard to see the difference between some shots, but that's more of a personal impression. Also present is the replay which intervenes automatically whenever an important and / spectacular exchange occurs and a rather classic multiplayer mode. In the pre-match, while the players warm up by exchanging a few shots, the summary of the statistics of the 2 players will appear. Atp placement, victories against the opponent, victories in the current tournament and so on. It should also be added that, at least as regards the version we tested, there were a few too many crashes and some slowdowns in the case of Doubles (therefore with 4 tennis players on the court). Final Notes However, apart from some structural defects, this Tennis Master Series rises decidedly above the average. Fun is ensured by a discreet trinomial: graphics-longevity-playability. It could have been done better, this is not the definitive tennis simulation, but we are certainly dealing with a good product. TMS2003 could keep you busy in front of the monitor for a few weeks, especially if you are passionate about Tennis and disappointed by the other games on the market, even if those who have little confidence and passion about this sport would do better to wait longer. Pros: - Very accurate and high-impact graphics - Above average playability and longevity - Career mode Cons: - Badly calibrated game difficulty - AI opponents not always convincing Tennis tries again on PC Reviewing a tennis title inevitably leads to always talking about the same things. Mainly of how much the PC market (and if we want videogames in general) does not offer any masterpiece and how much the productions of the last few years have always fallen back on the same mistakes, almost never managing to offer a playability up to this sport. Microids takes the field with this Tennis Master Series 2003 which, without too many preambles, definitely aims to create something new in the tennis horizon for PCs. In reality, TMS2003 does not actually present itself with particularly innovative cards. As already seen too muchor often the game modes are limited to the classic Career, in which you play the role of a tennis player over the years, a single season or friendly competitions. Even the choice not to use the names of famous tennis players does not seem particularly apt, even if given last year's Agassi Generation Tennis perhaps this is not so relevant. In any case, the game offers you 67 tennis players to choose from and there is really no lack of variety and the possibility to indulge yourself. Why exactly 67? Soon said. For each tournament you play there will be 4 tennis players (if it's your turn you'll have to face 2 qualifying rounds) who will have to fight to enter the main draw and the other 63 waiting, already qualified. But let's get to the heart of the game; after noting that in terms of the options there isn't much to configure (if we make the exception of 7-8 different types of rather convincing cameras) we see that this title definitely gives its best under the aspect of the graphic system. The facilities (stadiums) are all splendid, both in the technical construction and in the number and quality of the details. The audience finally seems to be convincing in a tennis game and, although the feeling of 'impersonality' remains, it really seems to be surrounded by people and not by a wall of colored pixels. The fields themselves are splendid for texture and chrome, whether we are talking about clay or grass, concrete or synthetic. Sometimes, if you want to be picky, some effects such as deterioration of the ground or imprints of the ball leave a bitter taste in the mouth but in general you really can't complain. Furthermore, the wheel that manages the shadows seems to me to work more than discreetly.", "date": "2003-04-16", "grade": null}
