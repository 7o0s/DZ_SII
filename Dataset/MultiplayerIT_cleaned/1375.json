From the first steps through the LoA menu, we can see that few things have changed. The only additional possibility is the choice of the campaign to start; the classic one of Dungeon Siege or the one that allows us to explore the new island continent of Aranna. The kingdom of Aranna is very ancient and there are many legends told by sages and bards. Heroes long forgotten, they lived epic moments in wild and dangerous regions. Our parents were heroes and during our first steps as adventurers, we will discover that their fate and their exploits were linked to an island off the coast of Arhok, our city. The island of Utrae is shrouded in mystery and offers new possibilities for fame and riches. Our first missions approach the island and are set in a region very similar to the one explored in the first Dungeon Siege. Here we will be able to increase our experience and team up with other adventurers who will accompany us on the island. Our character will gain experience in the same way that Dungeon Siege used to us some time ago. The more we use a weapon, or a spell, the more we will be able to use them. Fighting with a sword or mace will make you increasingly skilled at melee combat, while using a bow will make you increasingly skilled at ranged attacks. This allows you to create a very varied character capable of doing a little bit of everything. The same thing we can do with our companions. We will begin our adventures with weapons and scrolls that are different from those of the previous adventure and from the very first explorations, we will be able to come across one of the novelties of this game, the backpack. This object, to be included in our equipment, provides an additional space in the inventory. Basically a kind of mini-donkey from the original game. As I have already said, a series of missions will lead us to this mysterious island, apparently in search of a sacred object for the city of Arhok. Following in the footsteps left by the thief of this object, we will begin to explore different territories from those we are used to, in fact, from the snow-capped mountains of Arhok, we will pass to a golden beach to a dense and tangled jungle. There will be closed environments such as dungeons or fortresses. Above all, there will be new exotic creatures both friends and enemies. A gigantic man with dark skin and strange tattoos on his face will be one of our allies to survive the pitfalls of the jungle of Utrae. This island will not be inhabited only by wild animals but we will soon make the acquaintance of humanoid races of which only legends speak. The Zaurasks, Drocs and Hassans are humanoid creatures with animalistic traits and will hinder us in our quest. An engine that creaks All these novelties of territories and creatures are always moved by the same Dungeon Siege graphics engine which is beginning to be affected by age. Although the game was released just over a year ago, some features of the graphic aspect are now grainier and less defined than usual. The external environments are well made, but as the view approaches, the defects begin to be seen. The close-up detail isn't as neat as it might seem. Especially the characters could be more characterized. As in the original game, the clothes and armor will be visible, but lack variety and all characters have only one static expression. We've gotten used to something else lately. The graphics engine performs best in closed environments, where the detail increases considerably by depicting cobwebs and dust and many other objects surrounding the environments. The exteriors are still well depicted, but as previously mentioned, with a greater Zoom, a certain graininess of the textures is noticed. Despite these defects DSLOA has a remarkable atmosphere supported by both graphics and excellent sound. In the external and internal locations there are real and effective sounds (an example are the voices in the dungeons ... definitely atmospheric). A lot of play and little role As in the original product, also in this expansion the ~Role~ aspect is left aside for faster fights and action situations. As I wrote earlier, the handling of our hero and his experience has not changed. The inventory has been modified and formations have been added for the group, formations that our companions follow quite intelligently (although a couple of times I found myself having the whole group concentrated in the space of a few cm).An expansion or an appendage? In the introduction of the review, it was stated that there were two types of expansions, and after playing DSLOA and rereading what has been written so far, we are able to name the two types. The expansion that modifies little of the original game and does not bring substantial changes can be defined as an ~Appendix~. This is in fact Legend of Aranna; an appendix to Dungeon Siege which is found to offer us the strengths and weaknesses of a certainly high-level product but which at the moment is no longer able to excite. The worst flaw is the fact of being able to advance in the game, simply by repeatedly clicking with the left mouse button on a point of the screen and receiving fewer wounds than one might expect. This aspect allows us to understand how little space has been given to role-playing. In essence, this product adds little to the original Dungeon Siege, on the contrary, in the version proposed in Italy it deprives us of the complete translation of the original game, forcing us to spend 50 euros for a game in English with an expansion that does not make us cry out for a miracle. I also want to point out that it is possible to find Dungeon Siege in an Italian and economic version for less than 20 euros. This greatly influences a negative judgment of the product. PROS Graphics and sound that create a good game atmosphere despite small defects deriving from the age of the graphics engine. Good equipment and group management. CONS The distributed version penalizes the owners of the original game. For the more experienced role players it is not a demanding product. The expansions of a game are always a complex product to analyze. It is necessary to distinguish them into two main strands. There are expansions that add many elements and substantially change the gameplay of the original game (Morrowind with Bloodmoon is an example). Another type modifies very little and just adds layers and sections to the main product. Legend of Aranna, arrives more than a year after the release of the original game and tries to give new life to Dungeon Siege, an RPG that in the end turned out to be more similar to Diablo than it seemed. Let's see if anything has changed now with this expansion. First of all, it must be said that Legend of Aranna is distributed with a complete version of the original Dungeon Siege attached and for this reason the indicative price is quite high (should be around 50). This choice seems rather strange, above all because only the English version is distributed in Italy, while the version of Dungeon Siege published some time ago was completely in Italian.", "date": "2004-03-08", "grade": null}
