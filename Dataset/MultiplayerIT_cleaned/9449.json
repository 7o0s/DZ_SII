{"name": "De Blob 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/85627-de-blob-2-bibidi-blobbidi-du.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3 Released in 2008 exclusively on Wii, the original De Blob was received extremely favorably by critics, a little less by the general Nintendo public, accustomed for years to turning a blind eye to third-party offers. Natural therefore, the decision by THQ to put into production a multiplatform sequel, which resumed the winning characteristics of the first chapter, however aiming at a wider and -hopefully- more receptive catchment area. On the basis of these premises, therefore, De Blob 2 was born, which we were able to test in its incarnation for PlayStation 3. More Blobs for everyone Being a franchise that does not make the complexity of the plot its strong point, De Blob 2 can be easily tackled even by those who have never even heard of its predecessor. The story is in fact very simple, and broadly follows what we saw in the first chapter: it is enough to know that the Black Companion and his evil INKT Corporation are back in the fray sucking up all the colors from the very lively Prisma City, and it will be the task of the gelatinous protagonist to restore its original beauty to the place, free the inhabitants and drive out the bad guys again. The banality of the storyline is compensated for by an absolutely adorable character design, which finds its maximum expression in the amusing cutscenes which often and willingly also reserve tasty quotes that probably only the most mature part of the public will be able to grasp. Like its predecessor, De Blob 2 is a transversal product in all respects, simple and cute enough to captivate children but at the same time capable of giving different satisfactions even to players accustomed to a more hardcore approach. In fact, the gameplay has remained substantially unchanged: it is always a question of moving the protagonist within various settings (11 to be precise), absorbing colors from appropriate sources and using them to fight the prevailing gray by restoring buildings and constructions to their original appearance and taking out the minions of the Black Companion. On the surface, everything is done with the utmost ease, thanks also to a control system reduced to the essentials: just press a button to reload Blob of paint, and simply push it against the desired objectives to ensure that they are entirely painted the same color as the protagonist. Before completing an internship it is necessary to fulfill a series of primary missions, most of the time extremely affordable and in any case always strictly guided, but once this is done, more demanding secondary challenges are unlocked, intended precisely for eager users to deal with something more complex: this is where you come across tasks that require a more reasoned approach, for example managing your paint reserve sparingly or juxtaposing a variety of hues to achieve the intended purpose. In short, although the level of challenge is generally calibrated downwards precisely to meet the needs of users of all ages, De Blob 2 does not skimp on winking at long-time players, also allowing the latter to enjoy of a playful experience that may not be electrifying in the true sense of the term, but certainly very pleasant. Playstation 3 trophies De Blob 2 offers a total of 26 trophies, of which only one is platinum which is unlocked once all the others have been obtained: part of these are related to completing the different game levels, while the rest range from collecting all the collectibles to 'obtaining the best evaluation for each internship. In short, there is bread even for the teeth of the most meticulous players. The strange couple While continuing on the path traced by the prequel, De Blob 2 brings a couple of important additions to the original gameplay. First of all, the stages are interspersed with a large number of 2D sections, which shine for their fun factor and care in terms of level design, since they often require the user to interact intelligently with the surrounding scenario. Furthermore, along its path, Blob can collect particular bonuses that serve as a bargaining chip to enhance some of its characteristics, such as health, the maximum amount of paint it can absorb and so on, giving the whole thing a bit more depth . Also new in terms of multiplayer, enhanced compared to the prequel while remaining an absolutely marginal part of the package. A new split-screen co-op mode is available, where two users can work together in a seriesof settings in order to achieve the highest score; moreover, during the main adventure, a second player can participate at any time by playing the role of Pinky (Blob's robot companion), helping the protagonist by shooting the enemies that appear on the screen, a solution that recalls the one adopted for Super Mario Galaxy 2 and which seems to have been implemented more than anything else to actively involve the little brother or cousin on duty without loading him with too many responsibilities. All this always in the name of that transversality which is the real flagship of the Blue Tongue title, which at this juncture proves to be a very valid pupil of Nintendo, an absolute master when it comes to making video games that can be appreciated by all age groups. age. Another arrow in De Blob 2's bow is represented by a very valid technical sector, which cannot reach peaks of excellence having to measure itself even with the hardware inferiority of the Wii, but which in any case performs its duty impeccably. The design of the menus and the on-screen interface is particularly good, minimalist and punctual at the same time, while in terms of actual graphics the use of colors, the fluidity of the frame rate and the quality of the animations are rewarded at the expense of an obviously rather limited polygon count. The sound instead confirms the excellence already established by the prequel, with a perfectly fitting musical accompaniment that dynamically punctuates the touches of color operated by our Blob. Closing report regarding the support for the Move, which follows in all respects the command pattern of the equivalent on the Wii: a welcome presence which however is fundamentally overshadowed by the clear superiority of the classic pad in terms of responsiveness and performance.", "date": "2011-02-25", "grade": "8.3"}
