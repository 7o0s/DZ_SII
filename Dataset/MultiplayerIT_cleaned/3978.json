It is not only a beautiful sentence with which to open our review of Call of Cthulhu, but also one of the most emblematic quotations of the work of H. P. Lovecraft: it sums up all the laceration of the Providence writer, the impossibility of distinguishing between truth and illusion, the contradiction of all things, and an ominous darkness that comes from afar. A phrase that can also provide a first key to approaching the actual video game: what are the ~strange aeons~ Lovecraft spoke of? Who can ever live forever? But above all, how are these themes connected and how are they developed in the Cyanide Studio title? All Lovecraft readers will have very high expectations for Call of Cthulhu, especially considering that it also gives a nod to the paper RPG. We spent several hours in Darkwater and saw things from which there is no going back: we tell you about them in our review (but without spoilers). Synopsis: In the mists of Darkwater Call of Cthulhu tells the story of Edward Pierce, a private investigator now practically broke and in a complicated relationship with alcohol. If Edward does not accept a new case soon, his license will be withdrawn, for this reason when a distinguished gentleman offers him to work on the Hawkins case, he does not have much choice: he must accept and go to Darkwater, a whaling village as soon as possible. lost on the east coast of the United States. The Hawkins family met a tragic end: husband, wife and child died in an accidental fire inside the mansion. But the woman's father is not convinced of the version of events provided by the local authorities, and wants Pierce to investigate to find out the truth. We will not tell you what is hidden in Darkwater, nor will we allow ourselves to ruin an investigative adventure that makes storytelling one of its main cornerstones. However, it is clear, since Lovecraft is involved, where Cyanide Studio wants to go. The fishing village is a gloomy and almost completely uninhabited place: the few inhabitants are grumpy, perpetually drunk and downright creepy. Every person Pierce meets seems to be hiding some dark secret, even those who are initially well-disposed. The tension in the air is palpable, as the village is now in ruins since the whales disappeared from the area's waters. Yet, everyone remembers a glorious event from the past: the Miraculous Fishing, in which a gigantic whale with a decidedly singular appearance was brought back to Darkwater. About ten hours are enough to complete Call of Cthulhu, even dedicating yourself to a good exploration of all the proposed game environments and wanting to take a look at the various endings. We will thus visit in the company of Edward, and some companions whom he will meet along the way, the Hawkins villa, infamous bars, uninhabited places and underground tunnels, and many other ghostly environments which we cannot refer to without ruining the pleasure of discovery. Importantly, however, Edward's journey will indeed be a long, terrible descent into madness: nothing in Darkwater is as it seems. Playstation 4 trophies Call of Cthulhu hides not only mysteries and cosmic horrors, but also a glittering Platinum Trophy. To be able to obtain it you will have to replay the Cyanide Studio title several times or save your game at certain specific points: this is because on several occasions you will have to make different choices to unlock the respective trophies. Furthermore, almost all of them are related to the story, so don't even think about reading their description if you don't want to ruin the narrative! Gameplay: detective life Cyanide Studio called Call of Cthulhu a detective-narrative RPG. As always in the case of complex works that draw liberally from very different genres, it is not easy to attribute a single and simple label that makes the style of play immediately clear. Call of Cthulhu is clearly a first-person role-playing game, so much so that the protagonist has specific skills and talents that will be enhanced to our liking, as well as an inventory to consult from time to time, but don't expect who knows what clashes with enemies. Edward is not a warrior and cannot fight whoever stands in front of him: the few game sessions in which dangerous individuals will be present will have to be faced in perfect Outlast style, hiding inside a wardrobe or behind a door. The investigative component is the true heart of Call of Cthulhu: to solve the mystery of Darkwater we will have to search around, elaborate conjectures, interrogate everyone present, collect important clues often hidden very well in the surrounding environment. The investigative component of Call of Cthulhu tries to give its best in the lines of dialogue available to Edward, but almost never really shine. A quick example: after arriving in Darkwater we will be able to speak almost immediately with the captain, one of the local authorities. At this point we will have a series of reflections / questions from our investigator, as well as specific lines of dialogue that can only be selected if we have first poked around in his rooms a little. The best way to approach the game is therefore to explore as much as possible in the vicinity, collect all the documents, open the drawers, peek where we shouldn't, and then go and talk to the interlocutor on duty. By performing the two actions in reverse, we risk not being able to fully exploit the possibilities of the conversation. So what is the real problem of what should be one of the cornerstones of Call of Cthulhu? The fact that one answer is as good as another: the title is so guided that it will still allow us to get to the titles of things by following precise tracks, varying at most a few details or situations, or missing some special objects and conversations; not even the presence of different endings really manages to make a difference, on balance. Should this perhaps be a stimulus to replayability? Probably yes, but it's not. Special abilities and event reconstruction The dialogue system with the characters is not the only point where Call of Cthulhu, despite a fascinating setting and charismatic characters, begins to creak. A sought-after but unfortunately missing depth can also be found in the protagonist's special abilities: by completing the chapters of the main plot or by finding certain collectibles, we will accumulate points, to be spent to enhance Edward's skill tree. These are special skills and knowledge related to psychology, medicine, occultism, but also to the ~nose~ of the detective. Probably the only really useful skills are those related to investigation, because they allow for example to break open doors and immediately access the key points of the game environments, bypassing those who will eventually try to block our way. Medicine and Psychology allow more accurate deductions by investigating the case or questioning those present, but even here the same argument already made previously remains valid: Call of Cthulhu is only apparently profound, and in reality far too guided. It's possible to complete the game without upgrading anything at all, and one value higher than another won't bring much change to the game world. Yes, it will make the phases of reconstruction of the events more immediate and gratifying, i.e. those moments in which Pierce will ask himself ~what the hell happened here?~ and will begin to link together the clues present on the spot to formulate a plausible hypothesis; it will also lead to interesting (but never fundamental) dialogues with the interlocutors. It's a pity, because potentially a more robust, in-depth and refined gameplay would have allowed the game to be a candidate for one of the best narrative and investigative adventures of recent years. Technical and artistic sector The technical and graphic sector is also discreet, but decidedly forgettable: beyond the enormous loads between one chapter and another, Call of Cthulhu graphically and technically looks like a title suspended between the old and the new generation of consoles. On PlayStation 4 Pro the frame rate is stable and we didn't encounter any glitches, but the sound effects, the attention to detail and the refinement of the polygonal models occasionally left something to be desired. Fortunately, the artistic sector and the reference work, accompanied by a pleasant and dispatched narration, take care of saving Call of Cthulhu from the madness of nameless horrors and from that limbo in which forgettable games usually end up. Where does Cyanide Studio's production excel? In the atmosphere, in the sense of constant and definitive oppression that envelops the protagonist, and with him all the secondary characters. In that sense of darkness grown and things hidden in the darkness, which every game environment always and constantly refers to. It is an added value for the game, but a fundamental detail for Lovecraft's readers, and they will probably fall madly in love with Call of Cthulhu, turning a blind eye to many other little things that, put together, cannot fail to be showy .", "date": "2018-10-30", "grade": "7.5"}
