{"name": "Metal Slug 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-slug-3-recensione.html", "text": "Comment Metal Slug 3 is an interesting piece of videogame history characterized by a high-level technical-artistic realization, a real work of computer craftsmanship. In addition to this, it is still a decidedly fun game, enriched as it is by a comfortable online multiplayer mode, truly capable of bringing the arcade spirit into the house. What makes it so recommended for nostalgics, i.e. its absolute fidelity to the arcade tradition, however, distances it from the majority of the public, who could consider 10 euros an excessive expense for a game of such brevity, relatively simplified by the possibility of inserting lives and ~continue~ at will and moreover without additions to the original. However, if you have not yet had the opportunity to bring home Metal Slug in one of the numerous adaptations for consoles, this could be an excellent opportunity. Pros: Fun and adrenaline-pumping Possibility of playing multiplayer online Still impressive graphics Cons: Short experience compared to the price No new additions to the original. Some dips in fluidity Metal Slug 3 is available as a download on Xbox Live Arcade. Xbox 360 - Goals It is not easy to collect all the points scattered in Metal Slug 3. By the standard of Live Arcade games, this title also contains 200 Gamerpoints unlockable in 12 achievements. However, it will not be enough simply to continue from level to level to accumulate them: the points are in fact linked to the player's performance (points collected and lives spent), and it will therefore be necessary to refine one's technique to the maximum to try to collect them all. A crazy war The game is clearly divided into levels, each of which, as the series has accustomed us, characterized by decidedly different settings, enemies and situations. We find ourselves playing one of the 4 heroes available (Marco Rossi, Tarma Roving, Eri Kasamoto and Fiolina Germi), and with them cross the globe in an attempt to thwart the threat posed by the return of the formidable General Morden, who for the occasion seems having allied himself with alien forces, giving rise to a series of atrocities drawn with full hands from the tradition of science fiction and B-series horror, complete with tentacled creatures and awakenings of zombies ready to invade the earth. Clearly, trying to follow a logical thread in the plot of the game is a difficult task, but it is certainly not a cornerstone of Metal Slug. Rather, the chaos that characterizes the scanning of events leaves room for a great variety of situations: the third chapter of the series was in fact the first both to introduce bifurcations within the levels, which allow you to cross the schemes in a different and explore areas that are inaccessible at first sight, making extensive use of the metamorphosis characteristics that transform the characters in various ways (zombies, fat men and other pleasant creatures) with functional as well as aesthetic consequences. Always present, of course, the means scattered around the levels (tanks, submarines and various shuttles), a real stylistic feature of the series. Mysteriously absent, however, the additional modes included in the Xbox re-release (~Fat Island~ and ~Storming the Mother Ship~) which could have added something more in terms of longevity. Shoot and run We go back to the origins of the video game, with this title: no complex key combinations to remember, strategic elaborations to carry out or puzzles to solve. Metal Slug makes the anachronistic link to the typical shootem'up structure its flag, a real archetype of electronic entertainment that appeals to the gamer's primordial instincts: shoot and escape. However, far from being a trivial re-proposition of trite and abused situations and environments from decades of videogame experiences, the strength of Metal Slug also lies in its ability to joke with the clichs of the genre, leading the player to experience a continuous and full of quotes. On the one hand, the game seduces and entertains with its bizarre characters, absurd enemies, crazy proportions and the demented humor that peppers it in its entirety, on the other hand, SNK's zeal for the tradition of the shooter makes it a game which does not allow the slightest mistake to the player: accustomed to complex mechanics and the thousands of parameters to keep an eye on in ~modern~ games, one is amazed to notice how a wrong jump of a millimeter, or a small delay on a dodge can throw nettles an entire game, forcing us to take Metal Slug as a decidedly serious challenge. On the other hand, its structure linked to its origin as a pin-coin machine entails, in addition to the adrenalinic action caused byto the imminent presence of game over, even a brevity to which perhaps we are no longer used to, further worsened by the presence of credits and number of lives at the player's discretion, which certainly do not make the game eternal. Live Arcade is truly a versatile and eclectic service. Just when one could begin to think that Microsoft was exploiting it solely to launch products suitable for the ~casual~ market, with low cost and high returns (but often with little consistency from a videogame point of view), the platform online also brings out games with a capital G at the right time. A few days ago Xbox 360 even managed to rekindle the magic of Sensibile Soccer thanks to the Live Arcade, while more recently the release of this SNK classic, the third chapter of the famous Metal Slug series, seems to want to put things back in the right perspective. On the other hand, the name of the service clearly states the original idea that prompted Microsoft to introduce it within the Live platform: to recreate a rich game library of arcade games, easily usable and playable in company thanks to online support, taking advantage the vast community to set up a sort of widespread arcade, accessible with the push of a simple button. SNK Playmore would have tons of titles fit for purpose, with all the famous intellectual properties so closely linked to the arcade world (much more than that of consoles) and it is strange that so far it has limited itself so much in its releases on Live, which up to at the release of this title they consisted only of Fatal Fury. Metal Slug 3 brings to Xbox 360 the testimony of another historic series for the oriental publisher, who once again magically transforms the Microsoft home console into a bar cabinet. Requiem for the two dimensions As a true standard bearer of representation in two dimensions, SNK has inserted one of the most amazing cosmetics seen in an arcade into Metal Slug 3. In the period of maximum growth of 3D graphics, in a moment in which it was now clear that the two dimensions would be destined to remain a legacy of the past, the developers did not want to save on colors, sprites and backgrounds, packaging a product characterized by an opulence that leaves you amazed. The attention paid to every single detail gives the impression of being inside an interactive cartoon, with each screen representing a painting with bright colors and bursting vivacity. At times, some defects that also characterized the original (here to a lesser extent) remain, such as the occasional drops in the framerate during the most agitated situations, particularly present in the online multiplayer mode, although not such as to excessively affect the playability. The addition of high definition, then, has not particularly helped the game, which is simply equipped with rather heavy filters designed to smooth out the ~pixelated~ edges of the sprites. Also note the censorship implemented in this edition: the blood originally present in copious manner has been replaced by an anonymous clear fluid, although it is possible to return the ~gore~ element by setting the console language to ~Japanese~, if desired. In any case, it is undeniable that Metal Slug 3 is a sort of banner for the graphic school of 2D video games: that sort of steam-punk characteristic of the series achieves unprecedented results here, with bizarre weapons and vehicles and some of the most extravagant bosses in history of video games.", "date": "2008-01-16", "grade": null}
