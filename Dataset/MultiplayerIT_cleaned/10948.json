{"name": "Code of Honor 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/code-of-honor-2-recensione.html", "text": "Evidently the Latin maxim Errare Humanum Est was not listened to by the programmers of City Interactive who, instead of capitalizing on the criticisms and defects of their previous Code of Honor, preferred to churn out a new chapter full of the same defects that afflicted the predecessor. Apart from the story of the evergreen nuclear holocaust, which you will obviously have to avert by yourself, all the rest of the game is nothing but the usual heated soup that City Interactive inevitably serves up to us since it acquired the license for the graphics engine and the artificial intelligence of the first F.E.A.R.: but if the roots sink into a masterpiece like that of Monolith, the tree developed by Polish programmers, especially in this Code of Honor 2, leaves a lot to be desired. Starting with the artificial deficiency itself, castrated by an extremely repetitive and monotonous level design, with the usual corridor-room-corridor scheme repeated to capacity: and after having traveled kilometers and kilometers of corridors and cleaned up dozens and dozens of rooms, surely even the most fanatic of the Foreign Legion will begin to feel a sense of nausea in always being forced to perform the same, identical actions. Fortunately, the longevity is rather short and this represents a plus point, especially for those who, like myself, had to drag themselves to the end of the game (because of the precise votes taken towards our beloved editor-in-chief): an effort not to be underestimated, also because it was a real test of strength and patience, not only to try to ignore the numerous graphic errors present in the game (textures that dematerialize, effects dated to 2002 and so on), but also some notable smudges in the same gameplay , which will see you stuck inside walls and other objects in the world for no apparent reason. Which, of course, is pretty humiliating for a tough Foreign Legion mercenary. Everything repeats itself The game, therefore, always consists in repeating the exact same actions: advancing, eliminating anything that moves, without even too much effort, enjoying the very poor interlude scene and resuming the usual routine. The sale price, a good 19.90, does not justify the purchase in the slightest: we all know that a budget title absolutely cannot be compared to a multimillion-dollar production such as Call of Duty or the like, but we absolutely must not associate the idea of budget game to that of poor quality game: history has in fact shown us, and more than once, that a game can very well be sold at a price lower than the market average despite being a very enjoyable title. So if you want to buy a game and you don't intend to spend more than 20 euros, it makes no sense to throw them away with a title that isn't even worth a quarter of the asking price: for the same amount, you can find much better video games on the market. from all points of view, of this Code of Honor 2. Comment We have arrived at the final comment: already writing a paragraph on the City Interactive game was really difficult, but even just having the perseverance not to uninstall it after the first 10 minutes of play is not a commitment to be underestimated. Code of Honor 2 is basically what a video game shouldn't be: boring, repetitive, graphically dated, sterile, full of bugs. There isn't a single reason in the world to buy this title, considering that with those 19 you can buy a much higher budget title than this one.
