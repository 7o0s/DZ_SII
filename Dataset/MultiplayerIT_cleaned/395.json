{"name": "GODS: Lands of Infinity - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gods-lands-of-infinity-recensione.html", "text": "My kingdom for some shaders Once you arrive in the first world of Gods, a cold shower will make the fragile limbs of gamers more sensitive to the mere graphic aspect jump. Have you played Oblivion recently? Dream it. In Morrowind? Forget it. At the first Gothic? Forget it. Despite the more or less intensive use of nice plays of light and the rather skilful exploitation of some shaders (water, ice, grass and many other elements of the scenario are reproduced in a rather pleasant way), the graphic impact of this Gods mostly a revised and corrected version of the engine of a certain unforgettable Wizardry 8. Mind you, nothing disastrous, indeed. RPG enthusiasts have seen far worse in years of honorable career. Let's just say that the Cypron Studios title betrays a certain artisanal nature, starting from this aspect. The good news, at least, lies in the fact that even with pre-war systems it will be possible to play without worrying too much about performance, the only limit being the need to have a graphics card that supports pixel shaders (from Ati 8500, or Nvidia Geforce 4 onwards). On the other hand, the music that will accompany us through the moors of Antasion is decidedly well done and of absolute value. Many, varied and well-made, they will hardly get bored. Really compliments. The game interface turns out to be rather atypical for a first-person title. With only the use of the mouse it will in fact be possible to move through the lands of infinity simply by pointing the cursor to the point towards which you want to go. It will still be possible to use our trusty keyboard but, given the pace of the game, it will be practically useless. In fact, during the fights - just like in the case of the aforementioned Wizardry 8 - the title loses its real-time game connotation to present us with a mechanic that reminded us a lot of the one used in most of the JRPGs on the market. At least in this case however - fortunately - the clashes will never happen randomly and indeed, at least on most occasions, it will always be possible to try to avoid them. An attack order is automatically decided for each fighter on the battlefield, during each turn it will therefore be possible to decide whether to attack, cast a spell, use an object from your inventory, change your position in the formation of the group or simply defend yourself. Each of these actions precludes all the others, which can only reduce the tactical flavor of the clashes to the bone. Although there is no real concept of action points to be spent during one's turn, it is important to note that depending on the experience level of the character and his degree of knowledge of the martial arts rather than the magical ones, it will be possible to unlock new types of attack (or magic) which, however, could require at least one ~forced~ rest turn. The problem with this setting is that the game never indicates in a clear and direct way how much each action costs and so after a certain number of rounds you could suddenly find yourself having to put yourself in forced defense because you have chosen to use a series of attacks that led to ~tiring~ our character. of absolute value instead the music that will accompany us through the lands of Antasion. Many, varied and well-made, they will hardly get bored My kingdom for some shaders In a nutshell, even if the fight is ultimately one of the most enjoyable aspects of the entire title, it is undeniable how boring and decidedly not very varied in the long run. The same game setting, as already mentioned, removes any tactical ambitions of the clashes (present in masterpieces such as Fallout or even the multi-quoted Wiz8) transforming everything into a mechanical sequence of practically obligatory actions. The various swashbuckling sessions will take you for at least a good three quarters of the gaming experience, for the rest, as in any self-respecting cRPG (or almost), you will not miss the opportunity to have a chat with the various NPC of the game world to collect new missions, sell or buy various goods or maybe simply look for clues about our last mission. There is also an interesting (albeit somewhat ancillary) section dedicated to alchemy which will allow us to combine the most unthinkable ingredients to enchant weapons or armor rather than to make ourselves - like a forerunner Little Chemist - our favorite potions. We were talking about this right? Let's start immediately with the good news (which is only one): sporadically, it will be possible to choose between more than onesolution (usually two) to complete a mission. Sometimes, there will be even minimal plot repercussions. The solutions, however, are simply deciding whether to use brute force or not. Rather than finding a certain item or NPC. In the end, in the world of the gods, all problems are solved by fighting or, when it suits us, by performing jobs as a delivery man... Then forget about cutting-edge artificial intelligence scripts, scheduling the life of non-player characters or even just a glimmer of interaction with the game world. To tell the truth, even the dialogues struggle to lift themselves from a barely gnawed sufficiency. Gods Lands Of Infinity, seems to have emerged from a temporal anomaly that brought out a title from five years ago today. Undoubtedly there is no shortage of moments of discrete fun, but alone they cannot handle such a shallow and well-groomed game structure. Final comment Difficult to judge this Gods - The Lands of Infinity. Undoubtedly we are faced with a courageous and rewarding title, given its independent and low-cost nature. Equally undoubtedly, however, we are faced with a lacking title not so much in terms of the technical aspect as for the game mechanics that could soon get bored. Completely translated into Italian (in the text) and marketed at a budget price, Gods is still a candidate as a recommended purchase for all fans of fantasy games with turn-based combat. It is not one of the best exponents of the genre, but it is the only one that has come out for a few years now. And for some, that might be enough. Pros Excellent soundtrack Attractive price Text in Italian Cons Technically outdated Shallow role-playing Repetitive game mechanics Even the gods love to go to war. At least in the world of Bellarion where, since Xarax - supreme lord of the gods of Bellarion - was killed, the gods have been fighting each other to be able to sit on the throne of the most powerful. After about 2000 years of struggles, thanks to a weapon as rare as it is powerful Mortagorn - god of darkness - seems to have the fate of the battle in hand. Arswaargh - god of fire - is the only one able to save Bellarion from its sad fate (yes, 2000 years of struggles weren't enough), but to do this he needs Vivien, earthly representation of his own divine essence, who will have to explore the new, unexplored world of Antasion in search of a phantom, very powerful magical weapon, capable of being able to stop Mortagorn himself. Welcome to Gods - The Lands of Infinity. After a spartan presentation but still of valuable workmanship, you will immediately find yourself in the game, without the need to create our character or define its characteristics. Rather anomalous choice, being a cRPG, which immediately indicates the rather clear orientation of this tiol. The player will therefore be called to impersonate the young Vivien who, during the game, increasing her experience will learn to dominate her extra-terrestrial powers until she becomes a real god.
