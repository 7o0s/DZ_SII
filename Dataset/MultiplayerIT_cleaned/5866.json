And if suffering retaliation from someone can prove dangerous, if the author of any vengeful gesture is made by a certain Catwoman, then rest assured that it will have tragic implications. The theme of the rematch is therefore the one that forms the backdrop to the first of the two story DLCs proposed by Rocksteady Studios and Warner Bros. Interactive for their Batman: Arkham Knight. The extra content, available on PlayStation Network, Xbox LIVE and PC (as always ~free~ for season ticket holders, and at a price of 1.99 euros for all others) in fact features the sensual Selina Kyle grappling with the Riddler, immediately after the closing events of the Knight of Arkham and the Knightfall protocol. Catwoman's Revenge, as the title clearly explains, takes the adventure into a scenario essentially divided into two parts, one in the role of predator and the other more action. Will Catwoman be able to take revenge on the Riddler and Robin to stop Two-Face? Curiosity Since its release, Batman: Arkham Knight has received good support in terms of extra content. Unfortunately these have not always met the expectations of the fans or justified the cost of the packages. However, we point out the Batman v Superman Batmobile DLC which includes the skins for Bat Man's car and suit, the same ones that will be used in the film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which will arrive in 2016. This pack it's available for now only to season pass holders, but it will be available to everyone in less than a week. I am Catwoman, hear my roar In spite of what might have been expected given the previous ones, Catwoman's Revenge radically changes the gameplay of the Cat Woman, proposing a reasoned and silent approach to the mission, rather than direct and therefore made only of kicks, acrobatics and whips. At least at the beginning. The main objective is in fact to infiltrate the crazy Riddler's robot factory, steal all his money and destroy the production, but without attracting too much attention. In the first few bars, in fact, you have to steal three cards from as many henchmen without being noticed, under penalty of immediate Game Over. Having done all this, it is possible to proceed more ~freely~ to eliminate the rest of the gang, it being understood that in this case too it is important to act equally in the shadows. If just before this type of action was essential to avoid having to start all over again, this time it is to avoid being shot at by a dozen criminals and end up badly. Exploiting every corner, every handhold and every grate, it is better to operate through Silent KOs, in such a way as not to alert the rest of the enemies still alive. Paying attention to the conformity of the fake toy shop under which, as mentioned before, there is actually a factory of violent robots, one must in fact try to isolate the guards and kill them patiently one at a time. The second portion of the DLC, on the other hand, is more action-packed, and re-proposes a more ~traditional~ experience from a certain point of view. In fact, Catwoman must deal with the mechanical henchmen of the Riddler in a real descent into the Underworld of madness. The problem for the gamer in this case will not be constituted only by the presence of various types of opponents, but also by a couple of ~modifiers~ that will be activated on the surrounding environment: these are two laser beams that arrive from above and cause a great damage if you come into contact with them, and at a certain point a type of mechanical beings that electrify the panels that make up the floor, making the space within which to act without being electrocuted increasingly narrow. This is perhaps the most frustrating point of Selina's mini-adventure, as there are many opponents and there is little area in which to move serenely, which leads to repeating the sequence over and over again before succeeding, even with a bit of luck , to complete everything until the end. Even this extra content, in fact, is certainly not appreciated for its longevity, given that we completed it in half an hour on the first lap (losing time in the final stages of the battle we have just described), in twenty minutes on the second knowing already what to do and how to move quickly. No honeymoon A similar argument can be made for the other story package released by Warner, entitled Heads or tails and also set after the events relating to the Knightfall protocol. The story features the new husband Tim Drake together, but only in radio contact, with his wife Barbara. Robin must stop the organized money traffickingor by Two-Face and his subordinates, and bring the super criminal who escaped from prison back to justice. The Pettirosso begins his adventure inside a factory used for waste disposal, but where in reality the men of former district attorney Harvey Dent are sorting the money they have robbed from various banks. The gameplay is the usual, and as for Catwoman's Revenge there is a stealth first part and a more action-oriented second part, where, as always, you have to deal with the henchmen of the boss on duty. However the setting isn't bad, just as we found it fun to use Robin in this mission. If anything, what disappointed us was the not too high level of challenge and above all, as mentioned earlier, the lack of longevity, given that even this extra content runs out too quickly and without even the satisfaction of beating Two-Face. On balance, both DLCs offer a predator room and a fight for each character, they don't have classic boss fights (the fight with multiple enemies on the screen certainly cannot be defined as such) and they are too short. For these reasons, while appreciating some aspects (basically they are conceptually better than the last one with Nightwing, for example), we still believe that they are products below expectations, and therefore not recommended to the public, if not to the most ardent fans who want have every possible content related to Batman: Arkham Knight. At this point the last hope of having a proper story DLC from Warner Bros., in terms of duration, gameplay and storytelling, is placed in Age of Infamy.", "date": "2015-11-26", "grade": null}
