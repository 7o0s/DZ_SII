{"name": "No Man's Land", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/no-mans-land.html", "text": "The house on the prairie If these titles, however, aimed to describe a broad historical arc, No Man's Land definitely aims at another goal. The very appreciable attempt is to be able to focus the player's attention on the battlefield of completely different peoples, just like in fantasy RTSs (see WarCraft above all) where the differences between races are at the base of the game and represent the truest spirit. And what historical period, what kind of real events could lend themselves better to this purpose than the period of the colonization of North America by Europeans which began massively at the end of the seventeenth century? For this CDV in collaboration with Related Design has well decided to take a cue from these events to build its historic RTS. Indians, Cowboys and the usual crowns Now that the historical period and geographical location have been framed, the time has come to get to know the parties involved. NML (No Man's Land) stars an extremely diverse set of characters. The proposed campaigns, three in all, allow you to know the potential of the six factions present: the soldiers of the crown of Spain, the English, the settlers, the first American patriots (the real cowboys) and two tribes of American Indians, those of the forests and those of the prairies. The interweaving of the story will lead the player to face the most disparate situations, through a sufficiently compelling story full of twists and turns. The Spaniards in the perpetual search for gold, returning from the bloody conquests in South America, will clash with the British and Indians, while the latter, victims of an unjust invasion of their native lands, will be forced to retreat inland to make room for the invasion of the white man, guilty of the disfigurement of the territory, due to the construction of the railways, and the elimination of the fauna, a source of food for the natives. Heated soup? Framed the period and the context, let's look at the gameplay. The most classic look of the ~old school~ RTS fits perfectly for this title which certainly does not have the pretension to revolutionize the sector. Indeed everything is presented as a revision of something widely seen and revised in recent times. The interface seems greatly inspired by that of the better known Rise of Nations, nothing more and nothing less, but actually it is difficult to propose something more immediate nowadays. The first problems arise with the control of the units and in this respect we notice the first differences that separate an average title from a masterpiece full of subtleties and subtle tricks. Double clicking on a single unit will not select all units of the same type in your control. Moving troops over long distances the AI will reveal some imperfections and the chosen route will not always reflect common sense. But the most serious mottles come when it comes to dealing with the management of the fights. In fact, the total absence of an interface dedicated to the arrangement of units on the field drastically reduces the gaming experience. This is only slightly offset by the fact that the artificial intelligence tries to put the pieces together and tries, awkwardly, to replace the player's intervention, arranging the troops in formation as needed. Some might even find this choice interesting, but it always remains to be said that NML is an RTS, and as such it should leave every choice and strategic decision to the sole intelligence of the player and never replace it. To add a little spice to the whole there is the possibility of facing epic naval battles, really very funny and exciting. Seeing the Spanish galleons speeding in pursuit of the English frigates is really exciting... almost as exciting as bombing a colony village from the high seas. Balancing and the like As already mentioned, the forces in the field are of the most varied, and one therefore wonders whether the balance between the parties exists and whether in any case it is probable or not. Historically, the contrast between the European armies and the Indian militias would be far too unbalanced to be able to propose a balanced historical reconstruction. Technologically very distant armaments and age-old field warfare strategies cannot even be placed on the same level as the primitive knowledge of the red Indians. As is known the strength of these populations resided in theremarkable versatility and in the obvious knowledge of the combat terrain. From this point of view NML does not disappoint at all. The distinctions between the various factions are clear-cut and plausible. The Spanish and British possess heavy cavalry and a good number of shock units typical of conquering armies. The militias of settlers and patriots are instead a good compromise between the total war preparation of the first United and the agility typical of the Indians. The latter represent the real strength and novelty of the title. Technologically disadvantaged and militarily incapable of dealing with heavy pitched attacks, they are insidious and deadly for sneak attacks and ambushes. They possess the ability to blend into the landscape and have a much more developed vision that allows them to observe the movement of enemies from much further away. The trade also provides them with numerous firearms with which to drive away the ~pale faces~. The more sedentary Forest Indians build buildings and troops more similar to those used by Europeans, while their cousins, the Prairie Indians, have remarkable maneuverability and the ability to quickly move the camp, mostly made up of typical folding tents. The possibility of deploying heroes and special units on the field, then, concludes the series of typical offers of the average RTS. Game mode Alongside the aforementioned campaigns, there are other custom game modes. The ranks of the most navigated (see Deathmatch, King of the hill and Dominate) swell the ranks of some new, absolutely enjoyable. These are two modes related to the construction of a railway and its defense. The train, as is well known, was one of the protagonists of the period in question and many stories are linked to it (remember the old western films where the bandits continually robbed the trains?), and the idea of these challenges. You will find it absolutely hilarious to build the railway in the middle of treacherous gorges, with the constant fear of being ambushed. Too bad that this mode affects the historical fidelity of NML, so far remained quite faithful to the setting. Few will resist exclaiming, with a slight dissent, that everything can pass, but surely a Forest Indian had never been seen grappling with the maneuvers of a Western Union locomotive. Conclusion Having reached the finish line, the time has come to draw conclusions. The graphics of this game, deliberately left untouched so far, will not disappoint you. Based on a graphics engine very similar to that of Rise of Nation (even the interface seems identical to that of the latter), it comes in a totally 3D guise. The camera, which can be totally controlled using the mouse wheel, allows very detailed zooms and very useful overviews in larger fights, while the scenic complexity of certain levels will be very appreciable, rich in articulated geographical conformations and various props and models well done. However, the engine seems to weigh down the structure of the game a little too much, and it seemed to see too much fatigue from decidedly well-equipped machines (and we are talking about Radeon 9700). NML presents itself as an innovative RTS at least for the setting and some game insights never addressed before. Campaigns will keep the average player busy long enough to not feel like they've wasted their money. All in all, not considering some imperfections related above all to the management of the fights, however negligible, it can be said with certainty that this game is worth getting to know. The modalities for single games will then give further longevity to a pleasant game also from a multiplayer point of view (although in the test phase it was not possible for us to use the Gamespy servers, which supports the game, due to problems unrelated to us, but we limited the test to some sessions played in LAN). Finally, it is worth mentioning the excellent soundtrack, customized for each population in the game, a really good trick. Pros: Interesting setting Detailed graphics Some unique single-game gameplay Cons: Apparently heavy graphics engine Poor troop formation management Indians built railroads? Raise your hand who at least once, as a child, dreamed of being able to engage in an epic battle between Indians and cowboys. Except for some sporadic attempt to take the genre to the grand ppublic made in the past, on platforms that definitely belong to another era, in the field of video games the historical period that sees the first American settlers as protagonists and the epic battles on horseback to conquer the West have never planted solid roots. On the other hand, however, the last few years have seen the birth of some very versatile strategic sensationals that can be adapted to any historical period. Just to name a few, it is worth mentioning all descendants, by kinship or affinity, of the popular Age of Empires series launched a few years ago by Microsoft: Age of Mythology, Empire Earth and the younger Rise of Nation (with which the title in question has much in common). The evolutionary steps of the genre are clearly evident in these titles, which have led the right intuition of AoE, a strategy game with a purely historical background, to perfect itself from many points of view, starting from that of playability to ending with the graphic aspect .", "date": "2003-11-11", "grade": null}
