Whatever the motivations behind these mammoth delays, the fact remains that .Hack//G.U. Last Recode landed just a few days ago on the Kyoto flagship. Five years after the first release on PS4, the tetralogy dedicated to the world of Hack and developed by the talented people of Cyberconnect2 is ready to give hours and hours of healthy JRPG action boost, also relying on a decent technical work.Let's find out together in the review by .Hack//G.U. Last Recode for Nintendo Switch. Welcome to The World .Hack//OJ Last Recode: The World menu The .Hack series celebrates its twentieth anniversary this year and we realize that many may now be unaware of its existence. Whatever the motivation, what matters is the point of arrival and, in this sense, .Hack remains a rather seminal series in the panorama not only of action RPGs, but of a whole type of narration that then saw in Sword Art Online its main media epicenter. The GU series is actually the second one published, but also the one notoriously considered the best and it is no coincidence that Bandai Namco has chosen this one to test the ground again against old and potentially new fans. We find ourselves in a reality where online gaming experiences have now become to all effects a parallel life and, in our case, we play the role of Haseo, the game avatar of a boy who finds himself unwillingly the victim of the so-called PK (player killer). After his first violent death, a handful of months later, Haseo is now the terror of this type of infamous players and is considered a PKK. Within The World, the game world that forms the backdrop to this meta narrative, however, the law of the strongest still applies and the worst threat is represented by Tri Edge, the main player killer who recently defeated even a Haseo's ex-girlfriend, to whom he was clearly very close. What aggravates the situation is that all players killed in game by Tri Edge would appear to end up in a coma even in the real world. From these assumptions, dozens and dozens of hours of excellent narration unfold, in full Japanese style, which will make all lovers of the genre happy. Even better considering that, compared to the original release divided into three volumes over a few months and each sold at full price, now everything is included within the same package, despite the monetary speculations of the time. Action RPG with a pinch of fighting game .Hack//OJ Last Recode: teleports that allow passage from one area to another The guys at Cyberconnect2, the developer of the .Hack G.U. series, are known for their ability to bring excellent fighting games to screens, anything but technical and mainly devoted to spectacularity. Naruto's Ninja Storm series is a perfect example of this, but back in the days of .Hack G.U. the Japanese team was already more than an address towards the purest action and the trilogy in question is an emblematic example of this. Despite the nature itself, the role-playing part is of substantially lesser importance than the other exponents of the genre. Especially when you enter the actual management of the party - of which only Haseo can be actively used - you realize the willingness to sketch group tactics and battle preparation. In fact, everything is focused on raw battle, with a single key assigned to standard shots and a whole series of skills that can be called up by pressing the backbones. There is no shortage of special and group attacks, which can be loaded by accumulating points in the course of the battles, as well as some small gimmicks have been included to give the feeling of really being inside an MMO. In fact, at any time it will be possible to return to a ~menu within the menu~, the one that the protagonist himself views through his own device and which allows you to take a peek at the latest news from the world, read your emails, view some particularly significant data and clips and also manage a section related to cheats, one of the additions of this remastered. .Hack//OJ Last Recode: the quality of the anime-style cutscenes still knows how to defend itself just fine We don't want to bore you too much with a series of information that we have known for three decades now and that we have dusted off in depth during the review of the PS4 version, but it is clear that in this .Hack G.U. Last Recode there is so much of that materially to make a good part of the action RPGs of this period pale. If ownor you want to find the hair in the egg, we could talk about the addition of the fourth volume, all new and created specifically for this collection, and how it actually represents a decoy. In practice it is nothing more than a couple of hours of play that connect with everything we already know and which, among other things, does not shine for technical updating. The conversion for Nintendo Switch .Hack//OJ Last Recode: technically it was bare already in 2006 We come to the quality of the port itself, a more than important detail for deciding whether to invest your money. From this point of view we can only be satisfied with the work done. We can't hide the fact that, given the age of the game and its far from sensational technical quality even at the time, we would have been surprised to find big problems. At the same time we know how Nintendo Switch has given us joys and pains in equal measure from a technical point of view and for this reason it is always nice to find a smooth and pleasant game in your hands, especially in portable mode. The small changes made here and there to the original: like the possibility of moving faster, the rebalancing of the difficulty and, of course, the graphic cleaning and the high definition textures, close the circle of a job well done. It is obvious that we would have liked to find less empty and repetitive environments, a more varied combat system and perhaps even an Italian translation. However, we must come to terms with reality and be aware that the G.U. of Project Hack arrived in Europe only with this collection five years ago, previously confined to Japan and America. Who knows if the success of this remastered, first on PS4 and PC and then on Nintendo Switch may not convince Bandai Namco to return to devote himself to .Hack. Anachronistic, but we wouldn't mind.", "date": "2022-03-19", "grade": "7.5"}
