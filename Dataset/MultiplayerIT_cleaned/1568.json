{"name": "Dragon Ball Z - Il Destino di Goku II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-il-destino-di-goku-ii.html", "text": "The Legacy The Destiny of Goku 2 begins right where the prequel left off: after defeating the evil Frieza, our heroes have returned to Earth and have resumed their normal lives. Of Goku, however, there is still no trace, and the brave Saiyan seems to be lost in space. One fine day, while Gohan finds himself studying under pressure from his mother Chi-Chi, a portentous aura catches his attention and that of all the Z Warriors. In no time at all Gohan, Piccolo, Krillin, Yamcha, Tenshinhan and Vegeta they find themselves ready to face the invasion of a repeating Frieza accompanied by his father and an army of aliens. At the climax, however, a new Super Saiyan enters the scene, who easily defeats Freeza and his henchmen and who seems to know exactly where and when Goku will return to Earth. When this happens, Goku discovers the identity of the young warrior: his name is Trunks, he comes from the future, he is the son of Bulma and Vegeta and his job is to deliver Goku a medicine that will save him from a heart attack allowing him to defeat two androids that, two years later, will destroy the world. As can be easily understood by any fan of the series, the plot of The Destiny of Goku 2 faithfully follows that of the manga and anime, presenting the same twists and turns that will lead Goku and company to confront the evil androids of the Red Ribbon and with the fearsome Cell in a desperate battle to save the Earth... Z Warriors Like its predecessor, The Destiny of Goku 2 is configured as an action / RPG rather than a fighting game, perhaps a genre more suitable for an action series like Dragon Ball, focused on endless fights. However, if the prequel suffered from some very serious shortcomings in terms of gameplay that undermined the entire structure, the same cannot be said of this new episode where the shot has been significantly adjusted in favor of greater enjoyment of the adventure . Basically, the player has the opportunity to use more characters as he progresses in the adventure, for a maximum of five (Gohan, Piccolo, Trunks, Vegeta and the inevitable Goku), each equipped with a basic melee blow, one more powerful, a ranged energy attack, and a super energy attack. The fights take place in real-time, as in a classic action/adventure, and although the code that manages the collision detection is decidedly incomplete, the clashes demonstrate a remarkable variety, compared to a prequel where one was limited to always executing the same move. Furthermore, each character now has the possibility of transforming into Super Saiyan or, in Piccolo's case, into Super Namekian: in that case, by pressing a button, the character will get heavy bonuses on his own statistics for a limited period of time, decreed by the length of the spirit energy meter, required to perform any action that requires this power. By pressing the Start key it is then possible to open a menu which allows you to always keep an eye on the three fundamental statistics of your character (Strength, Defense and Speed), to use some healing items and to check the map of the area in which there it is. The game thus develops through the exploration of well-structured labyrinthine areas and fights in them, also placing considerable emphasis on exploration and Role Playing, forcing the player to solve simple but repetitive quests to proceed in the adventure. However, the main quest is alternated with totally optional secondary missions which, in their banality, offer a certain playful variety, especially in the case of some intriguing subquests linked to animated films dedicated to Dragon Ball (for example, the Neo Namek saga and Coolers). advance power Technically, from a graphic point of view The Destiny of Goku 2 represents a significant step forward compared to the bleak prequel and its poorly defined, badly animated and poorly colored sprites. First of all, from the outset, the care taken in the creation of the character sprites is noticeable, with a fair number of animations and quite detailed; but what catches the eye even before is the quality of the locations, really excellent: full of details, colorful, defined and wide-ranging, the settings in The Destiny of Goku 2 are really well done, perhaps undermined by a slight repetitiveness of the underlying theme. Even the energy attacks, which differ from character to character, have suffered a pextensive restyling, and it's a pleasure to find yourself wandering freely around a mode7 world map that faithfully follows that of the anime. However, the question remains why, in the European version, the initial opening sequence was eliminated, a simple introduction to cartoons that recalled the only value of the predecessor, or the presence of animated sequences of good quality magically compressed into the cartridge. On the sound side, you can hear repetitive but not annoying tunes and a corollary of digitized voices that are sparse but not particularly badly made. In short, although far from perfection, The Destiny of Goku 2, technically, is more than enough. And this can only be a good sign. Comment Usually the tie-in rule forbids having hopes in products related above all to merchandising, which exploit popular names and famous series to sell that extra copy to the fool on duty. If this could be said for the first Webfoot work, it is not equally true for The Destiny of Goku 2. Of course, it is rather unusual to be faced with a Goku who gains experience, levels up and faces enemies with a flying view. eagle; of course, usually from a Dragon Ball video game you expect a fighting game full of characters, arenas and special moves; but if a title is well done, however unusual, both from a technical and a playful point of view, it is impossible not to look at this experimentation with a certain optimism. Goku's Destiny 2 is not a masterpiece of the genre, mind you, but it is a good game that will satisfy players looking for simple and intuitive adventures and which, surely, proves to be a must-buy for fans of the Toriyama saga. Now, all that remains is to hope that the next episode, dedicated to the latest saga of the Z series (the battle against Majin Buu), further refines the role-playing aspect, perhaps by implementing a series of less trivial and more complex quests. If this occurs, together with a marked improvement in wartime controls, we could find ourselves faced with a small programming pearl for once far from the sadistic rule of hideous Tie-ins at all costs. Pros Good graphics Simple and intuitive game system Pleasantly challenging Cons Bad collision detection Repetitive Role Playing aspect too simplistic Dragon Ball, you know, is now a catchphrase. Since the animated series began to be broadcast in Italy a few years ago, what could be considered a niche phenomenon limited to the comics market has turned into a real mania, so exposed to the most sneaky and unbridled merchandising that it has become unbearable. Try looking around. Dragon Ball lollipops, Dragon Ball backpacks, Dragon Ball slippers... There's everything and more. The saddest thing is that the famous manga created by Akira Toriyama in 1983 has been somehow transformed, going from an action and adventure manga for boys to almost a child's play, also thanks to an Italian adaptation (as regards the anime ) to rose water and the exploitation of toy companies. In the gaming field, however, things are different. Dragon Ball has already made many appearances since the days of the NES, and never a particularly brilliant one, except perhaps Dragon Ball Z Hyper Dimension for SNES and Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Retsuden for Sega Saturn, two mediocre fighting games but quite faithful to the spirit of the series, as always limited to the Japanese market only. Last year, however, thanks to the western boom of the series, something started to move. The transfer of the rights by Bandai has led more daring software houses to create new video games dedicated to the saga of Goku and company, in particular to that more adult part which, in the cartoon, is marked by the last letter of the alphabet: Dragon Ball Z. After the discreet Dragon Ball Z Budokai, a three-dimensional fighting game for PlayStation2 (which will also see a cross-platform sequel shortly), Webfoot, developer for Electronic Arts, has produced a less than mediocre action/RPG for Gameboy Advance, focusing on the first part of the Z saga. The response from the public and critics has not been favorable, but a repeat Webfoot tries again this summer and the commitment, sometimes, must be rewarded.", "date": "2003-07-30", "grade": null}
