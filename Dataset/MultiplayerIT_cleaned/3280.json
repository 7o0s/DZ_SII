{"name": "Bookbound Brigade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bookbound-brigade-recensione.html", "text": "The inventiveness of the Italian Digital Tales already intrigues from the synopsis: when the theft of an ancient tome throws the literary world into chaos, a bizarre mix of heroes of fairy tales and myths from everywhere come together to find it. To write this review of Bookbound Brigade and find all the basic skills of advancement we spent more than a dozen hours on it; we just glimpse the final act now, but it hasn't been long since we feel like masters of its learning curve. On the other hand, Bookbound Brigade is an ambitious title that draws its inspiration from equally courageous, non-mainstream products, certainly not easy to digest by virtue of a level of challenge that continually puts the player back in his place, without ever making him feel outside above the gameplay itself. A good number of ideas accompany an intricate but fairly direct level design, in which progress and navigation in the game worlds - albeit of a more metroid than vain matrix - are all in all linear, dependent on having acquired or not one of the sixteen basic skills , learned according to a defined narrative pattern. Linear does not mean simple: the conformation of the map is minimal, the elements of the legend do not tell much about the areas and a large part of the backtracking is entrusted to the memory and the individual's ability to memorize the roads and passages. And use the many skills. Be skilled Let's start with the skills because they are the protagonists of Bookbound Brigade. Net of a certain character affinity, in which each of the 8 controllable literary characters (King Arthur or Dracula, for example) has a pair of skills in line with their heritage, the title offers four macro-settings, with a pleasant and also inspired traits, in which you advance from left to right to the point where you acquire a new move but are faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. The newly acquired improvement will be used to continue in another world; you will therefore find yourself forced - guided by the narrator - to return to the central hub to advance right to that point where you had stopped before, while also unlocking that dormant backtracking of the areas already visited, therefore eligible for a new visit to take the previously unreachable treasures. It's a flow that works: advancing is fun and as soon as you become familiar with the labyrinthine dungeons, the map slowly acquires meaning, logic and shape, provided you don't give up in the face of a backtracking that sometimes - and perhaps too much - seriously sends you into confusion even those who have chewed several similar titles. Although the script has been known since the very first hours - take a character, obtain skills, overcome the block - the title holds up well, keeping the player's attention on good levels and making the growth path studded with moderate satisfactions, especially with the bigger bosses. tough. A defect, or rather an advice that we want to give to the talented guys of Digital Tales is right on the reward system, or collectibles: as long as you understand that the growth of individual characters and improvements is the prerogative, trivially, of the expense of the experience accumulated by beating enemies and breaking crates, the reward system does not particularly incentivize all the backtracking necessary to recover them in the map. You will find non-player characters along the way (all belonging to this and that story or work) and each of them will ask you to find an object, hidden in a treasure scattered somewhere. As nice as the dialogues are, the quest system is reduced to the bone and soon the hunt for the object becomes a passing element: if during the progress you come across the objects, fine, otherwise they are left there, perhaps forever. On the way Bookbound Brigade is inspired by several more or less illustrious predecessors and defines its formula: bringing together a handful of romantic heroes in a group that can be maneuvered in various ways is a pleasant gimmick that packs a multifaceted approach to gameplay, capable of speeding up the action and entertaining even in the long term. Among the many sources of inspiration we have seen a splash of Super Meat Boy but above all The Wonderful 101, with a fairly skilful mix of more agitated phases - sometimes a little frustrating, but it is part of the genre - with others where the emphasis on puzzle solving and exploration. Digital Tales has opted for a minimal but successful artistic approach: the enemies and their patterns are sufficient to guarantee the right bite every time, the four settings manage to return a good number of peculiar artistic situations, the backgrounds make up a visual framework that reit comes out - in its essence - to convey the situation. It should also be added that the title is perfect for the portability of Switch - our test bed - as the structure goes well with a hit and run approach. Bookbound Brigade mixes its ideas with stubbornness, balancing the rapid simplicity of reading its DNA with gameplay that is not always perfect, but fresh and fun. There are situations in which everything just doesn't work properly: the formation change of your group is not always received with the right reactivity and sometimes you will die for reasons not always attributable to the individual. Another element that must be assimilated, not without complexity, is the amount of combinations to remember to activate skills and change formation: even in navigated hands the sensation is that the number of key combinations to remember leads, in the frenzy, to sometimes make a wrong combination and find yourself doing something else. A matter of no little habit. Digital Tales has not peppered the title with musical tracks, but the selected ones do their job well, resulting in an enjoyable accompaniment that adds that little additional empathy that never hurts. We close with a small sour note: the uploads to go and return from the central hub are long and we can't explain why. There are also phases in which the framerate suffers, but we are sure they will be fixed.", "date": "2020-01-29", "grade": "7.8"}
