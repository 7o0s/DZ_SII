Yet despite all this, the software houses continue to churn out genre products as if nothing had happened, evidently considering it not saturated and focusing on increasingly complete productions compared perhaps to those of the competition, to meet the growing needs of the public. Just like this EA Sport Active 2, second ~episode~, so to speak, of the fitness game released some time ago exclusively on Nintendo Wii and which Electronic Arts has now decided to offer also on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Perhaps it will be trivial to underline this , but EA Sport Active 2 is obviously not a game as it is intended. Rather a sort of mobile gym to use at home whenever you want to train, only to then ~put it away~ by simply turning off the console. Complete with a virtual personal trainer and digital doctor to monitor everything, as we will see later. But let's proceed in order. Once the disk has been started and the peripherals included in the package have been worn, i.e. three movement sensors designed with special straps, to be positioned one on the leg and two on the arms, with the one on the left having implemented a heart rate monitor, you will have to worry about configuring your personal file, thus entering your physical data relating to weight, height, age, and customize the appearance of the character that will represent you on the screen. Let's start training! Then you will have to perform a first exercise which will be used to evaluate your heart beats through the number of pulsations that will be recorded by the program and the average recovery time of your body after being subjected to an effort. These parameters will then be used for the ~game~ to evaluate any progress or setbacks during the subsequent sessions, so much so that you will have to repeat the test every week. Once you have completed everything we have just described, you will finally have to prepare your personalized training program. Paying attention to what your specific needs are but also to your physical condition. For example, the more athletic among you will be able to program a certain work plan based on a certain intensity, perhaps using a nine-week calendar, while the less handsome ones will be able to choose a shorter period of training and a series of less strenuous exercises. of cardio fitness lasting three weeks, in order to gradually accustom your body to gymnastic activities. However, the exercises can be selected individually and combined as you wish. If you want you can also assign the task of drawing up the training calendar for you to the virtual coach present as mentioned at the beginning of the article in EA Sports Active 2. The latter can be chosen from the two available, according to your tastes and your own character. They are the beautiful Niki and the muscular Devon. The girl has a delicate approach with users, while the other is tougher and more determined. In both cases, however, the personal trainers will follow you in every phase of training, giving you advice and stimulating you during the exercises. Then you'll be ready to start: through the main menu you can access your personalized training program, then do some stretching to warm up your muscles and start. The best? The exercises are of different types both to diversify the activity and make it less boring, and because they will involve various categories of muscles, complete with strength training and aerobics. Plus others inspired by sports disciplines such as soccer and basketball that also serve to spice up some sessions. In short, EA Sport Active 2 provides for a total use of the body, even more than in other similar products, and for this reason we would like to say that in some ways it appears if not the best at least one of the first three of the genre. In this sense we must underline the excellent performance of the peripherals included in the package, especially the heart rate monitor, which react quite well to the stresses of the human body by promptly interacting with the console. From what has just been said, the fact that a certain space is needed in the living room to be able to move freely, more than that necessary for other conceptually similar games, and therefore a few meters. And indeed it is. To complete the general picture, we would like to point out that the product also offers a personal diary where you can write down the daily data on your diet, the possibility of consulting the log of your workouts which shows a great wealth of statistics and that of carrying out some tests related to youror standard of living, then the type of diet, daily habits, hours of sleep, the extra daily physical activities you carry out and so on. In this way the software will give further advice for a healthy life even outside the phases of physical exercise and will also try to suggest which workouts are suitable to remedy any flaws in your way of life. There is also the option to train together with another person (provided you have another set of sensors), create or access training groups via PSN to share and compare your results with those of other members, and a shop inside the title with which to acquire new exercises, to make your workouts more varied. In conclusion and in a nutshell, this EA Sport Active 2 is a title with good depth, attention to detail and qualities such as to make it perfect for being able to perform strenuous and effective gymnastic exercises at home to keep fit.
