{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-recensione.html", "text": "About sixty years ago, in the countryside around the small town of Sonobe, a young man who often ventured into the depths of the bamboo groves came across the entrance to a cave that he had crossed several times during his wanderings. Legend has it that that day he gathered all the courage he had in his body, decided to descend inside and had an epiphany, the vision of a fantastic world entirely devoted to great adventure. That boy was called Shigeru Miyamoto, that vision would be transformed into the universe of The Legend of Zelda, while that imaginary world today has come to welcome green prairies, mountains of fire and endless oceans, up to point beyond the blue sky. Since then, every time the mosaic of the Link saga is about to be enriched by a new piece, a sort of tremor in the strength can be felt, as if an old and respected master was about to return to his chair in order to reveal an important discovery. And this is precisely the air you breathe in the skies of the Kingdom of Hyrule, around The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom: many hope that the new chapter - escaping the negative meaning of ~more of the same ~ - succeeds in the difficult task of squeezing all the great solos of the past into one great symphony, to communicate to gamers exactly what they need to hear. In fact, in recent times we have experienced difficult moments, something more worrying than the will to find out if the direct sequel would have lived up to a masterpiece like Breath of the Wild, or to the rumors that have tried to approach it with a trivial downloadable content. The echo of the global pandemic still resonates with extreme force in the world of video games, as if those years of emptiness had opened an incurable rift in the industry, transforming the emergence of new ideas and works of excellence - especially in the undergrowth of AAA productions - in a more unique than rare event. And here too this responsibility ended up falling on the shoulders of Nintendo EPD, a forge called not only to stage what according to many could represent the swan song of Switch, but to demonstrate to the whole world that there is still something out there the will to dream, to give a concrete form to simple yet powerful childhood fantasies, just like those that gave birth to the saga in a remote cave in the Japanese countryside. Eiji Aonuma answered the call, a captain anxious to show the ideas born from the studio over the course of the six years of development, revealing only the bare minimum and instead leaving - in full respect of tradition - for the finished product to do the talking . A product that, for its part, knows how to speak better than any live broadcast: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is simply a work that goes beyond all possible expectations. Synthesizing all the souls that have guided the saga within a single receptacle, it is aimed equally at old and new fans, putting an impressive amount of content on the plate and then embroidering its identity around the evolution of the foundations from the series: the adventure and the wonder. Very Breath of the Wild and a little Ocarina of Time, with a strong sprinkling of The Wind Waker and a light pass of Skyward Sword, Link's last journey wants to make a metaphorical bow to the lessons of the works of the past, stealing part of secrets before grafting its huge amount of originality, once again transforming the approach to the rules of the series and, in some ways, also to the video game itself. But is it really possible to go beyond a disruptive revolution like the one brought about by its predecessor? This is precisely the big question that underlies the review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. A video game that is played all the time It takes thirty seconds to understand that there is no limit to what can be done in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, more than anything else, you play. This might seem like a simplistic consideration, but it manages to condense the whole essence of Link's epic, the secret ingredient capable of differentiating it from all the others. Hyrule is a blank canvas, the numerous tools available become a palette, and each player is completely free to paint their own personal masterpiece; there is no right way to play, there is no wrong way, the one constant is that Link is always in the right place at the right time, despite the immensity of the world around him. Not a moment goes by without a silhouette on the horizon catching your attention, and in the same moment in you set off, the embrace of the setting becomes ever tighter, raising the curtain every twenty steps on a new interaction, on a passer-by who can't wait to share a secret, on an element that leads to veering off the beaten track once again. And perhaps this is the magic formula that holds the spell of the most recent Hyrule, which responds in a unique way to every stimulus of the player and never fails to provide its own, allowing the heroes to write an original story simply by playing with the imagination . The kingdom talks to the player, winks at him constantly, pushes him to ask himself: ~is it possible that this thing works?~. And, surprise, that interaction always works, transforming any gesture made in the virtual world into a sort of game within the game, taking the sandbox brushstrokes that colored Breath of the Wild to transform them into the protagonist of the picture. If contemporary video games live on well-defined compartments, such as crossings, secondary activities or creation systems, Tears of the Kingdom is an experience that flows as smooth and cohesive as water, in which everything happens naturally: curiosity pushes towards exploration, imagination opens up to dozens of unforeseen solutions, guiding each action is the desire to continue experimenting. And the experiments to do are almost unlimited, mixing Link's new abilities and the tools of the Zonau species that color the setting, creating weapons and machinery of all kinds, customizing the equipment down to the smallest detail, all without sacrificing the adventurous experience at the base of Breath of the Wild and indeed enriching it with new elements, precisely those that historical enthusiasts hoped to find under the skies of the new Hyrule. A Symphony of Zelda The new The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a synthesis of all the great lessons of the saga At the same time, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the outstanding synthesis of the entire The Legend of Zelda saga. If each inspiration that has guided the various episodes of the series can be understood as a single musical instrument, this iteration represents the whole orchestra; the wild freedom of Breath of the Wild, the claustrophobic backdrops of Ocarina of Time, a pinch of darkness of Majora's Mask, the focus on narrative of Skyward Sword: all these declinations have risen on the same stage in order to create a sort of manual definitive of the essence of the legend of Zelda. The result is a melody that begins with exploration, less guided than ever, linked only to the mental compass that unconsciously drags the player from the islands in the sky to the bowels of the earth. Then the descent - and sometimes the ascent - enters the scene in the heart of the dungeons, between floating archipelagos, underground labyrinths and real temples that test the ingenuity and memory, evolving an ancient drift that was thought lost forever . It is then that it explodes into boss battles, this time unique, scenic and challenging, perfectly set to music and beautifully choreographed. To close the circle, the story intervenes, always present but never intrusive, willing to frame the gameplay in some moments of great impact, daring more than usual without however trying to take responsibility beyond the reach of the saga. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a very direct sequel: structure and narrative Thus opens The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with a sequence in real time Link walks next to Zelda in the dungeons of Hyrule Castle, along the way deciphering the bas-reliefs that stage the mysterious War of the Exile, an ancient conflict unleashed by the coming of the King of Demons. This is how The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom opens, with a real-time sequence that seems to suggest a newfound importance for the narrative component, a plot about which we will not make any kind of spoiler. Knight and princess find themselves involved in a new catastrophe, reawakening an ancient evil that has remained buried for a long time under the castle of Hyrule, a construct that rises menacingly into the sky casting a disturbing shadow on the four corners of the kingdom. Some time later, Link regains his senses on an island resting in the clouds, stripped of all powers and healed thanks to the implantation of a mysterious prosthetic arm: it won't be long before he realizes that Princess Zelda is not there trace, but above all that the world - now in the grip of the evil entity - needs his intervention more than ever. Even if it has already happened that the imaginary of the series developeddirect, it had never happened that the continuity was so marked, to the point that the approach is very difficult for anyone who has not experienced the events of Breath of the Wild. Nintendo EPD has dusted off the idea that decades ago led Pokmon enthusiasts to revisit the Kanto region in Gold and Silver versions, staging a Hyrule that is the same and different at the same time, as familiar as it is alienating. All the well-known characters return, from the brilliant Pruna to the young champions of different peoples, with the important difference that they have now grown up, that the world around them has moved on, transforming each visit to already known places into an often more impactful surprise of a simple novelty. Secondary characters follow Link directly into battle Instead of proceeding solely along the road of the flashback - an expedient that necessarily remains markedly exploited - the plot also unfolds around facts that are happening here and now, leading the supporting actors to travel together with Link, to follow him directly into battle to fight first line the army of the demonic entity, along backdrops that are sometimes darker than the standards to which the series has accustomed us. The fabric of the narrative takes different directions, not only adopting the same radial structure already incorporated in the previous chapter - prompting players to explore the world in any order they prefer - but giving rise to different branches of the main mission. What happened to Princess Zelda? What is happening in the main poles of the kingdom? What secret lies beneath the surface of the realm? These are the trails of crumbs that guide the hero's journey, which ask the player to actively investigate, to read, to reason, almost always avoiding relying on cold pins on the map and instead preferring an experiential approach. If initially these routes have the scent of already seen and already heard, slowly they reveal a mass of implications that are impossible to predict even for the most imaginative enthusiasts. A new kingdom of Hyrule: the setting The glance of the new Hyrule is impressive The first impact with Hyrule is strange, disorienting, difficult to read. As soon as you take control of Link - especially when you reach the surface of the realm - the atmosphere is that of the most classic of sequels, of a project firmly anchored in the great revolution brought about by its predecessor. Shrines can immediately be seen on the horizon, by lifting a boulder the inevitable Korok emerges ready to reward Link for having found it, looking around for a few moments you immediately notice the traditional topographical towers. However, it only takes a handful of minutes to discover that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom adopts a structure similar to that of an onion: initially it impacts with a hard rind that makes it impossible to grasp what is hidden inside, until - layer after layer - dozens of innovations capable of changing the face of the experience are presented, completely reversing the approach to the setting and improving every single element introduced six years ago.In the beginning, you can breathe the air of the dear old kingdom of Hyrule, beautiful as it was left and enriched with new points of interest, full of caves and wells ready to open up on small and large underground labyrinths, dotted with animals and as always crowded with enemies. Vast floating archipelagos extend as far as the eye can see above the protagonist's head, the structure of which recovers the inspiration of the ocean in The Wind Waker: there are more massive islands and others that are reduced to mere Shrines in the clouds, gigantic flying constructs and minute structures devoted to single interaction. To navigate on the wings of the wind there are dozens of different methods, but the most common lies in the exploitation of the topographical towers, which now function as cannons capable of firing Link hundreds of meters in height; then, once you set foot on an island, you discover that the only limit to exploration lies in the player's imagination. Hot air balloons, drones, even fully functional fighter bombers: taking advantage of the new talents of the protagonist and the dozens of Zonau technologies, it is possible to animate devices that make movement the least of Link's problems, to the point that the innovations designed to sail the skies end to have enormous weight even on land. Launching from the islands it is in fact possible to reach any point of interest that captures the attention in the blink of an eye, transforming the long crossings of Breath of the Wild into a quick and pleasant interlude between activities, relegating the endless climbs to the simple", "date": "2023-05-11", "grade": "10"}
