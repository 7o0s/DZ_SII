Yet, although this race is one of those on which the fantasy genre has based its fortunes, there are not so many works in which a short and bearded character appears as the protagonist together with his axe. Despite being able to count on a reputation as fearsome warriors, dwarves often happen to be entrusted with the task of lightening the tone of the narrative, through gags of various kinds: to have an example, just think of the way in which Gimli was represented in the trilogy film of The Lord of the Rings. King Art Games, the development team of the adventure series The Book of Unwritten Tales, thought of reawakening the dwarven pride, as hard as the anvils found in the heart of Forgiardente. After a $310,000 pass on Kickstarter, The Dwarves was finally released at the end of 2016, a title that sees a dwarf as the absolute protagonist. Let's find out together, in our review. Sharpen your ax and tidy up your beard: let's go on the dwarven adventure of The Dwarves! Made in Germany If the name The Dwarves has rang a bell in your head, it means that you know the international fantasy scene well. The setting of the game is not in fact the developers' sack flour, but takes up what is told in the novel of the same name (Die Zwerge in the original language) written in 2003 by the German journalist Markus Heitz. The book, also translated into Italian under the name Le Cinque Stirpi, actually kicks off a saga made up of four other books, the last of which was published in our area in 2016. After the dutiful literary introduction, let's move on to The Dwarves video game, which as we said takes up the story narrated in the first chapter to put us in the shoes of Tungdil Manodoro. Although living in a world where dwarves are divided between five bloodlines (hence the name of the book), Tungdil has never met anyone of his own race. In fact, from an early age he was raised between the forge and books by Lot-Ionan, a powerful wizard who with his power helps to defend the region of the Hidden Lands from the invasion of the inevitable enemy forces of an evil nature. The opportunity to leave for the adventure presents itself to Tungdil when Lot-Ionan instructs him to make a delivery to one of his fellow magicians: a seemingly easy task, which soon turns out to be much more complicated than expected, carrying the protagonist around for Girdlegard. With the orc army almost upon us, dwarf forces will be instrumental in thwarting a disastrous invasion. Without revealing anything else about the plot, we can say that this aspect was one of the ones we liked the most within The Dwarves. While relying on some canons of fantasy that have become classics, the story is able to be followed throughout its entire duration: having not read The Five Bloodlines we cannot make judgments on the quality of the adaptation, but after playing The Dwarves that what we can say is that we are now encouraged to delve into the works of Markus Heitz. From map to battle The game mechanics of The Dwarves are based on two main components: the map, where the movement of the group takes place, and the combat phases in real time. To be precise, there is also a third part, dedicated to some phases where the protagonist investigates what happened in his absence. The map presents a series of territories, on which some placeholders are placed: the first of these is naturally associated with the player's group, but there are also others linked to enemy forces or itinerant merchants. Moving around the map allows The Dwarves to develop its own plot, while deepening the knowledge of the various characters. Despite the presence of a well-defined main vein of history, the possibility of exploring the entire map, following the waypoints that make it up to your liking, is not excluded. Here and there it is possible to meet some secondary quest or run into a choice point, which however has limited consequences on the continuation of the adventure. Compared to a plot that has already been written out in detail in a book, it is useless to expect who knows what deviations. However, it is good to know that there are cases in which a wrong choice can lead directly to death and consequently to game over, thus forcing the player to resume from the last save. Before moving on to the combat, we must say that this is the aspect of the game that convinced us the least, together with the very limited possibility of customization that is offered to us by The Dwarves, which we remember is described as an RPG. Despite the accumulationexperience points and the presence of levels, the only choice that the player can make is linked to the special abilities to be assigned to individual heroes, for which hit points and all the rest are automatically increased. Also forget weapons and armor: the only type of equipment that can be given to fighters is linked to a single slot, to which an amulet with a certain bonus or a potion can be associated. Four against a thousand The combat phase of The Dwarves is anticipated by a screen for choosing the characters to be used, similar to the one seen in The Banner Saga. Unlike Stoic Studio's effort, in The Dwarves the action takes place in real time, offering the player the classic possibility of pausing with the spacebar to issue orders to the heroes. This is a crucial phase, as Tungdil and the others find themselves facing a very large number of forces, typically composed of variants of orcs, but if necessary also from zombies resurrected by the magic of the books, creatures similar to elves but evil to the core. As we said, planning is everything, together with the study of the surrounding environment. The first thing to pay attention to are the action points with which to activate the various skills, to be used mainly to control the influx of enemies. Secondly, it is possible to use the scenario to your advantage, for example using a crowd control ability to throw enemies off a cliff, thus saving yourself the trouble of having to beat them further. We also need to be careful with ~friendly fire~, as the blows inflicted by our heroes can damage the other members of the group. If even one character dies, the battle ends with defeat and the possibility of starting it all over again. When everything we have described works well, The Dwarves manages to light a fuse even in combat which unfortunately remains asleep for most of the time. To begin with, we would have appreciated a better chance of distinguishing your heroes from the horde of enemies, as confusion can lead to lethal outcomes such as accidentally falling into a ravine, or dealing a lethal blow to an ally of yours. Secondly, we would have preferred more airy battlefields, in which to engage in survival wars until the last blow of the axe. The level design also uncovers the side of cunning actions on the part of the player, especially in the case where the objective is to get from point A to point B of the place where the battle takes place. Why bother eliminating enemies, if in one way or another it is possible to immediately aim for that particular place without risking your skin? The trick works more times than you might believe, thus ending up debasing the gameplay set up by King Art Games, which in reality would also be quite challenging. As for the variety of heroes, there is no shortage of choice: the poker to be deployed on the field can be made up of a maximum of fifteen elements, several of which are obviously dwarfs. Tungdil must always be employed, so in reality the choice is reduced to three heroes. Unity for the win The decision to use Unity as the graphics engine didn't stop the animators at King Art Games from doing a good job with The Dwarves. Tungdil and all the other characters offer a level of detail that is quite nice to see, just as the interlude scenes are appreciated net of some loading that is a little too abundant in terms of frequency. We must congratulate the dubbing, present in German and English: in the latter case, it is without exaggeration one of the best among those in circulation, both among the productions comparable to The Dwarves but also beyond. On the other hand, Italian is only present in textual form, with some small imperfections linked both to the interface, with the overlapping of some texts, and with a translation from the spoken word that is not always impeccable. Even in technical terms, unfortunately, The Dwarves shows an open side that also affects the gameplay: you can rotate the camera or choose its zoom level, it is not possible to move the view freely. We therefore find ourselves hooked to a single character when this is selected, forced to perform real miracles to be able to manage situations in which the four heroes are at different points on the battlefield. A half suicide, for a title of this kind. The duration of the adventure is around ten hours, with the possibility of starting from scratch in case you want to try the more challenging level of challenge.", "date": "2017-01-03", "grade": "6.6"}
