Also think of losing sight of the concept of separation between individuals, as we traditionally understand it, embracing an interconnected vision of the world where the one is never disconnected from the whole, and vice versa. If you have never heard of Everything, these few introductory lines should be enough to make you understand that we are not in the presence of a video game in the traditional sense of the term, but rather an unconventional experience in which the user can take control of everything what exists, without limiting ourselves to a single order of magnitude. Everything offers us the opportunity to become a vegetable, an animal, a house, a stone, embrace an entire continent, a planet or even a galaxy, and we could go on and on. It all depends on the player's choices, his propensities and the way he intends to get in touch with an extremely liquid reality, where the urgency of the existential question is punctuated by lucid and fascinating philosophical reflections. As the official description states, Everything takes the viewer by the hand and urges him to ~produce an endless documentary about the world you live in~. Presented last year, on the occasion of the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, the project comes from an idea - but perhaps we could speak of a systematic study - by the artist David O'Reilly. It is likely that this name means nothing to you, but O'Reilly has already become the protagonist of another sui generis simulator entitled Mountain, a radical contemplative experiment in homage to oriental meditation. O'Reilly himself has defined his new work as a ~simulator of consciences~ and if at first glance it may seem like a weird definition, it is precisely when you take the pad in your hands that this meaning receives confirmation. All in all, it could be said that the existential approach born with Mountain has been cubed to present us with a structured interpretation of the cosmos in relation to individual consciousness, delimited by a philosophical substratum that reveals itself one step at a time, articulating the exploration of stylized scenarios, full of surprises and with its own rules. That's why, in order to justify the experience and offer a key to understanding the whole, O'Reilly relied on the reflections advocated by Alan Watts, a twentieth-century English philosopher who dedicated his life to the study of Buddhism and Zen thought. Moreover, these same concepts had already been explored in the short film The External World, presented in 2011 at the Venice Film Fair and in turn inspired by existential themes. Everything is the new work by artist David O'Reilly and is a tribute to the mysteries of the cosmos Playstation 4 trophies Everything Trophies are 35 and must be unlocked through exploration. Often there are no precise indications on what to do, consequently you have to work on intuition. Ascent and descent in the eternal flow of the cosmos The incipit of the work is alienating, it assumes control of a small particle that is traveling in an indefinite space. Some existential questions appear on the screen, when suddenly the light becomes more intense and we find ourselves projected in the role of a polar bear, within a snowy scenario shared with numerous other creatures. The playful approach becomes even more particular as soon as one realizes that these entities do not walk normally, as one would expect, but roll rigidly on the ground as if they were static images. Leaving aside this detail, which we will return to later, one can begin to become familiar with the surrounding context, through a multitude of shared activities. For example, it is possible to make sounds, but one can also gather in a herd, dance with one's fellow humans and communicate with inanimate objects. However, the lived experience in Everything is based above all on two crucial concepts: the Ascent and the Descent. As we said at the beginning, it is possible to move by acquiring the perspective of anything present in the game world and to do this it is necessary to translate into a different entity. By choosing to ascend, one assumes control of a larger subject (or object), while by opting for descent, one can come into contact with smaller, even infinitesimal realities. In this way a dimensional journey is established that embraces all of creation, placing both the materials and the creatures visible in front of one's eyes in close correlation, from the smallest elementary particle to the mcosmic grandeur represented by galaxies and nebulae. This form of interaction is therefore marked by the search for all those entities that have not yet dressed up and those occasional dialogues that are suggested by the observation of the surrounding environment. Precisely in these situations you have access to short philosophical dissertations by Alan Watts, available from time to time in the form of an audio track. The type of narration that the user is able to trigger during his journey is probably the most interesting factor of the experiment, it gives a pleasant sensation of investigation and stimulates reflection on more general issues related to the common feeling of individuals, in constant search of an identity and their own place in the world. At the same time, we urge the abandonment of the rational beliefs we have become accustomed to, instead taking on new points of reference. Only by freeing oneself from the constraints and static conditions of one's existence is it possible to ideally take flight towards something new. A significant part of the thought advocated by Watts here originates from the distinction between the concept of self and the idea of ~other~, a conceptual barrier that would prevent the individual from placing himself in a much more extensive and harmonious context. Hence the metaphor of the ascent, or of the descent, which is precisely suggested by the gameplay. It's all a question of perspective, which finds its maximum expression in the pleasure of travel and discovery. Furthermore, we cannot avoid remarking that the aforementioned recordings require a sufficient knowledge of the English language - and also some rudiments of philosophy certainly do no harm - since the work has not been localized into Italian. The existential approach is also expressed in the tones of the soundtrack, composed by the German author Ben Luka Boysen. The tracks are always very delicate, aimed at outlining the wonder that one feels at each new discovery, but also that sense of investigation mixed with melancholy that Everything shares with O'Reilly's previous works. Moreover, despite the presence of very interesting and completely unconventional ideas, in some moments the work seems to get lost along the way and one feels the absence of an underlying purpose which, in some way, supports the play system when the surprise effect is over. Undoubtedly Watts' dissertations help to contextualize what is happening before our eyes and to give it a thematic coherence, nevertheless the title also suffers from a rather questionable artistic achievement, which afflicts the stylistic care of the settings. The shy colors, the unbelievable movements of some creatures, and the scarce landscape richness make Everything less captivating than it could have been, and it's a shame because the ideas are not lacking at all.", "date": "2017-03-28", "grade": "7.0"}
