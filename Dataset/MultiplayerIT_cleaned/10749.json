{"name": "Stormrise - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stormrise-recensione.html", "text": "Wars destroy more than build, and when you go beyond a certain point you can never go back. This is what happens in the world of Stormrise: armies use up all their most terrible resources to prevail, and in the end there is nothing left to do, the planet is doomed. The few survivors have the only possibility of locking themselves within the walls of armored fortresses, immersing themselves in a cryogenic sleep that will preserve them until the Earth is habitable again. A far from easy choice, given that the unfortunate ones left out will be destined for death... or worse. When awakening comes, Captain Aiden Geary realizes that the situation is perhaps worse than when he went into hibernation: the sky is almost clear, the plains are not on fire, but a terrible force has taken possession of those that before they were ordinary people, transforming them into powerful and monstrous creatures, aiming for the complete domination of the planet. The only way to deal with this threat is once again war, Geary joins the Echelon army and aboard his mechanical exoskeleton tries to restore peace in the only way he knows how: by fighting. A new approach to the genre? The element that made RTS enthusiasts discuss the most concerns the control system adopted for Stormrise, truly innovative, which allows us to manage everything using only the analog sticks and a button of the Dual Shock 3. The left analog stick is deputy to the movement of the ~pointer~: we can move it in all directions and the unit we control will turn around accordingly, moving the view. Once we have identified a point of interest to us, we can press the X button for the characters to reach it. The right analog stick, on the other hand, is used to switch from one unit to another, through an unprecedented system which is based on a sort of laser pointing: the various units are indicated on the screen by icons, and by moving the stick in their direction, release it we will take control of it, without the need for further maneuvers. This is a potentially very quick and intuitive solution, which allows the player to alternate control of the various groups in no time at all. If desired, a three-dimensional tactical map can be accessed by pressing the Select key to get an overview of the stage and the allied or enemy units inside it. The combat system is almost completely automatic: as soon as one of our teams finds opponents within range, he will open fire until the battle has ended with the defeat of one of the two factions. What we can do in these situations is to select the weapon we want to use (if there is more than one available, of course) and possibly move the units to a shelter that puts them in an advantageous situation compared to the enemy. As in any RTS, in fact, the largest army often prevails, and attacking recklessly or without a strategy inevitably leads to defeat. Search and destroy Each of the Stormrise missions is introduced by a quick briefing that explains what we have to do and how. Once in action, the characters on duty will activate themselves to mark any points to be conquered on the map and to indicate the presence of enemies. We will have to pay close attention to the management of the main units, in this case Captain Geary and his colleagues, because their loss translates into an immediate game over. On the other hand, we will not have limitations as regards the ~low manpower~, i.e. the small groups made up of more or less equipped soldiers who move in unison and without fear even in the face of huge hostile formations. The points to be conquered are generally represented by towers that provide us with the ability to ~build~ new units, in more or less high numbers depending on the energy available, and must be defended from enemy assaults on more than one occasion . However, it is precisely during the most agitated phases that the SEGA title shows all its limits: the presence of a third-person view relating to the selected unit is soon uncomfortable and prevents us from checking what happens to the other groups, while the selection via analog stick proves to be completely unsuitable for the management of numerous units, constituting a problem rather than a welcome innovation. The main mode of the game is accompanied by an online multiplayer for up to eight players at the same time, with a good number of maps but with the same problems as the single player... Technical realization The graphics of the game move between ups and downs, with the quality of the scenarios which gives a rather clear idea of this alternation: some resultsvery well made buildings, with a plausible layout of the buildings and a good level of detail; others are really sparse and uninspired. If it is true that during the missions we will end up controlling dozens of different units, it is also true that the animations do not do them justice. We will often see the soldiers move in an identical way, like automatons, always taking the shortest route to reach a certain area but making the move in a far from convincing way. The same thing happens to the main units, for example Captain Geary's exoskeleton moves in near slow motion which is less than desirable when time is running out and the situation calls for immediate action. The firefights are also poorly cared for and not very spectacular, moreover it is sometimes possible to notice that units are destroyed without being hit and therefore it seems to be faced with an almost predetermined fight in which the largest group, equipped with weapons, wins more powerful or in the best position. There is almost no interactivity with the environment and the frame rate is subject to frequent uncertainty. The situation worsens when one analyzes the sound sector, meager and devoid of bite as far as music and effects are concerned, endowed with a dubbing in Italian unfortunately of modest quality, with often metallic voices and an acting level that goes from bad to just sufficient. Sounds like the same voice acting team that helped localize Emergency Heroes for Wii, which is saying something. Comment Stormrise was supposed to represent a small revolution in the RTS genre on consoles, and instead it turns out to be the classic ~I wish but I can't~. The control system designed by the developers appears immediate only during the early stages, when there are few units to manage and the actions develop with relative calm. As soon as the pace picks up and the number of forces on the field increases, however, things become really problematic and the limits of the third-person view and the selection via analog stick make themselves felt, irreparably tarnishing the gaming experience. The new SEGA title therefore presents itself as a not very valid product, which cannot even combine the obvious problems of the gameplay with a technical realization that lives up to expectations, with scenarios of variable quality on which animated units move in a way that is anything but convincing. And the insufficient Italian dubbing doesn't help. In short, if you like real-time strategy and you really can't do without the news, you can also give Stormrise a chance, but keeping in mind its limitations. Pros Fascinating scenery Good number of missions and online multiplayer Some good quality locations... Against ...but the graphics in general don't make you cry for a miracle Problem control system Mediocre sound PlayStation 3 - Trophies Stormrise offers 44 trophies (of which 6 are silver and 2 are gold), some ranging from the simple completion of missions to eliminating a certain number of enemy units. There are also those dedicated to online (99 ranked matches must be won) and skirmish maps, while using all the available skills at least once during the game, you get a nice gold trophy.", "date": "2009-04-21", "grade": null}
