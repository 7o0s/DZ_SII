The circuits are well reproduced (at least on the map), but the scarcity of trackside elements contributes not a little to instilling a certain sense of desolation: some steps, tires, guard rails and a few planters surround the 'asphalt. The latter, on the other hand, is well reproduced and even the Mexican racing cars available are beautiful to look at and (now as expected) first made in 3D, then converted into (few) two-dimensional sprites; on the other hand, the reflection effect applied to the rear window is fixed and consequently inappropriate. The scaling of the sprites works well, while the collisions allow very rare dfaillances, we will sometimes happen to be ~penetrated~ by an opposing bolide or the thrusts resulting from a contact will be slightly unreal; the backdrops, on the other hand, are generally neat (the best is that of Suzuka), but a bit flat, even in spite of a simple parallactic effect applied. The speed of the game is acceptable, not high, but sufficiently suited to the genre of racing proposed by the title; moreover, there are no slowdowns of any kind. However, the feeling of being faced with a graphics engine not able to fully exploit the large resources of the machine remains, almost as if it were a slight upgrade of an 8-bit version. In fact, even the depth is poorly rendered, all the circuits are flat (without ascents or descents) and the curves all appear the same, as happens in titles of the genre for ~smooth~ GB. Finally, it can be noted that the color scale used is too reminiscent of the limited one of Mr GBC, demonstrating a chromatic narrowness devoted to realism, but too lackluster and in any case gloomy. An easy job The roar of the engines is quite realistic (but identical for all cars) as well as precise and functional in defining its speed. Other effects such as those of skids, braking and contacts are honest, but nothing more. Clearly it is always preferable to have a good pair of headphones rather than listening to the metallic croaking of the GBA loudspeaker. The music consists of a single, obvious, rock tune which, fortunately, we only find by browsing the menus and disappears when we get on the track. Let's see what's usually there Top Gear GT Championship immediately provides us with the Quick Race, the Championship and the Options. The latter concern a few but essential elements of the game, including the configuration of the keys and the management of the saves, as well as the choice of the unit of measurement for the speed. The Quick Start clearly allows you to choose a car, a circuit and immediately dive into the track for a race against the clock or against opponents controlled by the CPU. Through the Quick Start you can also access the multiplayer mode, with which up to 4 GBA users can challenge each other, provided they have a copy of the game each. Another Quick Start option is the circuit editor, through which we can indulge ourselves in creating the track of our dreams (proceeding in Championship mode, new track segments can be unlocked to use there). For the Quick Start races you can choose the weather conditions (sun or rain), set up the car correctly and choose the level of difficulty. This gradually increases with the three expected grades: easy, normal and hard. However, the feeling is that our adversaries drive on the rails, without the possibility of skidding or going off the track; in this way it is frustrating to compete, also because at our very first mistake we will instead be soundly punished. The Championship mode obviously constitutes the heart of the game: through ten seasons, of six races each, we will have to win the last class, the GT500, thus also ending the game. Before each race we will have to do a qualifying lap to get our best position on the grid. To win the championship it will be necessary to achieve the best possible results. Each race is held over the length of three laps, which are usually enough to jeopardize our good intentions and dreams of victory. When the machine is at the service of the machines This is because the game has a clear arcade setting (badly hidden behind poor simulation purposes), which seems to favor the opponents, always and in any case. Our car (of any type and class) always appears very heavy and having them run ogThe maneuver will be very tiring for us. It really seems that you can't make it slide on the asphalt and in any case, overall, the sensation of speed is rendered badly. Furthermore, the controls are not very efficient at carrying out their task, especially the use of R and L (to engage and downshift) is slow and imprecise in capturing our every pressure. Continuing on this same (sore) note, we can say that our opponents run on the tracks and that the different (unclear) parameters for setting the machine are just smoke and mirrors. Thus a depressing panorama emerges. Finally, inexplicably, with each of our victories we will suffer a handicap, corresponding to a ballast of many kilos, so that in the following race we will have even greater chances of defeat, all of this, obviously, to the advantage of frustration. The scandalous thing is that no matter how much we try to skid, our car will never lend itself to a spin (at most a little oversteer) or to any accident whatsoever, it is not even possible to race against the traffic or engage reverse , just as you cannot harm the car, all this, of course, in favor of ~realism~. Nonetheless, at our slightest mistake the game will punish us heavily, making us lose any hard-earned position, preventing us from any possible recovery. Then off-track exits are extremely dangerous: already on the curb the car tends to decelerate violently and getting out of the grass to regain the asphalt is always an exhausting operation, with the car that seems mysteriously attracted by that invisible wall that delimits our simulated world. Finally concluding This Top Gear (etc. etc.) soon shows its limits and its scarce simulation ambitions, awkwardly veiled behind a rough and naive arcade setting. Honestly, I early felt the need to abandon this game to personal oblivion; therefore also the longevity discourse is a subject subject to the subjective degree of endurance: in fact, it depends on how much one is able to tolerate certain oppressions that the game dispenses in large doses. A certain irritation persists in the undersigned at the memory of this playful experience. Pros: well reproduced car models many cars available... Cons: ...most of which to unlock ~recommended~ opponents too good mediocre technical realization A feeling of annoyance is generally felt when holding the GBA+TGGTC combo Good blood doesn't lie This Top Gear GT Championship (All Japan GT in the motherland) is the latest in a long series which, firmly rooted on the SNES via the N64, has always aroused conflicting opinions from the public. Contrasting opinions we said, for that fluctuating general quality that has always distinguished the series, either for a now mediocre now superfine technical realization, for an attention to detail between highs and lows, or for a driving approach when too devoted to the arcade, when instead very realistic and challenging. Clearly, the new episode developed for the Nintendo laptop could not betray its origins, albeit inheriting almost exclusively the worst characters. It should be noted that the game boasts the circuits and cars of the Japanese GT championship. I start by saying that initially I was favorably impressed by the presentation that the game launches when turned on (static, but nice, with a vague Namco aftertaste) and by the graphic style of the menus (sober, with a by now classic shape for the genre), as well as by the vastness of the same. Unfortunately, however, the first impact with the game in motion (see competition) was sufficient to dismantle my initial opinion. 10", "date": "2001-08-06", "grade": null}
