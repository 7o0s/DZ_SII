We are in fact talking about the new publisher GameTrust, born from an offshoot of a well-known chain of stores that sells video games, but above all of the famous Insomniac Games, authors of titles that need no introduction such as Ratchet & Clank, Spyro The Dragon, Resistance and the mistreated Sunset Overdrive. Unlike the large productions to which the Californian development house has accustomed us, Song of the Deep has the flavor of a high quality indie game, whose production values can be compared to those of Ubisoft's ~artisanal pearls~, such as Valiant Hearts and the fascinating Child of Light, with which it also shares some stylistic traits. The operation is also courageous for the genre chosen by the developers, namely that of the so-called ~metroidvania~, which today, unfortunately, does not have the same ascendancy as it once did on the majority of players, although it maintains a certain degree of interest among the more experienced ones . Released for a couple of days on PC and PlayStation 4 at a cost of around 15 Euros, we completed it in about eight hours without having collected all the collectibles and upgrades: here is the report of our exciting journey into the depths of the sea. Delicious style and an inspired soundtrack in Song of the Deep, the latest effort by Insomniac Games The courage of a daughter Merryn, the protagonist of the game, is a girl who lives alone with her fisherman father in a small house overlooking the deep blue. Every evening, the little girl awaits her parent's return on the highest rock with a lighted candle in her hand, a gesture of love that illuminates the way for the boat silhouetted on the horizon. The routine is abruptly interrupted when one day Merryn does not see his father return, and after waiting in vain all night with eyes swollen with tears, he falls asleep on the cliff and dreams of him: he is still alive but in serious danger. The girl immediately decides to act and with the tools available she builds a small submarine, with which, regardless of the dangers, she launches in search of the missing parent. This, broadly speaking, is the incipit of the Song of the Deep plot, which unfolds delicately thanks to fairy-tale illustrations and the story of the narrator, the player's faithful companion throughout the adventure. The story involves mysterious submerged civilizations and legendary marine creatures, details that influence the imaginative setting of the settings, although there are references to fauna and suggestive realistic ecosystems, such as kelp forests and the ever-present coral reefs. The player controls the small submarine driven by Merryn and at the beginning of the adventure he only has a simple retractable claw with which to interact with the environment and enemies, however, as he progresses, various fundamental upgrades are unlocked both to access new areas and to collect collectibles and treasures. Exploration, like any good self-respecting Metroidvania, represents the beating heart of the experience, and all the levels that make up the vast game map are connected to each other, even through portals. Backtracking is naturally present but is cleverly developed, prompting the player to retrace their steps if only to experiment with the new trinkets installed, which can be upgraded by spending the coins collected by an unlikely hermit crab Bernardo. In addition to the aforementioned magnetic grapple, which is very useful for attacking enemies and moving objects, there are also various types of torpedoes, more efficient propulsion systems, sonar and lighthouses that play a key role in solving environmental puzzles and puzzles, often based on physics involving barriers, sea currents, switches, levers and so on. If in the first part of the game they are well integrated into the exploration process, without affecting the taste for discovery and the pathos of the story, in the second part the difficulty level of the puzzles rises significantly and in some cases (rare, fortunately) the player's patience is severely tested, not so much for the complexity of the reasoning required, but for the cumbersome resolution method, which breaks the rhythm of the adventure. There is one in particular involving colored laser beams and mirrors that is bordering on frustrating. At some point in history our Merryn will also be inable to exit the submarine and swim in the narrowest coves, an aspect of the gameplay that further enriches the pleasure of discovery, catalyzed by the wonderful environments created by the artists of Insmoniac. The beauty of the exploratory phases is contrasted by the approximate combat system, not very stimulating also due to the lack of variety of enemies and rather scholastic attack patterns. The bestiary includes creatures inspired by jellyfish, anglerfish, sea anemones, crabs and nautiluses, all featuring a discreet design. Of course there are also bosses, but they are few and not particularly charismatic. The charm of the abyss To fully enjoy Song of the Deep, the use of the joypad is absolutely advisable, given that control via mouse and keyboard is far too cumbersome, especially when millimeter precision in movements is required. The submarine floats in the water with inertial motion, and while collisions with obstacles and walls are not a problem for the integrity of the hull, some puzzles involve the transport of dangerous mines, others require perfect timing to pass doors with timers, not forgetting the tiring ascents of the sea currents by clinging from handhold to handhold with the magnetic pliers. Interesting, but unfortunately little exploited, the use of lighthouses, necessary to dodge the jellyfish that prevent certain accesses and to unlock some treasures. Curiously, the precious sonar is discovered only in the final part of the game, and in addition to being indispensable in those stretches where visibility is impossible even with the lights on, it is essential for the recovery of all collectibles, given that it manages to reveal the secret passages among the elements of the scenario. The good variety of settings and the original characteristics of each of them, which mix both natural and artificial elements in a purely steampunk key, embellish the level design of the suggestive Insomniac work, whose artistic value is comparable to Ubisoft titles that show off the excellent engine UbiArt framework for 2.5D graphics, like the last two beautiful chapters of Rayman. The animations are also good, although there are some small bugs, such as the interpenetration of some enemies with the elements of the scenario and movements that are not always fluid. On PC, beyond resolution and V-Sync, there is no advanced graphics option, and curiously the minimum and recommended requirements are the same. Unfortunately, although with our test configuration the 60 frames per second are practically granite, with some hesitation detected only during saves, there is annoying stuttering, a phenomenon that could be mitigated with a patch or updated drivers. The audio sector is also excellent, thanks to the ~ambient~ soundtrack perfectly integrated with the marine context, the crystalline sound effects and the very good dubbing in English, subtitled in Italian.", "date": "2016-07-14", "grade": "7.8"}
