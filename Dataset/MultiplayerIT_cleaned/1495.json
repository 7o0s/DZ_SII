{"name": "Rainbow Six 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-3.html", "text": "Chi fa da se fa per tre... or not? Based on the game situations, we will have a series of directives available to be given, both with the pad and via the Xbox Communicator of the Xbox Live starter kit (or the customized version for Rainbow Six 3, sold with the game in a bundle created by Ubi Soft ), thanks to the support for voice recognition implemented by the programmers. Regarding this aspect, in the Italian version I encountered some problems in carrying out two specific commands to the team, namely ~Regroup~ and ~Move~, which must be correctly pronounced in English to be recognized, or instead of Move, I recommend using the default command Via via via or its English version go go go. For all other orders, however, the system recognition works without obvious problems and accepts even very Italianised pronunciations, provided that our English teacher does not hear us under penalty of failing any exam and being expelled from the course. Very useful is the Zulu command, which allows you to assign a series of actions to be performed in a delayed manner: only we will press the white button of the Gamepad, in this way it will be possible to carry out coordinated actions with our team even if you are in two different locations in the level. The selectable routines near a door, with various options available from the very trivial ~have a companion open the door~, up to those of assault, such as ~Blow up the door, throw a flashbang and clean up the area~. Rainbow Six presents, as per tradition, a truly wide range of weapons and equipment, from the precise pistol and ammunition fleet to the grenade launcher, through fragmentation grenades, plastic explosives or the very useful blinding ~Flash~. The design in the levels includes a great alternation of open spaces in villages or urban centers and completely internal sections, thus pushing for a double usable strategy setting, with particular attention to our physical health and that of the team, as there will be no medical kits scattered to collect to remedy difficult situations. For what remains perhaps the most critical aspect of any PC-Console port, especially in the field of Fps, or the precision in aiming, the programmers have used a system similar to the one present in Splinter Cell and Ghost Recon. A circular cursor that widens or shrinks according to our movements, covering a greater area when we are still, thus making it easier to shoot down the target. The control system is perfectly managed by the Xbox pad, which is confirmed as particularly suitable for this genre gaming, thanks to the precision of the analog sticks, combined with the generous amount of keys available. In Rainbow there are 3 difficulty levels that can be selected at the start of the campaign, which allow the game to be adapted to all types of users, at the Recruit level you can also venture into personal sorties, while at the Elite level you reach the true size of a Fps tactical like Rainbow Six. The artificial intelligence recreated in Rainbow Six is more than good, but not free from small imperfections, presenting situations in which terrorists and companions will act perfectly, with a high degree of realism such as seeing enemies seek shelter behind objects, or observe the movements of our team as it tries to cover the hot spots on the screen and other occasions where the AI could be much more efficient and better managed. Technically speaking Note of merit to Ubisoft for what concerns the implemented physics, partly derived from the experience made with Splinter Cell. The creation of movable surfaces, for example, such as tents, flags or ropes, partly exclusive for this title, or the use of the ~Rag-Doll~ applied to the various models, thanks to which not only the damage to an enemy will be localized, therefore a wound to the limbs will be less problematic than a fatal blow to the head, but the whole body will react based on the position where it was hit or where it is in the level: if we kill someone on a ledge, the body will fall in a completely natural way or it will slide down the stairs just like it would in the real world, adapting to the surface of the steps or walls. Even in the Rainbow graphics engine it does not disappoint expectations, representing a clear generational leap compared to Ghost Recon. The engine derived from the Unreal code is enriched by the dynamic lighting system seen in Splinter Cell. Although not representing the state of the art in its field, the technical aspect does not present particular gaps, solid frame rate at 30 frames per second, high resolution textures, with some rare exceptions, the already mentioned high quality, good video cleaning and use of various filters for night vision and thermal, combined with some new entries such as the effects produced by the blinding flashes, or by the particle cloud of smoke bombs that produce convincing results. Some reservations should be recorded only for some animations that are not exactly fluid. The sound department is promoted, with an excellent implementation of positional audio through Dolby Digital 5.1 and thanks to the quality of the reproduced sound effects. The choice of having the voices of our companions via the Xbox Communicator headset is much appreciated, provided it is connected to the pad, increasing the realism of the situation. Technically speaking Live experiences... As already mentioned, if Rainbow Six is an excellent choice as a single player game, for those looking for fun in multiplayer and especially online, the Ubi Soft game becomes a real Killer Application. In multiplayer, different options are possible, both in cooperative mode with three other players, and in direct confrontations with up to 16 supported players. The heaviness of the code for online play, present in ghost recon, then revised in its expansion Island of Thunder, has been further modified. Rainbow Six proves to be less bandwidth intensive than its predecessors with tangible results for all users. Obviously, there is the possibility of taking advantage of additional downloads via Xbox Live in the future, such as new levels or equipment, and the discounted voice support to talk to other players. Also present is the so-called Live Aware, or the possibility of always being connected to Xbox Live even when you are playing a mission offline: in this way, if a user in your friends list connects to Xbox Live, he can send you an invitation online. Technically speaking Comment Ubisoft with Rainbow Six 3 brings one of the most popular series in the PC world to Xbox, and it does so with excellent results. RS3 does not present significant defects in any of its aspects, the game maintains all the expectations it carried on its shoulders, representing in fact one of the best titles available for Xbox Live and a valid offline product. The graphic aspect is not the top of the whole Xbox lineup, and there are some small imperfections in the Artificial Intelligence of enemies and the strike team, or in the voice recognition of certain commands, but none of these manage to compromise the high quality of the game, which is unreservedly promoted. With regard to Rainbox Six 3 and Xbox Live, we remind you that an offer is currently active for those who want to subscribe to the Multiplayer.it Premium Gold service which provides an annual subscription + 1 Xbox Live kit for only 49.90! (More information) Pros: Killer application on Live Good technical realization Addictive gameplay Cons: Speech recognition not foolproof Small gaps in the AI After Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell, here is the third exponent of the Tom Clancy series arriving on Xbox: Rainbow Six 3 is now also available in Italian stores and, like its brothers before it, it will certainly not go unnoticed. In the game we take on the role of Domingo ~Ding~ Chavez, commander of a task force made up of three of the best elements of the Rainbow Six group, ready to eliminate every terrorist threat typical of the settings created by Tom Clancy. If Splinter Cell was designed for single player action and Ghost Recon strongly marked by pure multiplayer, which is also demonstrated by its great success on Xbox Live, in Rainbow Six 3 we are faced with an even more complete and homogeneous product, which manages to combine an excellent Offline section, surpassing itself in the multiplayer version and placing itself at the top of the Xbox Live lineup. The main mode, the classic Campaign, is made up of 14 missions to be completed in their various objectives and, unlike Ghost Recon, you will not be able to change characters during the course of the missions, thus remaining linked to Ding. One of the most appreciated features of Rainbow Six is the tactical and reasoned setting of the action, totally different from normal First Person Shooters, in which you throw yourself into the assault, basing everything on shooting accuracy and your own reflexes. Completing the missions without the help of our companions is probably possibleile, but enormously more complicated, and all the various actions can be carried out, under our command, also by the other operative agents.", "date": "2003-11-10", "grade": null}
