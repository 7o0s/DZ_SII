{"name": "Black Desert Mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/black-desert-mobile-la-recensione.html", "text": "We are now used to seeing the games that we least expected to see proliferate on these platforms transposed into a mobile version, so it is not surprising that we are faced with a review of Black Desert Mobile. The game in question, developed by the Korean team Pearl Abyss, represents one of the best known and most played MMORPGs of the moment, beyond the historical titles, and although it is a genre that does not seem much suited to a portable reduction, the operation is occurred with some success. On the other hand, especially in the Asian area, there is an evident tendency to transpose to mobile platforms games that meet great success on PC, regardless of how complex the fruition may seem. The result are bizarre paradoxes such as the fact that these titles are often played in mobile versions on PCs through systems such as BlueStacks, taking advantage of their being free-to-play and the additional advantage given by using a mouse and keyboard in front of a already simplified interface of its own. After seeing the mobile conversions of Lineage 2 and PUBG, a portable equivalent of Black Desert was at least due, considering the success of the game in recent years. It must be said that, although it is not really a conversion but a general readaptation, Black Desert Mobile manages to re-propose the characterizing elements of the original in a small way, which have decreed its success on the major platforms. First of all the combat system, particularly dynamic and action compared to the standards of the genre, but also the quantity of interpretable classes (although linked to the gender of the character), the diversity of the settings and the quantity of secondary and collateral activities that can be carried out all inside the game world, beyond the typical quests and fights. All these characteristics are found in large part within Black Desert Mobile, only that obviously the distortions typical of these operations must also be taken into consideration: the awkward interface, the automation of the gameplay, the heaviness of the graphics on less handsome and an inevitable trend towards pay to win. In the end the balance is not disastrous but the negative elements rather hold back the potential of Black Desert Mobile. An MMORPG in your pocket The first thing to strike is the character editor, which proposes the incredible completeness and quality of the one seen in the PC version, being able to act on practically every possible aesthetic parameter. The classes, as we have said, are linked to the gender of the character, therefore the choices on this front are limited and in general you have to work a little to be able to obtain truly original and different results from the presets, however even with little effort it is possible to get something pleasant, as long as you appreciate the graphic style with a rather oriental taste. The complexity of the world reproduced in 3D is impressive, perhaps even exaggerated: the amount of elements displayed puts a strain on mobile hardware and often forces you to act on the settings to reduce detail and resolution but clipping and pop-ups are a constant risk. A problem with the graphics is given by the dynamic modification of the level of detail and resolution which takes place by enlarging the shot, so when a greater quantity of elements appear on the screen everything becomes a bit confused and muddy, with evident aliasing, while with the very close shot shows a much better image quality, but with such a camera (which moreover does not rotate automatically in a logical way) it becomes really difficult to play. In short, from a technical point of view we are facing an admirable game in terms of the scale of the world represented and the detail staged, but also problematic due to its difficult management by portable hardware and for a choice of graphic filters and effects that tend to weigh down the image too much and also make it difficult to interpret. The latter aspect is evident during the fights, when the effects of the blows and special abilities practically cover what is happening around the character. From a gameplay point of view, Black Desert Mobile follows the excellent characteristics of its older brother, offering a good variety of quests and alternative activities, as well as a rather fun dynamic combat system, even if here it is a bit battered by the aforementioned problems of visualization and from a control system that with the touch screen is obviously not at the levels of controllers or mouse and keyboard. Of course, extremely careful design cannot be expected in such a gameto for each quest and in most cases these are limited to being simple actions depending on the grinding, but the activities to be carried out are still so many as to make it difficult to get bored, at least in the early hours. Those who want to devote themselves to Black Desert Mobile obviously approach the game in a different way from the standard player: in an MMORPG of this type grinding is a natural element and therefore the presence of autoplay also makes sense, which in fact allows you to complete quests automatically without ever having to intervene in the game. Such an option seems aberrant for the standard player, but it is actually useful for those who intend to ~make a career~ in the world of Black Desert. From this point of view, there is also a certain amount of pay to win, an inevitable implication in a title of this size but distributed as free-to-play: the game offers two different types of subscription capable of providing materials and game content that guarantees constant progression, but with an expense that becomes considerable. However, the game hardly faces blocks to be removed only through micro-transactions, therefore the spendthrift approach depends above all on the player's propensity.", "date": "2019-12-19", "grade": "7.0"}
