The classic SEGA, released in 1992 on the Mega Drive, put us in command of a dolphin, in fact, in a context that today we could define as ~metroidvania~: an adventure with many places to discover, skills to unlock and an ecological message at the basis of everything. Good: replace the protagonist with a paper shark, simplify the gameplay and you will get Derrick the Deathfin, the aquatic action game developed by Different Tuna which made its debut on iOS and Android a few years after its release on PC and Playstation 3. Driven by the desire for revenge against evil humans, guilty of having installed huge drills and platforms that literally ~suck~ marine predators to produce canned fish, Derrick finds himself facing over thirty levels, set within four different continents , to achieve its goal and free the oceans from the infesting presence of man. How? Using its huge jaws, of course, and trying to overcome increasingly complex routes without dying of hunger, using a series of prey and even fishermen and swimmers as a snack to reload the bar located at the top of the screen, which decreases inexorably with spend some time.

Yellow fins There are stages in Derrick the Deathfin that allow for a minimum of exploration, although the countdown represented by the health bar greatly limits this aspect of the experience; and others where there's really no time to do anything, set up as real breakneck racing to the finish line. In the meantime it is possible to use the shot to take spectacular leaps out of the water, collect collectibles, continue to massacre anything that is within reach of fangs and thus complete missions that generally turn out to be very short. Things get a little bit interesting during the final puzzles to move on to the next continent, but not even that much: in the DNA of the Different Tuna production there is simplicity, and everything seems to reflect this vocation. It's a pity, because from a stylistic point of view the graphic device of the paper models is very nice to see (someone, a year after the debut of Derrick the Deathfin, built a fairly important franchise on them), the scenarios are well differentiated, the hip-hop style soundtrack is engaging and the basic concept certainly has great potential. To cut off his legs, in addition to the aforementioned poor consistency of the gameplay, there are unfortunately touch controls implemented in a non-impeccable way, which make the left thumb slide along the screen during the most agitated phases, forcing us to reposition it in order to continue. Of course, it must also be said that those looking for a relaxing and colorful pastime will find bread for their teeth in this title, without having to worry about microtransactions and freemium mechanisms: once the 3.49 euros have been paid on the App Store (3. 39 on Google Play), the game requires nothing else.", "date": "2017-12-23", "grade": "7.0"}
