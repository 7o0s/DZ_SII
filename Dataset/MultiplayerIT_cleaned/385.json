{"name": "Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Warlords - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sid-meiers-civilization-iv-warlords-recensione.html", "text": "More nations on the plate of history As regards the first aspect, the already large list of historical leaders has been expanding with ten new characters. Some of these belong to cultures already present (this is the case of Caesar Augustus for the Romans), while others bring with them completely new civilizations (Ragnar is the head of the Celts), each of which with a characteristic graphic aspect and sound pattern. The special units that distinguish each nation are now joined by unique buildings, and three great wonders have also been added. Clearly these are further opportunities to create a competitive advantage over your opponents: the most spectacular new entry is the Wall of China which allows you to reduce barbarian incursions to zero in all the cities on the same continent in which it was built. Total war However, the greatest efforts are highlighted during the game: with Warlords even the most avid warmongers are finally taken into consideration. In the original game, in fact, the practice of war had been set aside to the detriment of more diplomatic and/or scientific research-oriented game conduct. Things change now with the addition of Great Generals and with vassal states. The first are characters who can join the city and thus provide all the new armies with additional experience points, or hook up to pre-existing military units, giving extraordinary modifiers and enhancing the single troop as never before. Like true leaders, their descent into the field must be carefully planned considering the difficulty in obtaining them. While the advent of other great characters, such as engineers or prophets, depends on the presence or absence of specific buildings in the city or on the form of government adopted, in order for Vercingetorix to be born in one of the empire's ~polis~ it is essential that the experience accumulated by the various war units reaches certain levels. This translates into the need, for those wishing to make intensive use of it and thus fully enjoy the benefits it brings, to pick a fight with the first unfortunate person who comes within range. Ask for mercy Military dominance can finally have serious psychological consequences on other civilizations: some will continue to behave as before, needlessly asking for a truce even in the face of the overwhelming enemy advance on the edge of the capital; others will more intelligently prefer to capitulate. In doing so they will lose any political power and will become totally slaves of the player who managed to subjugate them. In still other cases it will be possible to subject, not necessarily with war, the states that recognize the superiority of their own and ask to join them as vassals in exchange for protection. This brings benefits since it will be possible to share technologies and resources with them, but also costs, in terms of gold, to be incurred. Naturally, the subjugated cities must be defended from possible enemy threats, otherwise the vassalage will be cancelled. The ideal ground for testing the innovations introduced and illustrated so far are the six scenarios that accompany the expansion. Those who want to continue to dominate the earth from the ice age to the conquest of space will probably be disappointed: it is true, there are new enemies to deal with, but nothing more. The situations that are created with the pre-packaged maps and which also substantially modify the classic Civilization game scheme are much more interesting. Some of the most important historical moments of humanity are taken into consideration: the apogee of Alexander the Great is the scenario that requires the most unscrupulous approach given that one must expand eastward in a few turns. The unification of China is somewhat reminiscent of that of Shogun: Total War in which to win you have to bring most of the houses to an agreement with more or less orthodox methods. There are also Vikings and Genghis Khan; however, more modern settings are missing. Barbarically funny Finally, a gem that everyone would have liked to have already been present in the original game, namely the possibility of leading the barbarians. In this mode the different civilizations are controlled by the CPU, while the player has the task of attacking the cities and looting as much as possible, without being able to create population centers. Each looted building rewards gold with which to replenish the ranks of the army. Fun. Technical notes The master release under test suffers from a particularly annoying sound bug which manifests itself in the advanced stages of the game in the form of loud and sudden explosions. Firaxis advises in the technical notes, waiting for the imminent patch, to avoid the use of the EAX libraries in favor of the Miles ones. Finally, remember that Warlards is not stand-alone, so it requires the full game already installed. In conclusion Warlords refines the original title without making substantial changes and succeeds perfectly in the difficult task required of an add-on - that of keeping the fun of a cornerstone like Civ unchanged while offering something new. Considerations Civilization IV: Warlords is a must buy for fans of the Sid Meier saga and for those who want to try new game tactics after having managed to dominate planet Earth several times. Several modifications to the game structure change the approach to the game and impose otherwise little-used strategies. Unfortunately, however, everything is confined to pre-packaged scenarios and to those that can be created ad hoc with the new toolsets made available. Those who, on the other hand, are a lover of the ~usual~ rise to power over the millennia might be disappointed by the low weight that the improvements bring to the standard maps. Pros The new scenarios are interesting It becomes impossible to detach from them Guaranteed longevity Cons A few nasty bugs The changes could have been felt more even in the classic scenarios Months after its release, the success of Civilization IV shows no sign of diminishing. The magical alchemical formula retouched by master Sid Meier for the fourth evolution of the title that made it legendary did not seem to need further corrections, but Warlords proves that there is no limit to the best. It is good to state right away that from a technical point of view there are no changes of any kind: the graphics engine is still that of Pirates! properly updated to the latest patch. The fronts on which the attention of the designers have focused are therefore basically two: the addition of new updates and the wartime reinterpretation of the style of play.
