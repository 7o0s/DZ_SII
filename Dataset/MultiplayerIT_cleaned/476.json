{"name": "Heroes of Might and Magic V - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heroes-of-might-and-magic-v-recensione.html", "text": "Resurrected We have already done two hands-on of Heroes (which you can read here and here) from which we have drawn good impressions that had led us to positively unbalance the final results of the product (although some doubts remained). Finally getting our hands on the definitive version has allowed us to play it for a long time, testing its strategic qualities, and the chances of entering the hearts of those who were waiting for a great return of a title that made history. From the main menu it is possible to choose whether to take part in the campaigns (six in all, each consisting of 5 missions for a total of 30), whether to face a single scenario or whether to play in multiplayer. Obviously the first option is the one on which the greatest attention is focused, representing the playful core of the game. Grilled meat The six campaigns revolve around the six selectable factions and all follow the same narrative thread that develops linearly. Between one mission and another and in the midst of the same missions, some discreet film sequences, created with the game's graphics engine, tell the different events and give meaning to the different objectives that must be pursued. Obviously, in a strategic one, the narrative side, although not secondary to guaranteeing a prolonged interest, would not make sense if it did not frame a deep and structured gameplay, capable of capturing the player for hours. From this point of view HOM&MV is a real drug. Once you understand how the various interface commands work, you can't help but play grinding missions after missions and mentally pronouncing the fateful phrase ~another shift and then I'll stop~ (and five in the morning arrived, with the editor now capable only of yawning continuously, while he continued to look at the monitor with two eyes that would have intimidated Dario Argento who has never spent the night in his underwear playing some video game? Some longtime gamers will surely remember the Civilization syndrome well times). There are many things to do and, after all, although there are no big news compared to the other noble exponents of the genre, taking a hero's sewer and turning it into a war machine capable of dramatically enhancing one's army always has a certain charm. you can't help but play grinding missions after missions and mentally pronouncing the fateful phrase ~another round and then I'll stop~ Grilled meat The scenarios are littered with objects and sites to visit, left free or protected by groups of more or less powerful enemies. The mission scheme is generally rather obvious: given or conquered a city, you must collect enough resources in order to afford the best buildings that allow you to hire the most powerful troops, with which to set off to conquer the world (just to simplify). Although this structural plot is the rule, there will be some nice variations on the theme (like a sort of tag-team between heroes, just to give an example) that will vary the action and keep the interest alive. Grilled meat Troops can be obtained in various ways: either by producing them in the city, by buying them in some sites (different according to the type of troop and the species they belong to) or by recruiting those scattered around the map (obviously they must be well disposed towards you... if you are of elves and try to recruit undead you will only get yet another bloodshed). Each troop has two levels (the transition from first to second is possible by training them in cities, but only if you have built the right building; otherwise you can find the right building on the map even if it's a rather expensive solution) and specific characteristics that make it more or less effective during battles (for example, archers are very useful in sieges, where the city walls prevent the advance of troops). Assembling and managing a large army will be necessary to successfully conclude most of the missions which, more often than not, end with pitched battles against very fierce opponents. On the guts and around The most important phase of HOM&M V is, of course, that of combat. This takes place on a chessboard where troop morale and other factors of a different nature determine the order of action. After placing your military forces on the field, in the so-called strategic phase, the actual combat begins in which you have to study the battlefield and the conformation of the two armies, to understand how to move (each troop has different movement values , attack and defense it would have been appreciated, in this sense, that the manualof the game deepened the matter a bit... but we were not satisfied). The hero, unlike in other strategic games, is important and powerful, but essentially plays a support role (with spells or special abilities) and is not very effective in combat (especially against large armies). This makes it impossible to always and only win because you have a kind of divinity capable of wiping out everything and everyone (as happens in other series) and the need to learn how to best manage the army you have available ( in addition to the spells and abilities mentioned above). [C] The scenarios are beautiful but often very intricate A battlefield with troops deployed Will he make it? our little dog to get the better of the colossal enemies? [/C] The system is immediately understandable and pleasant, never becoming heavy and guaranteeing a certain tension, especially in larger clashes where every move can lead to a waste of troops which can prove lethal for the economy of the battle (l artificial intelligence of virtual opponents is very fierce and knows how to move, although some ingenuity is still present). The problems of HOM&M V begin to emerge when one realizes that, in addition to the campaigns, there is little else. It is true that the missions last a long time (some even several hours of play) and that the difficulty is set upwards so as to make the challenge intense even when playing at the ~normal~ level (the lowest one). It is also true that there is an apparently rather neat multiplayer mode. But Does it just glitter? the scenario missions are few and the just mentioned online mode is really too buggy to be fun (however interesting is the introduction of the ~ghost~, which allows the player not to get bored who is waiting for the opponents' turn to end, keeping him actively engaged), there are only six factions (in the past chapters there were at least two more) and, moreover, an editor that allows you to create your own maps is missing. in short, the net gain in visual beauty has led to barbarism in camera management which is uncomfortable and sometimes inadequate for following the action Does it just glitter? The biggest flaw, however, leads us to talk about the technical aspect. The transition from 2D to 3D has paid off from the point of view of visual beauty (the three-dimensional models are excellently made, as are the special effects and the various elements that make up the maps... a note of merit also goes to the skilful and fascinating use of color palette) but made the scenarios quite confusing. In short, you can rotate and zoom the camera as you like, but you are not always able to see some details, perhaps hidden behind some other object (how many resources the beautiful and luxuriant vegetation made us lose). Often you find yourself having to necessarily rotate the view to be able to click on the point you want to reach and, during the fighting, some troops risk ending up off the screen forcing the player to continuously ~search~ for the optimal framing, to manage the situation. In short, the net gain in visual beauty has led to barbarism in the management of the camera which is uncomfortable and at times inadequate for following the action, with moments in which the automatic shots (during fights) are incorrect and show a void, while the action takes place somewhere else. Of course, we are always talking about a turn-based strategy and there is no shortage of time to examine the situation (we will not bury the game for this). A separate mention, and applause, deserve the splendid music that accompanies the action. HOM&MV features one of the most beautiful soundtracks heard lately. Apart from the sound effects (since the advent of samplers, it's first to talk about them only when they are bad), the music is small masterpieces that deserve to be heard and give an extra touch to the game. Hardware boxes Heroes of Might and Magic V requires a 1.5 GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM and a 64 MB DirectX 9 compatible 3D card. turn-based nature of the title, allows you to fully enjoy it even without maximum fluidity. To get the best, bring the processor to 2.4 GHz, the RAM to 1 GB and equip yourself with a latest or penultimate generation video card (both ATi and NVIDIA). Tested on a 3.4GHz P4 with 2Gb of RAM and a GeForce 7800 GT video card, the game gave no problems and was smooth and stable. Final comment Heroes of Might and Magic V is a good comeback which, however, deserves some ear-pulling. It would bait took little time to make it a masterpiece at the level of the third episode: a few more scenarios, fewer bugs in the multiplayer, less confusing camera management all elements that weigh on the final judgment. Having said that though, there is no doubt that the game manages to entertain and glue to the screen. Definitely a product to try if you are passionate about the genre or if you want to try something different. Pros Beautiful and long-lived campaigns Original multiplayer for the genre Excellent from a technical point of view Cons Multiplayer buggy The management of the camera can be significantly improved You feel the lack of something more (individual scenarios, an editor, at least a couple of factions). Resurrected There has been a lot of talk about this game, since the announcement of the acquisition of the rights to the Might and Magic brand by Ubisoft. The death of 3DO had left many fans waiting for someone to save the two historical series: Might and Magic (RPG series, arrived at the ninth, ugly, episode) and Heroes of Might and Magic (turn-based strategy series you are reading about the review of the fifth episode). For now, very little is known about a resurrection of the first while the second has been entrusted to a software house specialized in strategy, Nival Interactive, already behind the Blitzkrieg, Silent Storm and another series of fantasy turn-based strategy games that owes a lot to the Heroes: the two Etherlords. The premises for success are all there, given the experience in the field and the use of a cutting-edge graphics engine that allows a splendid 3D representation of the game world, which is rare in a genre strongly rooted in 2D. Will the developers have managed to bring the series back to the glories of the second and third episodes? Yes and no.", "date": "2006-06-05", "grade": null}
