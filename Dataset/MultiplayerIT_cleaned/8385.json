The reasons must probably be sought in the characteristic features of this new spin-off of Nintendo's most profitable franchise. If you know Nobunaga's Ambition, well, congratulations, you are truly classy gamers. The strategic series Koei is not very famous in the West and when a crossover with Pokmon was first announced, many thought it was a joke. Instead it was all true. Bizarre, this choice by Nintendo, also because the two franchises have decidedly nothing in common; the result, on the other hand, exceeds our wildest expectations: it is a real shame, therefore, that Pokmon Conquest comes out so quietly, badly publicized and, moreover, without an Italian adaptation, a truly incomprehensible choice that goes hand in hand with that of not localising Kingdom Hearts 3D for Nintendo 3DS. Can I make war on you? In reality, the absence of localization shouldn't scare non-English speakers: the plot in Pokmon Conquest is really narrow, practically even less present than in the other video games in the series. Set in the kingdom of Ransei, a sort of feudal Japan, the story sees us in the role of a young warrior (or female warrior) committed to thwarting the plans of the ambitious and ruthless Nobunaga Oda. The myth tells that whoever manages to control all seventeen kingdoms of Ransei, will be able to summon a legendary pokmon with extraordinary powers. All you have to do is beat Nobunaga to the punch, conquering Ransei and restoring peace to the world. Or something like that. The plot is actually not that clear, told as it is through illustrations and short well-written dialogues but with somewhat insane content. Clearly, don't expect a serious story: the lords you will drive out of their castles will leave without batting an eyelid, others will decide to train to become stronger, some will join you because you're funny... In short, the graphic characterization of the characters is very pleasant but the psychological one leaves much to be desired, moreover we are talking about historical figures who really existed such as Nobunaga, in fact, but also Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Ieyasu Tokugawa and many other famous faces for those who have played at least one Dynasty Warriors. As usual, therefore, it is the gameplay that dominates, the story instead is a mere pretext to put you in command of a small army formed by your companions and their respective pokmon: you will have to face turn-based battles on an isometric battlefield , a bit like in other RPGs of this genre, Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre above all. With them, Pokmon Conquest also shares a colorful map in which to move by selecting one location at a time: there you can hunt down new pokmon, recruit new characters and micro-manage the defense of the castle in anticipation of any enemy attacks. To tell the truth, however, the actual combat system is disarmingly simple, at times even a little too much. pokemon tactics On the field, you can field a team that has not yet performed any action in the same virtual month of the game: six characters at most, and their respective pokmon. That of the calendar is a bit annoying, to tell the truth: it forces the player to struggle with the disposition of the troops after each battle, a pity that when you manage dozens of characters it becomes more frustrating than fun. When its turn comes, each little creature can be moved within its range; the aim of course is to get close to the enemy pokmon to attack them until their vital energy is exhausted. Each pokmon has a single ability, borrowed directly from the mother series, and in fact what really matters in the fights is the element of the creatures: Pokmon Conquest is also based above all on the infamous Chinese morra of the elements, so that the pokmon of fire are more effective against grass ones, grass ones against lightning ones, and so on. Basically this is the central strategic element of the gameplay, even more than the choice of characters or pokmon associated with them; however, each of the two hundred warlords that you can recruit corresponds to a precise pokmon with which to establish a perfect connection, allowing the evolution not only of the little creature, as per tradition, but also of its own master: at that point it will change the shape and attack of the pokmon, which is a bit frustrating since the game does not allow any kind of control over the creatures' moves, often involving significant changes that completely alter our tactics, forcinggoing to look for new units for our platoon. In short, there is no lack of the classic ~catch them all~ component, which however is made much simpler by the requirements required to recruit a warrior or capture a pokmon. The real strategy, if anything, is to be found in the special skills of each warrior, usable once in battle but extremely powerful, and in the possibility of turning the traps present in each map against our enemies. This is one of the most interesting features of Pokmon Conquest: each map has obstacles and traps that alter the layout or risk overturning the outcome of the battle if used cleverly, especially when the battle requires you to perform particular actions, such as conquering a certain number of squares, rather than defeating each enemy. A strategy for all The first game sessions may also appear a bit boring, especially given the ease of the clashes and the superficiality of the plot, but as the hours go by, you realize how much content has been compressed into this cartridge. Mind you, we are not talking about who knows what variety since from the first to the last minute you will only fight and increase the experience of the little monsters, but some of the advanced missions offer some really ingenious challenges, especially when you complete the main campaign in about fifteen hours and more than twenty additional missions are unlocked, focused on the various supporting characters of the story. At that point, Pokmon Conquest takes the form of a real strategic and the choice of the right element is no longer so important: it becomes essential to choose the pokmon with the correct skills and range, the best equipped items, the most intense connections between creatures and followers... In short, even the most experienced strategists will find the structure conceived by Koei interesting, although certainly simplified to meet the lower age groups. There's a little something for everyone: recruiting all the characters and capturing every pokmon, including the legendary ones, guarantees the typical, high longevity to which the franchise has accustomed us. The technical sector is also pleasant: it is not particularly amazing but it makes an impression thanks to a nice character design and a fair amount of colorful and detailed scenarios. The real protagonists, as always, are the pokmon: their tiny sprites are cared for and animated more than well for being a handful of pixels. However, Pokmon Conquest cannot fail to appear as a somewhat outdated product, especially when compared to the latest iterations of the mother series. The soundtrack is also of good quality: the songs, medieval and particularly Japanese, are a pleasant accompaniment, but those who hoped for the ~voices~ of pokmon will once again find themselves in the presence of the usual 8-bit screeches, now officially unbearable.", "date": "2012-08-07", "grade": "8.4"}
