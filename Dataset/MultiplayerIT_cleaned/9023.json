In essence we are faced, in all probability, with the best episode of the historic series originally created by Midway. Today it is Electronic Arts that takes over NBA Jam, specifically the EA Canada section, historic software house author of countless sports games such as FIFA, NBA Live, NHL, SSX and many others. The experience in the field therefore could not be better, the curriculum is undoubtedly the best in the world. This ~On Fire~ version comes from the ashes of the reboot of the series that took place in 2010 with the ~boxed~ versions of the new NBA Jam. Due to excessive price and out of position, the title did not have the desired success. NBA Jam: on Fire is back at a fair price (1200 Microsoft Points) and a series of improvements and additions, with the promise of regaining lost fans but also a new and richer audience. Rather than updating the rosters and re-proposing the game in digital delivery, EA Canada has thought of a whole series of filings and a more balanced and fun gameplay: in short, they have practically rewritten the game. The tastiest novelty is certainly the introduction of the ~Team Fire~, which can be activated only after having ringed three alley-oops, whose difference compared to the very classic solitaire ~Fire~ is obviously that in this case both players on the parquet enjoy the fiery power ups: super dunks, unlimited turbo, crazy baskets galore for a handful of seconds that will drive your opponents crazy. Other additions to the gameplay are certainly more subtle, but still welcome: it is now possible to use the pivot foot to make defending opponents lose their balance, and then launch ourselves for a basket or perform a backward fade-shoot, or a shot from three. There is also a key to directly call our partner's assist, and another to switch from one player to another, without necessarily getting stuck on one. The latter is a great possibility because it opens up new scenarios to the gameplay itself: it is therefore possible to call a halley-oop and then go and execute it, or defend more effectively by controlling both players on the field, even if one at a time. This is all called ~Tag Mode~. Xbox 360 goals Like any game on Xbox Live, NBA Jam: on Fire also promises 200 unlockable points, through 12 objectives almost entirely dedicated to obtaining medals (gold, silver, bronze) and reaching particular levels or challenges. By simply continuing in the single player you will get the entire loot in a very short time and with not much effort, without having to perform incredible moves or do particular semi-impossible actions. BoomShakalaka! EA Canada's efforts have been aimed entirely at the heart of NBA Jam: the new ~On Fire~ is in fact conceived and developed entirely on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, thus completely detaching itself from the 2010 episode which was a conversion from Nintendo Wii. So off all the ~extras~ basketball: Mario Kart style power-ups, ~boss~ fights, half-court matches and so on. NBA Jam: on Fire is the classic NBA Jam but with super detailed graphics, updated rosters, legendary players from the past, new modes and a refined and reworked gameplay (for the better): in short, a super NBA Jam. There is also a new career mode in the game which sees us engaged in climbing through six divisions, facing the ~bronze~, ~silver~ and ~gold~ challenges game after game which become increasingly difficult and demanding. gold challenges lead to platinum ones, where special and fearsome ~Jambots~ face us by copying our moves and the specials we perform in the game. Electronic Arts has used (the now) famous R.E.A.L. TO THE. developed for Fight Night which - theoretically - would be able to replicate human speed and intelligence in making quick and right decisions. Therefore, if we don't have a worthy companion to challenge, or if we don't find anyone available online, we can always count on a respectable artificial intelligence. The new animations are enhanced by the amount of ~Razzle Dazzle~ moves (in bow tie language), or a whole series of ~teases~ against the opponents that will put more than a smile on our faces. The graphics are always colorful and fun, with a more unique than rare style, halfway between the realistic aspect of the players and a cartoon. The many details aboutscreen frame a realization without flaws or defects. The game does not slow down and runs smoothly with its beautiful animations, even if the polygonal mass on the screen is positioned on the average of digital delivery productions. NBA Jam: on Fire is also nice to hear, though: the classic historical expressions are always present and the host constantly shouts ~BoomShakalaka!~ or ~He's heating up!~ among the excited and cheering crowd. Electronic Arts has announced that there will be some extra selectable teams, namely those who attended the last Final Four: Panathinaikos, Montepaschi Siena, Maccabi Tel Aviv and Real Madrid. As for the players available, we will have Sergio Llull and Carlos Suarez from Real Madrid, Dimitris Diamantidis and Mike Batiste from Panathinaikos, Bo McCalebb and Ksistof Lavrinovic from Montepaschi Siena, and finally Lior Eliyahu and Sofoklis Schortsanitis from Maccabi Tel Aviv. NBA Jam: on Fire Edition is available both on Xbox Live Marketplace for 1200 points and on PSN for 14.99 Euros for a download of 851.53 MB, a fairly heavy file due to the large amount of ~spoken~.
