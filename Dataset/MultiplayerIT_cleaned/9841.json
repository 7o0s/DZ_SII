With the SimCity series, Maxis has been providing us with its own interpretation of the thing for almost twenty years now, renewing scenarios, mechanics and methods from time to time to meet even the most demanding gamers. The game, one of the most famous managerial games of all time, sees us take on the role of the mayor of a city that in practice must be ~founded~ and followed over the years, with the aim of combining income and expenses in the interest of citizens . The first episode, converted for iPhone and iPod Touch two years ago, on the one hand presented itself as a fresh and interesting product, especially given the mobile context; on the other, it suffered from a control system that was not optimized to the fullest. Now comes SimCity Deluxe, a more or less faithful conversion of SimCity 4, which allows us to create a city from scratch by defining its characteristics (dimensions, degree of difficulty, etc.) or to try our hand at a series of pre-set scenarios. The aim of the game is always the same: to administer in a winning way, finding the right balance between the inevitable demands of the population and the accounts at the end of the month. Retrieve the tricolor band from the drawer, therefore, and let's see in detail what the new EA title offers us. Five years of good governance, dude We have already mentioned the game modes available: on the one hand it is possible to create a new city from scratch and follow its development over the decades, on the other hand you can measure yourself against a series of more or less complex scenarios, in which you have to changes in account management and infrastructure to put things in order. The SimCity Deluxe tutorial is unfortunately very meager and provides us with just a few notions to start with, so those who don't already know the Maxis series could find themselves in a bit of trouble. The first city created is therefore valid as a ~test ride~ to experiment and understand the meaning of each individual icon, given that the commands are quite numerous and there is no context menu that explains their functions. Having made some decisions regarding the degree of difficulty, any concessions and the size of the gathering, we set off: firstly, a network of streets must be created, secondly, the spaces relating to residential, commercial and industrial areas must be assigned, then passes to the connection of the water and the electric line, with the relative pipes. The upper part of the touch screen presents the icons that allow us to manage the income and expenses of our administration, on the right there is an indicator of the quality of life and at the bottom the commands that allow us to stop the passage of time or make it advance faster. As the months roll by and the seasons roll by, ~news~-style subtitles scroll across the screen reporting what's happening in the city. Do citizens feel unsafe? It's time to build a police station. Are the roads full of potholes? Better to increase the budget dedicated to their maintenance. Is industrial development behind expectations? A tax cut could incentivize that. Ultimately, SimCity does not set us a specific goal to achieve, but provides us with the most complete management freedom possible, warning us when we are too indebted and providing us with a series of consultants able to suggest the best strategy for solving our problems . Unfortunately, the problems that afflicted the debut of the series on the iPhone and iPod Touch have not been resolved: in the face of a good technical realization, which however suffers greatly from the management of an increasingly dense and detailed two-dimensional scenario (see the rendering of the buildings when we zoom in), in fact we have a truly cumbersome and inelastic control system, completely out of place on a small touch screen. The flaws are noticed immediately, unfortunately, and accompany our matches undermining the quality of the experience, although at a certain point it is possible to get used to it.
