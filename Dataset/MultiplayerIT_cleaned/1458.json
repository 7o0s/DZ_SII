{"name": "Secret Weapons Over Normandy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/secret-weapons-over-normandy.html", "text": "I've got all my life to live The re-enactment of such important events for the history of humanity is always a very delicate topic, especially if they are recent like those treated in this LucasArts production. Secret Weapons Over Normandy plays the player in the role of an American aviator, such James Chase, who after making a fine show of himself is recruited by the legendary Battlehawks, the secret anti-Nazi battalion par excellence. Chase will be catapulted to every corner of the planet, taking part in some of the most epic missions of the entire world war. In this regard, the choice adopted by the coders to make the player participate in every development through films that smell so much of an old documentary is excellent. Alternating comments with photos with a damned old-fashioned flavor, the narrative plot of the game will culminate in the reading of the diary of the protagonist who, between impressions and emotions, will describe the war from a subjective point of view, further penetrating the player into the part. Aircraft and Armaments One of the most appetizing peculiarities of Secret Weapons Over Normandy is certainly given by the diversification of vehicles and weapons, each with its own specific characteristics and methods of use. Equipping your aircraft with certain armaments will lead the player to take into account essential factors for their correct use. For example, in order to successfully release a torpedo, it will be necessary to evaluate the altitude, which cannot be too high, the perfect alignment of the vehicle and finally the speed, which must also be reduced. Furthermore, depending on the means with which we will embark, we will notice differences in terms of maneuverability, resistance to enemy fire, top speed and, finally, offensive power. I've got all my love to give As already anticipated, this LucasArts title ends up rightfully among the archives of aviation games, cataloged under the heading simulation, if not completely. In fact, Secret Weapons Over Normandy has been specially designed for cross-platform, as it is capable of mixing simulation elements with other decidedly more arcade elements in order to satisfy all users a little. During the game we will take into custody numerous aircraft with disparate peculiarities and as many types of armaments, all unlockable as the game progresses and selectable according to needs. The structure is quite canonical, with multi-objective missions facilitated by appropriate checkpoints. The nature of the missions is divided into two types: primary, where the player must imperatively fulfill his duties; and secondary, the execution of which will be at the discretion of the player. Also completing the optional tasks will serve both to increase in rank and to collect upgrades useful for the evolution of the vehicle. In this sense, the challenges that will open up parallel to the main game will also be essential for acquiring valuable add-ons, as well as training the player in the various vicissitudes to which he will be subjected in the main game. At first glance Secret Weapons Over Normandy will not enjoy much immediacy, due to a control system that will prove effective only after long game sessions. In fact, the possibility of doing all you can in totally different flight views inhibits you in the first few bars. In addition to the keys intended for the use of weapons and to lock on enemies, there will be more keys intended for very distinct flight styles and distinguished by as many views: the standard one from behind, with which it will be possible to do most of the actions; the one from above useful for bombing; the subjective to look behind you; and, finally, a view that will hold the surrounding background still, thus allowing you to perform otherwise impossible evolutions with your aircraft. It is good to dwell on the latter for a moment, since if on the one hand it is spectacular and appropriate for certain maneuvers, on the other it often ends in little credible evolutions that have little to do with physics. The artificial intelligence of the enemies has been calibrated, which will alternate emeritus duffers with elusive pilots always ready to strike. And I'll survive I will survive The considerable variety of missions will be the appendix to a balanced mix of frenzy, given by fights to the death against enemy units, and exploration. In this regard, the localization system dictated by the US developers is worthy of note, who have used a key to locate any target present on the screen, complete with coordinates and distance to travel. This very useful application is unfortunately affected by sporadic situations in which the screen will literally fill up with writings, mostly hidden especially when the enemy ranks will be thick. On this last point, the graphic engine of the Lucas title is certainly noteworthy, capable of withstanding, despite some small hesitation on the side of the framerate, the high numerical presence of vehicles on the screen and explosions, the latter made very well. The polygonal models of planes and boats are all in all well made, despite the fact that the applied textures are rather devoid of details and poorly defined. Also, and above all, the settings are sparse and excessively uniform to each other, so as to minimize the background differences between very distinct places, where even the massive presence of clipping contributes to sinking everything. However, the sound creation takes care of reviving a graphic sector with numerous gaps, which in addition to presenting a splendidly crafted dubbing entirely in Italian, offers epic musical tracks perfectly in style with the era. Furthermore, the various planes will also differ in the noises emitted, each one particular and, presumably, adjacent to the real counterpart. Final gem is the dubbing in the mother tongue of each extra present in the game, obviously subtitled; we will therefore have who will speak in German, Japanese and English. Comment Secret Weapons Over Normandy is proposed as a bold title capable of being able to satisfy all palates a little. The meticulous care taken in recreating historical situations and events is commendable, not least the creation of a sound that scares so much it is beautiful and an enjoyable gameplay despite taking a while to get into gear. Unfortunately, a rather neglected graphic design, a shallow multiplayer mode and the absence of online play invalidate an overall judgment which, otherwise, would have gone in one direction. Recommended to all lovers of the genre and games built on solid historical foundations. Pros: Loud sound. Excellent historical reconstruction. Gameplay varied and full of ideas. Cons: Poorly designed graphics. No live, no parties. Light multiplayer. The incessant habit of LucasArts to do its utmost between diametrically opposed eras is now well known, consolidated in the years spent between the Star Wars epics and the revisiting of evocative scenarios belonging to the past. Among the latter, Secret Weapons Over Normandy enters by right, an ambitious flight game set in the Second World War and developed by Totally Games. This US software house, which has seen a lot of water under the bridge, returns to the scene of this huge videogame amphitheater after almost two years of absence, to be exact from the excellent Star Trek: Bridge Commander released at the beginning of 2002 on Personal Computer. In over twenty years of presence on the market Totally Games has focused a lot on aviation games, and this latest effort is no exception: Secret Weapons Over Normandy is aimed at users of all platforms, including PC, and we will consider review the Xbox version.", "date": "2003-12-10", "grade": null}
