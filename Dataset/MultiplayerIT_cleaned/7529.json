Type:Rider is not a simple educational software, with ludic inserts placed in a widespread way to try to make a historical subject interesting that can be indigestible, it is on the contrary a real video game, rather well structured, which exploits the subject in question to create a common thread between levels, characterize the setting and reinforce a sense of progression between levels of an abstract puzzle-platformer. The theme of typography therefore becomes the characterizing element of a game that would otherwise have risked remaining rather anonymous and also has the advantage of teaching something that we would hardly have bothered to go and read without the right inputs. The aim of the game is to guide a pair of dots through various levels that represent some milestones in the evolution of typography, thus going from a prologue on cave painting, Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese writing to modern offset and computerized typography technologies, obviously passing through the discovery of movable type typography. Each world is therefore characterized by themed scenarios with the historical period and the subject matter and divided into four levels to be completed, in which we basically find ourselves running the two points on various letters, trying to collect small luminous characters and asterisks that unlock historical information to be read separately. It is therefore not just a question of reaching the conclusion of the levels, but also of finding as many characters and asterisks as possible to complete the entire information and documentary sector, which also turns out to be very interesting. Instead of forcibly breaking the pace of the game, all the information on the characters, techniques and historical events related to typography are stored in a sort of ~library~ divided by historical periods, thus being able to be read calmly, and the unexpected thing is that you will actually want to interrupt the game to read the documents in question, perhaps after having managed to collect a particularly hidden asterisk linked to some particular event in the history of typography. Type:Rider makes the history of typography fascinating and fun, and vice versa Two points and back The control system is simple and intuitive, requiring a touch on the sides of the screen to direct the two points to the right or left, with the possibility of jumping given by a short press on the opposite side of the one to which they are directed. Being round figures, these obviously roll and slide on the elements of the scenario, reacting to the conformation of this on the basis of a basic physical reproduction between jumps, rebounds and interaction with self-propelled objects. For most of the time, therefore, it is a question of managing inertia and jumps with the right dosage and timing to reach characters and asterisks and avoiding the dangers that are hidden within the levels (abyss, flames, spikes and various obstacles), but we are also faced with various puzzles to solve, with the need to activate levers, keys and mechanisms in order to continue and often having to deal with a third point to be moved and placed inside particular switches. The puzzles are quite basic but as the levels progress you notice a sense of progression which also leads to a discrete variation of situations, which has a very positive effect on the overall pace of play. However, there are some problems regarding the control system: the simple inputs do not allow precise management of the movements and the very essence of the ~protagonist~ of the game, i.e. a pair of rolling points, obviously focuses on above all inertial control, which mixes active interventions with the passive effects given by the conformation of the scenarios. The result in some cases is quite annoying, in particular as regards a somewhat chaotic management of the jumps. From this point of view, the relative simplicity of the level design helps not to fall into frustration. The graphic characterization of the scenarios is very beautiful, which manage, even with the use of a few elements and the simple use of black profiles on colored backgrounds, to be pleasant and evocative, with references to the history of typography that make the whole take on characteristics decidedly interesting abstract sounds, together with a rarefied but well thought out audio accompaniment.", "date": "2013-10-30", "grade": "8.0"}
