{"name": "Eastward", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eastward-recensione.html", "text": "We are in the future and the world is in shambles (for a change). The planet has been invaded by a toxic entity that destroys everything it touches and has made the surface unlivable. What is left of mankind has therefore decided to go and live underground, to have a better chance of survival. Life underground is hard, especially if you find yourself under a tyrannical regime like Potcrock's, in which citizens are exploited in various ways and do not have the opportunity to rebel. All this at least until a strange couple is formed: John, a miner from Potcrock, knows Sam, a mysterious girl with long, curly and white hair. Soon the exuberant character of Sam puts both on a collision course with the mayor of the underground town, creating a chain of events that will kick off a long journey and will give birth to all the hope that on the surface there is a different life and not only the monsters the regime propaganda talks about. This is the premise of this amazing clone of The Legend of Zelda presented in splendid pixel art graphics, which managed to keep us glued to the screen for about thirty hours, telling us a story full of magic, social implications and twists, such as you will read in the course of the Eastward review. First steps Some of Eastward's settings are beautiful The first few hours of Eastward are slow and very dialogued. The game lets us get to know the various characters who populate Potcrock, also giving us an insight into life in the town. John and Sam live in a dilapidated trailer and have as main objectives to work the former and go to school the latter. Wandering around the town you can practice with the control system, really simple, based as it is on a single button that manages all the main interactions, whether they are talking, interacting with objects (to collect or use them directly) or making purchases in stores. Soon you end up exploring the first dungeon, the mine where John works, where you learn the basics of the combat system by facing slow and not very dangerous mutant slugs and where you find the first supplementary weapon: bombs, very useful for destroying obstacles and solve the first puzzles (actually they will be useful for the whole game). John fights like a bull holding a lethal... frying pan, with which he launches powerful blows against enemies or breakable objects (inside there are hearts to heal, bombs and other objects). If desired, he can also charge a shot by holding down the attack key, a move that proves useful on more than one occasion. Later in the adventure ours will get other offensive tools, such as firearms of increasing power, but at the beginning you have to be content with fighting like little Bud Spencers. Sam is not initially involved, but a narrative twist will make her first playable, then a permanent member of the group. Unlike John, who is a normal human being, Sam has special powers, the nature of which will be revealed as the adventure progresses and which are linked to an energy bar that recharges over time. The relationship between the two is one of the most beautiful dynamics in the entire game. It's the classic father / daughter relationship where both care about each other up to the extreme consequences told in the finale. Pair gameplay Eastward offers very varied settings The synergy between the two is also the keystone of the gameplay, which blossoms when you find yourself using them in concert to resolve the most thorny situations. Eastward's puzzles aren't very original, based as they are on pressing plates, interacting with levers, crates to move, obstacles to remove, timing and all the other styles you can think of. Yet they work. What makes them different from those of other video games is precisely the need to use both characters to solve them, having to think from time to time to understand how to exploit their characteristics and abilities. Having a favorite character is simply pointless, as the gameplay is built around using both to proper profit. Switching from one to the other is as easy as pressing a key and soon you are perfectly comfortable controlling them practically in real time, choosing the most useful one each time. Exploring in Eastward is a pleasure, either for the beauty of the scenarios, designed with great attention to detail and full of small animations, some of which are excellent (just think of the explosions), or because the dungeons are overflowing with secrets, which usually hide containers filled with useful items, such as thesalt, the game currency, or ingredients to use with the pan to cook rich delicacies with the pan, or mechanical parts with which to build objects and upgrades. In Eastward there is a lot of talk The game world is really varied and during the adventure you find yourself exploring very different places, such as caves full of ferocious insects, forests full of plants and other lethal creatures, ruined shopping malls, semi-desert areas, cathedrals sci-fi, and so on. The enemies are many and range from the aforementioned mutant insects, to the classic undead, up to futuristic creatures. There are also big bosses who, in addition to being perfectly animated, offer unique challenges, with attack patterns that require some study before they can be understood and countered properly. They're not impossible, but they give a lot of trouble and, fortunately, can't be overcome by furiously pressing on the controller. Dungeon puzzles will often require both characters to be used to solve During their journey, which will take place for the most part on the railway, John and Sam will also have the opportunity to explore new cities, profoundly different from theirs in terms of architectural styles and culture, in which they will meet many other characters, who will slowly help to reveal the key parts of the plot. One of the most interesting activities that can be carried out in these places is to go around talking to the inhabitants to find out what they have to say and to understand some anecdote related to the rich mythology that forms the backdrop to the adventure. From this point of view it must be said that the work done by the Pixpil guys is really huge and it would be a shame to miss some details just for having run through the levels. Not all the dialogues are significant, but taken as a whole they help to have a broader picture of the game, making it more present in its narrative will. Pixel art at the highest level Eastward's pixel art is gorgeous and has been worth waiting years to play One of the best features of Eastward is its ability to offer something different from start to finish, in a really excellent progression of unlocked skills and items obtained. There are some repeating situations, but it's nothing really compromising, for an adventure that remains interesting throughout its duration and which also has a lot to offer for completionists, who will have a hard time finding all the objects. particularly in advanced dungeons, which become particularly intricate. We have already mentioned the visual style, but it is better to reiterate the concept. Eastward is beautiful, not only because it's drawn to perfection, but also because it manages to have its own strong personality where it seemingly seems to do what others have already done. It is a title with an impressive graphic richness, as it becomes clear when one enters a completely hand-drawn city, in which each building is different from the others and is enriched with often insignificant details, such as broken tiles or unique frescoes, which, however, added together, give the idea of living and, above all, experienced places. Sam, the main character Finally, to magnify everything is the soundtrack, inspired and made up of songs designed to underline every situation, with specific tracks for each major environment. If we wanted to find some fault in Eastward, perhaps we would talk about some naivety in some dungeons, with excessive reliance on finding keys and some puzzles that were too rigid, which perhaps could have left the player more freedom. Even the combat system is not among the most complex that exist in the world of video games, but in this case the developers' choice is justified by the fact that overcomplicating it would have negatively affected the couple gameplay, i.e. when you have to use both characters by exchanging them quickly. Overall, they are small things that do not spoil the game, which remains excellent, from any point of view you look at it.", "date": "2021-09-14", "grade": "8.8"}
