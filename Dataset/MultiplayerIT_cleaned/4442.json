There are several reasons, but in general we can say that picking up, dismantling and perfecting the gameplay models abandoned by the big names in the industry has historically been considered a real political act, especially by the more fundamentalist developers. Pixel art in particular is heralded as a form of reaction to the depersonalizing production processes of triple A titles. Joakim Sandberg, better known as Konjak, has never made a secret of his radical position on the subject, to the point that at the dawn of the development of Iconoclasts, when it was still a prototype called Ivory Springs (actually it's more the first version of the game, which Konjak ended up discarding, then starting almost from scratch), openly spoke of years of development to complete it. For him, video games must be handcrafted creations, in which the hand of the authors is evident in every single pixel. In short, after the two excellent Noitu Love, which we warmly invite you to recover, Konjak has pursued an almost Zen form of development, not in any hurry. Some would say that he can obviously afford it, but nonetheless the end result is excellent in several respects. Iconoclasts is a 2D metroidvania that tells the story of Robin, the daughter of a mechanic who inherited his big wrench from her father. In a world where every aspect of life is controlled by the central government, under the threat of being considered sinners by a deity simply called Mother, Robin and her selfless desire to help others soon come into conflict with the central power, unleashing a series of events whose dramatic intensity will grow throughout the game, resulting in moments that we do not hesitate to define as tragic. Perfection in design Sandberg is undoubtedly a master of game design, little to add. He had already demonstrated it with Noitu Love 2, but with Iconoclasts he has reached truly incredible peaks of excellence: there is not a single moment of the gameplay that has not been studied to perfection. At first Robin can only jump and use his stun gun, but soon he gets his father's wrench, with which he can solve the first, simple, puzzles. During the adventure, Robin will obtain other weapons and tools (bombs, upgrades for the wrench itself and more), overall not very many, but all exploited with great wisdom to create increasingly difficult and interesting macro puzzles. Obviously, as tradition of the genre dictates, some will allow you to return to already explored areas to reach previously inaccessible areas. Note that all of Robin's tools will remain useful for the entire game, including the starting weapon which will even be indispensable against some of the final bosses. It is a radical design choice, as effective: instead of adding stuff to stuff, Konjak has preferred to exploit each mechanic to its extreme consequences, giving the player a great awareness of the game system. Apart from Robin's equipment, many of the puzzles are linked to the conformation of the levels and the characteristic elements that compose them. Overall, Iconoclasts offers a variety that is difficult to find elsewhere, a variety that fortunately has many highs and very few lows. In short, some small sections are less inspired than others, but overall everything works very well. From the point of view of design, we are faced with one of the maximum expressions of the metroidvania, capable of reserving surprises from start to finish. The boss fights themselves share the same genuine ingenuity as everything else - there isn't one that is linear or repeating. The player is called upon to study their schemes and understand how to act to defeat them, in a constant mix of reflection and skill, which feeds on the amazement of the minute details taken into consideration in each fight. Adding variety are also the secondary characters who meet throughout the game and who follow Robin on her adventures. Konjak has used them in a new and creative way, in some cases indirectly (driven by the CPU, Robin must interact with them to overcome puzzles or bosses) or directly (the player can take control of them). It must be said that they are also interesting characters who, while starting from precise stereotypes, do everything to overcome them and be more ~human~ and original than the average of the genre. Doubts Reading the previous paragraph it might seem that this mixture of excellent levels, ingenious puzzles and high writing has noflaws, but it's not like that. Ironically, given how long it took to develop Iconoclasts has some underutilized mechanics. We think in particular of Robin's grafts, which are built on workbenches using materials found in chests scattered throughout the game world. Unfortunately, despite being a very present mechanic, it never seems to be decisive. In short, bonuses are obtained, but without these affecting the gameplay too much, so much so that sometimes you forget you have them. In a certain sense it is almost inevitable that this is the case, given the nature of the game, but the result is a certain weakening of the exploratory part, which becomes almost superfluous in the long run. The smell is more that of the late addition or, worse, of the mechanic that has lost importance in Konjak's head as the game progressed. Another problem, which actually isn't a problem, is pixel art. It's certainly wonderful and we don't hide from you that we have admired it in some points, but it's also true that it loses a bit when compared to that of an Owlboy and, stylistically speaking, Iconoclasts is less fresh than a Hollow Knight and other titles of the genre. In short, it's nice, but there is better. It is not a huge defect (in fact we do not list it as such in the box with the comment), but if you have played many indies it is difficult to be amazed by the excellent work done on the individual sprites and animations, all perfectly made and capable, with a few frames, to represent expressions and feelings of the characters.", "date": "2018-01-28", "grade": "9.0"}
