{"name": "Bioshock - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bioshock-recensione_a.html", "text": "Every bullet counts There are no more enemies to face, the game does not cheat, but confronts us with a small presence of ammunition, Eve, medkit and Adam, but above all it reviews (and corrects) the functioning of the Chambers of Life. Everything depends on the scarcity of means available. Hence, exploiting the environment in accordance with one's abilities becomes absolutely necessary. Since the amount of bullets and Eve dispensers present is drastically reduced, with this costing much more in terms of consumption, every offensive action must be done according to the certainty of reaching one's goal. Throwing yourself into a melee head-on, perhaps relying on the experience accumulated by having played it in previous incarnations, and relying too much on your consolidated combos is most often the wrong choice. An extremely cautious approach, with an attitude more stealth than ~Garibaldine~, and with an eye constantly turned to the possibilities offered by the manipulation of the environment is the winning strategy to survive in the world of Andrew Ryan. Very useful at this juncture is the ability to use robots and watchtowers to your advantage, after hacking the system, thus avoiding wasting precious resources. The abilities of the plasmids must therefore be exploited carefully, avoiding the use of the usual direct offensive techniques, in favor of those abilities that allow you to overcome clashes without emptying your arsenal. Everything has been modified downwards therefore, from the bullets available to the amount of damage done, up to the aforementioned availability and consumption of Eve. Obviously the same thing can be said for the Adam. The only thing tending upwards is the artificial intelligence of the enemies encountered during Jack's wanderings. Their ability to deal damage has therefore increased, as well as their skills in avoiding projectiles, but above all they are now much more skilled in carrying out concerted attacks. The Chambers of Life, which with a questionable choice of gameplay lowered the tension in the clashes, returning to the player a good part of his energy at the cost of a little Eve, have now been heavily modified, in fact greatly reducing the level of resources (and energy) available at the moment of rebirth. The choice regarding the energy of the enemies remains unchanged, which remains the one present at the time of the player's departure, which has remained the same compared to the Xbox version of the title. Despite this, the more you die, the more the chances of replaying to the best of your strength diminish, also in light of Eve's scarcity and abnormal consumption. So here the circle comes full circle, the survival horror turn is definitive, this fourth level of difficulty makes the 2K Marin title a really tough nut to crack, a really challenging experience, in which every bullet counts, in which every dark area, every cone of shadow can hide a mortal danger. In terms of new additions, the new plasmids made available for Xbox 360 only after launch are immediately available, which is obvious but very welcome. Puzzles and trophies The other exclusive is a series of rooms, environmental puzzles to solve, which will be released later and represent a potential expansion of the ~physical~ mechanics of the game. During the E3 in Los Angeles a small puzzle was shown to be solved in which it was necessary to restore power to the Grand Carnival carousel where a Little Sister was stuck: all this without using the electricity plasmid! To complete the PlayStation 3 offer, Bioshock offers about fifty trophies, with those collected in Survivor mode guaranteeing the greatest satisfactions, given that they impose ~impossible~ tests such as finishing the game without using the Chambers of Life. From a graphic point of view, the work done by the boys of 2K Games, even after a year from the first release, leaves you stunned for the great artistic direction, for the richness of the settings and for the good number of special effects applied. The two versions in direct competition are practically indistinguishable, with all that follows, or textures in some cases fluctuating, some rich in detail and others flatter and dull. There are also some slowdowns, which is difficult to explain given the extra time during optimization. Comment Despite a year having passed since its first release, Bioshock remains one of the most beautiful and exciting titles to play for those who haven't played it yet or want to throw themselves back into Rapture again, also in light of the exclusivity features in this new version. Survival modeuto offers a very challenging challenge that enhances the gameplay of the game, expanding the various types of approaches to survive in Andrew Ryan's Utopia. Too bad for the graphics sector, which while reaching the levels of artistic excellence of the Xbox 360 version, has not undergone any further optimization and is practically identical. The icing on the cake is represented by the ~environmental~ puzzles, available shortly, but which represent something that goes beyond a simple diversion to increase the already excellent longevity of the 2K Marin title. Pros Immersive story and gameplay Artistically excellent Survivor mode Environmental puzzles... Cons ... unfortunately not yet available (will be available on November 20th) Some graphical flaws inherited from the Xbox 360 release", "date": "2008-10-17", "grade": null}
