{"name": "Observer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/observer-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Observer made its debut exactly a year and a half ago on PC, and after landing on PS4 and Xbox One, the Bloober Team guys decided to bring their peculiar cyberpunk adventure to Nintendo Switch as well. The game is set in Krakow in 2084 and puts us in the role of Daniel Lazarski, a police officer equipped with cybernetic implants that allow him to read the minds of victims, whether they are alive or dead: an Observer, in fact. Lost in the streets of a metropolis torn apart by social inequalities, the man receives a mysterious call from his son Adam and decides to investigate to see if anything has happened to him. But when he reaches the apartment from which the transmission started, the only thing he finds is a decapitated body and some strange clues. The condominium is dilapidated and is managed by a strange guy, but whoever lives there must have seen or heard something: after analyzing the crime scene using enhanced vision and biometrics, Daniel decides to knock on every door to see if there are any witnesses. At one point, however, he comes across a disturbing trail of victims, torn apart by what appear to be large claws. Who killed these people, and why? The only way to find out is to connect to their neural chip and retrace their memories. Gameplay and structure Conceptually, Observer is a title very close to Bloober Team's previous project, Layers of Fear, even if from a gameplay point of view different elements of interaction are introduced and there are sections in the campaign where it is possible to run into game over. The claustrophobic, at times dreamlike horror that the authors have tried to depict does not always work, as certain situations lead the user to remain relatively detached, for example when the protagonist connects to someone's mind and relives their memories, trying to put them back together like a puzzle. The puzzles are actually varied: we go from surveys in real life, with objects that can suggest a code or other useful information for further investigations, to the activation of mechanisms and devices useful for revealing hidden passages or evidence to collect. However, when the action takes place in the virtual world, asking us to complete increasingly complex paths, in which we have to find the right order in order not to get stuck in a loop, even jumpscare attempts often end up failing. Daniel can track his progress by calling up a holographic interface at any time, which serves as a helpful guide to the next steps to take. The display also indicates the possible need to take a dose of Synchrozine, a drug necessary to inhibit the effects of rejection. In case you run out of active ingredient, your vision blurs and things get more complicated, but fortunately it is possible to find bottles within the scenarios with a certain frequency. The layout of the controls on Nintendo Switch is the same as we experienced in the original version using the controller, with the triggers and shoulder buttons doing the bulk of the work. If you want, you move quite easily, you can run and this comes in handy in some of the most excited moments in the story, but in general we are faced with a reflective experience, which makes the atmospheres and the narrative context its strengths. Atmosphere and technique In short, it is above all the atmosphere that makes Observer fascinating: the audio design developed by the authors allows you to immerse yourself with conviction in an engaging story, in which there is no lack of twists and moments of reflection, very well underlined by the charisma of Rutger Hauer, who he lends his voice to the protagonist and creates interesting dialogues, often interpreted with the tired tone of an elderly policeman who has seen a lot. Many of the visual solutions adopted for the game are clearly gimmicks aimed at masking a production value that is not at the highest level: sometimes the trick works, sometimes it doesn't. On Nintendo Switch, however, things are made more complicated by poorly defined, very dirty graphics that barely hold up to 30 frames per second although nothing chaotic ever happens on the screen. The game also takes a few moments too long when trying to access areas that have not yet been visited, and this breaks the rhythm of exploration a bit. Observer is not the most suitable title to exploit the portability of the Nintendo console, given the focus on the atmosphere which can certainly benefit from a large screen and a decent sound system, but at least there are no substantial differences between one mode and the other.
