There are those who call them ~walking simulators~, walking simulators in a somewhat derogatory way, who frame them within the now crowded adventure genre. Basically the concept is always the same: the story is in the background, usually just hinted at or told with unconventional methods, the degree of challenge is almost non-existent and, in some cases, it is practically impossible to lose while all the value of the game is in the its ability to stir emotions or suck the player into an immersive and evocative universe. In recent years we have learned about Journey, Abzu, Firewatch, Kentucky Route Zero, Limbo and Inside, all the titles made by the late Tale of Tales and we are just mentioning a few. Today is the turn of FAR: Lone Sails which, after almost three years of development by a very small team and after having collected mentions and awards in various videogame events, now arrives on PC and Mac, before making its also appearing on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Switch in the coming months. Lonely survivors The game puts us at the controls of Lone, a girl with undefined characteristics, apparently the only survivor of a world now in ruins. At the controls of a sort of cyberpunk train equipped with sails and strange technologies, we will have to cross a fascinating and disturbing landscape desolation to reach a destination that has never been defined or explained. The main peculiarity of FAR: Lone Sails is in fact the total absence of graphic aids, writing, an on-screen interface or any explicit narrative. There isn't even a tutorial and, with the exception of the appearance of a couple of commands on the screen in the first moments of the game, it will be the gameplay itself that stimulates us to try the interactions to understand the functioning of our means of locomotion and above all to forcing us to sharpen our eyesight so as not to miss any crucial element on the screen. The basic mechanics are extremely simple: in this long existential journey that takes place moving towards the right of the screen, we will have to collect small objects of common life that we will sometimes find on our way and that will force us to stop the train to take them on board and burn them in the boiler. Wooden crates, bins, books, chairs, lamps, everything can be transformed into fuel to feed the mechanisms of this strange train which, during our epic, will be enhanced with a handful of new features to better address some problems that will arise on the our path. In fact, the journey of the protagonist will periodically be slowed down or prevented by environmental puzzles, which will often force us to stop and get off the means of locomotion to activate a certain mechanism or unlock a gear. Mind you, these are never complex interactions, nor is it possible to make mistakes or die. Everything is extremely linear and directly connected with the evolution of the journey but above all of the train, which is the true protagonist of FAR: Lone Sails. Everything happens seamlessly, given that the game is completely devoid of loading and we will be able to move in and out of the means of locomotion at our total discretion. We will be able to directly command the protagonist alone, while the management of the vehicle takes place via a series of buttons distributed within it, a bit like what happened with the spaceship in the cooperative title Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime. So outside of the short and sporadic environmental puzzles, we will spend a good part of the three, four hours of game necessary to complete the title simply by pushing these switches to keep the engine powered, stop when necessary, manage the sails and intervene in case of breakdowns and fires. All in a repetitive micromanagement and unfortunately very little stimulating. Much of the adventure will flow away admiring the landscapes and listening to the background music, while our actions will be very similar to those of an automaton that can easily keep its brain on standby. Not that this is an a priori problem, mind you, and the genre of narrative adventures has shown us many cases of non-existent gameplay in the face of an absolute degree of immersion aimed at making room for a story full of twists or masterfully narrated. Unfortunately however, in FAR: Lone Sails, there is no quell'adequate counterbalance to balance the poverty of the game mechanics. A fascinating work of art However, it is on the artistic front that this small independent title really shines in its own light. The style adopted is extremely fascinating thanks to a splendid use of a bare-bones color palette, which perfectly alternates the cold detachment and solitude aroused by the gray and blue scales with the warmth resulting from the flashes of red that surround the very small portions of scenery in the distance, where there still seems to be a glimmer of life and hope. The world of FAR: Lone Sails is clearly on the verge of extinction and the journey of the protagonist will take us through an endless sea dried up by drought, where huge ships stand stranded or near fortified and hastily abandoned villages. And there will also be sad hilly landscapes beaten by incessant hailstorms. To underline that almost philosophical relationship between the smallness of the living being and the enormity of the world crossed there is also a clever and very interesting use of the camera, which is always managed automatically by the game, in order to be focused and zoomed on Lone, as long as the latter remains inside the train. The moment we go down, perhaps to look for resources or to solve a puzzle, the shot gets further and further away. This way we can better admire the difference in size between the human, the vehicle and the scenery. The result is artistically very interesting and helps restore that sense of desolation that permeates FAR: Lone Sails. The soundtrack is also extremely pleasant, non-invasive in its being a minimalist and very subtle accompaniment. It envelops us with small pieces played with piano, winds and strings and often mixes with ambient noises, restoring a splendid rhythm to the playing environment. There are no dubbed or written dialogues on the screen during the adventure, but all the menus are translated into our language.", "date": "2018-05-12", "grade": "7.5"}
