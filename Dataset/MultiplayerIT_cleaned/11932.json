{"name": "My Sims - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/my-sims-recensione.html", "text": "The boy of Gluck street As soon as we start My Sims, we are asked to create our alter ego by characterizing its appearance (hair, skin color, eyes, clothes), then to give it a name and then to say in which city we would like to live. It is clear that this is how the city where we will actually move will be called, discussing with the mayor on what is best to do to attract tourists and give a jolt to the economic activities of the area. In fact, in the game we have the role of ~savior of the country~, we have to go around the various neighborhoods and talk to all the characters we find, helping them in different ways. At first we can only explore certain areas of the city and not all shops are open, so it's time to talk to the mayor to find out where to go, who to talk to and who to lend a hand. The first business that we have the task of revitalizing is the flower shop, and it is there that we will also discover an important aspect of My Sims, namely the minigames. In that specific case, we will have to use the stylus to make garlands, completing them in the shortest possible time to collect a certain number of points. At the end of the operation, the owner of the shop will give us a wreath, which we can decide to give to some sad tourist to start a conversation... Accidental tourists In the city of My Sims we will find a whole series of characters, often characterized by a dark mood. It will be our duty to converse with them to cheer them up, in order to replenish the progress bar in the game ... it is in fact that access to the most distant districts depends on it, as well as the opening of new shops and the arrival of new possibilities (such as buying a house bigger than the sad starting studio flat). Once you have met a character and started a conversation, a bar appears on the screen indicating the Sim's morale, which must reach its maximum within a limited time. We must therefore select various icons to advance the discussion, being careful which one we choose so as not to make everything more difficult: converse, listen, laugh, cry, angry, comfort, encourage... Often the procedure to follow is intuitive, in other cases it is a bit confusing, especially when the conversation ends with a question (the answer to which cannot be known except by experimenting). Ultimately, this is the spirit of My Sims: you walk around town, talk to everyone, shop in stores and help them with their business. In addition to this, there is a whole series of mini-games that contribute to the general progress and therefore to the unlocking of new districts and new elements. All this takes place over a day divided into four parts (morning, afternoon, evening and night), which marks the characters' commitments but which does not affect the needs of our Sim (who sleeps just to sleep, to be honest, but certainly does not have the duties that characterize the normal episodes of the series The Sims). Technically speaking The creation of My Sims for Nintendo DS is functional to the gameplay, but nothing more. We have cartoon-style characters and settings, but a not very varied park of animations and a view of the character that is too close, which cannot be changed and which, especially at the beginning, creates many problems when you have to move from one place to the other. The upper screen doesn't help us in these operations, as it doesn't show us a map and limits itself to scanning the four phases of the day (something for which a small icon would have sufficed...). The quality of the graphics doesn't change for the better for minigames, indeed we often find ourselves faced with an involution. As far as the sound is concerned, then, we're really on the essentials: rather repetitive music comments on our exploration (after a while we'll tend to mute the volume...), while the effects are very few and quite trivial. The game can be controlled using the stylus and the touch screen, but using the standard controls (d-pad and buttons) proves much more practical and intuitive, at least until you try your hand at minigames. Minigames, what a passion! In My Sims you will face a number of mini-games: small games of squash (with a collision detection system that is far from perfect, actually), making garlands of flowers (with the stylus), paragliding (blowing into the microphone to gain altitude...), fishing, etc. etc. At the same time, we will have the opportunity to help shopkeepers by building customized objects for them, which will have the merit of attracting new customers. If you've ever played an episode of The Sims series, you know exactly what it's all about: step into the shoesof a character who has to earn a living, socialize but also carry out his basic needs (eating, washing, sleeping, etc.). All while always trying to get something more from every point of view, in this case buying a bigger house, starting a family, becoming wealthy and so on. For My Sims, the developers EA wanted to do something different, however, and their intentions are already clear from the design of the characters (basically children). We are dealing with a product intended for young users, especially as regards the Nintendo DS version (deprived of some advanced features present, however, on the Wii). Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it should be clarified immediately. Comment My Sims is certainly a new product compared to The Sims, but not as expected. The Wii version has elements of greater depth than those present on the DS, but in general it is a game aimed at a young audience and with rather simple and linear mechanics. Everything revolves around the interaction with other Sims, which leads to the expansion of the city and therefore to the introduction of new minigames and new quests. But everything is rather limited, there is nothing whose conquest produces who knows what satisfaction... and longevity could be reduced as a result. This new EA-branded title can therefore be recommended to young users or those looking for an undemanding experience: if you expect a certain depth from My Sims, you will inevitably be disappointed. Pros: Nice graphics Numerous minigames Many customizations Cons: Too simple and linear Repetitive sound Only for the youngest", "date": "2007-10-16", "grade": null}
