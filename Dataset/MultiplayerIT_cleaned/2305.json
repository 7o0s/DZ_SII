{"name": "Lady Sia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lady-sia.html", "text": "The pretext for the adventure is one of the classic ones: the usual evil wizard conquers a new, devastating power with which to vent his evil intuitions, so to eradicate the chaos that has arisen to create a hero is what the world needs. Lady Sia (former princess of one of the kingdoms of the ~resistance~) then rises to the heroine of the game. After such a brilliant incipit, a useful tutorial brings us weight into the adventure. Although there could have been all the prerequisites for creating a splendid old-fashioned graphic adventure, the developers opted instead for a game setting equally reminiscent of old glories of the past and of an era of video games as glorious as they are shining in the memory of the writer and in that of those who have at least 4 decades behind them. Lady Sia looks like a platform game, as you have to jump frequently and attack naive mindless enemies, but it looks more like that derivation of the genre that were the two Prince of Persia and certain CapCom adaptations of some Disney films, rather than the axiomatic Mario and Sonic. The difference may appear laughable or not appear at all. It will be that here the sword is used and that the clashes are one against one (mainly), but there seems to be no trace of the frenzy and pure action, of the axiomatics mentioned above. Also, the scrolling beat 'em up aftertaste is just as strong. The objectives to be achieved are still the most common: collect diamonds, energy points, mana spheres (to perform simple but useful spells), free the prisoners, defeat the enemies and restore order almost everywhere. Of each level a final screen shows the percentage of completion and the time taken; if a satisfactory performance is not obtained, the same level can always be repeated, in order to obtain the ~perfect score~. In this regard, the exhaustive manual can help us. If from a graphic point of view Lady Sia proves to be extremely valid (actually certain chromatic choices have left me dumbfounded), the same cannot be said for the sound sector. In fact, the music prepared varies from setting to setting, but repetitive and unattractive (so much so that they can soon be relegated to a sub-background, far below). The effects are also anonymous and small, but not annoying. However, the use of the Musyx audio tools (by Factor 5) is included and the use of earphones is always recommended to enjoy stereophonic audio. The game also has a well above average longevity, depending on the twenty-four, replayable, game levels (plus the secret ones) and the medium-high difficulty that will keep the player busy for a long time (and along a path that leads to frustration and tediousness). Also not to be underestimated is the presence of Italian among the numerous languages into which the dialogues have been translated; comical (and/or irritating) some errors that lead me to hypothesize the use of programs for automatic translation or the assumption (with those in charge) of Italian as a Spanish dialect. Pros: Fascinating graphic sector (strong point of the game), at least in the early stages Good longevity Good control of the character (after a bit of practice) Localized (badly) in Italian Varied and multiple action... Cons: ...but soon repetitive and therefore not very inviting Sound compartment not in line with the graphic one It may require an excessive effort to complete the adventure 1 Lady Sia is one of those products that you really don't expect, on the contrary, you think it's the umpteenth commercial production (adhering to the current trend according to which the protagonist is an exponent of the gentil, but not so much, sex) and instead you have to immediately change your mind about the erroneous hypothesis conceived. What is immediately astounding is the high visual quality achieved by this title. Sometimes it seems to be looking at a PC graphic adventure from a few years ago, such as Monkey Island 3 or Broken Sword, just to give you an idea. Especially in the splendid (technically) introduction certain comparisons seem very evident. In the game levels, the scenarios are designed - with a slightly deformed style - in a varied and captivating way, recreating a fantasy setting as seen in certain cartoons, furthermore the chromatic scale used is always appropriate (although sometimes questionable) and contrasted in adequately, to ensure the right visibility even in non-perfect lighting situations. Then there are several planes of parallax in the background and in some cases I know about themdon't apply perfect transparencies as well. The presence of animations on the backdrop gives that final touch that makes the game environment fascinating and ~alive~. Of course, the character animations are also good. The sprites  large and detailed  are animated in a deliberately non-fluid way so as to obtain (especially for Sia) a very interesting and cartoonish effect, also underlined by a thick marking of the contours. The overall fluidity always remains high (in truth, there are never many animated sprites on screen).", "date": "2001-12-19", "grade": null}
