We've tried hard to hate the lilac onesie in which Perry walks around like she's going to a dance, but her personality and charisma trump looks. Above all, he succeeds in light and never gratuitous irony, which allows him to be credible and pleasant. If it seems irrelevant to you, consider that you will have to listen to his comments for hours and reevaluate this point. To interact with us there are many characters who are attractive in dialogue but often disappointing in appearance and in practically absent facial expressions. If it weren't for the talking brain you'll meet in the Academy, for the first ten hours of the game you wouldn't even remember one of the characters you interacted with. Nothing so serious, because the dialogues always prove to be up to par and very often better than those we have heard in much more famous and acclaimed games. The good thing is that while the texts will all be localized in Italian, the dubbing will instead remain in English, which in the version we tested gave a demonstration of professionalism. However, Deep Silver has room to improve considerably in terms of animations, while the screens enjoy much more attention to detail than the three-dimensional models. Not all of them are worthy of certain particularly evocative locations, but overall it is clear that whoever made Perry Rhodan deeply loves this setting and science fiction, so it is natural that the player feels immediately gratified. A last interesting parallel concerns the sequence of twists which maintains an effective pace and takes turns with the level of difficulty of the puzzles. Even if technically Perry Rhodan does not shine for the use of latest generation technologies, it makes good use of its strengths and does a decent job also from this point of view. If only there had been fewer anonymous screenshots and more found that deviate from what the genre has been offering for years now, Perry Rhodan could have gone even one step higher. However, it remains an exciting and balanced graphic adventure, perfect for a heterogeneous audience and which we hope will obtain the well-deserved success to spur Deep Silver to improve further. Comment Perry Rhodan immediately offers a well thought out narration, which poses on a vast world, with over a thousand publications concerning it behind it. Added to this is a script balanced in rhythm and interspersed with well-distributed puzzles in terms of difficulty level. If he had wanted to break away more from the canons of the genre, as he managed to do with certain inspired and courageous puzzles, Perry Rhodan could also have shined among graphic adventures. However, it remains a classic point and click that can be enjoyed both by those who are not familiar with the genre and by the more seasoned adventurers. While the quality of the environments isn't always exceptional, the overall care is Deep Silver's declaration of love for classic sci-fi and a nice journey full of surprises.Pros Well distributed puzzles Cinematic narrative pace Intriguing storyline Some memorable puzzles Cons Not offers significant innovations. Poor animation. Appearance of characters not always up to par A relay of puzzles and twists Perry Rhodan is a graphic adventure that rests almost entirely on the typical structures of the genre, although it does not give up some courageous choices. Point and click games thrive on puzzles and storytelling and it doesn't take much to get an idea of both aspects. The interface is disarmingly simple, perfect for streamlining game sequences: there is an inventory that is always present on the screen and a pointer that changes when you are on a sensitive area. Trivial but not superficial, because additional functions have been studied for many objects to be exploited in very different game contexts. In fact, it may happen that you find yourself with four objects in your inventory without being able to solve a puzzle even for a couple of hours. However, most of the puzzles develop on the association of objects or on the interaction with the characters present, but the most interesting part concerns the rhythm of the puzzles. the sequence of twists takes turns with the difficulty level of the puzzles A relay of puzzles and twists With great care Deep Silver has expertly dosed the number and difficulty of the puzzles, so that after a damned numeric keypad that has forced you to the same location for a long time, you will have a good half hour of exploration ahead, with small tasks to do to take a breakto. The difficulty is never excessive, and stands on the average for anyone with a minimum talent for logical association, while the experienced adventurer, now worn out by carpal tunnel syndrome, will find Perry Rhodan a stimulating but almost never impervious route to take . Two factors, on the other hand, work in favor of the casual player and free us from frustration: the first is the notorious button for immediately viewing the sensitive areas of the screen, while the second concerns the diary with the progress of the investigations, which very often contains some veiled suggestions on the right way to direct attention. We can agree or disagree about the reveal button, but we believe that it dilutes the pleasure of point-and-click, also considering that although Perry tends more to reflection than to tavern brawls, he is certainly not a great collector of objects. In any case, there are several difficult points for which there is no key or clue that holds, and it is there that Perry Rhodan dares that much more which raises him above average. At various times the developers have chosen dynamic interaction as the main way to solve puzzles, crossing action, investigation and logical association with each other. The example of the robot to which we have to make the right run is enough, even if we won't tell you anything else about it. Those are the best moments of the game, even if sadly rarer than the classic mechanics.
