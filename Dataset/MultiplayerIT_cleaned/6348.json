{"name": "Cannonate gratuite", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/148900-gear-up-cannonate-gratuite.html", "text": "The result of the work of only five developers within the small Swedish software house Doctor Entertainment AB, Gear Up is a simple free to play multiplayer action game for up to sixteen players, where small combat vehicles (generally similar to toy tanks ) do battle in colorful and childish scenarios, without therefore taking themselves too seriously from a conceptual point of view but with an enviable solidity of purpose. After whipping it in its Early Access version, of which you can read our test by clicking on the following link, we thoroughly tested the definitive one, in which some of the edges that we had identified a couple of months ago were filed. If you want to find out if it's worth investing your time - and possibly your money - in this project, you just have to continue reading. Gear Up, an honest and fun free to play action from the creators of Puzzle Dimension Cheerful but not too much The current videogame panorama is now full of free to play or presumed such products, and this presence seems to be destined to grow significantly in the near future, bearing in mind announcements and proclamations (actually not exactly appreciated by the players) of various publishers and developers. Although this distribution method has often resulted in questionable microtransactions or, even worse, in the notorious pay-to-win, it is possible to appreciate various virtuous productions, honest in the economic model and above all valid from the purely playful one, such as the appreciated World of Tanks , the nice Loadout or the vast Planetside 2, about to be released also on PlayStation 4. Gear Up, from the point of view of ambitions, is far from the above projects, nevertheless it fits perfectly in the same qualitative line, given that it is possible to have fun without spending even a cent. As we explained in our previous article, the revenues for Doctor Entertainment AB developers derive from the Basic and Premium versions of the game (respectively at 6.99 and 13.99 Euros), which do not give advantages in tactical terms, but provide greater freedom and speed to build your dream tank. Let's proceed in order. In the free version, in Gear Up it is necessary to purchase the various components in the virtual shop by spending the so-called G-Points, which are earned at the end of each match. Even to obtain the most effective and exotic pieces, usually ~unattainable~ in the common free to play, it is not necessary to engage in wild farming, as they are all accessible without having to play millions of hours. The limit of this version is linked to the number of slots in your warehouse, i.e. ten, which force you to sell any old components in order to try and equip new ones. With the Basic version of the game this limit is eliminated, in addition to the possibility of saving three distinct configurations and a doubling of the G-points that can be conquered in battle, while with the Premium version immediate access is given to all 116 components, guaranteeing the maximum possibility customization and experimentation right from the start. In addition to this non-negligible detail, with the more expensive version of the game you have access to the single player mode against bots (actually rather limited and an end in itself) and other little extras, such as the nice - how useless and very heavy - mode ~Army~, where you can make dozens of your vehicles walk in formation, or the Replayer, where you can capture some screenshots on a white background. Crossfire As you may have guessed, the beating heart of the experience is linked to the personalization of your vehicle, which, beyond the interesting aesthetic values, radically changes the approach to battle based on the equipped components. They are divided into seven distinct categories, namely turrets, hulls, propulsion, main weapons, support weapons, flags and decorations, which with the exception of the last two significantly affect properties such as speed, resistance to enemy fire (armor), maneuverability , acceleration and of course the damage dealt. Thanks to the 116 unique pieces available, there are over a million distinct configurations, and from the most classic tanks equipped with tracks and cannon, i.e. the basic vehicle with which all novice players start, you can get to real aircraft that float in half air, alien hovercraft, and dangerous mobile spider-legged turrets that can scale vertical surfaces. It is possible to play both with mouse and keyboard and with the joypad, and the control system is generally responsive, although sometimes it can appear cumbersome and not very sensitive, especially whenWhen you have to shoot and rotate the turret with slower vehicle configurations. However, through practice it is possible to find the right balance, both to better manage the strafe (keys Q and E on the keyboard) and the more complex propulsion systems, such as the fast ones that are not exactly easy to master in turns and the aforementioned by spider, who sometimes have some problems with the elements of the scenario, although in a decidedly reduced way compared to the Early Access version. The weapons range from machine guns of various calibers to the lethal sniper rifle, through mines, spears, cluster bombs, lasers and more original solutions, each capable of offering a rather different gaming experience. As we underlined in our previous analysis, although there are many possible configurations, there is a certain predilection for spider legs accompanied by the sniper rifle (capable of removing 75 armor points with a single shot, and therefore ~instant kills~ ) and versatile tracked wagons equipped with miniguns, solutions that seem to have a certain advantage over the others, although what makes the difference is almost always the skill of the players, obviously at the same level of experience. Fortunately, the bullets run out quickly, especially the most effective ones (the ammunition for the sniper is a maximum of six), and therefore it is necessary to leave the advantageous position to collect the recovery bonuses scattered around the map. In this regard, we recall that there are others capable of increasing shields, regenerating health and enhancing weapons, all to the advantage of the strategy. The great variety of vehicles is counterbalanced by the rather limited number of modes, which include the classic free-for-all deathmatch, team deathmatch (red against blue) and Conquest, the most played and appreciated by the Gear Up community, where two teams battle it out for control of the classic designated areas. There are six maps in all, namely Oasis, Inferno Island, Construction Chaos, Deadly Dock, Armed Arena, Atoll Action and Violent Valley, a couple of which are also available in a night version. Although not particularly large and complex, they have an accurate level design that develops both vertically and inside buildings and structures, with several interesting positions where to lurk and ambush enemies, perhaps hiding behind some self-propelled architecture. Stylized diorama Despite being a free to play title created by a handful of willing developers, from a technical point of view Gear Up is quite accurate, especially for the rendering of the vehicles, the scenarios and above all the lighting, which gives the production that atmosphere typical of Pixar animated films. The graphics are in fact stylized, colorful and ~toy~, always resulting fascinating, even if not accompanied by particle or volumetric effects of the latest generation. Physics is generally valid, however some reversals are not always credible, due to a gravity of the vehicles - especially during jumps - more lunar than terrestrial. Compared to the previously tested version, the sound effects have a decidedly more incisive and cleaner timbre, although they are rather limited in terms of variety. Unfortunately there are no dedicated servers, and everything is delegated to the games hosted by the players: lag and microstuttering are certainly less than in the past, while the number of sessions in which you can access, even with a match in progress, is always quite large thanks to the active community. An interesting matchmaking feature is added to the solidity of the netcode, which indicates the average experience level present in the game, suggesting to novices which matches to face or avoid. The game, among other things, no longer suffers from crashes and above all from freezes that previously undermined the enjoyment and fluidity of the games.", "date": "2015-05-10", "grade": "7.0"}
