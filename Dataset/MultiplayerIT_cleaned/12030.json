{"name": "Elven Chronicles", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/elven-chronicles.html", "text": "It is now a hackneyed speech: at present, there are videogame genres that are still unavailable on mobile phones, just as there are others that marry perfectly with this type of device. While waiting for technological progress to solve the problem, let's enjoy role-playing games for example, of which this Elven Chronicles is a perfect representative. Developed by Big Blue Bubble, a team that already has some experience with RPGs on portable systems, this title sees us control a pair of characters grappling with a series of quests. He is a warrior named Rogan: he doesn't remember his past but he knows how to wield a sword and doesn't disdain offensive spells; she is an elf named Jada: in close combat she is not worth much, but she is a master of the magical arts and is resourceful. The game starts from a village where it is possible to dialogue with non-player characters to start quests. Once the mission has started, on the map (which can be called up on the screen by pressing the right function key) both the place of departure and that of arrival are highlighted, i.e. the place where we will find what we are looking for, whether it is an object to collect or a monster to kill. As in any RPG, our characters earn experience points after each fight, points that are used to level them up (with all the benefits of the case: more life points and magic points, new spells, etc., etc.). The clashes are random, in the sense that each section of the map has its own creatures, which return to their place every time you return. As the level of our characters increases, the degree of challenge also increases: the enemies become stronger and more resistant, giving us a hard time but consequently giving us a greater number of experience points. After each quest, you return to the village to collect the fruits of the mission (which often results in the acquisition of particular objects) and to spend the money collected on weapons, armor and so on. Technically, Elven Chronicles is well done without any sharp details. Let's say that it boasts graphics that are functional to the game mechanics: well-designed but poorly animated sprites (the creatures aren't animated at all...), nice effects for spells and locations without infamy or praise. And the sound sector boasts good quality music, which accompanies the action in the best way. Unfortunately there is the problem of very frequent loading, with each change of scene, which, despite being rapid, take away a lot of dynamism from the gaming experience. For the rest, the control system works perfectly and it is possible to extricate oneself well even in the complicated menus of the characters. No problem during the fights, which take place in turns and therefore do not require a particularly sensitive input device.
