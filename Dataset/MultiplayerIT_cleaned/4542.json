This is what happened in the now distant 2011 in L.A. Noire, the result of a troubled development and the work of the never too late Team Bondi paired with Rockstar Games. THERE. However, Noire was also lucky enough to experience, during this generation of consoles, not one but two revenges. We told you about the first one yesterday, and it happened thanks to the brute power of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The second, however, is due to the skilful work of porting and adaptation on a completely different hardware: that of Nintendo Switch. Drop the gun and keep the Joy-Con in sight So far, the relationship between third party titles and Nintendo Switch has taken the right direction, in view of ever-increasing support, but it has also been marked by mixed results. They range from the excellent The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim that arrives in these days, to RiME, which is already a lot if it manages to start. THERE. Noire demonstrates that the landing on the hybrid console is absolutely possible, that compromises are necessary, substantial revision and adaptation works, but that the result can abundantly repay the wait, requiring, among other things, an honest price (in this case around 40 EUR). Maybe from L.A. Noire you will already know everything if you frequent our pages, but it is worth refreshing your memory once again. The game conceived by Brendan McNamara transports us to the fascinating and dark Los Angeles of the Second World War, an entrepreneurial city, home to the nascent cinema, banking and enterprising spirit, but also to the underworld, prostitution and drugs. In this combination of dignity and corruption, we take on the role of Cole Phelps, accompanying him from promotion to promotion from the role of a simple patrol officer to that of a veteran among Los Angeles detectives. All within an open world that faithfully reconstructs places, buildings and even the clothing of the forties, thanks to a meticulous work of historical documentation. Shootings, adrenaline-pumping chases and more thoughtful investigative cases can be tackled in TV Mode with a resolution in 1080p and 30 fps; switching to portable mode, the former drop to 720, maintaining an identical frame rate. But we have already anticipated that it is not the power that marks the difference compared to the counterparts, but the excellent job of adapting the game controls. All the potential of the Nintendo Switch controls and all the exclusive features of the console are called into question, none excluded. We can, for example, use the Joy-Con by exploiting the movement commands and the gyroscope, to ~get our hands~ in the true sense of the word on the crime scene, collecting and rotating the objects of interest. It's just one of the possibilities: even when using the Joy-Con with traditional control systems, full support for Rumble HD has been introduced, to receive faithful tactile feedback in real time. Climbing on a gutter we will feel the movements of the hands, starting a car the roar and the crackling of the engine. They are small details, but they enhance the player's identification with the certain actions he is called to perform. Los Angeles always with us The game controls in TV Mode and Tabletop are a welcome added value, but what might lead to the purchase of L.A. Noire on Nintendo Switch is clearly the portability factor. Removing the console from the dock we can have Los Angeles and Cole's cases always with us, a highly alienating experience on a par with Skyrim and Doom: we are not yet used to the idea of playing on the train or for a walk with titles of this caliber, of such significant dimensions. And at the same time it is still a source of wonder to see how the gaming experience comes out almost renewed, corroborated: as if they were new titles, never seen before. In portable mode it is also possible to take advantage of the Nintendo Switch touch screen for an experience impossible to achieve elsewhere, which in fact enriches L.A. Noire of real point and click mechanics, pushing the genre towards hybridization. The touch mechanics are particularly useful during interrogation sessions, where we will be able to select the actions that Cole can perform using texts on the screen, now enlarged compared to the original edition. This without counting the equally functional possibility of rotating the shot by simply pressing (and then dragging) anywhere on the screen. The portable mode, however, also has a not particularly noble value: disguising a technical yield that inevitably feels the weight of its six years ofold age, and which has been enhanced to a lesser extent than the versions dedicated to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In L.A. TV Mode Noire suffers, in open environments, from annoying and evident pop-up effects, textures in certain cases very coarse, significant drops in frame rates in crowded places and in the most agitated moments. It goes a little better moving inside the buildings, with perfectly studied light and shadow effects. Fortunately, all this on the small portable screen is less noticeable, and the best way to enjoy the title on Nintendo Switch is therefore to play it on the road, console in hand. But the flaws remain, and we must point them out. Even if, noting all the efforts made for the conversion, perhaps we could also turn a blind eye.", "date": "2017-11-17", "grade": "8.0"}
