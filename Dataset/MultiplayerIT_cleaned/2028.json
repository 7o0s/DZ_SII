{"name": "Britney's Dance Beat", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/britneys-dance-beat.html", "text": "The Queen of International Pop What perhaps few, including the editor of this review, did not imagine, is that Thq, a well-known brand for Moto Gp on PC and Xbox and the (soon to be such) bilogies of Summoner and Red Faction, has acquired the image rights of the puppet in question to make it a rhythm game, entrusted to the hands of Metro Graphics, the development team that gave birth to the hilarious Bust A Move saga (from us Bust A Groove), perhaps the best video game saga to the rhythm of music on Sony consoles (and not only, one might say) . The following paragraphs have the task of revealing how effective said union has proved to be. Baby (NOT!) One More Time! An intro that will certainly be seen and revised ad libitum by fans of the young Spears introduces us to the actual game, unfortunately not up to expectations (it is good to put your hands forward right away): first of all the songs present are only 5 (five!!), a pittance taking into account the capacity of a DVD and the enormous discography of Britney Spears: in order, ~Baby One More Time~, ~Oopps!...I Did It Again~, Stronger, Overprotected, I'm Slave For You, with some of these remixed tracks (for the menus, the extra films, etc.), represent the videogame offer packaged by Metro Graphics, to which are added various extra cutscenes to unlock as you rack up victories on the dancefloor against your opponent, one of six newbie dancers. Unlike the aforementioned Bust A Move saga, each character does not have his own particular style of dance, so the choice of your alter ego is merely accessory; the game concept involves pressing the keys when a cursor, which moves clockwise, passes over the icons of the various keys on the pad; collecting combo after combo (i.e. lots of perfectly executed dance moves one after the other) is the only way to win the opponent while the reward for the most deserving in this sense is the presence, for a few seconds, of a polygonal version of Britney on the dancefloor instead of the 2 hard-earned piles of polygons and textures of the moment. Baby (NOT!) One More Time! Initially very easy (pressing a single key), Britney's Dance Beat becomes considerably more difficult (pressing the 4 keys of the pad and the directional crosses) already when dancing with the notes of ~Stronger~, leading the singer's fans to unlock behind-the-scenes and extras (like a concert, where you can zoom around and move the camera) by competing against the easiest to dance to in the background. Too bad OopsI Did It Again (SADLY) Britney's Dance Beat is not exempt from criticism even technically: obviously the songs present cannot be judged except in an extremely subjective way: whoever writes these lines adores most of the singer's records, feeling profound repulsion for ~Stronger~, so to speak, but certainly the assessment of the sound side of the game (in this case of extreme importance) is left to the individual player. OopsI Did It Again (SADLY) Excellently implemented the various digitized voices, primarily that of our Britney Spears. Coming to the graphics, the plays of light are remarkable as opposed to the almost non-existent shadows of the dancers, the discreet number of polygons of the characters, the textures used to cover them, of just sufficient quality and the bad backdrops, permeated by a low definition (except video clips that are streamed from a screen, in fmv). Needless to say, aliasing, although to a lesser extent in games like Virtua Fighter 4, unfortunately peeps out here too. (NOT) Overprotected Britney's Dance Beat is a rhythm game that would have been well done if it hadn't had the obvious limitations of gameplay and longevity, mentioned here. The modest technical realization and the appetizing extras that can be unlocked (unfortunately) only gradually as you play do not help the Thq game to recover, it being understood that for every Spears fan, it is a practically obligatory purchase, provided you want to bear the expense for this expensive gadget. Pros: Britney Spears songs Lots of extras Cons: Britney Spears songs Few songs Gameplay not exciting Lots of extras .but few will try their hand at the feat The Queen of International Pop Ascent to the greatest honors (and an inevitable appearance even in The Simpsons), the very young Britney Spears certainly did not think, in her debut with the highly popular hit ~Baby One More Time~ of becoming, in a short time, the current queen of pop international. Millions of diswho sold how many the number of drooling kids on the air of one of his many video clips, liters and liters of rapidly descending drool of the most thirsty when they find (dubious) links of their favorite naked artist and so on.", "date": "2002-08-26", "grade": null}
