{"name": "Il Cavaliere Oscuro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-cavaliere-oscuro_a.html", "text": "Acclaimed by audiences and critics as one of the best films of recent years, certainly the best of those dealing with the theme of superheroes, ~The Dark Knight~ makes us find Gotham City just as we left it, that is, protected by a caped crusader who he has to contend with criminals wholly out of the ordinary. Threatening the city this time is the Joker, played by a masterful Heath Ledger: mad like few others, this character did not go into hiding for mere economic gain, but for a real vocation. Will Batman's strength and attorney Harvey Dent's courage be enough to put an end to his reign of terror? You will find out by seeing the film, it is clear, and you will be able to retrace the plot (in summary...) with this mobile reduction of The Dark Knight, signed once again by the prolific developers of Glu. In the videogame field, we are certainly not faced with the first Batman tie-in: the DC Comics character, created by Bob Kane, has been the protagonist of an unspecified number of games since the second half of the 80s. Probably one of the best titles was the transposition of the film in the NES version, released in 1989: fantastic. The Dark Knight presents itself as a 2D scrolling fighting game, a genre that is now all the rage when it comes to translating an action story into a mobile environment (see also the excellent The Bourne Conspiracy, made by Vivendi Games Mobile) and which works damn well on mobile, dodging the limits that the joystick has highlighted with the conversions of titles such as Double Dragon or Final Fight, which, unlike this tie-in, allow you to move the character in three dimensions. A little less freedom shouldn't discourage, however, especially when the work is done competently: in this sense, this new Glu-branded production immediately proves to be rich in depth and technically more than adequate, with a Batman in great shape, capable of dispensing combos of kicks and punches, blows from behind, devastating holds, sudden attacks and so on, all using only the 5 key in combination with the joystick. The platform elements are not lacking, and they call into question the classic grappling hook of the bat man, with which we will be able to reach the roofs of the buildings and possibly swing after having hooked a handhold, to then glide towards otherwise unreachable areas. The developers have even included a hint of stealth: in the presence of electric lights, the batarang icon will start flashing and we will be able to launch the weapon to destroy them. At that point, hiding in a dark recess, we will be able to wait for the arrival of an enemy and suddenly pounce on him, putting him out of action with a single move where, normally, even a short exchange of blows would be necessary. The graphics of the game can't compete with the best products made by Glu, above all Shadowalker (still unsurpassed in the mobile action game genre), but it is well above the average. Batman has a good set of animations, he is certainly static in his ~plastic poses~ (especially when he uses the grappling hook) but he makes up for it during the fights, when he shows off very convincing though never too fluid movements. The henchmen, who represent the bulk of the enemies we will face, are divided into at least three or four different types, and each one has peculiar characteristics as regards the modus operandi: some are extremely easy to knock out, others must necessarily be grabbed, others still they can hurt us with clubs and must be hit while wielding them. The sound sector, unfortunately, does not boast the same quality: some fairly well-made music is accompanied by a few sampled effects, which however can generate slowdowns when reproduced.
