The most trivial example that comes to mind is WipEout, the futuristic racer created by Psygnosis in the early 90s, in which you had to face tracks full of hairpin bends and acceleration ramps, memorizing the tracks so as to know every detail, exploit its advantages and avoid its pitfalls. The same can be said for ~tube racers~ such as Proun+, i.e. games in which you don't necessarily control a vehicle but still find yourself in a context in which it is important to understand what to do and when to do it, putting memory and reflexes to the test . Available on the App Store at the price of 3.59 euros, and also arriving on Google Play and the eShop for Nintendo 3DS, the title created by Engine Software has a rough and surly initial impact, with inevitable episodes of frustration which, however, soon they leave room for the mechanics that form the basis of a more multifaceted gameplay than one would expect. From the point of view of a race between four ~spheres~, our task is in fact to travel the track by rotating the view to avoid obstacles and therefore maintain the highest possible average speed, crossing the finish line first or in any case on the podium . Every mistake results in a potentially fatal slowdown, so in the end it is a ~do or die~ that leaves little room for interpretations and luck, even if the latter never fails. Proun+ combines the immediacy of the arcade-style ~tube racer~ with a gameplay that is anything but trivial The crazy ride The Proun+ control system allows you to choose between three different settings: the first sees you ~turn~ to the left or right by using the touch screen on the two sides, while further down there are the buttons for the brake (on the left) and for the boost (right); the second operates a virtual analog stick left or right, with brake and boost buttons on the other side; finally, the third is based on the accelerometer, so you have to tilt the device to ~steer~ and touch the screen only to brake and use the boost. All three layouts have strengths and weaknesses, although perhaps the most reactive and precise is the one that uses the virtual stick, given that it allows very rapid trajectory changes and the convenience of being able to act separately on the brake. Whatever our preferences, the gameplay of the game does not change and we must pay the utmost attention to the development of the track, memorize its characteristics and try, perhaps after a few attempts, to obtain victory. This also includes the functionality of the aforementioned boost, which is activated when our driving is clean and allows us to take advantage of an extra cue, to be exploited, however, only when the situation allows it, or in the absence of obstacles that are difficult to avoid proceeding at great speed. This simple but solid play system is placed within a rich and well thought out structure, which unlocks new tracks and modes as we gain experience and obtain victories, focusing on a minimum of variety with challenges and bonuses, but remaining for mostly anchored to the initial dynamics. The graphics are beautiful, openly inspired by the works of El Lissitzky, adjustable according to the capabilities of our device (there are two presets, high quality and low quality), fluid and full of fascinating geometries; and the same can be said of the musical accompaniment, even if it is sometimes a bit repetitive.", "date": "2014-12-12", "grade": "8.0"}
