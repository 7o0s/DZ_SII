The early release compared to the Japanese counterpart (Winning Eleven), the landing also on PlayStation 3, the presence of finally adequate and fierce competition. The sixth chapter, last year, had not sparked in the 360 edition, and after our in-depth test we can anticipate that the problems have been solved for the most part from the point of view of the actual gameplay, but much less as far as it's about the online and side options. Presentation and menu But let's go in order, after the short introductory movie you are projected towards the menu, quite meager, which allows you to select the various existing game modes, once again not daughters of the PlayStation 2 version (which you can read about in the separate box) but of the aforementioned previous chapter for 360. We start with the exhibition, which inexplicably does not allow the dispute of a session of penalties only, with all the usual settings for the series, such as the choice of weather conditions, the conditions of the players, duration of the match, the type of ball and the stadium, among the fifteen present. In addition to the possibility of playing cups and fantasy tournaments, the flagship remains the Master League, which in truth has undergone only marginal improvements compared to the past, with a slightly deeper management of transfers, some additional touches such as interviews with players and the initial choice of starting the season by impersonating real teams with or without fictitious players or even with a brand new team that can be customized in every small detail, starting from the logo up to the uniform and the type of stadium. It therefore remains an excellent mode, but we doubt that it will be undertaken by the old players of the series, by virtue of the few innovations present. On the other hand, the editor is really well made, which allows you to create the players in the smallest details and several dozen parameters related to the physical characteristics, the movements and even the celebrations, selectable from a shortlist of seventy-four. In addition to all these options there is the possibility of using the EyeToy/PlayStation Eye for PS3, the Vision Camera for 360 and any USB webcam for PC, in order to use your own photo to be modeled around the player's face . We've tried it ourselves and the results have been mixed, is it the game or our ugly face? The objectives are common to all versions of the game and obviously integrated with the gamertag as regards the 360, and range from winning the first game to scoring three hat-tricks up to playing 50 online games, all quite achievable by spending several hours with the game. Lastly, training is much more meager, which is limited to the choice of the type of exercise to be tackled. The overall picture therefore, even adding the online which we will talk about later, is not the most satisfactory, largely unchanged from the past and indeed lacking in some options present on the PlayStation 2 version. But how to play? However, Pro Evolution Soccer's fame was built on its simulation of a football match, the sensations it manages to convey to the player, as well as the extreme fun it provides. Once on the field, many of the bad sensations that arose from last year are no longer perceptible, the 2008 version of the Konami soccer game is a pleasure to play, with a reproduction of the match that explodes especially when two human opponents are playing against each other. The players have taken off that sense of heaviness of the past and the response of the commands is incredible and has not yet been achieved by any other competitor. The animations are even more beautiful, increased in number and always credible, the collisions are excellent and goodies such as the jerked shirts and so on. The variety obviously benefits from all this, which is especially noticeable in the actions that can be taken close to the penalty area or in the types of goals scored after just a few games played. Another novelty lies in the introduction of the simulation, which can be activated by pressing the two left backbones in addition to the upper right one. However, its use is quite difficult in excited actions and if not performed perfectly it leads to a warning precisely for simulation itself. The last improvement, the most interesting one, is the enhancement of the artificial intelligence of the players controlled by the CPU, here called Teamvision and which, at least according to the developers, allows the teamopponent to adapt to the player encountered. Although we have not fully encountered this feature, the difficulty, especially at the two highest levels, seemed better and more calibrated than in the past, with the opposing players decidedly aggressive and able to cover the field in the best way. Of graphics and sound However, there are cons, and they are all aimed at the speed of the game, which is a bit excessive and makes the simulation needle lean too much towards the arcade. Especially when you are in command of the strongest and most representative players, it is possible to sneak between two or three players through too nervous and unrealistic dribbling, or even to make efforts in undisturbed 50-meter strides, mostly managing to change direction without being reached by opposing players. This ~problem~ can be greatly mitigated when two very experienced people collide with the game, but in fact a lower speed would have helped to make the game even more realistic and would have eliminated these annoying defects. From here we refer to the technical sector, which unfortunately is not of the same level as the purely played one. Paradoxically, it gives its best in close-up views, thanks to the excellent reproduction of the players and gems such as the folds on the shirts, it continues to enrapture thanks to the various and credible animations, but it breaks down in the reproduction of stadiums and fans, below average , and in the textures, passable but nothing more. In reality, the biggest disappointment starts from the PlayStation 3 version, which suffers from obvious clicks in all views except the basic one, certainly children of poor optimization but which affect those who do not use the aforementioned distant view. Inexplicable then, and here are also the PC versions (on medium or low-end computers) and 360, the shots during the scenes entering the field and during the replays, which go to bless the beauty of watching an action that has just ended and appreciate all the animations of the case. The reality is that, in our opinion, the graphics engine that moves the game is too tied to that of the older generation: it would have to be heavily rewritten in order to no longer run into the same problems and finally propose an adequate glance and in line with the sensations that the title returns by playing. Also because even the sound sector is not memorable, with 59 quite catchy audio tracks but with often anonymous choirs and above all with the commentary in Italian that is not very expressive and at times almost annoying, so much so as to induce it to be deactivated as soon as possible. Online, what's wrong with me... The PlayStation 2 version As already happened last year, the PlayStation 2 version is the one to be preferred, unless you suffer in front of a naturally inferior technical sector, even if more optimized. Starting from the number of options and modes present, which include a training based on challenges and scores, the presence of the PES Shop to buy balls and uniforms and a section made up of missions and scenarios that must be completed, such as scoring within a certain amount of time or recover from a disadvantage. Even online (which also suffers from lag here) there are more modes, including the championship one, as well as more integrated chat management. Finally, the game speed is a little lower and therefore the realism of the game itself benefits from it. Consequently, add a few decimal points to the PS2 version in terms of votes, for a commercially conceivable choice, incomprehensible due to the bugs and shortcomings present in the other versions. Comment Judging Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 is a hell of a nut to crack, especially given the many things that should have been but aren't. The heart of the game is the same as always and still remains the reference in terms of simulating a football match, above all thanks to the extreme variety and fun that the game causes once the pad is in hand. Too bad that Konami's latest effort has to juggle various problems, shortcomings and bugs, which make the experience perfect only under certain conditions and mainly by challenging other human opponents. In strict order, the PC versions (with a good pad) and 360 are to be preferred, finally the PS3 version, for which a few decimal points can be removed from the vote if you usually play with different visuals from the basic one. Considering the price to pay for this version and the fact that the competition is making great strides, we wouldn't be surprised if for someone the choice of their football simulation could fall elsewhere. Pro Solid and polished gameplay Variety and animations at the highest level In two is unrivaledCons Technical sector below average. Online scarce and plagued by bugs.
