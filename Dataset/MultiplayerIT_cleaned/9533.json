Thanks above all to being developed with the iPhone as a single reference platform, the fifth chapter of the Gameloft franchise had marked a decent step forward compared to those that had preceded it, but with the recent release of the fantastic Real Racing 2, Asphalt 6 suddenly finds himself with his back against the wall, forced to offer an over the top experience in order not to be defeated by the battle. Or, at least, not to come out with too much broken bones. The French team thus decided to play everything on speed and adrenaline, trying to overtake the competition with a blow of Nos on the straight. The competition of the big brands As per tradition, Asphalt 6: Adrenaline is a shamelessly arcade racing, fast and rude, in which you push the accelerator hard and tackle every curve in a drift. That would be enough to make any comparison with Real Racing 2's more simulation approach seem out of place, but the near-simultaneous December release inevitably led to a neck-and-neck for the crown of best iPhone racing game. The subtitle is this time due to the main novelty introduced by Gameloft and aimed at making each challenge even more frenetic: by collecting objects along the way or thanks to a reckless guide made up of leaps into the void and skids, the Nos va man indicator hand filling. Normally the player is able to use nitrogen to gain powerful acceleration, but once the gauge is full the Adrenaline mode can be activated: the scenery becomes entirely monochrome, the car takes a long and impressive boost, while opponents are highlighted in red and made easily visible. For the entire duration of the Nos, in fact, the player's racing car is able to throw the other cars into the air simply by touching them, which throughout the career sometimes proves to be useful and sometimes indispensable. A kick in the teeth at realism, of course, but do you want to put the sensation of hurtling at 470 kilometers per hour along the streets of Los Angeles, transforming opposing cars into cans of Sprite? The single career leads to eleven different competitions, for a total of 55 challenges scattered among some of the most suggestive locations in the world. On the strength of the positive opinions received with the last chapters, Gameloft then decided to alternate once again traditional races with alternative challenges: ranging from the more classic timed matches to 1-on-1 duels, passing through the Collector mode, in which to collect a certain number of symbols along the way, or for the one called Elimination, where you have to knock out enough rival cars. From time to time, two objectives are then proposed to be completed during the same race, thanks to which you can earn stars that are useful for unlocking new cars, stickers and upgrades. Despite the discrete variety of situations, however, there is always the strange feeling, common to many racing games, that the opposing AI tends to cheat, going much slower when you are behind and much faster when you are in the front locations. If on the one hand this ploy helps to keep the challenge up until the last corner, on the other hand it tends not to fully reward the player's skill, and indeed risking making him lose an entire and flawless match for a single mistake made all the time. last bend. Nothing to say instead about the control system, improved compared to the previous chapter and completely customizable, giving the possibility to steer both by tilting the device and by touching a virtual steering wheel on the screen, where one or more touches allow you to activate the Nos and decide the power. On a motorcycle, things get a little more complicated and due to a decidedly rough handling, you have the feeling of driving a rocket that has gone mad and is ready to take off. The very high speed that is reached almost immediately, however, manages to mask the small graphic imperfections of the game. Let me be clear, the series has finally managed to get rid of the weight of an embarrassing framerate, while the support for Retina Display and the amount of objects that move on the screen help to enhance each track; yet it cannot be denied that, above all for the quality of the textures and the attention to detail, Asphalt 6 fails to impress as much as Real Racing 2 did, making each car look like a lacquered plastic model. However, there are some elements in which the Gameloft game equals or even surpasses all its rivals, starting with the weight of its licenses: with over 40 cars sporting big names such as McLaren, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Ducati and Ferrari, the new chapter of Asphalt offers the most varied and captivating car-motorcycle park among all the racing games on the App Store. Even the tuning system is much more substantial and varied than that of Real Racing 2, allowing you to upgrade your car, apply stickers or freely choose the color or opacity of the glass. Also, similar to the girlfriends introduced in Asphalt 5, a sponsorship system gives further cash and performance bonuses, although this is partially marred by the unbalanced cost of components, resulting in a turbo system for a Mini Cooper that costs exactly as much as that of a Bugatti Veyron. And the multiplayer mode? Unfortunately, once online, the title turns out to be disappointing: among all the challenges present in the career, the only proposal in this case is the traditional one, with 6 players who can challenge each other through Gameloft Live!. Not only is it a very small number when compared to the 16 opponents that can compete in Real Racing 2, but the impossibility of establishing a minimum or maximum speed limit often generates unbalanced matches, in which a respectful Nissan Nismo perhaps has to deal with a Lamborghini Murcilago made up.
