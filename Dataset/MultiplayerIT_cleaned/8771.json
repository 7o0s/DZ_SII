It is no coincidence that Jagged Alliance 2 is closely linked to Jagged Alliance: Back in Action, the remake with which the guys from BitComposer Games have decided to bring the series back to the PC scene more than ten years after the last time. Not an easy task, for a classic gameplay that now arriving on the market has required a modernization, also in the form of some choices that have made fans discuss over the past months. If from its side this Back in Action can also count on an isometric 3D view, the story and part of the original design remain unchanged, also including the various expansions but introducing a game system that is no longer turn-based. A double-edged game linked to its old ~parent~, and therefore awaited between doubts and hopes by the large group of people who loved Jagged Alliance. Back to Arulco Those who have played Jagged Alliance 2, as we said, will recognize many of the elements present in Back in Action, starting from its setting: in fact, the imaginary nation of Arulco returns, whose leader Enrico Chivaldori is accused of patricide by his own wife (very little loved), Deidranna Reitman, meanwhile seized the command line. In Prague, Chivaldori entrusts the task of reconquering Arulco to the Commander, the protagonist of the game together with his team of mercenaries that we are called to lead. To do this, the structure is the one already known: within a computer system, the player can choose which soldiers to recruit among the various profiles available (close combat expert, sniper, doctor, and so on), also assigning them to the various missions that make up the game. Everything closely recalls Jagged Alliance 2, so those who have already played it will become familiar in a second, even if the new features make the transition from the tutorial mandatory for everyone, thanks to which it is possible to learn efficiently and rather quickly all types of action that can be performed by their own teams. As we said, Back in Action presents some substantial innovations: the turn-based system has been abandoned by the developers, in favor of a setting devoted to real-time action, supported by what is called ~Plan & Go~ combat. In essence, it is a system with which it is possible to pause the game, giving your mercenaries a series of orders to be followed in succession to implement your tactics: the entry into this phase can be activated by the player, or set to happen automatically following certain events, such as the death of a character or discovery by an enemy. It is useless to deny at this point how the turn-based system of the original game may be missing from the most fundamentalist fans of the series, but it must be said that Plan & Go proves to be a good alternative, in a rather convincing action-turn-based mix. The role-playing-like component is also appreciable, thanks to which the mercenaries acquire experience to then spend on skill points. When there is no fog Going to Milan, Tot and Peppino worried about the fog: in Arulco instead there is no this type of problem, given that among the novelties of Jagged Alliance: Back in Action we find the removal of the fog of war, an element present in the already cited second chapter. The enemies are all visible, both by scrolling the game view and from the minimap present on the interface, where not only their exact position is even shown, but also the direction in which they are looking or moving, complete with movements in real time. The player therefore knows perfectly where the enemies are and can plan his own moves well in advance, thus making sense of the Plan & Go. The main element of challenge offered by the game is therefore constituted by the artificial intelligence of our opponents, intended to react to our movements in a position of both (numerical) advantage and (chronological) disadvantage. All this will sound almost like a blasphemy to the most consumed players of Jagged Alliance 2, but in the long run it must be said that the system developed by BitComposer, while substantially changing compared to the original concept, manages in part to convince: the enemies they move by patrolling the areas with skill, often showing themselves careful to track down our mercenaries. To tell the truth too much, given that it takes very little to find a fair amount of it on without understanding the pwhy. The Achilles heel of the entire system, however, is made up of artificial intelligence, sometimes too naive in falling into the player's trap to the point of making it child's play to kill enemies in real time, which unfortunately ends up diminishing the importance of coordinating actions with Plan & Go. Jagged Alliance 3D If for a game like Jagged Alliance 2 to be up to date from the point of view of game mechanics is not such a feat, given its extraordinary quality, from a technical point of view it obviously pays for the years of evolution that elapse between its release and Today. Well aware of all this, the developers have decided not to overly distort the original visual, changing the interface (some will say for the worse) and maintaining the isometric framing to which they are applied the now ubiquitous three dimensions. The result is a motor that is certainly affordable for a large number of configurations, with the possibility of managing the camera between rotations and zooms, even if the latter appears a bit too limited, both going into a wide shot and narrowing the shot . In reality, this solution could also be a way to remedy some shortcomings in the general graphic rendering, given that a good attention to the details of rooms, buildings and terrains of different types responds to somewhat ~plastered~ models for protagonists and objects external. On the other hand, nothing to complain about the sound, which largely follows the one appreciated in the original.", "date": "2012-02-09", "grade": "7.0"}
