The History section in particular helps us shed light on the genesis of The Horror at MS Aurora. There we discover that in the southern Swedish port town of Karlshamn, a group of friends enrolled at the Blekinge Institute of Technology wanted to create a spectacular project for their dissertation. As it is as it is not, in 2011 they founded a software house with the name of 12 O'clock Studios and, what was supposed to remain a prototype born among the university desks, instead becomes the first of a series of commercial video games. Thus we find ourselves in our hands The Horror at MS Aurora, a title that, according to the developers, had to satisfy three requests: a high-level production, a three-dimensional game environment and a plot capable of supporting the action. Naturally it had to be a horror game, because the developers wanted to create a title that lasted about as long as an average horror film, so as to provide players with an alternative to the classic evening movie, the kind you watch in the dark with headphones, sitting in front of the PC or television. The premises were therefore excellent and the project undoubtedly aimed at creating an original format, but after the first moments of the game it becomes clear that the inexperience of the team and the lack of funds, perhaps invested with too much enthusiasm in the only two positive aspects of the game, the excellent soundtrack and the animations of the protagonist. For the rest, the MS Aurora is taking on water at a worrying speed. So let's try to figure out together where the flaws are. The Horror at MS Aurora is a failed attempt to make a great university thesis marketable A script to review The story begins with our hero, First Officer Frederick Kirk, calculating the course of the Aurora, a cargo ship crammed with containers that set sail from the Scandinavian peninsula on a common trade route. Now, we don't know much about ships, but it seems hard to believe that a big hull like the Aurora can sail with only four people on board. And this is the first aspect that made us raise an eyebrow. We later realized talking to the rest of the crew results in lackluster banter that doesn't leave us guessing anything about the real psychology of Kirk or his companions. The fact of being able to choose two tones in the answer doesn't change anything and above all it doesn't shed any light on the protagonist's inner conflicts, which are simply absent. Kirk is an unpretentious adventure story hero, engaged only in the fight against a monster. The captain seems like a good family man but, in the only noteworthy interaction with Kirk, he decides to leave him the controls of the ship for the first time in an absurdly difficult situation, such as navigating by sight between icebergs. Either way: either the captain is out of his mind, or steering a ship is child's play. of wanting to condense the adventure into barely sixty minutes of play. A feat that perhaps veterans of the genre like Telltale would have succeeded. To buy time, the developers have chosen to eliminate the cinematic sequences, leaving the player the possibility to interact during the narrative phases, but if the intention is excellent, the execution is awkward. Here's an example: a dialogue between the Aurora's sea dog and the ship's doctor should give us a hint of background. Perfect. But in the meantime, what do we do? We prepare the coffee by pressing the keys that we see appearing on the screen, a useless sequence that tells us nothing about Kirk and also as involvement leaves the time it finds. Delays of this kind are present in quantity, especially in the first half of the game. Later, when the monster finally appears, trivial Quick Time Events allow us to escape its attempts while we try to restart the generator or run away. The escape sequence or the exploration in the dark with the flashlight could and should have been moments of tension, while instead the pathos is almost completely absent. And when we finally reach the climax of the story, a dramatic gesture completely out of proportion to the type of character we have been shown up to that point makes an otherwise dramatic scene grotesque, leaving us with an image of Kirk that is more sinister than heroic. Maestro music (at least that one) For the soundtrack, 12 O'clock Studios were able to count on the skill of the Belarus Philharmonic Orchestrara. There's no debating this point: from the splendid opening music to the percussion hits that punctuate the confrontations with the monster, The Horror at MS Aurora doesn't miss a note. Kirk's animations are also smooth and convincing, thanks to hours spent with Imagination Studios' Motion Capture. Important capital investments that further highlight the rough edges of the game, such as low-resolution textures, rudimentary light and shadow effects, which show us night screens where you can barely see the character, and environments made squalid by the lack of details. It's a shame because the technical limits collide with a fresh and unusual graphic style, almost cartoonish, perhaps unsuitable for a horror game, but certainly personal and noteworthy. We are referring to the faces of the characters, the only prominent element in an otherwise mediocre graphic sector. The game system however, as you may have guessed at this point, is all based on simple Quick Time Events. Unfortunately the same system, without the pressure of time limits, has also been adopted for useless delays, such as the sequence in which Kirk checks all (we repeat: all) the containers lined up on the deck of the ship, or the aforementioned stunt with the coffee . It's a little better during the fights with the monster, but there is a sequence during which its tentacles chase us and we have to press the keys to make them appear on the screen. Maybe it's a mistake, but it cost us a lot of time: we thought we were going to die because of the wrong route we were following. Only when we dropped our hand angrily on the keyboard was the mystery of the keys to be pressed even in the absence of an input revealed. And speaking of road, the path to follow is clear, linear and without surprises, from start to finish. At this point, however, an inexplicable fact remains: despite the obvious flaws, The Horror at MS Aurora is not a disaster. There's something just right under the rough surface of the game. It will be due to the fact that it begins, develops and ends following an elementary but solid logic, it will be the curious graphic style, or perhaps simply the feeling that there is a lot of effort and good ideas waiting to mature behind it. In the hope that the developers of 12 O'clock Studios treasure their mistakes, we are therefore waiting to see what the second game in the series will be. We can only advise you to do the same.", "date": "2013-10-03", "grade": "5.0"}
