{"name": "Flashout 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/112274-flashout-3d-non-chiamatelo-wipeout.html", "text": "In times of expensive fuel, the idea of driving futuristic vehicles that use the earth's magnetic field to move appears, despite the objective impossibility, even more attractive; however, the fascination of anti-gravity cars has already been exploited for years, at least in the videogame field, perhaps reaching the highest peak of excellence with the historic Wipeout series by Studio Liverpool. Present on every Sony gaming platform, including portables (Pure and Pulse on PSP, 2048 on Vita), the frenetic all-European title represented a real point of reference for many fans, remaining in fact the only exponent of the noteworthy kind. Frantic but with a granite framerate, technical but always fun, Wipeout has been able to make the most of every generation of games, taking incredible advantage of HD graphics and above all of online, integrated in a completely natural way. Flashout 3D is nothing more than its clone for Apple and Android platforms, certainly not the first but probably one of the best in terms of final realization. Puncture proof In Flashout 3D, a Wipeout fan will find virtually nothing surprising, starting with the game mode selection menus: Career, Single Race and Time Trial. Challenge mode and Multiplayer, while present in the interface, will be made available soon with a free update. The design of the (only) 5 available ships, to be unlocked by advancing with the career, is also heavily inspired by the ~base~ models present in the title intended for Sony platforms; we are talking about the basic model because, as is known, in the last Wipeouts each car ~manufacturer~ had several models of the same aircraft, optimized according to the type of race to be tackled (~armored~ model for elimination challenges, super light for timed ones , psychedelic for zones, and so on). Here, on the contrary, the vehicles are unique, albeit subject to small upgrades. Just the improvements that can be purchased in the garage represent the first reason for concern, given that they are basically weapons or upgrades that can be found as normal power ups on the various tracks. The strategic advantage therefore consists in starting the race with, for example, the turbo, missiles or shield already activated but, once the effectiveness is over, you will return to the same condition as the other pilots. The conformation of the 7 tracks is obviously more than inspired by what was seen in Wipeout, however the hairpin bends and the breathtaking gradients that drive fans of the Studio Liverpool game crazy are missing. The result is therefore a feeling of general flatness, a choice however forced by the fact that the ships, not having standard airbrakes, cannot make too tight curves by limiting themselves to the reach of the virtual rudder. The ~timed~ use of the air brakes, as all enthusiasts know, is also essential for correcting wrong trajectories at the last minute; in Flashout 3D, however, the entire part dedicated to controlling the vehicle is limited to turning right or left, not even being able to adjust the automatic acceleration as desired. The controls, entrusted to the sensitive accelerometers, however perform their task very well, even better than the PS Vita counterparts of Wipeout 2048; the same thing cannot be said of the virtual sticks, which lose miserably against the physical ones and which we obviously advise not to use. Also missing are both the tricks and tricks that in Wipeout allowed us to gain precious seconds, and an optimized management of weapons, impossible to discard. Particularly annoying is the fact that by passing over a power up of a weapon, it is automatically collected and replaced in place of the one supplied, even if it is lower in power. Autopilot, shield and turbo have at least separate slots. The upgrades are therefore almost identical to those of the inspiring title (the leech ray, the earthquake, the plasma, the bombs and mines are missing, which however we find scattered as random obstacles on the slopes) but different, and yet very much, are the effects of use. Poor explosions, barely sketched turbo effect, no particular energy aura for using the shield; everything seems reduced to a minimum, perhaps in order to preserve, and this must be acknowledged, the incredible fluidity of the game. Also on the graphics in general there is little to say: a good glance at a glance, at first glance it even seems very accurate, but a still image is enough to see how washed out the textures are and how little detail is present on the track and on the means. However, it remains enjoyable, also because the moments in which you can admire the landscape from a standstill are very few.", "date": "2012-12-20", "grade": "7.8"}
