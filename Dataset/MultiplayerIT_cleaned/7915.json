A good number of users had to wait a long time and several updates before the fantasy world of Arrowhead Game Studios became at least usable. Yet if you looked closely, but very carefully, since launch it was possible to glimpse a cooperative action with enormous potential, thanks to the union of a strong sense of humor, light-hearted gameplay and an intriguing system that allowed you to combine your own spells to create new ones. After a couple of years, as many million copies sold and a handful of expansions, the franchise has finally left the confines of the PC market, landing on iOS and Android devices. However, it does so not with a simple porting of the original, but with an ad-hoc chapter that tries to rework the characteristic elements of the original Magicka by proposing them in an even lighter guise, which meets tactile devices but above all different users that hangs out in the App Store and Google Play. Magicka Magicka Emi The way Wizards of the Square Tablet tries to reinvent Magicka is evident from the first glance at the game. Leaving behind the polygonal graphics and top-down view typical of action RPGs such as Diablo and Torchlight, this new chapter prefers to adopt a 2D horizontal scrolling setting. Classics such as Golden Ax and Final Fight, or the more recent Castle Crashers, immediately come to mind, and in fact the new Paradox title works in the same way, occasionally interrupting the player's advance with small groups of creatures to eliminate. The main difference obviously lies in the combat system which draws heavily on what has already been seen from the original PC chapter: the player has seven magical elements at his disposal that can be used to inflict damage on opponents or to defend his alter-ego, but at any time, and without any mana limit, it is possible to create more or less powerful combinations, mixing the various elements to obtain a completely new effect. The element of Life is usually used to heal oneself or one's allies, but combined with the element of Fire it can unleash a powerful incandescent beam against enemies. The next level of this mechanic is given by the so-called Magicks, special spells that require a combination of elements performed in a particular order: obviously the effect of the Magicks is often much more devastating, giving life to snowstorms, unleashing meteor showers or allowing your character to teleport. Adding further depth are character status changes and how these affect the effectiveness of spells: a burning ally can be ~snuffed out~ with a splash of water, but a drenched player cannot use electric attacks if you don't want to be electrocuted. Compared to the original Magicka there was a slight skimming in the number of elements available (the Arcane is missing) and in the quantity of combinable elements (four instead of five), but overall the developers managed to perfectly convert the mechanics and the feeling of the original, albeit on a different platform and with a new game structure. The company of the bathrobe The touchscreen control system works great: with a touch anywhere in the scenario you indicate where to move your character, while to manage spells you select the various elements and touch directly on the enemy to hit or on the area where direct the shot. If anything, the problem arises in the multiplayer mode, the beating heart of Wizards of the Square Tablet. Especially when facing the levels in the company of three other players, the action can become excessively frenetic and confusing, thanks to the possibility of inflicting damage on one's teammates. One thing that we have also noticed in the other online players is that the slowness in moving discourages moving if it is not really necessary: the result is that more often than not there is an allied sorcerer in the trajectory of one's spells, and paradoxically changing target becomes a more convenient option than moving to another location. Yet it is precisely in the multiplayer that Magicka enjoys the most, to the point that it is sad to note the absence of Versus modes similar to those of the PC chapter. The chaotic cooperative sessions almost make you forget a campaign which, although playable with two different levels of difficulty, remains so short as to poter to be completed within a couple of hours. Alternative clothes and equipment must then be purchased using the credit collected between levels, but the player can easily finish the entire campaign without ever accessing the in-game shop.", "date": "2013-04-05", "grade": "8.0"}
