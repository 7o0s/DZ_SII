{"name": "Hearthstone: La sfida di Rastakhan", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hearthstone-la-sfida-di-rastakhan-recensione.html", "text": "The Hearthstone cycle continues unabated, regardless of competitors or any missteps. Despite the decline in interest and in the number of players, a physiological situation for a card game already four years old aimed at a casual audience, Blizzard does not seem to have any intention of overturning a product that, up to now, has dramatically inflated the coffers of society. Even without the founding fathers, Hearthstone therefore continues its life cycle head on by giving players exactly what they expect. Rastakhan's Challenge is therefore no exception with its 135 cards (of which ninety equally divided class and forty-five neutral) and tries to carry on until next year, when the rotation of the expansions should finally be able to propose a fresh and more meta lively. We waited for things to calm down before writing this review to try to understand if, and how, the addition of the new cards would have really changed the decks that have had the good times and the bad times to date. 135 new cards, few really useful ones The first thing to do to verify the effectiveness of a CCG expansion is simply to observe how many of the new cards find room in the meta. Unfortunately in this The Challenge of Rastakhan aligns with Operation Apocalypse, making only a handful of cards really useful and indispensable. This time, however, the news touches all types of decks and if the old top tier decks continue to remain so with no - or very few - changes, other decks that struggled to get to the top of the rankings have risen by some steps. We are talking, for example, of a completely new shovel OTK, of a very strong spell hunter but also of an interesting dragon warrior who join new priests, discard locks and hunters based solely on beasts. A good amount of decks circulating and trying to make the games different, with satisfactory results for now. The real strength of this expansion, which does not have a very high power level, it must be said, will still be seen in a few weeks when the experiments end and we will fossilize again on a handful of decks to farm and reach the legend. If as a variety, at the moment, one cannot complain, it is the new mechanics that seem to be nothing in particular, and the thing that leaves us most disconcerted is the failure to introduce new keywords that have a real impact, which, unfortunately, has already been happening for several expansions. In short, if Assault has taken the place of Charge, to the great displeasure of those who loved to close with surprise combinations, the new Annihilation keyword still does not seem to be sufficiently characteristic. Basically this new keyword activates its effect if the damage generated exceeds that necessary to kill the target creature. It can be found on creatures, weapons, or even spells, and it's a simple extra effect that adds value to plays. It is a situational keyword and for this reason it will not find space in the future, at least not as much as Load, a keyword that instead works at any moment without the need for other correlated elements. Among the other novelties we find the Loa, spirits of the trolls endowed with special powers: with The Challenge of Rastakhan each class is assigned a Loa, usually a creature with zero attack, three health and immunity in the turn in which it is played, capable to give great value to the following cards. For example, the thief's Loa doubles all battle cries, making synergies with pirates or Kingsbane interesting, while the paladin's Loa allows you to summon creatures with the same cost as a newly cast spell. Currently they look like interesting cards and could come in handy in the future, but it's nothing compared to the power level offered by the Death Knights. As proof of what has been said, the first competitive tournaments return feedback that is not exactly exciting, with the pros still reluctant to experiment and look for solutions that can actually break the goal. In short, if you are waiting for the revolution of the game that will arrive only in April. An adventure for everyone The new single-player adventure completes the Rastakhan Challenge package, thanks to which it will be possible to obtain an exclusive back for our deck. This time, instead of having to complete it several times as it was for Kobolds and Catacombs, it will be enough to defeat the final boss once to grab the coveted reward. In pure Gurubashi theme, our adventurers will have to challenge eight trolls in sequence under the supervision of King Rastakhan and aided by the sanctuaries, exclusive cards of this competition with the most diverse effects. So everything takes place as forKobolds and Catacombs, with the player choosing a class (linked to his sanctuary) and then progressing gradually through the clashes building the deck with the reward cards that are provided to him. The bosses are inspired by the archetypes already seen on Hearthstone, such as the control shovel, the miracle rogue or the discard lock but obviously come with enhanced and much more complex versions to destroy. Sufficient therefore overall even if not particularly original or revolutionary: is it possible that the ideas for the single player mode have already run out after such a short time? Finally, we close by talking about the fluctuating quality of the artworks, which range as usual from some incredibly beautiful designs to others that are less detailed and cared for. Also from this point of view, in our opinion, an extra effort should be made given what the competition is offering in this period. Gwent has shown magnificent things, Magic has inspired artwork and well-curated animations not to mention Artifact which, among card games, remains probably the most beautiful to see. In short, from the next expansions of Hearthstone we really expect an extra gear.", "date": "2018-12-18", "grade": "7.0"}
