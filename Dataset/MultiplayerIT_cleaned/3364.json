{"name": "Narcos: Rise Of The Cartel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/narcos-rise-of-the-cartel-recensione.html", "text": "Kuju is a name known to some more attentive and experienced players, given the debut title was Train Simulator 2001 at the dawn of the millennium. Since then the London developer has worked more or less in the shadows, collaborating with other software houses for projects such as Dark Messiah of Might & Magic, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3. With Narcos: Rise of The Cartels, tie-in of the television series of the same name produced by Netflix whose review you read, he returns to face it in the first person, seven years after the discreet All Zombies Must Die. It is a turn-based strategy game set in Colombia that tells, from the point of view of detective Steve Murphy, the rise and fall of Patron Pablo Escobar. In reality there is also a second campaign, in which drug traffickers are controlled, which is only unlocked after completing the first missions which act as a long tutorial. Part of the films was made with the actors made famous by the production of the American giant; it is an added value that also captures the attention of those who have not followed the first season (the following ones could be added later via DLC). A traditional play structure Narcos is an old-fashioned strategy game: at the start of the game, the player positions his five men at the insertion points and must guide them to the completion of the required objectives, like pawns on a chessboard. Kuju's game also shares other rules with chess: for example, the opponent's position is known from the start and, above all, only one man can move at a time. The basic actions which are, move, attack (if an enemy is in line of fire), rest and reload; others become available as the unit gains experience. Some of these are mutually exclusive: for example, it is not possible to switch magazines and shoot in the same turn. This setting, initially destabilizing, differentiates the way of playing compared to the classic one of Xcom because it leads to sacrificing certain team members who will act as a decoy while allies are used to hit the exposed enemy. At the same time it makes shifts very fast both because the actions to be performed are limited and because the CPU has to deal with managing the movements of a single agent. The soldiers are divided into five categories: the demolishers, equipped with grenade launchers; the Colombian policemen, armed with a simple revolver; army soldiers holding a machine gun; special forces with assault rifles and DEA agents with their shotguns. It goes without saying that each means of offense is characterized by magazine capacity, range of effect, damage and precision. The roster needs to be refined: we found the grenadier too unbalanced, given that with its firepower it is able to make its companions practically useless; at the same time in some missions it seemed to us that some drug traffickers were too strong for any member of our team, apart from the demolisher who seemed to be the only available choice to win the mission. Artificial intelligence works in alternating phases: sometimes it is really ruthless and takes advantage of all the features available to its soldiers, while others leave them helpless for turns, giving the player the opportunity to prepare calmly before launching a new attack. The management part is missing Unfortunately, apart from the tactical part, Kuju's offer of the title is very limited. From the base camp you can simply heal or recruit soldiers, using the dollars earned at the end of the missions, but there is no way to develop new weapons or upgrade the structure. The missions to be tackled are chosen from the map, according to a scheme that sees us forced to complete some secondary tasks before unlocking an intermediate challenge whose success allows us to proceed in the plot. The tasks are the traditional ones that games of this genre have accustomed us to: resist the enemy assault for a certain number of rounds, collect clues, destroy cocaine reserves, escort a hostage, eliminate the leaders of the enemy faction. However, all this always and only translates into the elimination of any hostile; certain missions are made more difficult by the fact that, on a regular basis, new enemies appear on the battlefield. For the technical part, the versatile Unreal engine was used. The maps are small and poor in detail; the environment is not a variable to be exploited to create strategic advantages (grenades, for example, have no effect on the walls of a wooden hut or on a parked car), apart from the few cases in whichspread over several floors. The settings are varied and discreetly made: we go from tropical forests to urban guerrilla scenarios, without disdaining some interiors such as those of a casino or a villa. We would have liked to see a little blood splatter on the screen, considering the violent setting, and above all a slightly more detailed graphic sector: it is true that this is not the most important aspect for a turn-based strategy game, but, given the paucity of content, more work could have been done at least on this aspect. In terms of longevity, a dozen hours should be more than enough to complete the DEA campaign; value which, however, adds up to that of drug traffickers.", "date": "2019-11-19", "grade": "5.0"}
