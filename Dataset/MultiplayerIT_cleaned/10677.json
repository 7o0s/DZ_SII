{"name": "La serie Tales debutta su Xbox360!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tales-of-vesperia-la-serie-tales-debutta-su-xbox360.html", "text": "Tales of is one of the longest-lived and most appreciated Japanese jrpg ever in the history of this genre, and has seen the light on practically all consoles, from the Super Famicom to PSP, from GameCube to the current next-gen chapter on Xbox 360, the first in ~high definition~. Vesperia is the tenth incarnation of one of the most popular series in Japan and beyond, constituting the only real competition to Square Enix's role-playing sagas such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Star Ocean. Tales of differs from the classic jrpg for some key elements, including an anime-inspired character design, traditionally entrusted to the mangaka Kosuke Fugishima, and a very special combat system, born with the Phantasia chapter and called ~Linear Motion Battle System ~. The latter, with a strong action accent, abandoned the classic scheme of turn-based choices using window menus in favor of real-time combat that took place on the protagonist-enemy horizontal axis. With Tales of Symphonia the battle system was updated in 3D, giving the player the ability to rotate around enemies, while remaining stuck on a horizontal axis. The final evolution came with Abyss on Playstation 2, which allowed free running across the battlefield. This premise is necessary to be able to describe the model adopted by Vesperia, which takes its foundations from that of Abyss and inserts some improvements and innovations there. The system allows cooperation up to four players, all on the same screen through some multiplayer modes. Story is a big part of the jrpg experience Tales of Vesperia, like any good self-respecting Jrpg, pushes the accelerator on the narrative and the relationships between the characters, doing it in its own way in a very original and exhaustive way. The events tell of a world that depends on the ancient technology of the ~Bastia~, through which it manages to defend itself from evil creatures and natural disasters with barriers placed to protect the major cities. Terca Lumines is the scenario within which the adventures of Yuri and his travel companions take place, whose relationships are very intense, but not disturbed by adolescent themes as in Abyss, they are mature and never superficial, albeit with many dialogues and interludes purely comic in nature. The plot unfolds through hundreds of cut-scenes excellently made with the game's graphics engine, and other sequences animated by one of the most talented teams in the world: Production I.G., already authors of Ghost in The Shell and Kill Bill, as well as previous episodes by Tales of. Furthermore, at any time, by pressing the back button it is possible to activate semi-animated skits through which dialogues and mission objectives are explored. Thankfully, at least these sequences can be omitted at will. The main quest, very articulated, covers about 50 hours of play. The sub-quests equally, managing to almost double the longevity of Vesperia, and represent for once again an effective way to deepen the themes and the story that is intertwined in the main story, rather than an easy shortcut to artificially lengthen the life of the game. The roots of a remote past While representing the perfect incarnation of a modern jrpg, the heavy legacies borrowed directly from the first role-playing games are evident. The fights are not random, but follow what was already seen about 20 years ago in Zelda 2: Adventure of Link. The system, later also taken up by other games, is still today a satisfactory compromise between randomness and arbitrariness. In practice between city and city, dungeon and dungeon, the exploration of the world takes place through a sort of free-roaming (very limited, to tell the truth), within a 3D map to be crossed in real time. Enemies appear randomly in this area, but the fights only start if we touch them with our on-screen character and can therefore be avoided. The clashes, given their action nature, shift the player's attention to knowing the movements of the opponents rather than drawing up a strategy. Despite this, it is possible to freeze the action at any time to decide who to attack and observe their characteristics, open the main menu, assign spells, weapons and set up an offensive or defensive line. Vesperia adopts a battle system capable of satisfying both old fans, accustomed to drop-down menus, and newbies more accustomed to immediate action. Each character can develop certain ~arts~ and use personalized spells, in addition to the classic melee moves, making the clashes always varied and engaging. If the character controlled by us reaches an HP value of zero, the otherscomrades continue to fight alone, or they can revive us if they are able. The various skills are hundreds and by binding to the dozens of weapons available they make the game even more varied. The arts, on the other hand, are used to create ever-changing combos and attacks (air, melee, critical) and are obtained from the fusion of some skills or through particular quests. Moreover, there are also numerous ~finishing moves~, or end-of-match moves, which serve to finish off an already exhausted opponent just as if we were performing a Mortal Kombat fatality. The characterization of the characters is extreme: from the personality to the aesthetics, from the dialogues to the combos, passing through the technical characteristics of the attack to the defensive strategies. Xbox 360 goals Tales of Vesperia offers the canonical 1000 points to unlock, like any other Xbox 360 game, but what changes are the modalities. Almost half, 450 points, are obtained at the end of the game, while the rest are acquired gradually during the adventure through particular actions: creating a weapon, completely revealing the game map, activating particular skills. These are small satisfactions of 10 points, or 5 like each completed sub-quest. I Speak English Tales of Vesperia represents the techno-visual peak reached by the Cel Shading style, typically used when it comes to having to give a game the typical look of a cartoon. The next-gen use of polygons and effects, the wonderfully spot-on chromaticity and a sober but lively design characterized by a unique style, that of Fujishima, make Vesperia a real cartoon drawn in real time by the Xbox 360 graphics processor 60fps, no aliasing and no slowdown even in the most frenetic phases of the fights. The locations visited are very evocative, never banal and never cloying. The fantasy setting is recreated in detail, as regards countries, cities and environments. The interiors and dungeons are a little less cared for, often too bare and spartan. The world map has a very large horizon, is fully rotatable and is really large to visit in its entirety. The quality of the animations is excellent as regards the fights, a little less in the movements of the character and in some small details such as the lip during the spoken phases. Unfortunately Vesperia is entirely localized, dubbed and subtitled in English, with all due respect to those who are unfamiliar with the Anglo-Saxon language and would have greatly benefited from an Italian localization. In doing so, a good part of the charm of the story and of the relationships between the protagonists is lost: a fair slice of any self-respecting jrpg, in short. The soundtrack, again composed by Sakuraba, is slightly subdued. With the exception of Bonnie Pink's opening theme, the average quality of the music fluctuates and varies from good to ~already heard~, with endless loops and not very catchy themes that do not affect as happened in other chapters of the series. The voices chosen for the English edition are decidedly questionable, starting with which of the protagonist, perhaps too hoarse and mature for a young boy like Yuri.", "date": "2009-06-23", "grade": "8.0"}
