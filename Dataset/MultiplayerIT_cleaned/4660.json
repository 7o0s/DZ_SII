{"name": "Super Hydorah", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/188963-super-hydorah-super-hydorah-riparte-da-nemesis.html", "text": "Imagine a kid in an arcade with his face immersed in a cabinet (a large vertical box with a screen and a dashboard): with his left hand he holds a joystick, while with his right he presses buttons. He is controlling a small spaceship in which he takes on hordes and hordes of enemies in levels more treacherous than the bullets themselves. We are in the 80s and if the boy is good enough around him there will certainly be other human beings of his age who are admiring his evolutions or joking, but not too much, trying to bring him bad luck to end the game and be able to play them . One of the bosses: big, but not too bad In those years, videogame culture expressed itself one coin or token at a time, simultaneously creating social dynamics that remained indelibly imprinted on those who lived through them. Obviously every era has expressive forms that determine it and that are not erased over the years (at most they are replaced), ready to come back to the mind of adults every time one tries to compensate for some dissatisfaction with the present. Super Hydorah by Locomalito, Gryzor87 and Abylight Studios, a revised and corrected version of the freeware Hydorah (2010), is completely immersed in those atmospheres and from there, inevitably, it restarts both aesthetically and mechanically. It is a shoot'em up, or shump or classic shooter if you prefer in which, in command of a spaceship modeled on Gradius' Vic Viper (or Nemesis outside Japan), you have to face twenty-one levels full of enemies and, above all, references to countless other titles such as the aforementioned Gradius and Salamander (initially followed by Gradius, then became the progenitor of a spin-off mini-series) both by Konami, R-Type and X-Multiply by Irem, but also Aero Blaster and Kaneko's Heavy Unit, SNK's Last Resort, and so on. The graphic style itself is a pixel art inspired by the coin ops released between the first and second half of the 80s, with also the possibility of setting a CRT filter to recreate the feeling of the monitors used at the time, accompanied by music and effects sounds that would not have disfigured in the classics mentioned above. Hydorah For those intrigued by Super Hydorah, but not yet convinced of the purchase, we remind you that Hydorah, the freeware version of the game, can be downloaded for free and is excellent. Some weapons are missing and there are fewer levels, but it's still worth playing. If you are interested, you can download Hydorah by clicking here. Love for the 80s Talking about the plot of Super Hydorah is quite superfluous, given that it is the classic shooter plot useful only to justify the action. Briefly told, it's about an evil galactic empire that wants to invade Earth, and about us being everyone's only hope of salvation. In reality, at the beginning of the game we are quite limited in our arsenal, since we only have a front cannon and can fire missiles. The additional weapons, all of which can be upgraded by collecting bonuses left by the carcasses of the enemies, are unlocked by completing the levels, i.e. by defeating the bosses, usually large beasts of various shapes, which can be gigantic robots, or lethal flowers, or even octopuses spatial. Some steps are... complicated. Weapons are selected at the start of each level and include lasers, missiles to destroy ground emplacements, pods, beam cannons, and so on. In the levels it is also possible to collect bonuses that increase movement speed or give a protective barrier. There are also several super weapons, these non-upgradeable, characterized by single attacks of great power that usually help to get out of the most chaotic and dangerous situations. One of the best aspects of Super Hydorah is the way the various elements of which it is made blend together. For example, choosing weapons does not necessarily mean focusing on the most powerful ones, but understanding your style of play and, above all, knowing the dangers you are about to face in the selected level. The latter have all been designed with great accuracy (especially from the great space battle onwards) in order to favor the different possible approaches, which lead the player to carefully weigh the pros and cons of each choice and to replay the individual levels several times to find the best configuration (or even out of a simple desire for completionism). Even the new levels, i.e. those that weren't in Hydorah, are excellent in design and offer various situations, including narrow passages, forks, battles where you have to be careful not to kill civiliansi, areas where it is best not to shoot and much more. In short, there really is a lot of wisdom in this little game, wisdom that comes from years of experience and a profound awareness of the material being handled. In some cases, shooting complicates the situation instead of helping If we want, however, some of its strengths are also its limitations, at least with respect to a certain audience. We find it really hard for a modern gamer to share our excitement for Super Hydorah. In fact, Locomalito was decidedly radical in some choices: Super Hydorah is a difficult game, with a great sense of progression and balance, but only if you are comfortable with the genre and accept the challenge as such. Some may find it difficult to pass even the second level, since one hit is enough to destroy the spaceship (two with the protective barrier). Basically we are talking about a product dedicated to a well-defined niche, which will surely love it, but which it will be difficult to get away from. For those who have a radical approach to the gaming medium, this will probably sound like a strength rather than a defect, but all the others should reflect on why Super Hydorah may simply not be a game for them. Bonus mode In addition to the single player mode, Super Hydorah is also playable in local co-op multiplayer with another player. Tackling the levels with two is more fun than doing it alone. If you get tired of the base game, you can also select a bonus cooperative mode inspired by ~Robot Chase~, in which two robots have to create a laser link to catch jelly creatures.", "date": "2017-09-25", "grade": "8.5"}
