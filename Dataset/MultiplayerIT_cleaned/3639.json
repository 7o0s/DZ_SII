{"name": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance - A Woman's Lot", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kingdom-come-deliverance-a-womans-lot-recensione.html", "text": "A Woman's Lot is what all Kingdom Come: Deliverance DLC should have been: original, interesting and capable of adding meaning to Henry's story, keeping the focus on the facts of the main plot while tackling them from another perspective. In summary, it adds two lines of missions to the core experience, both related to the dramatic events in Skalitz that kickstart the game. Let's start from the second, the least interesting, called Our Lady of Sasau, in which Henry helps his friend Johanka to overcome the trauma of the Skalitz massacre, going to the places of her nightmares to find out what they hide. We defined it less interesting because, on balance, it is a series of missions perfectly in line with those of the main story, elaborated in a way not unlike that of the other two narrative DLCs of Kingdom Come Deliverance (The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon and Band of Bastards). So we have good writing, a series of interesting subplots, but at the same time an end in itself, which is fine as an impromptu addition, but which we can consider almost superfluous compared to what has been done and seen in the rest of the game. It's just one more quest that adds to the multitude of similar events we've already played. Definitely not ugly, but not essential either. Theresa's story However, the focus of A Woman's Lot is another, namely the mission line The destiny of a woman. If you have played Kingdom Come Deliverance you will surely know that Theresa, one of the main characters, never tells Henry what happened to her after the events in Skalitz. How did she survive? How did it get to the mill? What adventures did she go on? How did she find Henry? These are all questions that finally find their answers, in a splendid adventure lived from the point of view of the girl and faced in her dimension. Theresa is a judicious girl, our grandparents would say, but at the same time she is determined and capable of managing even in very risky situations. We are not going to tell you all his adventures so as not to spoil what is a good story, but know that the way they are intertwined with Henry's story is really done with great wisdom. The tweaks made to the gameplay are also excellent to avoid creating inconsistencies in the use of the character. In general, the interface and basic mechanics remain identical to those of Henry's adventure, with only a few differences. Meanwhile, Theresa can move stealthily, she knows how to fight (even if she's not exactly very strong due to the impossibility of using armor on heavy weapons), she knows how to pick locks and she knows how to play dice, but for example she can't pickpocket, she can't ride a horse, she can't read (although his wisdom and intelligence, as well as sagacity are highlighted several times in the dialogues), he wears neither male clothes nor armor. In addition to Henry, however, he has his dog friend, Tinker, a precious travel companion who can also be used as a weapon to defend himself or attack. It is not very strong, but it is excellent in ambushes, an ability that makes it valuable on more than one occasion. If he is beaten, his obedience ends at zero and it is necessary to wait for him to regain his strength before being able to exploit his services again. Note that Tinker's obedience, which is also his energy, can be increased by feeding and resting him. In general we can tell you that A Woman's Tale is best played with stealth rather than combat skills. The choice is still left to the player, but trying to fight against anyone makes Theresa's adventures much more difficult and, frankly, less exciting. Even more interesting is how the game tries to make us understand the condition of women in the Middle Ages, as well as the machismo prevailing in the society of the time, through some really spot-on small narrative tricks. For example, despite her sharpness, Theresa struggles very much to convince men through dialogue, while in case she commits a crime and is caught, her imprisonment is much harder than Henry's. Speaking of cold numbers, in total A Woman's Lot adds about 9 to 10 hours of content to Kingdom Come: Deliverance, seven of which are from Theresa's questline alone. From a technical point of view, it does not change the game in any way, as could be expected, but honestly little attention is paid to these trifles in the face of a job that is finally well done and worthy of being purchased. In short, it is the best DLC among those made for Kingdom Come: Deliverance, as well as one of those that can be defined as essential for complete understandingof the game.", "date": "2019-06-05", "grade": "8.5"}
