In summary, it was all the fault of a passable plot, weighed down by the weakness of the dialogues, and a couple of features such as the offspring of the heroes and the customizable castle that could have given something more. On the gameplay, however, we had nothing to say: Fire Emblem Fates, especially in its Conquest incarnation, represents the non plus ultra of the series, a real evolution on which Intelligent Systems can and must build the future of the franchise. How, though? Because the solution orchestrated with Fates and its three ~paths~ has raised more than one eyebrow. Now that we have also played Revelation, the paid downloadable content only after purchasing Legacy or Conquest, we can really sum up this experiment, starting from a very simple concept: Revelation is the real, unmissable Fire Emblem Fates. Revelation is the best incarnation of Fire Emblem Fates - everything else is training! Long live neutrality! At this point it would not surprise us if someone was confused by all this history of alternative Fire Emblem Fates, paths and DLCs: in the box below we try to clarify the release of the game because, in case you missed this detail, Revelation is not a Fire Emblem Fates that you will find on the shelf or in the virtual catalog of your trusted store. It is in fact a package that you can download only after purchasing Legacy or Conquest and having reached chapter 6 in which Corrin must choose whether to side with her adoptive family, the Nohr, or with her blood relatives, the Hoshido. In Revelation, however, Corrin takes no sides at all and remains neutral, setting off a chain of events that will have drastically different repercussions than the two original ~paths~. Here is the reason for that Fates - destinies - in the title, originally If in Japan: the three versions represent the possible choices that Corrin can make, changing the course of history a bit like Gwyneth Paltrow in front of that cursed subway train. But if in Legacy our protagonist took the evil Garon's empire head on and in Conquest he acted from within to defend Nohr from invasion and at the same time dethrone his father, in Revelation it is fantasy and epic that act as the master, transforming a kind of Japanese Game of Thrones into a Fire Emblem worthy of its predecessors: myths and legends of vanished civilizations merge with political intrigues in the background, Azura's role becomes much more decisive and, finally, it's about the quintessential MacGuffin, the Fire Emblem that didn't even seem to exist in Legacy and Conquest. Suddenly, the details expressed between the lines of the two initial episodes acquire new meanings and, after a rather sluggish start, the plot explodes forcefully involving all the characters; the two rival families will then join Corrin's cause for an all-out battle against an ancient and seemingly invincible enemy. Revelation is, in short, the path that we liked the most and that truly gives a sense of epicness to this fantasy epic, but despite being the best storyline of the trio, it would be wrong to diminish the importance of Legacy and Conquest: only through them you can get to know and better understand Corrin's various allies, whose interactions in Revelation are something of a culmination of the journey begun earlier. Although it is possible to reach chapter 6 with Legacy or Conquest and then play Revelation directly, this choice is certainly the least wise, also because it would not allow us to grasp the nuances of the DLC both from a narrative and from a gameplay point of view. To recap... Let's clarify once and for all. Fire Emblem Fates will arrive on your physical or digital shelves in two versions, one subtitled Legacy and another subtitled Conquest: in the first, the protagonist Corrin sides with the Hoshido family, while in the second he fights for the Nohr family. The decisive moment occurs at the end of chapter 6, after which an option will appear in the main menu that allows you to purchase the alternative version via digital download and at half price. Later, from the same menu it will also be possible to buy the Revelation chapter at the same price, which represents a middle ground both in terms of story and gameplay. In any case, it is better to play at least one of the two versions first to better understand some details of Revelation which, otherwise, would remain rather cinfusions. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition! The plot of Revelation is not the only thing that makes Fire Emblem Fates better, and in this sense, Nintendo's experiment is tinged with even more light and shade. In our review of Legacy and Conquest we pointed out that the former is a kind of Fire Emblem for beginners: simple, linear, forgiving. Suitable for new players, it is a training ground in which to learn the basics and experiment thanks to the possibility of accumulating money and training each unit at will. For this reason, Legacy is also the least satisfying Fire Emblem Fates on a purely strategic level. Conversely, Conquest manages to be much more challenging, but also more frustrating, especially if you're playing Normal mode with permadeath around the corner: the inability to grow characters at your own pace and amass money at will make it more similar to the old Fire Emblem, it is true, but also a questionable business card for those who have never approached the franchise. Revelation solves the problem by being the meeting point between the two philosophies with an absolutely perfect balance. The DLC literally combines the best of both worlds and, thanks to the ability to customize the experience by choosing the most appropriate level of difficulty, offers the player a situational variety that is embarrassing to say the least. The level design of maps and missions closely resembles that of Conquest with its multiple and dynamic objectives, environmental dangers and the far from obvious placement of structures, enemies and reinforcements. Even the Dragon Veins - the interaction points that allow the most important characters to alter the map - are arranged in a much more intelligent and creative way, where in Legacy they represented a simple tinsel of gameplay. From Legacy, on the other hand, Revelation inherits the ability to face enemies that randomly roam the world, to accumulate money to buy new weapons and seals and to upgrade each character, freely unlocking each support conversation and, therefore, the second generation of heroes. It is a structure that guarantees countless possibilities, especially if we consider the fact that we can mix the two armies and their peculiar classes and weapons, creating ever more imaginative and surprising combinations. Everything, then, is reflected in the narrative, since it unlocks the sparkling conversations between characters who in Legacy and Conquest were bitter enemies, and on the personalized castle, which becomes reasonably richer and more varied even in appearance. But if everything seems to be turning for the better, in Revelation, raising the general quality of the Intelligent Systems proposal a notch, why did we talk about lights... and shadows a few lines ago? Well, that's all very nice, but Revelation is still a 20 Euro DLC that can only be purchased after buying Legacy and/or Conquest. The idea of offering an alternative path so different as to seem like another game at half price is commendable, but on the other hand, you must first go through the preliminary offer which is the base game, whether it be Legacy or Conquest, and which costs full price. If you then want to completely dissect the Fire Emblem Fates trilogy, you have to add the halved price of the other alternative route, and you get to around 80 Euros, less if you buy the unobtainable limited edition: you have to keep in mind that, however, the game is fundamentally the same, so as beautiful and gripping as Revelation may be, at some point you feel a certain tiredness, especially if you play the two or three titles back-to-back or even simultaneously. In short, Nintendo's maneuver has its positive sides and its negative sides, but fortunately it does not oblige you to buy any extras since Legacy and Conquest are absolutely independent and complete games: the experiment, if anything, allows you to further customize the our experience, and offers fans of the franchise the opportunity to play three Fire Emblems at their own pace.", "date": "2016-05-12", "grade": "9.0"}
