{"name": "Un ritorno amaro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/126371-nba-live-14-un-ritorno-amaro.html", "text": "That something was not going well in EA Sports as regards the basketball sector was now well known, considering the troubled situation of the NBA Live series and the difficult genesis of this chapter. Four years have passed since the last release in the series, following which we have witnessed two cancellations of games from the already started development, with NBA Elite 11 and NBA Live 13 both eliminated in progress, a clear sign of major problems encountered already in the construction phase of the titles. All this has led to the situation of absolute monopoly for the genre by 2K Games and its NBA 2K, which already starting from the excellent qualitative base that characterizes it, has also had the road completely paved so far for the conquest of the market. A strange case, that of made in EA basketball, which clashes somewhat with the resounding successes of Madden NFL, NHL and above all FIFA around the world, which despite the outsider status of football in America has proven to represent the flower of the flagship of the entire EA Sports production in recent years. However, the conditions for a historic revenge were all there, at this point: starting from the new Ignite Engine which has already demonstrated excellent things with FIFA, a general reshuffle of the responsible team, full of new proposals and expectations and the potential offered by new hardware of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, on which the developers have focused exclusively by eliminating the burden of the ~current gen~ versions, made us think of a new beginning in a big way. Unfortunately, several things did not go the right way and NBA Live 14 proved to be a product decidedly below expectations, despite some good ideas launched by the team on the playing field, the usual substantial outline of typically EA modes and contents and a major partnership agreement with ESPN that embellishes product packaging. Woops, I did it again One would expect that after the long hiatus, at the very least, the game would arrive full-featured on store shelves, but NBA Live 14 still seems to be in the works, as evidenced by the recent statements by executive producer Sean O'Brien on the state of ~work in progress~ imposed on the game following the negative feedback detected in the first days of launch. It would also be a commendable move by EA Sports if it weren't so late. On the other hand, the problems of this new basketball simulation are difficult to solve through downloadable updates and involve different aspects of the game, from the gameplay to the technical sector, to get to the mechanics of the various modes, which are however numerous and apparently well matched. The first problem is related to the graphics sector and is evident at first glance, in particular if you have previously dealt with NBA 2K14, but this could also take a back seat if there weren't several gaps in the mechanics of the gameplay itself. The Ignite Engine that we appreciated in FIFA 14 does not seem to be able to apply itself properly to the dynamics of basketball, generating unconvincing collisions and above all maintaining that old sensation of the ball gluing to the movements of the bearer that tastes so old school, despite the system ~free~ control of the dribble through the movements of the right stick - the ~BounceTek~ - also works properly and triggers animations that are pleasant to see. The fact is that it seems disconnected from the standard movements of the players and in this way increases the general sense of artificiality of the animations and especially of the movements of the ball. On the playing field, the other fundamental problem is provided by artificial intelligence, both in the defensive and offensive phase. It is not easy to be able to set up an action that involves the whole team, with the schemes that partially work even when they are directly called by the player. The standard attack action of the CPU is limited to the continuous attempt to penetrate towards the basket, while in defense the computer-controlled players mainly think about maintaining the standard positions and blocking around the area, difficult to see cuts or complex maneuvers from part of the artificial intelligence with or without the ball, which is reflected in both the defensive and offensive phase for the player. If you stop for a moment during an attack or defense situation, the static nature of everything around the player becomes evident, which seems to be the only variable at play in a hardcover world. All this, combined with the woody and almost ~scripted~ management of the ball, contributes to flattening the rhythm and dynamics in a worrying way.he of matches. The expected return smacks of failure: NBA Live still has a long way to go The options are there EA Sports does not betray in terms of the amount of options and game modes, at least, even if the generalized approximation with which NBA Live 14 seems put together does not spare even these. The Career mode follows the classic one of sports, allowing us to experience firsthand the rise of a player from access to the NBA to the consecration in the hall of fame. Obviously, the problems found in the heart of the gameplay remain, i.e. the matches on the field, but also the outline does not prove to be up to what was seen in NBA 2K14, with an excessively punitive system regarding the evaluation of actions which in practice does not allow never to improvise some alternative game solution forcing us to follow a narrow path as regards behavior on the field, as well as cutting out all those collateral elements in player management given by relationships with sponsors and with the team. Dinastia is the managerial mode (with the possibility of playing games directly) and from this point of view the experience of the developers has allowed a basic functional work, mainly focused on the management of statistics and menus. The problem, in this case, is perhaps given by a rather random simulation of the championship dynamics, which do not seem to take much account of the actual value of the various players and their actual conditions (despite the constant connections with real statistics), both in terms of match results and market management. The Scenario mode and the usual, excellent, Ultimate Team are much more convincing. The first allows you to relive firsthand some topical moments taken from the games actually played in the NBA, as happened in the old Konami's Winning Eleven and constitutes a very pleasant variation to the normal game dynamics. The Ultimate Team, on the strength of its by now widely consolidated tradition, works very well also in this declination and guarantees a game within the game that does not betray expectations, at least in this case. Xbox One goals NBA Live 14 contains 49 unlockable achievements for 1000 total points. Like any sports video game, most of the objectives are linked to particular performance within matches and player statistics, but since there are a large amount of different modes, the achievements are well distributed throughout the various game possibilities, requiring decidedly disparate actions . The complete collection therefore requires you to devote yourself to every aspect of this title. Was it true next gen? Even leaving out the direct comparison with NBA 2K14, which technically stands out as a colossus compared to this title, it is immediately evident how the graphics sector of NBA Live 14 represents a simple update of an engine designed for previous platforms, despite the courageous choice of cut out PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 to focus exclusively on next gen. An increase in details and applied effects is noted, but the polygonal models still appear rather woody and even rough in some cases, also due to a fluctuating quality of the animations. As for the latter, rather convincing moments, linked above all to the dribble and in conjunction with the use of the BounceTek, alternate with a generally low quality of the reproduced movements. The Ignite Engine fails precisely in what should be its strong point, or rather the collisions between the bodies and the harmony between the movements, making the players very woody and in some cases the movements markedly unrelated to each other. If you combine these defects with a movement of the ball that returns a feeling rather far from the most convincing realism, you have a picture of the state of backwardness that still distinguishes the EA Sports series compared to direct competition. On the other hand, the packaging work carried out is remarkable thanks above all to the close partnership with ESPN, which guarantees a direct line with the real NBA and contributes to a general spectacularization of the matches between presentations and side elements that make the electric climate of basketball breathe deeply North American, a feature that represents a sort of stylistic code for EA Sports productions. The audio sector also does its job excellently in this sense, between sound on the pitch and commentary in English.", "date": "2013-12-09", "grade": "5.0"}
