{"name": "3D Rollercoaster Rush", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/3d-rollercoaster-rush.html", "text": "Rollercoaster Rush, released in 2006, was one of the most popular titles made by the talented team of programmers in question. A year later, Digital Chocolate has chosen to re-propose substantially the same game, but with an interesting novelty in terms of graphics, i.e. the use of 3D rather than the normal bitmap of the predecessor. The concept is extremely simple but incredibly valid at the same time; in fact, everything revolves around the possibility of controlling the carriages on the roller coaster tracks, acting on the accelerator and brakes in order to entertain the lucky (?) travelers as much as possible without jeopardizing their safety. What may seem at least questionable on paper, in reality once you pick up the mobile phone it becomes so addictive that it is really difficult to be able to detach it. Each level offers a different track, made up of incredible ups and downs, loops, straights and so on; the aim is to be able to find the right balance in the speed of the carriages, to be able to arrive smoothly at the finish line. If, as already mentioned, exaggerating with the accelerator can lead to going off the rails and therefore to the premature end of the race, on the other hand excessive prudence will be very fruitless in terms of the final score. Yes, because the fun of the travellers, indicated during the race by the smiley faces, brings with it points which, once the level is finished, determine a score from one to five stars. Accumulating stars thus allows you to unlock not only the next levels and trophies, but also to add carriages and therefore travelers; more people means more points, and so it becomes essential to repeat the levels already passed to improve the final result. The graphic component, the main object of this revision, is on the whole more than successful, maintaining the comic style of the original version; the use of polygons has also made it possible to adopt a mobile camera so as to also provide a new dynamism to the action. The only criticism may arise from the presence of a few pop-ups which in any case don't bother too much and above all don't affect playability. Finally, the variety of settings, which range from Australia to Paris to New York, is the icing on the cake, and the excellent sound component closes the picture of a title that we would certainly like to recommend without major reservations. Of course it won't last forever, but it will still be money well spent. PRO Good graphics Very funny Sound spot on AGAINST Long repetitive A few pop-ups", "date": "2007-05-30", "grade": "S.V."}
