{"name": "Rolando", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rolando.html", "text": "It must be admitted that, seeing him only through screenshots and press-releases, it was easy to limit oneself to judging Rolando as a ~clever~ LocoRoco clone for iPhone, which would have simply transported the winning gameplay of the Sony title to the Apple device, exploiting the tilt sensor as control system. In reality, as we will be able to illustrate in the course of the review, the Hand Circus project is indeed inspired by LocoRoco, but also the bearer of innovative ideas and perfectly implemented in the game economy, two elements in themselves more than enough to guarantee him an undoubted personality. In Rolando, the user's task is to guide small spherical beings (named precisely rolando) towards the exit of the various stages, each equipped with a particular objective to be satisfied: the level design is really excellent, and gradually as the adventure continues, there is always something new, not to mention puzzles that intelligently exploit the playful mechanics of the product. The control system is also the most spot-on we've ever seen on the iPhone: the Rolandos are rolled by tilting the device, while you use the touchscreen to make jumps (with a quick upward movement of the finger), select the desired character and operate devices such as buttons, wheels, propellers and so on. It only takes a few moments to become familiar with Rolando, but that doesn't make Hand Circus a simplistic game, on the contrary: each level offers hidden secrets and bonuses, as well as a time limit within which to complete it to enjoy a better score. All things that, combined with Xbox360-style goals, help increase the longevity of an engaging product like few others on the iPhone so far. Also noteworthy are the brilliant solutions adopted by the developers for certain accessory aspects, but which testify to the great care placed in the product: for example, Rolando uses a system called iSave, which automatically saves the user's progress in the event of a call received or a sudden exit the application. Furthermore, simply press the top left corner of the screen to bring up the pause menu, and you can listen to songs from your iTunes library in the background to the action - an aspect, the latter, which is still likely to be little used, given the excellent quality of Rolando's funky music. Finally, the icing on the cake is the highly enjoyable graphic design of the title, noteworthy not only for the delightful look of the characters and for the colorful scenarios that appear before us, but also for the small touches of class that make the difference: we refer, for example, to the interactive main menu that expands as the adventure progresses, as well as the game map that opens like a children's storybook, not to mention the funny expressions of the various rolandos that you encounter on your I walk. The comparison with LocoRoco is inevitable, of course, but Rolando is anything but a simple carbon copy.
