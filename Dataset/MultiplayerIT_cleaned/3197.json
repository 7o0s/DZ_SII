In Montral, on the occasion of the fixed appointment with the Six Invitational in February, the atmosphere was different. Ubisoft, already in the approach to the two reveals that embellished the programming of the various events that followed on the main stage, behaved differently. It will be because of the various changes made to the development team or simply because the experience behind it has allowed us to improve even the purely communicative side, but the curiosity and attention of the fans have never been so high. We ourselves, during the preview behind closed doors, witnessed a presentation in which the developers - with no small emotion - repeatedly reiterated a concept to us: ~Starting from this moment, Siege will become the game we originally theorized ~. To achieve this goal, Ubisoft has decided to focus more on introducing new features that are considered essential and requested over and over again by the community. This, obviously, also implies a new management of the contents released through the individual DLCs, both in terms of time and quantity and type. At Void Edge, therefore, the arduous task of conquering - and, in some cases, regaining - the interest of the players and, at the same time, of acting as a link between the past and the future of Rainbow Six. The key to the success of this passage is certainly ~solidity~ and, for this reason, everything is focused on the new operators and on the (almost unexpected) rework of one of the most loved maps ever. Oryx & Iana: solid shoulders and a look to the future Taking a quick look at the operators released during Siege's fourth year, Ubisoft itself noticed how little the new recruits of the Rainbow team had impacted the game's meta. The development team knows it well: the desire to soon reach the threshold of 100 playable characters - a phrase that has been repeated like a mantra for some years now - must not expire in the production of approximate gadgets and uninspired skills. Here, then, is the reason for the introduction of Oryx and Iana. Visually and conceptually, these are two very different operators, but both, after playing them for several hours, gave us the same doubt: ~why didn't it already exist?~ By relying on the brute strength of Oryx and the delicate technology of Iana, Ubisoft may have managed to find two operators capable of undermining the certainties of their teammates who dominate the statistics regarding the percentage of appearances in the matches played. In reality, the two characters also have another detail in common, since they are the first two members of the Rainbow team not to belong to any unit of the armed forces. Saif ~Oryx~ Al Hadid is the powerful new defender with a stormy past: born in Jordan, he was imprisoned for about 15 years, completely disappearing from international records. This event tempers his character to the point of convincing General Kaid to open the doors of his Fortress to him... but only after leaving him sitting in the middle of the desert for two weeks. There he hones his skills and, as a simple recruit, he soon manages to win the trust of his general and become his right-hand man. Oryx's tenacity, in terms of gameplay, easily translates into the first only and exclusively physical special ability: the Remah Shoot. Despite his impressive size - we are talking about an operator with 2 Speed points and 2 Armor - Saif Al Hadid is able to move extremely quickly for short distances, taking advantage of his muscular explosiveness. In the instants that he uses the Dash, he moves with a speed unattainable by any other member of the Rainbow team. This ability, in the mechanics of uses, is somewhat reminiscent of those of Vigli and Caveira, but in the case of Oryx it is limited to a maximum of 3 charges at a time. However, once a Shot is used, a recharge of about 8 seconds starts automatically which allows you to get another one. If his fellow roamers bet everything on silence and surprise, on the contrary the Jordanian defender is thunderous in his movements, but he has another advantage on his side: he is a human bulldozer. Oryx is capable of literally running over anything in its path. Using the Remah Dash in the direction of unreinforced walls, you are in an instant on the opposite side, with one more chasm in the map and 10HP less to the defender. In fact, opening these passages involves a small sacrifice in terms of health points, but ensures spectacularity to this action, capable of taking eventhe most prepared assailants. The same result can also be obtained by forcefully crossing the typical wooden barricades and even the Armored Panels of Castle, among other things, in this case, without even suffering damage. The physical overwhelming power of this 130 kg bull also gives him a further advantage over his opponents: if a wall doesn't stop him, imagine how little a simple human being can do. Oryx, in fact, is also able to charge the attackers in an almost rugby-like move and throw them to the ground helpless. In this physical confrontation, however, neither the defender nor the attacker suffers any damage and both remain unarmed and vulnerable for a few moments. No one is safe from her Remah Rush, not even her Extendable Shield-equipped French counterpart. Yes! You got it right! Montagne is powerless against Oryx's charge! That would have been enough to convince us of the validity of this operator, but in reality another aspect of his ability has greatly impressed us: Saif Al Hadid is the first defender capable of climbing trapdoors. Once again, his physical strength allows him to make jumps worthy of the best basketball players in the NBA and to reach the ~doors on the floors~ that have always characterized the Siege maps. This action is even more interesting in light of the fact that it does not involve the use of Remah Sprint charges. Furthermore, the defender can choose whether to catapult himself directly to the upper floor or to remain clinging (and unarmed) to scan the room and, only later, to go back up or let himself fall. Wait a minute though! Don't be alarmed! Ubisoft seems to have thought of everything: Oryx obviously can't exploit this ability with the trap doors that lead directly onto the roofs of buildings. Otherwise it would have been hell for the attackers. While her special ability still wowed us, the same couldn't be said for her loadout. After a very brief interlude with the introduction of the new sniper rifle for Kali, the development team has returned again to reusing weapons that we already know well: MP5 (without ACOG) or SPAS-12 as primary and Bailiff 410 or USP40 as secondary. Waiting to be able to see the new gadgets promised at the Six Invitational (including the Proximity Alarm), at least for now Oryx has the Barbed Wire or the Bulletproof Camera. Ubisoft, in the last year, has paid particular attention to the creation of the ~6 Universe~: working on the background and the capillary characterization of the individual operators, it has managed to add that lore that the game evidently lacked. It is no coincidence, therefore, that with the release of Void Edge all the biographies of the operators released with the DLCs of the first two years have also been revised - after having already rewritten, some time ago, those of the original members of the Rainbow team - and that with Iana really indulged themselves. Nienke ~Iana~ Meijer is a particularly strong and focused woman, who has tempered her character over the years spent in her hometown in the Netherlands, having to face social stigma and discrimination from her peers, due to her albinism. The new attacker also suffered a bitter disappointment in her attempt to become a fighter pilot, being rejected precisely because of the fragility of her retina. However, this did not stop her, on the contrary it motivated her to develop contact lenses capable of correcting her genetic defect. Precisely these lenses, thanks to the use of experimental software, were the keystone in the creation of his unique gadget: the Gemini Replicator. This attacker's ability with 2 Armor points and 2 Speed, allows her to create a holographic copy of herself, through the use of tiny flying drones, perfectly identical to her real counterpart. We had seen something similar with the projections generated by Alibi's Prism but, in Iana's case, the Replicator is tangible and is able to perform some of the most basic actions, since it is controlled remotely by the operator. The hologram, therefore, can walk, run, climb over, hold the weapon and enter aiming mode (all while also producing the typical noise of these actions), but is unable to shoot, use melee or gadgets and, more generally, to cause damage to objects or opponents. The Gemini is impossible to distinguish (except for the absence of the heat signature) and in addition to being able to gather information by moving freely through the rooms - the traps are not activated when it passes - it is the perfect trick to deceive the opponents. Iana can use her ability as many times as she wants, but sticking to teasvery precise mpi: the autonomy of the Replicator is 15 seconds and, once the charge has finished or the hologram has been autonomously deactivated, you have to wait 7.5 seconds to be able to ~summon~ it again. Things change if the projection is destroyed by shots, explosions, Mute Jammers or electric shocks: in that case the recharge time increases to 30 seconds. The trick, therefore, is to use the Dutchman's unique gadget sparingly and lucidly, above all since to make the most of it it must be associated with good coordination with the rest of the teammates. Nienke, in fact, while controlling her projection, remains motionless and defenseless and is unable to sense the presence of opponents, until she is hit (but in that case it could already be too late). Also in the case of the equipment available to Iana we don't find any big news: ARX200 - with the addition of the vertical handle - and G36C are the two alternatives; the Mk1 9mm is the only pistol he can carry. Fragmentation and Smoke Grenades, on the other hand, embellish her equipment, especially if used in combo with this operator's gadget. Oregon: the rework we didn't know we wanted Let's start immediately by saying that, when this reworking was revealed to us, we sincerely reflected on the fact that it did not fall within our personal ranking of maps to be changed urgently. However, this thought vanished the moment we played the first match in the new version of Oregon and, indeed, it totally changed when, just a few days later, we returned to our stations and had to step back onto the stage of the now antiquated and not very functional building. Operation Void Edge takes one of Siege's original maps and with a few sharp chisel strokes makes it into a work worthy of the best Michelangelo. It is no news that the complex located in the town of Redmond had problems related to the difficult practicability of some areas and the lack of connections between certain areas. The developers have mainly focused on eliminating these bottlenecks and have fully succeeded in introducing new structures and expanding others. The new flight of stairs and the cold room in the basement are clear examples of this process. The attackers therefore have a new access point which, on the other hand, also translates into a simpler rotation for the defenders. A corridor between the Big Tower and the Kitchen also allows you to cut the building from side to side in a few moments, especially if you also consider the expansion and greater playability of the Small Tower (also thanks to the door that puts it in communication with the Dining Room). Less heavy, but equally incisive, are the changes to the upper floor: a new area of the dormitory allows direct access to the Attic (formerly the Hayloft), to which, however, the long horizontal slit and the ladder have been removed. Finally, it is very easy to rejoice over the elimination of the bomb site in the Torre Grande and its replacement with the one between the Conference Room and the Kitchen. QoL: the attention to detail that has been missing for a while As we said at the beginning, with Operation Void Edge Ubisoft has begun this process of re-evaluating certain mechanics and introducing features necessary to improve Siege's ~Quality of Life~. We could say goodbye, for example, to the annoying debris of the destroyed barricades! The development team has studied some solutions and, in order not to further weigh down the servers, has opted for the simplest one: if hit, the typical wooden covers of doors and windows shatter into tiny pieces that no longer obstruct the view. Now the spawn kill is truly an even battle! The new DLC also introduces a new option that may have permanently saved the lives of many helpless drones. In addition to being generated directly in the access point selected in the selection phase, in the game settings, in fact, it is also possible to define the behavior automatically assumed by your attacker at the end of the preparation phase. You can decide to leave everything as it has always been, instantly placing the handheld device supplied and leaving your drone at the mercy of the defenders or to remain in control of the small robot even at the sound of the gong at the start of the action phase. The third possibility, only for real support, even allows you to stand by the drones of teammates in case your own is destroyed. The reworks of two operators, in particular, will certainly impact the meta of the game. Lesion is d", "date": "2020-03-13", "grade": "8.6"}
