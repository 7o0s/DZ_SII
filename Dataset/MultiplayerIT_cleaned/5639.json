The title of the Italian Forge Reply skilfully mixes the typical mechanisms of gamebooks with the turn-based combat system of videogame RPGs, combining atmosphere and involvement, spectacularity and strategic implications in a single, convincing solution. Yet on the one hand the time that has passed since the debut (which often and willingly implies a rethinking of the evaluation on the basis of the inevitable evolution of the genre), on the other the less ~intimate~ dimension of the text pages on the television, pushed us towards a positive but less enthusiastic judgment than we would have liked. Having installed the game on Xbox One and created ~our~ Lone Wolf, selecting his physical characteristics, psychic powers and equipment, however, we came across one of the peculiar aspects of this production, namely the high degree of replayability, the possibility of reliving the entire adventure by taking crossroads and making different choices, but also that of facing the fights using a shrewd or instinctive, even crude, approach. At that point the reserves melted like snow (blood red) in the sun, we enjoyed yet another trip to Rockstarn, the price of 14.99 euros seemed adequate to us for a campaign that requires about twelve hours per single completion and the presence of three levels of difficulty could only consolidate our beliefs. Is reading the pages written by Joe Dever on the TV screen less ~intimate~? Of course, but this in no way affects the value of the experience. Joe Dever's Lone Wolf Console Edition is a solid, convincing title with remarkable stylistic choices Choose your destiny The village of Rockstarn was suddenly attacked by an army of Jaks and Drakkars, who massacred dozens of inhabitants and destroyed their homes, perhaps looking for something. The survivors have holed up in the mines, hunted down by their tormentors, and Lone Wolf realizes what is happening with guilty delay. Lord of these lands, last of the Kai Knights, the protagonist of the adventure reaches the site of the attack only to see the massacre perpetrated by his sworn enemies; however a mysterious girl armed with a crossbow, Leandra, makes him understand that there is a sense behind the assault, and that to avoid much bigger trouble you have to embark on a difficult journey, facing hostile patrols from time to time, making choices that will have serious consequences and selecting the path to take based on the possible dangers and the desired approach. The plot of Joe Dever's Lone Wolf Console Edition unfolds through four acts, each divided into three chapters, which, as mentioned, bring together the mechanisms of gamebooks and those of videogame RPGs. As we scroll through the pages of the story, we will come across situations that require a decision or inevitable clashes with the Giaks and their superiors, from the point of view of a bestiary that includes a large number of different opponents, increasingly stronger and more cunning. To defeat them we will not be able to go for subtlety, on the contrary we will have to use up all our resources from time to time, trying to make the best use of the indicators of health, vigor and spiritual energy, as well as any equipped objects, from potions to incendiary bombs. Xbox One goals Obtaining the forty-eight Objectives of Joe Dever's Lone Wolf Console Edition will require commitment and perseverance, given that different achievements are often linked to specific choices and it will therefore be necessary to replay the adventure to unlock them all. There is also a whole series of Objectives related to the amount of specific actions, from the point of view of crafting and combat, so the picture appears quite complete. The console version In addition to having to read pages of text on a large screen, a situation far from what happened on mobile devices, where this part of the experience was comparable to the use of any ebook, our perplexities about the console edition by Joe Dever's Lone Wolf also and above all concerned the interface and the adaptation of the commands on the controller. Well, during normal navigation in the story and between the menus something is inevitably lost in terms of immediacy, given that you have to move the ~pointer~ from one slot to another and this makes things cumbersome, especially when dealing with the multifaceted crafting system of the game and scroll through the many items that can be purchased or sold at merchants. The same slowness is found in the management of destinations, while for scrolling pages yeshas opted for a double solution: the back keys to go forward and backward, or here too the selection of an arrow with the cursor. Fortunately, the layout of the commands during the fights is instead very well organized, with the main buttons that allow access to the various moves of Lone Wolf: the attacks with the Sword of the Sun, the Kai skills, the physical maneuvers with the equipped weapons and those related to shots from a distance, whether it be throwing knives or shooting arrows from a crossbow. During our turn, respecting the three energy indicators as mentioned, we will therefore be able to select one of these ~categories~ by pressing the relative button and moving the analog stick, then complete simple quick time events for the correct execution of the attack. Even on consoles, as on PC, the QTEs are systematically simplified compared to touch commands, but this is an aspect that could not be changed without taking into account possible balancing problems. What matters is that battles are never taken for granted, and that eliminating multiple opponents in the course of a single round always gives great satisfaction, even if it is a goal that is difficult to achieve during the first few games. So let's go back to the starting point: the many facets of the game allow not only to replay the whole adventure over again by discovering new things, taking different crossroads and selecting peculiar skills, but also and above all to retrace one's steps with greater awareness of what is the rich repertoire of the protagonist, of how the crafting system works and what are the best strategies to not find yourself starting a duel in a disadvantaged situation. This system, so solid yet so structurally simple (reading, decision, QTE, duel and then repeating), is accompanied in the console edition by a technical realization that lives up to expectations, which exactly as on PC reveals unclear textures in close-up shots and polygonal models with some edges that become evident due to the high resolution, but which at the same time flow smoothly (probably at 60 frames per second) and are flawless from an artistic point of view, both in terms of character and show that that of the environments. The orchestral soundtrack is also splendid, which succeeds in the arduous task of accompanying long reading sessions without being boring.", "date": "2016-03-22", "grade": "8.0"}
