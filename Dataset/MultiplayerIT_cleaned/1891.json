{"name": "Not For Broadcast", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/not-for-broadcast-recensione.html", "text": "If you've always dreamed of directing a TV show, alternating shots and keeping your hand ready on the red censorship button, you're in the right place. And that's not all, in Not for Broadcast you will be asked to host no less than the night programs, including news and advertising prohibited in the protected range: in short, the best of public TV. Although it may seem like a quiet job, in Not for Broadcast there is no time to laze around in the armchair, limiting yourself to pressing a few keys from time to time; in addition to humor, satire and irreverent sketches, the game published by tinyBuild also surprises with a narrative focused on the protagonist of this bizarre story. In the Not for Broadcast review, we tell you how we managed in a control room that saw us grappling with hilarious TV commercials, uncovering secrets of important public figures and not exactly common ~external attacks~. On air At Not For Broadcast, when it comes to politics, it's always best to watch your back As mentioned at the beginning, Not for Broadcast can make one think of a product devoted entirely to comedy without taking itself too seriously on the game mechanics, palely imitating Telling Lies as regards controls and dynamics. NotGames, on the other hand, has sought a more sophisticated formula that does not transform the product into a simple sequence of videos full of jokes performed by real actors. The story tells of a character, Alex Winston, cleaner of the National Nightly News television station, who finds himself covering the role of director after the escape of the one who was supposed to perform this task. With this incipit we have a first overview of our tasks and how to carry them out, bearing in mind that what matters, of course, is keeping the share high. Are you wondering how? The answer to this question is the backbone of the whole game, and to find out we just have to experiment. What do the public like best? The discovery of a political scandal or the embarrassing episodes of familiar TV faces? If our shots, tactical zooms or commercial breaks are spot on, we learn it precisely from the bar at the top right that we find in our workstation, which precisely shows the following of spectators based on what we broadcast. But the change of direction is not the only parameter to outline our skill behind the cameras. Election day Will you be able to keep viewers engaged in Not For Broadcast? Not for Broadcast is set in a kind of 1980s UK during one of the hottest times for journalism: Election Day. The new use of the protagonist, we will soon understand, can strongly influence public opinion by confronting us with the moral choice of what to show people: the truth or a fake reality. And it is precisely this exaggerated satire aimed at party journalism or politics in its entirety that manages to hit the mark in the fruition of the game. We therefore find ourselves grappling with the victory of the Advance party, an emerging political grouping which promises to solve the problems created in society over the years but which behind the appearance of saviors of the homeland also hide skeletons in wardrobes, or rather men in stockings net. Added to this are invasions of naked Protestant nobles in the control room, thunderstorms that disable some keys on our workstation and ~alien~ attacks that arrive directly from the studio window (also a satire towards the pandemic); in short, the work of director of a night broadcast turned out to be quite eventful. Added to all this is the rather annoying presence of interference that made our job even more challenging, as if choosing whether to lie to the population or linger with the camera on a scandal wasn't already challenging enough. Our job is therefore to make everything go smoothly and entertain the audience, keeping them glued to the screen thanks to our skill on framing choices or on the right timing to air advertisements sponsored by the incumbent party or not. But be careful, the ravenous world of politics will know about our actions, intimidating us or threatening our private life depending on what we broadcast: will we be able to keep our moral integrity high? Home and work In Not For Broadcast, sharing isn't our protagonist's only problem The gaming experience focuses mainly on what happens on the four screens of the director, but in Not For Broadcast there is also room for the private life of Alex, who has to deal with what happens within the four walls of his own house, trto economic problems and family difficulties. These excerpts from daily life are represented by images with commentary, a cut that is very much in contrast with the flow of TV broadcasts that have seen us engaged in the workplace. The narration, at this juncture, becomes rather gloomy and almost seems to belong to a different game. The choices made as a director also spill over in no uncertain terms on Alex's family who find themselves in the balance between the bills to pay and the responsibility for what their job entails. Pushing yourself to show cross-sections of propaganda towards one or the other party will lead the protagonist's son to become a fervent supporter of the party that is talked about so much on TV, finding himself at home, for example, a teenager in the midst of an existential crisis. At the same time, this influence led us to get curious about the various narrative crossroads, opening the game to multiple endings. The longevity of the title, in fact, is based on the player's willingness to discover the alternative ways, the choices left open and thus appreciate all the ramifications that this bizarre story can take. Of course, repeating some portions can be repetitive and enjoying even a single ~game~ can be a satisfying experience without going to find everything we missed in the first place. Only for true gentlemen: Deluxe Edition In Not For Broadcast you never stop working... Not for Broadcast is a title that we played entirely in English; offers many other languages, some of which also with dubbing, such as Chinese and Russian, but Italian is not provided for either the game interface or the subtitles. To fully appreciate the title you need to have an excellent command of the language, since sometimes skits are offered with popular sayings or not very well known idioms. However, we are talking about a product with a strong English imprint, which is difficult to adapt. Leaving aside satire on modern politics, between Conservatives and Labor, whose history and ideology not everyone can know, it is the more refined references to British sitcoms or customs that certainly have a more subdued impact on an Italian public. As just said, this clarification therefore does not want to be a criticism of Not for Broadcast but only a warning for those in doubt about a possible purchase, now aware of what awaits them. Having said that, the NotGames game, or rather its basic version, has already landed on the stores for some time, but given its success, the development team's work did not stop after the main chapters. In fact, Not for Broadcast has a Season Pass which, added to the base game, makes up the Deluxe Edition, and if the base version can be completed in approximately six hours, the additional contents bring the count to nine, making it a more complete product that seeks also to get out of political plots to bring satire to other areas. Some screenplays are more successful in terms of fun than others but the quality expressed from the beginning also remains in the additional chapters.", "date": "2023-04-11", "grade": "8.0"}
