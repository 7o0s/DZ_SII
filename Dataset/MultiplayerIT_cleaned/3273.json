{"name": "Grand Mountain Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grand-mountain-adventure-la-recensione.html", "text": "If we talk about video games dedicated to the world of skiing and snowboarding, most fans will think of the historic 1080 Snowboarding for Nintendo 64 and EA's SSX series, or perhaps Amped or even the more recent Steep. Grand Mountain Adventure, the protagonist of our review, is immediately striking for the different approach to the sports in question, offering a decidedly original and well-characterized experience. The first work of the Swedish team Toppluva, made up of three brothers who are all expert snowboarders, it is a mobile game that has already been available on Android for some time and has now also arrived on iOS. 8 resorts to explore Grand Mountain Adventure is above all a very rich content product, which is not exactly obvious on mobile platforms and even less if we consider the small size of the development team. In fact, 8 locations are made available, all reproductions of real ski resorts scattered around Europe between Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Finland and even Italy, with the Grolla Pass. However, only the first is included in the free version, while the others must be unlocked with an in-app purchase of 5.49. A fully justified figure, as we will see later. Grand Mountain Adventure is, in structure, an open world title: once you start the descent, whether it's on skis or snowboard, you can basically head to any part of the area you want. Freedom of movement, with no constraints other than those of physics (i.e. that you have to go down the slope) is the backbone of the whole experience, the cornerstone on which everything else has been built and, consequently, what which gives more gratification to the player during the games. The basic objective is to collect ski passes, through the various challenges present or simply through pure exploration: thanks to them, in fact, the ski lifts and subsequent contents can be unlocked. All of this happens ~alone~, because in Grand Mountain Adventure there are no opponents: the most you can meet is some other skier busy on his own in a descent or sunbathing outside a cabin, novice children who descend a snowplow or even some wild animal disturbed by our passage. Toppluva's effort aims precisely at recreating sensations and situations that those who experience this type of sport firsthand know very well from direct experience. Most of the challenges are related to tackling a descent within a track delimited by stakes, but there are also challenges involving tricks or alternatives that add variety. The level of difficulty is never prohibitive but rather varied, offering a certain challenge in some situations. The ability to rewind your actions a few seconds at a time with the press of a button further reduces any shadow of frustration, making it even clearer that the goal of the game is not at all to challenge the user, rather than guaranteeing an experience in which exploration and discovery and the simple pleasure of tackling the descents with skis on are the founding components. The beauty of the snow The control system is simple but not poor: on the sides of the screen there are icons representing the two sticks, through which the curves are managed but also the weight shift during jumps, all in a natural and effective way. Possibly the particular choice of the game shot may initially create some problems, which translates into a slightly inclined bird's eye view and placed in front of one's alter ego and not, more classically, behind him. The pleasure of playing Grand Mountain Adventure is also closely linked to the excellent work done by the team with regard to the technical component which, in a far from usual way, was all created internally, without the aid of pre-existing resources. This means that the game rests on a proprietary graphics engine that is truly a gem for what it is capable of offering, especially as regards the reproduction of the snow. The care taken in replicating all the different conditions in which the slopes can be found is truly incredible: there are the traces of one's own skis and those of other skiers, the typical signs of the passage of the snowcat, the footprints of animals, the fresh and groomed snow, small avalanches or the fall of some rocks and a whole series of other evidences that contribute to making the setting incredibly realistic. The attention to detail is superior to the mmedia, and that's something you appreciate all the time when you play Grand Mountain Adventure. Finally, the soundtrack is also really excellent, composed of very pleasant songs that are ideal for accompanying the action on the screen.", "date": "2020-02-01", "grade": "8.8"}
