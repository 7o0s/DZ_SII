{"name": "Shin Megami Tensei 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shin-megami-tensei-5-recensione.html", "text": "Let's face it honestly: if it hadn't been for the resounding success of Persona 5, today Shin Megami Tensei V would not have been one of the most anticipated titles of the year, at least in the West. Which is ironic, considering that the stylish Atlus franchise is literally the offshoot of a rib of Shin Megami Tensei, as we told you in celebration of its 25th anniversary of Persona. Not that MegaTen - as its fans affectionately call it - is an unknown series: the excellent Shin Megami Tensei IV had already made headlines, at the time of Nintendo 3DS, but either for a question of the public, or for a question of visibility and style, compared to its spin-off the Shin Megami Tensei series has always remained for a niche of hardened fans. Shin Megami Tensei V, the protagonist is a Nahobino Now, finally cleared by the success of Nintendo Switch, which justified the greatest hype, Shin Megami Tensei represents a new starting point for Atlus and a valid alternative for JRPG fans who dream of Persona 5 on the hybrid console of the big N that so far they've only had to settle for its sequel/spin-off Persona 5 Strikers or the recent remaster of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne. And Atlus is well aware of this. In our review of Shin Megami Tensei 5 we will explain what you can expect from this new gem which, for many of you readers, will probably be the first MegaTen and one of the most disturbing gaming experiences of your life. Stories of angels and demons Shin Megami Tensei V, Aogami is the being that will merge with the protagonist We don't want to anticipate anything that could spoil the surprise, but we must necessarily make a premise on the narrative: the first minutes of the game immediately drop you into a strongly mythological context, telling you of how God has assumed total control of creation by depriving human beings of the Knowledge. This has diminished every other supernatural being, relegating it to the imaginary dimension, when in reality demons, oni and any other kind of spirit or deity has been waiting for the great final battle for the conquest of human souls. Shin Megami Tensei 5 is a story about unspeakable forces and you will be caught in the middle. The silent protagonist is a very ordinary Tokyo high school student who slips into a tunnel one fine day to find out, together with some curious students, what happened after a mysterious accident. Suddenly finding himself in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, your alter ego immediately risks his life and is saved in extremis by a being called Aogami, who offers him to literally join forces and become a Nahobino, a hybrid neither man nor demon who can draw on unusual supernatural powers. The story of Shin Megami Tensei V takes a few hours to get going, although perhaps it would be better to say that it takes a few hours to reveal itself. In the beginning, in fact, you will find yourself wandering through the ruins of a distressing and hostile Tokyo, while trying to take the measures of the gameplay. With a goal to reach and no other short-term goals, the feeling is that of having ended up in a sort of creepy playground to be discovered. It is an approach that can disorient the more casual players, especially if they have known Atlus with its Personas and are used to being taken by the hand by a straightforward and didactic way of telling the story. Amazon offer Shin Megami Tensei V 59.9 See Offer Either for the vastness of the first explorable area, or for the caution with which you will gradually push yourself further and further away, it takes some time for the story to come to life and even then the narrative maintains a dilated but significant pace throughout the campaign. The absence of a real ~party~ means that the characterization of the supporting actors is entirely entrusted to the interlude scenes and dialogues: the cast does not rise to the levels of any Person, but the characters are all interesting, often wrapped in mysterious auras that intrigue and push you to continue the adventure just to understand where the bizarre script is going with this. Shin Megami Tensei V, Sophia presides over the Shadow World The themes, as usual, are far from trivial and the unusual representation of the supernatural factions on the field - with demons often portrayed in an ironic way and the angelic forces as a rigid dictatorship - tends to question the certainties of the player, especially when you have to make some choices that can have significantly different outcomes. Sometimes these choices can change the direction of a secondary mission. For example, you may decide to ally yourself with the demonwhom you were sent to assassinate, gaining his respect and maybe even his help. More often it will not even seem that there are immediate consequences, since it will be the set of our decisions to determine the alignment of the Nahobino and the development of the story, which can branch and end in different ways. Shin Megami Tensei V, the protagonist in human form To complete a single campaign of Shin Megami Tensei 5 it takes between 40 and 50 hours, but it is a very relative estimate that can depend on various factors such as the difficulty level set or the player's determination to complete each side mission. However, it is a long-lived and demanding title that does not get lost in lengthy or unnecessarily verbose dialogues, and which for this reason is very willing to be played again, thanks also to the possibilities offered by the New Game + mode. Demon fights Shin Megami Tensei V, the combat system is called Press Turn The Press Turn combat system, so dear to Atlus, returns in one of its driest and most balanced iterations. The Japanese developer has preferred a direct approach, without weighing it down with unnecessary complications or controversial upheavals in the name of forced innovation. Anyone who has played Persona 5 or Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne will immediately recognize the basics: you fight in turns, fielding a party of up to four characters - including the Nahobino - who act in the order of formation. Each enemy is more or less vulnerable to different types of magical and physical attacks, which not only deal more damage, but add an extra action to the player's turn. By exploiting the affinities with intelligence, it is possible to ring up to eight actions per turn, two for each member of the party, before it is the enemy's turn. Shin Megami Tensei V, Aramasa is a unique technique of the Nahobino The problem is precisely this: even the enemy can take advantage of your affinities to gain extra actions and exterminate you in the space of a turn. Shin Megami Tensei 5 allows you to choose between three starting difficulty levels, which will become four with the free update on launch day and the addition of a beginner level. The highest, Hard, is selectable only at the start of the game; later, the player can lower it at any time, but then he will not be able to raise it again. Instead, you can alternate between the Relax and Normal difficulty levels without limitations, but let's be very frank: Relax is also a demanding difficulty level that can put less prepared or far-sighted players in a corner. Also because you go into Game Over as soon as the Nahobino dies and it doesn't matter if the other demons in the team are still standing. Not being able to save at any time, but only in the vicinity of the energy sources, you will feel constantly on tenterhooks. All it takes is one misjudgment to end up on the main screen and lose any progress made since the last save. We understand Atlus' intent - after all you are playing an adventure that often borders on horror - but we admit that modern JRPGs have got used to it quite well in this sense and a form of automatic saving would have been appreciable. Shin Megami Tensei V, at each level up you can assign 1 point to the parameters of the Nahobino On the other hand, Shin Megami Tensei V is a title that wants to put you in difficulty and that makes the unexpected its forte. This also applies to fights, but not only. You can also bet on affinities as much as you like, but if a spell fails, is negated or absorbed, the Nahobino's team loses up to two actions at a time, handing a major advantage to the enemy. In terms of difficulty Relax, the weight of the strategy is felt a little less, but we assure you that already in Normal you have to rely on the various spells that improve or worsen the parameters to overcome even the most trivial clashes. In this sense, completing the side quests to unlock the Magatsuhi is one of the smartest things you can do during your stay in the afterlife. The Magatsuhi is a sort of super move that changes according to the species to which the character belongs, and which consumes a special indicator to be filled by collecting particles around the map or by satisfying certain requirements in combat. Its effects can be the most diverse: it can inflict massive damage to all enemies, or make every attack launched during a turn critical, improve or worsen the parameters, double the experience points at the end of the fight and so on. It is the only accessory of a combat system that does not hold big surprises, but which can be captivating, if not downright electrifying, when it comesbe prepared for the boss on duty. And then we go to the dear old ~trial and error~: we die, merge new demons and return to the office more prepared than before. Collectible demons Shin Megami Tensei V, decisions... decisions... A parallelism between Pokmon and Shin Megami Tensei V would not be entirely wrong: here too, monsters are collected to be deployed in battle. The small difference lies in the fact that the infamous Compendium of Shin Megami Tensei 5 includes biblical entities, deities belonging to the most disparate beliefs, urban legends and folk myths. They are all there, on the streets of Tokyo, indeed of the Da'at, the afterlife that has engulfed the Japanese capital and that the Nahobino and his companions from Bethel Japan must contain before it pours into your reality. The monsters are visible and identifiable: coming into contact with their models triggers combat, which is why it is better to take them by surprise with a sword stroke and start with an advantage. The interface is curiously bilingual, partly in Italian and partly ' English. We're not sure if it's intended; perhaps Nintendo will release an update that translates text that hadn't yet been localized in our review code, perhaps it's a stylistic choice. However, the dialogues are in Italian, as are the descriptions of the skills and monsters. Shin Megami Tensei V, Atlus' iconic mascot, Jack Frost The fact that the dialogues are in our language, however, doesn't help much when choosing Talk in the Nahobino's combat menu. As often happens in MegaTen, this option allows you to converse with demons and perhaps recruit them. They are delusional dialogues that often lead to nonsense: the attitude and appearance of the demon on duty should suggest the tone to take, but in any case most of these negotiations end up with Nahobino dropping Macca, Health/Magic Points and consumables . If all goes well, and the demon accepts, you'll end up with a new monster in your ranks. Collecting monsters is essential for several reasons. In the immediate future, it means having a new force to oppose your enemies, and you will often find yourself looking for the right monsters to face the next boss with an edge. Shin Megami Tensei V, the Cait Sith are among the first demons you will come across in the Da'at You may want to recruit them for collecting, after all there are more than two hundred and Masayuki Doi's character design translates well into their 3D models, full of details and animations. Each monster is also characterized by a nice card that tells some anecdote about it, and luckily video games aren't instructive. Did you know that your black cat could be a Cait Sith and that if you mistreat him, he could drag you into his supernatural realm with him? We don't and now we feel much more erudite. Joking aside, the recruited demons can merge into the World of Shadows, a dimension accessible through the Energy Sources where you will find Sophia waiting for you, a mysterious entity who will assist you in exercising fusion. If you prefer, you can call it the Velvet Room, the concept is the same. By fusing two or more demons, we get a new one that we can customize: in fact, it will inherit a certain number of skills or spells that we can choose when it is created. Shin Megami Tensei V, conversations with certain demons are truly delusional It is not strictly necessary to go looking for certain demons every time you need them for a fusion: after registering them in the Compendium, you can summon them again in exchange for Macca, which for the record is the money of Shin Megami Tensei V. You will accumulate them by selling the items valuables, also called relics, to the disturbing Gustave in the Corpse Den, an emporium accessible through the Energy Springs. Given the prohibitive cost of these evocations, it may be preferable to go and recover the demons in their natural habitat: a lower cost would certainly have streamlined this procedure, but it is also true that it can be significantly reduced by buying the appropriate Miracle. And this leads to another service of the World of Shadows that binds to the combat system, the fusions of demons and other dynamics of the gameplay. Shin Megami Tensei V, you will have understood it, is a refined puzzle game. The World of Shadows Shin Megami Tensei V, fight with two Azumi and one Tsuchigumo Glory is a second currency that you will need to hoard and spend sparingly. You will find it inside large silver crystals floating in mid-air in the most hidden places, or you will receive a small amount after finding the Miman for Gustave. These little creatures hide in the most unthinkable places and finding them will be a challenge, but", "date": "2021-11-04", "grade": "9.0"}
