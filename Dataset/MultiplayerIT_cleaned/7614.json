Games that at the time were a source of pride for millions of fans who owned a Sony console, and the forbidden dream of as many enthusiasts who could not enjoy these titles on their platforms. In recent years, we know, things have changed and today the series is forced to chase the antagonist of all time, FIFA, between attempts at arcade turns and sudden changes of course. In this sense Pro Evolution Soccer 14 seems to want to be a sort of starting point, a title that should act as a watershed with the recent past and bring the saga back on the old simulation tracks that made its fortune years ago. In short, the game is to be considered in all respects the first of a new era and therefore, in evaluating it, one cannot fail to take this detail into consideration. Having made this premise, let's go into our analysis of the new chapter of PES. Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 is renewed and focuses on the FOX Engine to try to return to the glories of the past The year zero Created by a new group of developers within Konami called PES Productions, Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 took four years of work, a period in which, according to what was revealed by the publisher, the team operated following the feedback received from the fans, starting practically from zero as far as the development of the entire game structure is concerned. The latter rests solidly on an adapted version of Hideo Kojima's FOX Engine, the one that will be used in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. And the results on the field can be seen. In fact, immediately after stepping onto the pitch and starting a game, one immediately realizes how playability benefits greatly from the use of the new engine. In fact, it is decidedly more satisfying from a simulation point of view than in the recent past, and the feeling you get after the first few bars is that of having greater control over what happens on the turf. We are not yet in the sphere of complete freedom without rails (there is still a little something above all on the occasion of goal kicks and sudden contrasts), but by limiting ourselves to the series such a level of freedom had never been reached. This as long as you use the manual settings, in our opinion the best way to enjoy the game, given that with the assisted ones it otherwise becomes a little more predictable and simplified. In any case, the good responsiveness of the players to the commands that are given to them (a little lag is present, but compared to the recent past it is much less annoying, except in the manual change of the player to be controlled), and the improved artificial intelligence of athletes themselves, guarantee greater variety in the composition and construction of an action. This prevents the gamer from suffering the typical frustration due to the delayed execution of one of his ~orders~ or from enticing him to try to head straight for the goal. What is also made more difficult both by the attention of the opponents, better disposed on the field, and by the new physics of the product, the management of which is entrusted to a system based in turn on the Havok engine. Escaping a marking isn't always easy, not even with precision dribbling (among other things, with the new system to do it you also have to take into account the shifting of the weight of the champion), and in this sense instead of a predefined series of animations that repeat repeatedly in similar game circumstances, now more natural and varied situations occur in the ~duels~ on the pitch. These are really calculated based on factors such as the physical strength and size of the players making the tackle, the direction from and intensity of a tackle or hold, and so on. The situations described above are managed by the player through the movement of the right analog stick, with which you can make your player spread his arms to keep the defender away, or stretch his hands to try to hold the shirt or to move with the shoulder the opponent to steal the ball from him. Everything doesn't always work properly, and sometimes one gets the feeling that the virtual footballers are light, but despite this, the gameplay is pleasant. Difficulty putting down a high ball, inertia caused by a sudden change of direction, having to press the button at the right time to head the head, or tripping over the ball due to an incorrect movement are all elements that we are and that give more credibility to the game.To all this is added the reduction of that excessive discrepancy between more or less technically and physically strong players, even if in certain situations the new collision system brings a bit of an advantage for very powerful teams such as Bayern Munich. At the level of collective play, the teams move quite well both offensively and defensively. Specifically, in attack we witness intelligent movements and functional overlaps to the scheme adopted, while in the coverage phases the players react more convincingly to dangerous situations, even if in some circumstances the defenses tend to get inserted too often centrally with rapid one two. It almost seems that when a through ball is thrown towards his own penalty area, the central defender closest to the ball loses himself for a moment looking at the ball before moving, and this gives a big advantage to the attacker who instead slingshots on the ball and grabs it the weather. In general, however, passing over situations like the one just described, the rearguards appear to be more attentive in marking, anticipating and sensibly reading the opponent's offensive action. Official licenses Also in the 2014 edition Pro Evolution Soccer fails to match the dominance of Electronic Arts in the field of official licenses. However Konami can boast some exclusive exclusive of absolute prestige, such as those relating to the UEFA Champions League, the Europa League, the AFC and the Copa Libertadores, with the related participating teams. Then there are the European Super Cup and the Club World Cup. To these are added those for the Dutch, Spanish, French championships, the Argentine and Chilean new entries, and those of the Italian and Brazilian Serie A (both lack the official names and the Lega Calcio and Brasileiro logos). The English tournament is still out of the running: although the players' names are all faithfully reported, the only team to appear with official names, flags and uniforms is Manchester United. Almost the same situation for the Portuguese Primeira Liga, with only three licensed teams: SL Benfica, SC Braga and FC Porto. As far as the national teams are concerned, almost all the most important ones enjoy the necessary permits to be reproduced, as in reality. Negative note for the team rosters, unfortunately updated at the end of July: Konami has however ensured that the latest market changes in the rosters will be implemented through a patch that will be released shortly. A matter of the heart Similarly, goalkeepers are more cautious and react quite well to dangerous situations. Compared to the past, they cover the near post better, and even if they still tend to commit some ingenuity, at least in outings, in principle they give more guarantees between the posts. Shooting accuracy therefore becomes an even more determining factor in trying to put the ball into the net. To conclude towards the goal, however, the gamer must take into account several factors when he decides to try his luck: first of all the way in which the athlete he is controlling at that moment gets to hit the ball. In fact, the engine takes into account with a fair precision the timing in pressing the appropriate key, the position of the athlete's body, the speed with which he arrives on the leather ball, his preferred foot and the portion of the ball that is ~ touched~. This actually adds that element of randomness that exists in real football, and which causes the ball to literally jump in the air or end up bouncing between the feet of an opponent if certain parameters are not met. The only sore point in this sense is linked to the weight of the ball, which appears a little lighter than usual. To partially remedy the thing and have slightly more credible and more tense conclusions, even in this case it is advisable to focus on advanced manual controls rather than assisted ones, as well as resorting to double-tapping the shooting button. Proceeding further, another of the most interesting innovations introduced in this chapter of PES is undoubtedly the so-called Heart, the function that determines the attitude of a team or of an individual player in relation to what happens in the stands. In practice, athletes are subject to certain emotional values, which is why in front of a warm crowd that encourages them, they will find new emotional resources to push the accelerator harder if they have to attempt a comeback, or defend their advantage. Conversely, if they are away, they can suffer strong negative psychological pressures, thus committing errors in the coverage or setting phase. Above allwhen the stamina of the athletes at the end of the race is reduced to a minimum, this can prove useful. In such situations, even more so, the champion can get excited and find the decisive starting point for his team. Because if it is true that in Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 the tactical organization and the collective are fundamental elements to give the champion the opportunity to express himself at his best and make a difference, it is also true that the latter can still pull the classic play that resolves the match. And this is where the Player ID comes into play. Less invasive than in the recent past (so don't expect the old unstoppable gallops of Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo against everyone) in the game we have a sort of evolution of this technology which allows, we remind you, to have the most important players digitally reproduced with their to act and with their parameters which reflect, or should reflect, those of the real counterparts. In the previous chapter, there were about fifty top players who enjoyed such treatment. Well, that's about double that here, and more importantly, it seems to work better from an AI and animation standpoint. When the match requires it, the skills of these champions can be successful: a precise free-kick at the crossroads, a robbery goal or a shot from outside the area are just some of the solutions that athletes with their own Player ID will naturally look for. Champions and championships Closed the large parenthesis dedicated to the gameplay, let's now find out which and how many game modes are available, selectable through a decidedly uncomfortable and really ugly menu. In addition to the classic performances available in all guises, even those related to cups or spectator mode, and the plethora of licensed competitions, cups and personalized tournaments, there are free training sessions and specific ones, where you can learn all the novelties of the gameplay through an interesting and complete tutorial. Finally we have the return of the League Mode absent in PES 2013, and within Mondo Calciatore the classic Master League, both offline and online, and Become a Legend. The latter mode is substantially similar to the past one, except for the addition of the possibility of also impersonating a goalkeeper, while the Master League is the one that has undergone the most changes, to the point of being more simplified. First of all, some boundary elements have been eliminated such as the skits relating to the coach or the secretary, and new ones have been implemented that are more useful to the context, such as for example for the presentation of the players, the delivery of the Ballon d'Or, etc. On the other hand, however, the staff, the doctor and the observer were removed. Changes also for the market, which has been simplified and reduced in times (there is no scanning in days) and in some functions, even if various aspects relating to the management of sales and the career of the technician have finally been fixed. You can buy players from other continents, and to do so you have to take into account the loyalty of an athlete towards your club or the prestige of the team concerned, as well as that of the player himself. While as far as the coaches are concerned, at the end of their contract they can move from one team to another, change leagues and, if they wish, they can agree to be the technical director of a national team at the same time as that of a club. For the rest, as always, they will have to manage every aspect of their club, worrying about contract renewals, the transfer market, matches, the Primavera team and buying specific items to enrich the team's training program with new exercises useful for improving their attributes. In general, the mode seemed to us less deep and well-finished than usual, with a calendar that was among other things strange and an evaluation system of the cards of some players that was exaggerated downwards or upwards compared to their real potential. To close the modality topic, as unfortunately happens in these cases, it was not possible for us to properly test the online component. However we can confirm what we anticipated in a previous preview, namely that the game on the net is conceptually similar to the one seen in the previous episode of the series, with myPes for Facebook, with ranked matches, tournaments and the community, but with more options to customize your matches against other players, lobbies and more. In addition, there are a series of filters that should serve to offer a more advanced matchmaking system to better divide players into ladders according to their skill level.", "date": "2013-09-18", "grade": "8.5"}
