{"name": "Circulate", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/circulate.html", "text": "Have you ever tried those aquatic games in which you have to place pieces in the right order on the bottom, trying to somehow compensate for the inertia during the descent movement? Well, Circulate is clearly inspired by this type of puzzle, given that in each stage the aim is to group spheres of the same color in different ways, with the constant of making them ~fall~ by means of gravity. We will therefore find ourselves having to put identical or opposite spheres together to eliminate each other, or to have them end up in special spaces according to the color, possibly with the addition of devices that can help us in the enterprise or make things more difficult for us. If in the case of aquatic harps it was possible to adjust the movements of the pieces using side buttons that blew air into the water, in the case of Circulate we will find centrifugal energy assisting us... The fifty stages that we will face, as mentioned, require the arrangement of the spheres in certain ways to be completed. Sometimes we will have to make them all disappear, perhaps placing the ~hot~ ones side by side with the ~cold~ ones; in other cases, we will simply have to drop them inside a container, possibly dividing them according to the color. But how are we going to get some spheres to go one way and others the other? We will need to use rotation, of course: by moving the d-pad to the left or right, we will rotate the stage respectively counterclockwise and clockwise, at such a speed that the spheres will remain stationary in their position until the end of the ~round~. With a little practice, therefore, it will be possible to divide groups of spheres simply by performing rotations and correcting the downward trajectories as appropriate. As we continue in the stages, we will also find a series of devices to make things more complex: gates, ~fixed~ spheres and bombs to be activated by pressing the 1, 2 and 3 keys on the numeric keyboard. In Circulate each level is a puzzle to be solved, and it is clear that in the absence of the minimum elements to do it, game over is incurred. This means that in the more advanced stages we will have to adopt strategies based on ~trial & error~ to understand exactly how to achieve our goal. The game's graphics use a hybrid bitmap/vector system which on the one hand ensures the readability of the interface and the presence of special effects, on the other hand allows the rotations to always be extremely fluid and fast, without uncertainties or slowdowns of any kind. The end result may not be extraordinary or spectacular, but it certainly proves to be functional with respect to the action, and in a puzzle game that is enough. As far as the sound is concerned, however, unfortunately the introductory music is decidedly to be forgotten, while in the middle of the stages there is absolute silence: very little. The control system, as mentioned above, relies on the d-pad for rotating the stages and some keys for activating extra devices. The response to inputs is immediate and precise, without ever a problem.
