{"name": "TNA Impact - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tna-impact-recensione.html", "text": "The feeling of the old 80's Wrestling What is immediately surprising about TNA Impact is the control system, effective and quick to learn. The commands are simple but numerous: each key is dedicated to a different action. Kicks, punches, run, reverse, action, catch, defense. The backs and fronts are exploited to the maximum, but without instilling the slightest delay or doubt in playing, resulting easy to learn and above all to use. There are dozens of different grips, and they are performed not through complicated combinations of several keys, but only with the Y: in fact, our athlete performs a different move depending on the position of the body with respect to the opponent. Side by side, in front or behind, the final effect of the combo is always different. Easy to learn, hard to know how to use to the fullest. In online matches, for example, the difference between players is created precisely by the intelligence with which the moves are performed, rather than by the best dexterity of each one. The rings, unlike traditional combat sports, are hexagonal, and the roster to choose from boasts almost thirty wrestlers including Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Booker T, Homicide, Sting, Shark Boy and many others, excluding (too bad ) of sinuous female wrestlers. What is immediately surprising about TNA Impact is the control system, effective and quick to learn The feeling of the old 80's Wrestling During fights, two indicators appear at the top left. The first reveals the level of Impact reached, which once at the maximum allows you to perform special moves and end the match in a more spectacular way. The second is our health, like any self-respecting fighting game. Alongside these two indicators, however, there is yet another, perhaps the most important, which reveals which parts of the body have suffered the most damage and which ones are still fully healthy. By always making different moves, critical points such as legs, arms, body and head are hit, which vary in color from green to orange, up to red, which means criticality and a prelude to the final knockdown of victory. TNA Impact is not a button smashing game, that is, a title in which you just madly press the keys in random order. Keeping an eye on those indicators leads to victory, and to make your opponent give in you need to perform a certain variety of moves: always using the same keys and the same combinations doesn't pay. Watchword: viuuuulence! There is a button dedicated to reverse, or counter-moves that neutralize the effect of an enemy attack, bringing it to our advantage. These must be performed with a certain precision, to be activated and be effective, otherwise the opponent will hit us violently. This last word seems to be the keyword of TNA Impact: there are no rules, you can use objects at ringside, crush enemies against metal fences, or throw them on steel corners. Each wrestler uses a different style, which allows them to rely more on stunts, strikes or submissions. The Midway game boasts all the traditional modes of every fighting game: there is obviously the simple match, single or two-on-two tag team, submissions (where the only way to win the match is precisely to keep the opponent down) , Falls Count (in two or four), two-on-one fights, and finally the fateful Ultimate X, which every fan of the TNA league will surely know. In practice, it is a question of having to conquer a large red X hanging in the center of the ring on two large cables. you can use objects at ringside, crush enemies against metal fences, or throw them on the steel corners of the ring Watchword: viuuuulence! To be able to grab it, it is necessary to climb the steel turrets on the sides and advance on the ropes relying only on the strength of the arms. Simple to say, much less done, given that the opposing wrestler will continually try to throw us off balance and hinder our path. Once hanging in the air, flying battles bordering on the surreal start, hanging by the arms, kicking and trying to hook the enemy with the legs. Regardless of these modes, the first one to run in single player is the story. You choose your favorite wrestler, after which the adventure begins, narrated through cut-scenes created with the game's graphics engine. The stories are decidedly superficial and non-sense, but only serve to give the pretext to the various fights that quickly follow each other. After the first games, really fun and exciting (they remind us of the first Wrestling titles for NES and SuperNES),the limitations of TNA Impact come to light. Although Midway had promised almost 2,000 different moves in the game, the final result has been significantly scaled down due to the choice to simplify the controls. On the one hand, the choice was certainly right, because the controls are effective and fun, but on the other they failed to further diversify the range of possibilities originally promised. Comment TNA Impact is an enjoyable wrestling game, by virtue of its easy to learn yet deep controls. The problem is that by eliminating key combinations and difficult pad virtuosity, the moves have been decidedly limited in number and all the wrestlers perform the same, almost eliminating their unique fighting characteristics. The Ultimate X mode is well done, but it gets boring quickly and the few online and customization options don't help to increase the longevity of the game. The wrestlers are well done, however to the detriment of everything around them: backgrounds and spectators seem from a previous generation. The foundations for creating a flawless game are all there, now Midway is expected to retrace his steps and be able to improve all the aspects of TNA Impact that are not convincing. Ultimately, a game recommended for fans of Wrestling and TNA, we recommend everyone else to try it. Pros Creation of fighters Intuitive control system Cons Few moves, one size fits all Poor customization possibilities Some issues with animations Xbox 360 goals TNA Impact provides the player with the canonical 1000 points. The former are unlocked in a very few moments, just long enough to start a game with some particular wrestlers (Sting, for example). All the others are obtained naturally by advancing with the story mode and obtaining victories in single player and tag team. Then there are many objectives that refer to the stories behind TNA and concern the relationships between various wrestlers, and are unlocked only by defeating particular wrestlers and selecting some others. Ultimately it is a game that from this point of view can give satisfaction, in a relatively short time. Simplicity or complication? TNA is aiming for the former. The individuality of each wrestler was thus sacrificed, as TNA Impact recycles the same moves for all fighters present. Everyone has their own favorite style, it's true, but within those few macro-categories the shots are performed by everyone in the same way and with the same animation. Furthermore, before starting the story mode, we are asked to create our fighter starting from a rather limited set of choices, which includes a few dozen trousers, as many shirts, a few tattoos and a few different masks. In short, the possibility of customization is decidedly limited and irrelevant. A pity, considering the online game and its customization potential. However, the available TNA athletes are created very well, with a good number of polygons and well-defined textures. The old Unreal Engine always does its duty in these cases. The individuality of each wrestler has been sacrificed, as TNA Impact recycles the same moves for all wrestlers present Simplicity or complication? TNA is aiming for the former. Unfortunately, as much care has not been placed in the backgrounds surrounding the rings, all well characterized and different as they are made in an approximate way. Few side elements, many spectators who, however, wave and move with animations that are not up to par and a rather low definition of the textures. The animations of the various moves are well done, but not well connected to each other, and with a certain tendency of the characters to slip and ~adjust~ the position of the body in an artificial way, they create an unrealistic effect. The soundtrack, rocking and very American, does its duty without particularly distinguishing itself in quality and quantity, limiting itself to highlighting the salient moments of the game and of the story. Noises and sounds are well sampled, and the Italian commentary is fun to listen to. Midway has promised not to forget the many fans of TNA (many in the United States, less in our country), and has announced a series of content to download via Xbox Live Marketplace and PSN, which will arrive in the near future.", "date": "2008-09-29", "grade": null}
