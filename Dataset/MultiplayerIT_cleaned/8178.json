{"name": "A Musical Story", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/a-musical-story-recensione.html", "text": "Do you remember the years between the sixties and seventies? Those of the student revolts, of the tensions between two global powers and their innumerable ~races~, of the affirmation of the electronic as a communicative and artistic medium, of the counterculture? Do you remember what air we breathed in those years? Probably not, but then again, neither can we. Anyone who lived those twenty years to the fullest is a child of the post-war period, a grandson of a world war he has heard of, but whose results he was able to vividly observe, before they were rapidly covered by a veil of illusionistic ~resurgence~. However, more or less direct testimonies have come down to today, giving us the idea (or rather, building it for us) of what it meant to live in those years of cultural ferment. Thus, we have perceptual associations imprinted in our heads that are triggered whenever we are in contact with sounds and images coming from that period or depicting it. Who doesn't have in mind the image of Jimi Hendrix on stage at Woodstock or Martin Luther King's speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial or, again, the visual accounts of Vietnam through the lens of photographers like Nick t and Eddie Adams? This audiovisual ~bombardment~ has created a whole series of labels with which we identify this period, of which we have distant memories or which is only part of our family past. And there is no doubt that this leads to a whole series of cognitive processes, which can rely as much on nostalgia as on fascination, depending on the sensations experienced by the individual and on the bond they have established with the latter over time. It is precisely these elements that make someone want to go back to exploring these environments, these ~flavors~, which can be as much a distant memory as a socio-memorial construct that has met our path, marking our perception of a world that we know only through constantly mediated sources. A Musical Story, the first work of the small French team Glee-Cheese Studio, is the result of this encounter, investigating a past time in an intimate and vibrant way. We go into more detail in our review of A Musical Story. An audiovisual narrative A Musical Story: a road trip without words A Musical Story is exactly what the title suggests: a musical story. Indeed, for the entire duration of the game, words are never used as a form of communication. The only elements that narrate the events treated are images and, above all, sounds. Through these two means, the road trip with the latter's band unfolds before us and the protagonist, stuck in a coma, heading towards a music festival that loudly recalls the imagery of Woodstock. Like any journey, however, the road taken can lead to non-pre-established territories. This does not mean that we have the possibility to choose the fate of the young Gabriel and his friends: the story narrated is linear and the player is not given decision-making powers, a position that is becoming increasingly rare within the gaming landscape. Telling a univocal story, without crossroads, which goes from one point to another in a straight line, implies a strong trust and communicative urgency. A Musical Story falls within these parameters, but there is no doubt that the effectiveness of this narrative approach works only partially. A Musical Story: through the reconstruction of Gabriel's memories, we discover the ins and outs of his journey to Pinewood The deprivation of a voice and the responsibility attached to sounds and images alone has not exactly succeeded in making us empathetically bond with the characters. We were always on the verge of being emotionally engulfed by this narrative, but something denied us access, as if we were watching it all from behind a glass (which, in some ways, we are). The other side of the coin, however, has seen us completely addicted to this audiovisual universe, which recalls the American territory in every way, but which could also easily show the French one, where the members of the development team grew up. The question does not concern so much the identification of this or that other place, but rather the seventies as an iconographic soil of collective memory. In time with the music A Musical Story: the entire game is punctuated by seventies sounds, adapted to a current conception of the musical landscape You've probably heard the expression ~this isn't a game, it's an experience.~ Here, A Musical Story follows that canon a bit. The Glee-Cheese Studio title is undoubtedly a video game, but it is also an audiovisual experience. In fact, forget itdifficulty levels, ~game over~ and the like: this is a video game where it is impossible to lose. The category in which it can be placed is that of the rhythm video game, given that the aim is to play the notes that are indicated in advance at the right time on the screen by pressing only two keys (on controllers it makes no difference which ones you reward, as long as they are placed either to the right or to the left of the central axis of the pad). A mixture that recalls both the legacy of Guitar Hero-style musical titles and the more traditional ~Simon Says~. We greatly appreciated the constant increase in the complexity of the pieces to be performed, starting from fairly linear sonorities up to countermelodies and sound asymmetries. A Musical Story: The goal is to play various types of instrumental loops correctly Each chapter follows a different fragment of the protagonist's memory. Our task is to sequentially complete the loops of the instruments that make up the theme of this episode, so as to reconstruct the memory and gradually discover how Gabriel ended up in a hospital bed. But don't worry: if you miss one of the notes in the loop, you can basically try again indefinitely until you manage to frame the right rhythmic sequence, the only way to proceed to the next frame (a dispassionate advice is to deactivate the aids immediately, so they are of little use and only affect the harmony of the splendid visual sector). Once you get carried away, you can also choose to repeat the various chapters, twenty-four in all, so as to try to complete each one without errors and unlock a bonus episode. Whether you decide to just follow the story and then abandon the title or try to complete the all one hundred percent, the game is certainly not long-lived. In the first case, it will take you a couple of hours, while in the second it could reach five. That said, we absolutely do not feel like condemning the title as ~not long enough~. The myth of duration brings with it the ghost of repetition; and a game with this setting can't afford to bore its audience. A Musical Story: The Road to Pinewood As soon as we started, we would have liked to play it endlessly, but after a few hours the structure was starting to ~heavier~ (perhaps the best approach is to play it calmly, without consuming it all in one go, as, on the other hand, they suggest the developers as well, as they return the player to the chapter select screen every two episodes or so). Fortunately, it ended at just the right time, on the very edge of the line between dissatisfaction and satiety. Furthermore, something that not many are able to achieve after the end of their narrative, discovering that it is possible to unlock a bonus chapter gave us a further push to return to the game and retrace the adventure even in a scattered way, following the pieces of music that most amazed us. An ode to the senses A Musical Story: Although each frame is a work in itself, the game is at its best ~on the move~ We are surrounded by hyper-realistic or extremely stylized video games, in two or three dimensions, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The more development studios push themselves to look for innovative ways to propose an iconic stylistic line, the more we think that by now almost every road has been taken. And yet, we continue to find new and unconventional points of view, which truly have the ability to leave a mark in the common imagination. The one behind A Musical Story is one of these. Conceived as an illustration in continuous movement, which recalls the style of the psychedelic posters of the seventies (with also some references to the ~stippling~ technique) and that of television cartoons (for everything concerning the effect of psychotropic substances), the game immediately stands out for its highly fascinating visual sector, characterized by the absence of shadows, replaced by ever-changing background colors. The scenes represented are lost (or come to life, depending on the point of view) in these monochromes, capable of flattening and, at the same time, expanding the subjects represented in a space apparently without identifiable boundaries, both physical and metaphorical. A Musical Story: visual insights like those adopted in this game remind us how much this medium is capable of surprising Despite the general mastery behind the visual sector, this would be nothing without the sonic counterpart. The real foundations of the game are, of course, the musical ones, which link each sequence in what could easily be seen as a long single composition, without interruption. The strength of the columnsound is certainly given by the loop structure, which allow you to link every moment in a fluid way, without annoying interruptions. Even repeating a sequence over and over again doesn't lead to frustration, precisely because this structure makes everything more usable. Furthermore, we are witnessing a continuous crescendo, both in terms of assimilation of the loop (at first repeated several times to give the possibility of adapting to the rhythm, but then a barely mentioned rarity which will directly recall the player's mnemonic ability), and from the point of view of narrative disclosure. A Musical Story: once a memory has been reconstructed, we witness a real audiovisual expansion, which leads from a circular fragment to the screened totality Each loop performed correctly causes a fragment of memory to appear in a circle in the center of a black background. When all the musical instruments are brought ~into play~, the scene explodes, revealing the memory in its entirety, both expository and in format. The definitive experience is obtained if played, as well as with headphones (which is recommended by the developers themselves), in the dark and, perhaps, with a good system of lights synchronized with the images on the screen, so as to be sensorially overwhelmed every time you unlock a memory. The scenic workmanship evokes the image of a sort of ~well of memories~ fed by a few drops of water that quickly become a stormy sea, also without borders.", "date": "2022-03-30", "grade": "9.0"}
