{"name": "Transformers Prime", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/111237-transformers-prime-trasformazione-perfetta.html", "text": "Back on the crest of the wave in recent years, thanks above all to the film trilogy directed by Michael Bay, the Transformers have also been the protagonists of a large number of animated series whose goal was to revive already known characters by providing them with a different design and background. In the case of ~Transformers Prime~, we are faced with a CG cartoon, also broadcast in Italy, which takes up the theme of the alliance between the Autobots and some brave kids, in this case Jack, Miko and Raf, to counter the threat of the Decepticons, determined to conquer the Earth after the destruction of Cybertron. We therefore find the inevitable Optimus Prime together with Ratchet and Bumblebee, with an appearance similar to that (very bad) of the film version, accompanied by two new entries, namely the clumsy but powerful Bulkhead and the snappy Arcee. Within a campaign consisting of thirteen levels we will have to take turns in command of these Autobots and thwart the plans of the evil Megatron, who, while trying to appropriate a huge meteorite full of Dark Energon, awakened the gigantic Thunderwing, a titan follower of Unicron whose only reason for living is the destruction of the Matrix. Autobots, transform! Transformers Prime is a third-person action game very similar to the various tie-ins already produced by Activision in the past, but evidently designed for a rather young audience, or at least this is what can be seen from the general lack of content. In fact, the internships are too short, a ~hit and run~ which, while revealing a certain potential (the controls work well, the fights are well represented), never manages to take off precisely because it is choked by miserable times. The control system sees us grip Wii-mote and Nunchuk and use a traditional mold configuration: the analog stick to move the character, the A button to jump, the B trigger to open fire and the Z button to lock- on of a target. Acting on the left and right directions of the d-pad it is possible to move the view in robot mode, while pressing the C button switches to vehicle mode. Finally, the basic combos are carried out by shaking the controller: the system is simple but effective and, thanks to the presence of numerous bullet times, quite spectacular in its results. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, Bulkhead and Arcee in fact know how to assert themselves and have a repertoire of moves with a fundamentally identical value, but fairly varied in terms of choreography. In short, let's say that it is difficult to get tired of melee, given the quantity of actions that can be performed and the dynamism conferred by the fact of being able to transform at any time and perhaps exploit the momentum to break through the energy shields of the opponent on duty. Microtransformers Although simple and far from original, therefore, the gameplay of Transformers Prime works. The title developed by Now Production lets itself be played with pleasure but the aforementioned brevity of the sessions inevitably clips its wings, however giving us a campaign that is completed without problems within three hours. Furthermore, the opportunity to exploit a giant like Thunderwing during the boss fights appears ~wasted~, given that those who see him as the protagonist are much simpler than when we face normal Decepticons, in situations that are quite different from each other. It could have focused more on exploration, an element that appears just mentioned in some missions, as well as on the ~obstacle courses~ to be overcome by quickly passing from the form of a vehicle to that of a robot, this too a solution that is used too little. The play offer is therefore poor and the presence of three competitive multiplayer modes (for two players plus bots, strictly locally and not online) solves little in terms of duration of the experience. Finally, from a technical point of view, everything is exactly as we expected: simple polygonal models, ugly textures and mostly anonymous and uninspired scenarios, or rather what multiplatform productions have accustomed us to for years on Wii. On the other hand, the sound sector is surprising, both because of the good dubbing in Italian (a pity that many sentences lack the necessary conviction and therefore appear out of context), and for the quality of the music, which deserved a better location.", "date": "2012-11-21", "grade": "5.8"}
