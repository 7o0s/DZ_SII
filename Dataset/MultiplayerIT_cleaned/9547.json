The problem is that the gigantic one located in the city of Willamette, Colorado, is full ... of zombies. A mysterious pathogen has caused the dead to rise from their graves and invade the streets, in turn biting and transforming anyone who stands in front of them. The result is an entire area under quarantine, with the American government having to decide how to solve the problem before it becomes unmanageable and an assault photojournalist, Frank West, determined to get the scoop of his life. Frank hires a helicopter ride and gets dropped off right on the roof of the Willamette mall, asking the pilot to come back for him in three days: enough time to take a lot of pictures and figure out what the hell happened. However, the survivors stand between Frank and his goal, people who somehow managed to escape the terrible fate of ending up devoured by zombies but who need help to reach the safe haven that is located in the maintenance room of the structure. The rude appearance of the photographer hides a noble soul, and so the robust character cannot fail to lend assistance to those who ask him, trying to carry on his reportage hand in hand. Released in 2006 exclusively for Xbox 360, Dead Rising was able to displace critics and audiences due to a structure that was anything but friendly, which required backtracking within a high number of ~escort~ missions, in which it was necessary not to only to reach one of the survivors inside the boundless shopping center, but also to accompany him safely to the shelter. To make things more complicated, a strict time limit that marked the events of the main mission and that could in no way be ignored to save a few more lives: if things got too complicated, the only option was to abandon someone at the own destiny and carry on. Such ruthless gameplay was combined with an extraordinary technical realization, which combined extremely convincing animations with a disproportionate number of zombies managed simultaneously by the graphics engine, all without the slightest slowdown. From stars to rags The conversion of Dead Rising for Wii has shown that modifying even just one of the elements that held the Capcom product together, in an undoubtedly precarious balance, meant distorting it. A shopping mall where there weren't hundreds of zombies on every corner but only dozens already communicated a different idea from the original one. The rest was done by a questionable control system and weapons management. Having therefore ascertained that Frank West's adventure could in no way be redesigned for a platform with lower technical capabilities, why was it decided to make it a portable edition for iPhone and iPod Touch? Mystery. Dead Rising Mobile therefore enriches the collection of Capcom titles on the App Store, but not in the way everyone hoped. The starting story is the same one we already know, with Frank finding himself inside a gigantic structure filled with the undead. The objectives change: instead of actually rescuing survivors, the character finds himself completing senseless missions such as collecting one guy's favorite record, another guy's car keys, and so on, interspersed with fights with normal zombies and with the so-called ~mad zombies~, somewhat enhanced versions of the undead we are used to. If from a technical point of view we hoped to be able to speak of a small miracle, the reality of the facts is quite different: the zombies are invisible from afar, they appear on the screen only when they are a few meters from Frank and in any case in small numbers. But the problem more than anything else are the polygonal models, which look like those of the Dreamcast and represent a clear step backwards compared to what the Apple device has shown it can do, even in recent times. Finally, to make matters worse, the control system arrives, borrowed from the classic episodes of Resident Evil and therefore with the protagonist struggling to turn around and change direction, while the camera seems to go about its own business. The original music of Dead Rising and the presence of the interesting ~rescue call~ option (with which it is possible to ask for help from a friend via Game Center as soon as the game over occurs) alone are absolutely not enough to make the general picture less sad .
