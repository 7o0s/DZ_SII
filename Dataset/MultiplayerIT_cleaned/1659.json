{"name": "Golden Sun: The Lost Age", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/golden-sun-the-lost-age_a.html", "text": "Prologue Golden Sun: The Lost Age begins just as the previous adventure ended. So let's take a step back. The saga takes place in a world, Weyard, where the power of Alchemy once dominated unchallenged, a science that had led men down the path of violence and corruption. Thus, this practice was banned and sealed for centuries in an ancient sanctuary, Sol Sanctum, protected by the village of Vale above. One day, Vale is devastated by a terrible storm, which claims several victims, including the parents and brother of Jenna, a best friend of our (first) protagonist, Isaac. The years go by, and later almost for fun Isaac, Jenna and the stubborn Garret introduce themselves with their mentor Kraden in Sol Sanctum and, unknowingly, lead two shady characters: Saturos and Menardi, exponents of the Clan of Mars, intent on stealing the elemental stones kept in the temple to activate mystical mechanisms, the Elemental Lighthouses, scattered around the world and apparently capable of revealing the secrets of Alchemy. Furthermore, Saturos and Menardi appear to ours in the company of none other than Felix, Jenna's brother believed to be dead, and another individual, the mysterious Alex, who will appear to help and hinder our heroes at the same time throughout history. Saturos, Menardi and Felix then kidnap Jenna and the wise old Kraden and practically vanish into thin air; Needless to say, Isaac and Garret are on their trail almost instantly and embark on a journey to Weyard with a dual purpose: to save their friends and stop the Clan of Mars; journey during which they will meet formidable allies such as Ivan and Mia, as their ~Adepts~, i.e. holders of the mystical power called Psyenergy, based on natural elements. Golden Sun ended with the cataclysmic defeat of Saturos and Menardi on top of the second Lighthouse they activated, that of Mercury, while Felix, Jenna, Kraden and the mysterious Adepta Sheba were thrown on a remote island in the ocean, separated from Isaac and comrades. Here begins our adventure, with Felix as the leader of a new group of Adepts who will have to deal with the evil that seeks to ruin, once again, Weyard... Not as inspired or profound as the storylines born from the minds of SquareEnix, the plot of Golden Sun: The Lost Age develops the mediocre incipit offered by the prequel, counting on more charismatic and interesting characters (especially Sheba and Piers), and through a rather uncertain initial arc, takes off from the point where the new party reunites with the old man to arrive at a truly epic ending. The Lost Age There are no changes of any kind from the point of view of the gameplay: The Lost Age is a faithful sequel to Golden Sun also in the concept. Like any self-respecting JRPG, The Lost Age forces the player to explore various locations and dungeons, interspersing the raids with the classic random fights (with a rather annoying frequency). The difference, however, between Golden Sun and the other JRPGs is the puzzle system that unites it more to Zelda than to Final Fantasy: exploration is not aimed at simply reaching the way out, the progression must be sweaty by solving puzzles and puzzles in industrial quantities, of a rather high difficulty. The resolution of the puzzles is entrusted not only to a certain logical and intuitive ability, but also to the skilful use of the ~field~ psyenergy possessed by the various characters: here then is that a surface of leaves can be swept away by a cyclone, that a puddle of water turns into a pillar of ice etc. Among other things, Camelot had the good idea of including in The Lost Age a large number of brand new psyenergy alongside the old ones: in addition to the aforementioned cyclone (Cyclone, different from the Whirlwind already present in the first episode and reproposed here), among others, psyenergy make their appearance capable of draining water (Parch), digging (Scoop), laying ropes (Lash) and even causing earthquakes (Tremor). However, psyenergy are not limited solely to puzzle solving, as they prove to be heinous murderous tools in combat. Each of the characters in the party masters a natural element, and it is on this that the entire set of spells is based, taken directly from Golden Sun and expanded by a number of brand new spells. Therefore, the Djinn also return, on which it is necessary to say a few words: a Djinni is a little creature, vaguely similar to a Pokmon, which embodies the elemental forces; scattered around the world it is possible to recover seven Djinn per element, which once captured (often after having fought them) canbe joined to one character at a time, so that they can increase the value of the psychophysical statistics and the pool of skills and spells. Obviously, it is advisable to combine Djinn of the same element with each character, but the combination of several Djinn of various elements allows you to discover spells and secret classes. Furthermore, Djinn can be called into battle to exploit their mystical powers, and by accumulating them the summons of powerful esoteric creatures become available: the more Djinn of the same element are available in battle, the more powerful the summonable creature will be. On balance, since the first Golden Sun the summons available were sixteen, but Camelot has introduced an interesting novelty in The Lost Age: the Combo Tablet, or the ~bi-elemental~ summons. These mystical hidden tablets must first be found and retrieved for the player to be able to summon creatures from supernatural planes that harness Djinn of two elements rather than one - needless to say these are the most complex, destructive and spectacular summonings yet. As is clear, the combat system of Golden Sun is back in all its simplicity and strategic immediacy, with its most exciting features (the regular crits and the special ones of the weapons, for example, increasingly elaborate and imaginative) and also with its flaws: Camelot does not seem to have corrected the annoying tendency of taking a defensive position and losing the turn of the characters who are assigned to hit an enemy who is eliminated before their attack. As they say, winning team... I + II = 128 Let's clarify one detail right away: from a technical point of view, Golden Sun 2 hasn't changed one iota from its illustrious predecessor. Indeed, it would be more correct to say that it hasn't even improved... but that it has been enriched. Book I aficionados, therefore, will find in The Lost Age the spectacular features that had made the prequel great: an excellent character design of monsters and characters, highly detailed in-game artwork, an extraordinary and a truly incredible wealth of special effects. But Camelot didn't limit itself to re-proposing the same code making minimal variations, it actually seems to have decided to squeeze every bit of free space in the cartridge (which, we recall, is a good 128MB) to fill the game with a number of touches of class and details really disproportionate. And if on the one hand an engine that would make the sprites less pixelated during rotations or zooms in fights would have been appreciated, on the other it is impossible not to appreciate the inclusion, sometimes even excessive, of visual effects of all kinds , from the beams of light that delicately skim the villages to the rotations in mode7 or the particle explosions that enrich the battles. As for the sound aspect, Golden Sun surprised users with what probably still proves to be the best soundtrack ever produced for the small Nintendo handheld. A year and a half later, The Lost Age re-proposes simply splendid musical tracks, undermined by the GBA's reduced musical reproduction capabilities but which, combined with the best performance of a Gameboy Advance SP or a good pair of headphones, turn into a real own joy of hearing. A simply excellent job. Comment Expectations for Golden Sun: The Lost Age weren't the brightest. If from a technical point of view it was legitimate to expect a revised, corrected and even improved version of the original (and so it was), it was difficult to hope for a more difficult, complex and profound game than that straight line without a plot that had turned out to be the previous work of Camelot. However, the plot of The Lost Age remains simple and its characters do not enjoy psychologies bordering on paranoia, but the whole thing is more than enjoyable, above all thanks to a denser plot and greater freedom of action (which sometimes, however, borders on dispersion ). And the greatest value of The Lost Age is to amaze, to say the least, the player returning from the brevity of the prequel: the 128MB of the cartridge are justified by the vastness of the explorable environment (which is why the party takes possession of a vehicle ...), the amount of events, characters and locations, as well as the satisfying 35-40 hour duration. Furthermore, if Golden Sun has been completed, it is possible to transfer (via link cable or by typing a - very long - code) the data of the old party to then be able to exploit its full power, complete the collection of Djinn (fifty-six) and gain access to secret areas and items. In short, The Lost Age provedto a bolt from the blue, a real KA for Gameboy Advance, to be enjoyed alone or in the company, possibly, of the prequel. Camelot still has a lot to learn about plot and characterization, but from a playful point of view, it passed the exam brilliantly. Pros: Technically divine Excellent game system Long, complex and difficult at the right point Cons: Too simplistic plot and characters Too frequent random fights At times rather dispersive In 2001, a few months after the launch of the GameBoy Advance, Nintendo marketed the first real JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Game) for the newborn 32-bit portable console. Ougon no Taiyo, that was the title of a little programming prodigy that immediately made converts all over Japan. After a few months, first the American and then the European version saw the light, with the much more intriguing and understandable title of Golden Sun. What many ignored, however, was that Golden Sun was actually the first part of an initially ambitious project conceived as a trilogy, which would invade the GBA twice to end on the GameCube. And yet... Golden Sun proved, in some ways, a disappointment. Splendid game but not without flaws, especially as regards the plot and characterization of the characters, shamelessly deceived the player, convincing him that he was facing one of the most epic adventures ever experienced, and then left him in the lurch with a very short duration and an absolutely inconclusive. But Camelot, the skilful team behind the programming of Golden Sun, also demonstrated their know-how in terms of marketing: the Golden Sun project, initially, as already mentioned, planned as a trilogy, was transformed into a bilogy taking place only on the GBA, concluding with a ~double~ chapter in size (Golden Sun was contained in a 64MB cartridge, the sequel instead is compressed in ~only~ 128MB!) and quality. The Lost Age is ready to unveil itself to players who will once again venture to the fantastic lands of Weyard...", "date": "2003-05-09", "grade": null}
