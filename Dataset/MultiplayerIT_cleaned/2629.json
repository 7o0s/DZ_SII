{"name": "Vandal Hearts II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/vandal-hearts-ii.html", "text": "Let's retrace the story. Vandal Hearts II tries to emulate and improve Square's title, but even if it fails, it certainly constitutes a fun alternative by presenting itself as a good strategic game. The story of the first Vandal Hearts was digestible, but unfortunately this second chapter chooses to build a plot on the charm of that of Final Fantasy Tactics making the saga incomprehensible. Joshua is a poor farmer until he is manipulated into murdering a revered political figure. At this point Joshua, knowing he can't stay in the village, decides to flee and shortly after forms a band of mercenary thieves. These seemingly simple events will unleash a political whirlwind of intrigue and betrayal that most of you will not wish to follow. Let's check the vandals! The control of Vandal Hearts II is mainly based on the standard system of strategic games; you will have to move your characters on the map and engage in duels on various battlefields that will use the method of attack in turn. Unlike other games in the strategy genre Vandal Hearts II does not follow the traditional model. The Dual Battle System allows the computer to move its characters in battle adding an innovative element that makes the strategic side of the game more interesting. In this way, knowing where your enemies come from, you can move around to avoid their attacks by trying on your own to approach by another route and attack; the enemies are not stupid and they too will do everything to avoid being massacred by moving at the right time. Every time you make a movement you will lose your all attack and so will your enemy. Unlike Final Fantasy Tactis which is distinguished by an excellent job system as regards the characterization of the characters, in Vandal Hearts II you can instead use a good assortment of weapons. Each of them has one or more spells or abilities enclosed within it that can be learned by the character who owns it. At first the spell will be inactive but it will be enabled later after using the weapon for a few turns. Once a spell is unlocked, you can transfer it to another weapon of the same type and this will be beneficial especially if you have specialized characters all on the same weapon. A frustrating thing can be determined by the fact that to access from one battlefield to another you will have to obtain certain spells otherwise you will not be able to continue especially in critical battles for the continuation of the plot. The visuals of Vandal Hearts II feature above average workmanship. Graphically, the battlefields are somewhat derived from those of Final Fantasy Tactics, but they are much more extensive. Unfortunately the characters that jump on the game map are too poor in animation. Very poor are the portraits of the characters, all with very awkward facial expressions and a color quality of an 8-bit. The soundtrack consists of glorious and epic songs that add to the excitement of playing more than the graphics. The End Ultimately Vandal Hearts presents itself as a good strategic game as an alternative to Final Fantasy Tactis that can be appreciated by both veterans and those who approach the genre for the first time. pros: high presence of strategic elements in battle. cons: alternatively has a very accredited title like Final Fantasy Tactis. RPG what a struggle! Although the RPG genre is highly appreciated all over the world, however its tactical branch, i.e. the strategic role-playing game is going through hard times precisely because it requires a particular attitude on the part of the gamer. However, no title so far has managed to oust from the throne of strategic RPG what is a real must for fans of the genre, Final Fantasy Tactis. Vandal Hearts II tries to emulate and improve the title of Square, but even if it fails, it certainly constitutes a fun alternative presenting itself as a good strategic game.", "date": "2001-02-22", "grade": null}
