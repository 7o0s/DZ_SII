Oculus Rift with connected Touch, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR have been on the market for some time, some for less but the result is always the same for all: sales strongly below expectations, an advertising hype that ran out early and a videogame offer reduced to a minimum and rather questionable in terms of quality. For all these reasons, but not only that, it was rather complex to be able to give due coverage to the phenomenon here on Multiplayer.it given that after the initial intoxication, fewer and fewer readers have shown interest in the video games available for these peripherals. However, we know that many of you have made the big purchase and you have often pointed it out to us in the comments and for this reason we have decided to turn the spotlight on Arizona Sunshine, the debut title from the guys at Jaywalkers Interactive which only managed to quickly demolish our skepticism but even entertained us with a handful of hours of good fun. Despite the usual delays we have to undergo every time we want to dedicate ourselves to some test sessions with HTC Vive. Let's start immediately by saying that the video game produced by Vertigo Games is a shooter with a first person view that the more classic you die: we find ourselves catapulted into a traditional zombie invasion in the middle of a particularly stereotypical scenario of the American South West halfway between the prairies of Texas and the abandoned canyons of Colorado. The single player campaign, which can also be played in cooperatives with an online friend armed with everything you need, is divided into nine fairly linear levels but which allow a minimum of variety in the access points to the clashes. There is also a horde mode, which can also be tackled in multiplayer for up to four participants. Basically, however, the action is always the usual one that can be expected from the genre: we take a few steps waiting to face some small group of zombies hungry for flesh and blood, we listen to the sarcastic and irreverent jokes of the protagonist (who does so much Duke Nukem) and we prepare for the next battle. All by solving some microscopic puzzle that involves finding keys and cranks and pressing buttons to access areas of the level that are otherwise forbidden so as to prepare for loading the next map. Arizona Sunshine is a very fun shooter for Oculus and HTC. Yes, we repeat: it's fun! Stop? So told this Arizona Sunshine would seem to be yet another VR experience of a genre that already lives on a constant sense of dj vu. Instead we have to admit that from the first minutes in which you wear Vive and face the brilliant and colorful world of the game, the fun is tangible and the identification catapults us into a well-calibrated and extremely satisfying gameplay in an instant. First of all, it is the excellent recognition of hands and body that amazes, as is the tradition of the Valve device. In fact, the developer recommends facing the title standing up to manage your presence in the virtual space in the best possible way, especially in terms of coverage and interactions with the surrounding environment. In fact, it is possible to open and close the doors and trunks of dozens of cars, drawers, filing cabinets, desks, doors and activate electronic devices and buttons of various kinds. All this while leaning and ducking in an extremely realistic way. And then there is the paraphernalia. In the game we will have access to about twenty different weapons including pistols, shotguns, machine guns and grenades and we will be able to equip two at a time by relegating the positioning of discarded weapons (two more at most) and the ammunition deposit to our combat belt. Arizona Sunshine offers among other things an excellent system of management of the vents. First of all, starting from the normal difficulty level upwards, we will not have any type of pointer and we will be forced to use the sights physically present on the weapons to hit the heads and limbs of the attacking zombies. Secondly we will have to manually eject the magazine and insert the new one working with the circular touch of the Vive 3D controller and then approaching the waist as well as we will physically have to detach the fuze from the bombs before launching them performing complex pressures of the various keys of the two input systems. Perhaps this last element is the first criticism that we feel like moving to Arizona Sunshine: thanks to the movement that takes place via teleportation to minimize the senseof nausea connected to the movement of the body, the keys to press on the two controllers are many, too many during the most agitated fights. Movement, ejection of the magazine, fire, grenade, each element requires a button or some interaction with the two Valve peripherals and it is clear that the latter are not pads and the supply of keys, as well as narrow, is also often uncomfortable . Things are probably better with the Oculus Rift Touches but at the moment we can't go into the details as we haven't tried them yet. Once you get the hang of it, however, it will be quite immediate to slip into the apocalypse by properly managing interactions with the game world and above all performing sniper shots while perhaps using a car door to cover yourself, or taking advantage of the windows to strike from 'external zombies nested in a house. Everything happens spontaneously and from this point of view the VR and above all the controllers perform their task perfectly, allowing the player to aim with great precision and with a particularly cinematic style and to really feel in the middle of the action. Hit and run experiences From a technical point of view Arizona Sunshine tries to do the homework resulting clearly castrated by the usual problems inherent in virtual reality. The title offers just enough visual horizon and the scenarios, although quite varied, very colorful and explorable, are all excessively linear, lacking in detail and presenting the usual excessive aliasing. More generally, the rooms are all rather basic and the interiors are negatively striking for their poverty of furnishings. On the contrary, the zombie models are all of excellent workmanship and even if they don't shine in variety and behavior styles, they have a very believable ragdoll and physics. Hitting them on the limbs, chest or head leads to important consequences in their movement and attack capabilities and it will very often happen that you have to manage their killing tactically, perhaps by incapacitating a zombie near a door to prevent other monsters from entering quickly in the house in which you sheltered. We completely leave out the audio sector, practically absent if we exclude the standard sound effects and the protagonist's dick speech, to mention the only other limitation of Arizona Sunshine: its duration. It will hardly take you more than three hours to complete the main campaign entirely even on the normal difficulty level and maybe you will still want to redo a couple of scenarios, the funnier ones, with a higher degree of challenge. The horde mode can be added to the total calculation which, however, is the most standardized imaginable and, unless you have a couple of friends equipped with VR and obsessed with this title, you will hardly face it more than a couple of times.", "date": "2016-12-20", "grade": "8.5"}
