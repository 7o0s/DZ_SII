Since the first Halo, released in November 2001, so much water has passed under the bridge that Master Chief, a faceless and almost voiceless hero, has become an icon of the world of video games, carrying most of the fortunes of both Microsoft-branded consoles and Xbox Live. Bungie, after a long time spent with the Spartans and the Covenant, leaves, and does so by letting others tell what will happen to the Chief after the end of Halo 3, choosing to start from before the beginning of everything with this chapter. Halo: Reach chronicles the end of the planet where the Spartans, elite soldiers of the Earth troops, were trained. A symbolic planet for the UNSC, this is the name of the militias, subjected to a colossal attack by the Covenant, in search of an artifact and the secrets kept beneath the surface. An epic and sad story, whose ending is already known to millions of people, given that the whole Halo saga started from this resounding defeat, but a story that could be told in many different ways. Bungie, it seems, has chosen the best way. The Spartans of Noble Team The protagonists of Halo: Reach are seven. There are the five companions of the Noble Team, apparently in charge of rescuing the Spartans who survived the attack and the inhabitants of the planet, Noble Six, or the new member of the group, played by the player, and the planet Reach. Bungie, in this chapter, and thanks to a setting that precedes the total destruction of life on the Earth colony, brings in, for the first time, the possibility of making the player feel civilian life in the world of Halo, with desperate inhabitants waiting for some form of help during the evacuation phases, and with wild creatures that populate the planet and which, in the most mammoth specimens, attack both the soldiers and the Covenant, without distinction. The setting undoubtedly helps with beautiful landscapes, with bright colors and defined textures, with a feeling of sinister stillness which, through the ten missions of the campaign, is swept away by a conflict whose weight and weight it is very difficult not to feel. 'emotion. All team members have a name and, above all, a face. They have psychological profiles, certainly framed in well-known narrative canons, but which are told with a series of interlude scenes, all made with the game engine, in which the team, having removed the encumbrance of Master Chief, allows itself to say and to do many things with a freedom that, perhaps, was not otherwise possible. And it is here, like never before, that the specialty of being Spartan is brought to life, with our heroes going through space, jumping off cliffs and showing off abilities that give meaning to the genetic modifications that each of them has had to undergo to become part of this elite of warriors. Where the Chief's personality has been told over the years more with silences than with words, here the approach is completely different with a much more important narrative component and which gives Halo: Reach the trend of a Hollywood action movie, respecting the statements of Bungie, who said he appreciated the way of telling the stories of Infinity Ward with Call of Duty, while leaving the fundamental canons of a gameplay that is now a trademark unchanged. The powers and gameplay that is trademarked The Spartans of the Noble Team, except Noble Five - Jorge, are of the third type and have the possibility of equipping additional powers, which are gradually fed to the player with changing situations and with the nature of the maps. At first you only have the run, which is activated by pressing LB and which is consumed progressively, as anyone who has participated in the multiplayer beta knows by now. Along the countryside there are depots, in which to reload the ammunition of the UNSC weapons, treat the wounds suffered with the medikits after having exhausted the energy shields, and in which to change the equipped power - you can only carry one at a time - with those that are made available. The choice, especially in the cooperative playable in four both in system link and via Xbox Live, must be careful, given that the powers to be collected are limited and that the players must agree on which one to take, given that it is not certain that there is one of each type for each of them. Coordination in the use of powers, especially on legendary difficulty, becomes fundamental in the most extreme conditions. In total there are six: the race; the Guardian's Armor, which protects the player from attacks, while also serving as a shield for companions; the jetpack that opens the maps vertically and that has pallowed Bungie to draw some locations ~in the void~; camouflage which, in addition to making it partially invisible, drives opponents' radars crazy in multiplayer; the shield bubble that creates an area of invulnerability available to anyone who passes through it, including the Covenant; and finally, the hologram, which allows you to launch a virtual avatar in a certain area of the battlefield so as to attract enemy fire to it. Around these six powers and as always vast maps, now also developed vertically thanks to the jetpack, Bungie has gone even further in the definition of that FPS sandbox, which allows you to face each fight in a thousand ways, with the possibility of giving life to games that are always different also thanks to a further refined artificial intelligence of the Covenants, with the exception of the normal difficulty level, too compliant, in which the use of these ~power ups~ is barely scratched, given that you can launch without too many thoughts in most battles well past the middle of the campaign, especially if you have been used to Halo a ~Legendary~ for almost ten years. New vehicles are also introduced, such as the Revenant, a sort of two-seater Ghost, almost as powerful as a Wraith, and the Rocket Hog, or the jeep equipped with a rocket launcher that allows the Halo physics engine to do the usual pyrotechnic numbers. For the first time you can drive trucks, trucks and civilian cars abandoned on the surface, up to a forklift that looks so much like a quote from Shen Mue. Always with a view to putting the Spartans in even more epic situations, there are also the fights in space, which more than a small cameo, constitute a reference to LucasArts' X-Fighter, with a real set of commands, between lateral evasion moves, turbo to accelerate and homing missiles, while all around stands out what remains of the terrestrial fleet. The single player campaign To complete the Halo: Reach campaign, played almost entirely in three players at the Normal level, it took us about six hours. Which makes us estimate that around eight are necessary for those who will play it alone, especially by exploring the maps in search of a series of hidden notes that tell the story of the planet and the experiments that were carried out on it. Obviously, the advice is to play at least Heroic alone and Legendary with friends, also to make the most of maps, powers and artificial intelligence. Multiplayer, skulls and credits In Halo: Reach, as well as in the other chapters especially starting from Halo 2, longevity is entrusted to the multiplayer sector, as well as the cooperative campaign. The playability is the one already tested in the beta with, in addition, all the possible combinations given by the new powers that can be equipped. We got a taste of it with a series of matches between the journalists present at the event organized for the review, and of course we will come back to it later. We poked our nose into the nine maps and took note of the twelve modes available, each in different variations depending on the type of rules underlying each game, starting with the simple DeathMatch, which has six versions, such as SWAT, in in which the powers are deactivated and in which you can only arm yourself with an assault rifle and pistol. There is no shortage of modes such as Infection, in which a player armed with a Covenant Sword attacks the others, equipped with a shotgun, transforming them into infected and in which the winner is the one who scores the most Kills until all players have been pierced by the sword - or until at the end of time - and other crazier ones such as racing, in which you chase checkpoints that appear randomly on the maps, trying to get as many of them as possible by the end of the game, on board the vehicles. The Cinema mode is back, to make movies and images extrapolated from the game sequences, the Forge, with which to create maps by arranging any element, object, and weapon to your liking and the Shootout, built along the lines of the Gears of War Horde, which , following its debut in ODST, now offers up to five players the ability to take on the growing waves of Covenant. There are again the Skulls to activate, both primary, which directly affect the difficulty of the game, for example eliminating the use of the viewfinder or making the Covenant even more intelligent, and secondary, which instead affect accessory elements such as the effect of physics after grenade explosions. Each game played, single or multiplayer, both in System Link and on Xbox Live, leads to the achievement of a series of credits, the more numerous the higher the difficulty level and the number of skulls activated. These can beeras spent to unlock accessories and new pieces of armor, purely aesthetic variations, of course, and even extra voices to be attributed to your soldier when playing in Shootout, with the possibility of even using the Master Chief's voice. Xbox 360 goals Halo: Reach will be played for hours and hours, if you want to get all the thousand points available to fatten your Gamertag. At the end of the singles campaign, in Normale, and with only two notes collected, the loot scored only 150 points. A switch to Legendary is certainly mandatory, as are many multiplayer games. Long live Spain! Bungie worked hard on the Halo: Reach engine to mitigate the criticisms that had been leveled at the graphics of Halo 3, giving life to the most beautiful Halo ever, also thanks to the great variety of campaign settings. Between the skill of the artists, the atmospheric, particle and light effects, the polygonal detail, with the models of the humans redone, especially in the cutscenes, and the physics applied to each element, one remains repeatedly immersed in admire a unique atmosphere. The team also tried to resolve the presence of the ladders that heavily afflicted Halo 3, but which continue to exist, albeit limited by a dynamic anti-aliasing system that intervenes in the portion of the scenario closest to the player, but which is unable to manage the scenes in which the view moves further away, as in all the sections in which you fly aboard aircraft. As usual, the soundtrack helps, which is also a real hallmark of the saga, and the very rich audio sector. We don't know about the dubbing, since the version we played was in Spanish with only the subtitles of the cutscenes in Italian. On this, as on the multiplayer, we will return later, modifying the review as soon as we have a final and localized copy of the game at hand.", "date": "2010-09-12", "grade": "9.5"}
