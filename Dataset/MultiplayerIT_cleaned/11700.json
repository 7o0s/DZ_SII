We are in Farca, an imaginary place immersed in a real setting. A choice that allows the team to insert a whole series of elements not too distant from our lives but which at the same time convey an air of the future, albeit fortunately not suffocating. In the role of Isabella Song, a beautiful detective housebound under arrest for a forbidden heist, we find ourselves gradually discovering the recurring cast of characters who from case to case returns to cheer our discoveries, seasoned with supporting actors sufficiently characterized to say their within the flow of the game. Whether it's worth putting on the Sherlock Holmes hat or not, we'll tell you in our review of Song of Farca, available on Windows PC. A gameplay with a minimal essence The particular graphic composition of Song of Farca: above 3D, below 2D The idea of dividing the screen in two is nice: above a camera pointed at Isabella's living room, with 3D graphics, below 2D graphics to animate the succession of dialogues, searches, cast and progress. A simple but effective gimmick in making the idea of what happens on the screen of the protagonist, a hacker capable of doing practically everything from a terminal. We are talking about cyberpunk and fiction, a marriage that takes the poetic license to let us enter more or less every possible place, sometimes even in a surreal way. The gameplay flow is simple: after accepting a case provided by the progress of the narrative, you scan places for clues using cameras and drones, study clues and profiles, interrogate suspects and allies by calling them on a future Skype, and reach a conclusion. We have therefore condensed various phases, capable of amalgamating quite well and with good skill. Everything works, net of a few small flaws: exploring the places by hacking the cameras is fun, there are also moments in which you have to sneak through the surveillance, but in its minimal essence it is all quite guided, even banal, and we consider it impossible not to complete in a few seconds each exploration. Different speech for passwords, a bit sore point: having said that there are no safes that block progress, having or not the clue covered by a password helps to compose a more complete picture of the case, but the enigma-like designs proposed by the team are not convincing. Often you will find yourself faced with a sketch completely detached from the context in which no one provides you with a way to make sense of it or at least to understand how to read it. The writer has experience with puzzles, physical and tabletop escape rooms, puzzles galore, Song of Farca's conundrum is objectively meaningless. Unfortunately, if you are a completionist - apart from the collectibles to be found hidden in the game drawings - and you want to solve everything yourself, life will be hard and you will not be able to understand why certain design choices. Cyberpunk interrogations A video analysis sequence in Song of Farca Given its point-and-click soul, exploring in Song of Farca remains a fun playful activity, the only one that is minimally lively to tell the truth. We continue by exploring videos, clues, calling artificial intelligence to analyze data, questioning suspects and trying to get them out by showing evidence and reaching conclusions. It must be said that the dialogues are well proposed, provided you know English well, and the ~objection~ system, to remain in the language of lawyers, grants satisfaction when you take the opportunity well.Here we arrive to the second flaw: to advance and try them all, it will not be uncommon to rely on trial & error, showing a little everything you have in hand and tying the conclusions in every possible way in order to advance. Perhaps we are not very smart, but the most satisfactory conclusion, the one capable of giving the idea of having made the right choice, is not always clear. However, the dialogues are confirmed to be interesting and the side characters well characterized, capable of transmitting traits and uniqueness of thought and personality. The cases are not always uniform in terms of themes and the crossroads of potential choice are able to change the story of the game , always saving the progress. However, there is one piece of advice that we would like to give you: since the cases are finished in a maximum of one hour and their driving force is not enormous, do not do them in succession otherwise you risk lowering and watering down the narrative. The title will last you no more than 10 hours if you stop to find every collectible and try to solve every password, but we think that in 7-8 hours you will have brought it niceterm complaint. In any case, Song of Farca mixes political, social and sexual themes in an evergreen cyberpunk that doesn't know anything new, but at least is told with the right rhythm.", "date": "2021-08-20", "grade": "7.2"}
