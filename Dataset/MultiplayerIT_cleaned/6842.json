{"name": "Palle al balzo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/138809-nba-2k15-palle-al-balzo.html", "text": "For many years now, NBA 2K, the popular Visual Concepts sports saga produced by 2K Sports, has risen to the status of the best electronic basketball simulation. On the other hand, it is enough to have played one of the titles that make up the series at least once, especially the last ones, to realize that this fame is deserved, and has really been conquered on the field. NBA 2K15, we say it immediately, demonstrates once again the great passion of the developers for this sport, which is the engine that drives them to try to improve the series year after year. And even in this, while not revolutionizing their creature compared to the past edition, with a series of ad hoc tweaks they still managed to give the public an even more complete edition than the one that preceded it. Filings of the defects of 2014, attention to detail and lots of content, these are in fact the salient features on which the development team has worked the most. Let's see with what results. Simulated basketball has never been more realistic than in NBA 2K15 Curiosity In addition to the various NBA teams, both current and classic, NBA 2K15 offers the Turkish Airlines Euroleague teams with some new clubs such as Crvena Zvezda Telekom Belgrade, Brose Baskets Bamberg, Budivelnik Kiev and Galatasaray Liv Hospital Istanbul, which in fact join the classic Real Madrid, Barcelona or our Armani Milano and Montepaschi Siena. All the teams have the old rosters, but they can be updated with the latest market movements thanks to a free update available via the internet. 49GB of content Let's start with the game modes, which as per tradition for the series are many and rich in content. In short, the user is spoiled for choice, and after having created his own virtual alter ego, as always, he will have no trouble finding the one that best suits his tastes. Almost all the modalities, among other things, being able to rest on the solid structures of the previous editions, do not present epochal changes, but a series of still interesting improvements. This is the case of My Team, a sort of Ultimate Basketball Team in which you can take advantage of the special credits to build a team made up of current players and legends from scratch, and then gradually accumulate points to buy new packages containing other champions, upgrades , and more. Here, on the basis of the 2014 edition, there is an absolute novelty of the possibility of buying or selling player cards in real time in a special auction house, and of using real money to buy additional envelopes. Proceeding with the description of the innovations concerning the most important modes of NBA 2K15, we obviously have My Player/My Career, once again the beating heart of the production, which this year too is extended to the network in order to allow users to enjoy , among other things, My Park. This multiplayer mode dedicated to ~street~ basketball is enriched with the opportunity for users to join one of three new communities, namely Old Town Flyers, Rivet City Rough Riders or Sunset Beach Ballers (each affiliation guarantees a series of special characteristics related to defense, speed or precision), to form a team and go and challenge other human players in rival playgrounds. Alternatively, it is possible to play five-on-five games in five-minute quarters inside the Jordan Rec Center with NBA rules, where the loser is eliminated, and only those who manage to stay on the field until the last challenge win. Thanks to a new reputation system, power ups and gadgets can be unlocked along with the fame acquired on the pitches. Unfortunately, due to server problems, we had a lot of difficulty testing the game on the net, and between a freeze and the often inability to connect, we had to raise the white flag. In any case, staying on topic but in offline single mode, the career is usually characterized by a strong narrative structure that gives ample prominence to what happens both on and off the field, where all those surrounding elements are valued which however contribute to lowering more the gamer in the role of a new promise of the NBA. Promise that this year, among other things, he won't start from the draft, but must initially settle for ten-day contracts with various teams, in the hope of convincing one of them with good performances to be signed permanently. Then there is the other game session that is very popular with the public, namely My GM. As usual, in this mode the gamer is called upon to play the role of a General Manager, managing a team both from an administrative and technical point of view. We therefore need to organiseorganize the coaching staff and that of talent scouts, but also the weekly rhythm of training, renewals, transfers and management of the starting quintet, even during the match if desired. The novelty of this year consists of a system of ~conversations~ which expands the role of the gamer and increases his responsibilities even outside the field, placing him even more in his role. Together with the financial and technical side, in fact, it becomes necessary to monitor the morale of one's athletes, make one's presence felt in the media, choose carefully the answers to give, and pay more attention to human relationships, voices and the pressures and expectations that they come from the property or from the locker room. Users will certainly be pleased to see that virtual currency no longer plays such a decisive role in the development of a manager's career. The general manager, in fact, can no longer be improved to the maximum already at the beginning of the first season, and this thanks to the new system which provides for the acquisition of experience points which can then level up and obtain a new ability for the executive with the natural progression of his career. The last mode we talk about, but by no means the least, is the brand new game option called My League. In this session conceptually similar to the old Association, users can design a real ~world of its own~, i.e. develop a franchise that lasts a single season or up to eighty years, freely intervening on the various parameters that regulate both the gameplay than the organization of tournaments, from the salary cap to the number of races per season, to the teams to use. The mode is only present in next-gen versions and on PC. Playstation 4 trophies NBA 2K15 offers players 51 trophies distributed in the various game modes. There are simple ones, like the bronze that you unlock in My General Manager mode by drafting a promise with an 88 rating or higher, and more difficult ones, like those that plan to be named an All-Star in the NBA in My Career, or to score a game-winning field goal when time runs out or from beyond half court. Up to platinum, which is achieved by unlocking all the others. (Re)touches of class Closed the large parenthesis dedicated to the modalities, let's finally analyze the gameplay itself. Let's start by saying that, except for some aspects that we will analyze in detail in the next few lines, the title rests in terms of gameplay on the solid foundations of the previous chapters. Therefore at first glance, as with other sports titles, the average user may not immediately recognize or appreciate the news, as the hardcore gamer will in all likelihood do. Nonetheless, NBA 2K15 is a bit more complicated than previous games, and for this reason the learning curve will be steeper even for those familiar with the series. The developers' work this year has focused a lot on the defensive and attacking phases, with a particular eye not only on a certain logic on the part of the virtual players in applying their team's schemes, but also on physical contacts. From this point of view, the work is quite good, and the feeling, right from the first games, is that the game takes into account a whole series of more sophisticated parameters in the ~management~ of the various game situations. But it's not just the renewed physics that make every contact, ball movement, move or touch on the parquet realistic. In fact, a series of new connection and completion animations act in combination, especially those related to dribbling, crossovers, rotations and sudden movements, contacts under the basket and rebounds, which are really very fluid and natural, and a more advanced artificial intelligence than in the past. These elements, in fact, make the defensive phase more varied and effective once properly mastered, but at the same time difficult, since in order to steal the ball or block without committing a foul, you need to take more account of every single gesture of the opponent, try to understand where he will go to dribble, choosing the right intervention time, otherwise he will be inexorably jumped like a skittle. In this sense, the spatial awareness of virtual basketball players also helps, so it is difficult to see them glued to each other as sometimes happened in the old editions. Similarly, when attacking, the artificial intelligence responds best to the actions in progress thanks to the ability to ~automatically~ read the action by the teammates managed by the CPU, and to the strategies set or recalled by the user. Can hereso it happens in the same action that the ball carrier attracts the attention of the defense to himself, for example to serve a more free teammate or to open useful spaces for the pivot wing for an insertion, or, alternatively, that he exploits a cut on his block to clear the latter's area, to go to the basket or to attempt a running conclusion or a stop and shoot. By the way, an important change of this edition is related to a new shooting system. Upon release, a blue bar inside the one at the player's feet signals the best time to shoot, and with the right timing the chances of a field goal become high. The system minimizes the percentage of randomness, given that every time it calculates a substantial series of parameters, such as the player's position on the field, his body posture, all his general statistics, even those contingent on the match, and the position of its marker. The precision of pressing the appropriate key and the ~optimal~ union of the above parameters, are required to be successful. In a nutshell, it is more comfortable to shoot, and the basket is no longer linked to luck or bad luck, but to various factors, including the ability of the basketball player and that of the user in timing the ~shot~. For the rest, learning to read the defense, the attack and the game situations in general, not forcing too much but knowing how to wait for the right moment to attempt the lunge or play, remain the foundations for better facing matches in the NBA 2K15. This, at least, until it happens to be faced with or having to manage the so-called crazy variable. Who in basketball, as in any self-respecting team sport, is the champion. For the more experienced player, or for the CPU, having people of the caliber of LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, or Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Kobe Bryant or Serge Ibaka in their ranks, can be a significant advantage. I count. Provided of course that you know how to exploit the characteristics at the service of the team. In this sense it must be said that as per tradition Visual Concepts has worked well in reproducing in a credible way the essence of their way of thinking and acting, and the statistics of each individual athlete, which reflect their real counterpart under different points of sight. Also visual, given that the graphics have done an excellent job by making good use of the potential of the PlayStation 4 hardware. The polygonal models of the players border on photorealism as per the textbook, and each of the champions moves exactly as in reality. Sweat, beard, tattoos, everything is rendered with a truly obsessive attention to detail and we must admit that at times, during our test, we found ourselves almost hypnotized in front of the beauty of the NBA 2K15 graphics, especially in replays or in sudden shot during the race. In the same way, the public has also been made less homogeneous and in blocks that are all the same, resulting in more diversification and reactivity to what happens on the parquet. Compared to last year, however, we noticed a different use of lights, which made the skin of the players less ~glossy~, and the colors less bright in some arenas. To highlight then the presence of an interesting new feature that allows anyone who wants to take advantage of the PlayStation Camera to perform an accurate scan of their face, to then reproduce it faithfully in a 3D version within the game. It still needs some tweaking, but we thought it was a nice addition. To complete the picture of a very rich offer, there is a respectable audio sector. Starting from the soundtrack, which this year made use of the collaboration of Pharrell Williams, who to accompany the gamers' performances thought of a mix of hip-hop, rock and R&B, choosing artists of the caliber of Afrika Bambaataa, A Tribe Called Quest, Major Lazer, Depeche Mode, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott, as well as some of his songs of course. The ~arena~ audio effects are also excellent, which help to give the player the sensation, even auditory, of being in front of a real basketball game, the commentary in American language and the jokes during the pre-match interludes between Ernie Johnson and Shaquille O'Neil.", "date": "2014-10-13", "grade": "8.7"}
