However, the period is also unfavorable for titles that have tried to give new life to the genre (see DJ Hero), a fact that demonstrates even more clearly the need for a pause for reflection in this area. Also on iOS the various Guitar Hero and Rock Band have maintained their classic setting, replacing only the ~strum~ with the tap on the screen; in Touch Tap Tunes, however, colors and notes merge to give life to a fun and original audio-video mix. Musical spots Like any self-respecting Rhythm Game, even in Touch Tap Tunes you have from the beginning the possibility of trying to play the standard songs included in the supplied tracklist; as we will see, however, this option, although obvious, turns out to be the least fun. In fact, the songs present in the initial database are particularly few and of questionable quality: in fact, they range from anonymous pop pieces to a rather disturbing cover of Beethoven's Per Elise, a frightening chronological leap absolutely not up to par. However, the real explosive potential of this title is given by its main feature, namely the ability to create virtuosity with your fingertips using your iTunes library. This feature, which is also a trademark of Frets on Fire on PC for example, basically allows you to have an infinite game and exactly connected to personal musical tastes. The forbidden dream of all console owners, the personalized tracklist in a music game becomes reality on iOS terminals thanks to the simplicity of the management software, which limits interactivity to the simple pressing of a series of colored spots in time. More specifically, the aim of the game is to hit the sequence of circles that appear on the screen when their interior is completely filled, turning black; if the pressure is timed correctly, the circle explodes in a pastel colored spot, giving match points. Holding your iPhone or iPod Touch with both hands will therefore be the thumbs the undisputed protagonists of the action; of course, to unlock the various multipliers it will be necessary to never miss the time of the taps, even if a certain margin of error is tolerated (visually, the greater the precision, the greater the expansion area of the stain). To use the songs saved in your favorite Apple device, just select the Edit button from the Touch Tap Tunes main menu, which will very easily start a kind of recording studio through which you can finally set the song, assigning the various combinations. The result thus obtained can be saved locally or sent to the online database, which can be downloaded by other users. The store is naturally also available for free downloads, which however suffer from a heavy (but understandable) limitation: in fact, to be usable you need to own the basic song, the software limiting itself to downloading only the combinations for the tap. During the test, in fact, many songs appeared in downloadable format but, when selecting them, an error prevented the operation from being completed; then it was enough to synchronize with iTunes some of the songs present to play the respective combinations of spots peacefully. In addition to the ability to download and send TABs (i.e. ~scores~ for songs), the title allows online score comparison and sharing; Finally, the modifiable game skins and the now canonical compatibility with Game Center should be noted.
