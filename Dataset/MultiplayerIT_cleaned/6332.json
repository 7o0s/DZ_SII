In fact, Paradox Interactive's plan was to divide the franchise into two strands, with the Arrowhead team engaged in giving life to the campaign of the second chapter of the series, and Paradox North with the task of creating a competitive multiplayer variant, along the lines of MOBAs . On paper, everything might seem excellent: the captivating graphic style, the funny little wizards, an enormous number of spells and combos to which is added a team-based structure that rests on a valid free to play model. The ingredients for an excellent title are all there, but as recent history has taught us above all, it is the execution that makes the difference between a worthy title and a forgettable one. In addition, the competition in this area is tighter than ever with DOTA2 and League of Legends dominating unchallenged, Smite in continuous expansion and Heroes of the Storm almost ready to start. Being able to compete with the giants is never easy, but in its arc Magicka: Wizard Wars keeps the light-hearted vein intact and a more complex than average gameplay that will surely win the hearts of fans ... even if we are not sure that focusing on the sentimentality is enough. Magicka: Wizard Wars brings competitive teamfights to the Paradox franchise Battle mages If you have already had the opportunity to play a title in the series, you will immediately be at ease with Wizard Wars. Marrying the philosophy of only competitive titles and distancing itself diametrically from the solid narrative component that characterized the first Magicka, in this case without too many preambles we immediately find ourselves in the center of the arena to test the solidity of the combat system. For those on an empty stomach there is a full-bodied tutorial that introduces the basics of both game mechanics and controls, the latter as per tradition simple and intuitive to understand but difficult to master effectively. In this sense, the veterans of the genre will benefit: remaining strongly anchored to the gameplay of the series, even the most savvy will immediately find themselves having to deal with a decidedly above average number of keys and with a game rhythm marked by the preparation time of each magic. Each attack must be prepared before being executed, but unlike the previous title we have only three elements available to combine instead of five, consequently increasing the pace and spectacularity of the clashes. A factor that should not be underestimated in this sense is the presence of friendly fire that is always active and the possibility of ~crossing the streams~ to create new and very powerful spells. It is precisely the great ductility of our wizard's magic that gives depth and depth to the gameplay by dramatically expanding the use of each individual skill compared to what we are used to seeing in the most famous MOBAs. The interaction has far more complex implications than it might appear at a single glance. For example, if one of your companions launches a bolt of lightning on the enemy team, you make it rain to further expand its destructive range; in the same way, if you are under attack, you will have a vast collection of spells at your disposal with which to block your opponents and protect your companions, for example by making a shower of water fall on them to limit the damage of an opposing fire spell. The clashes are therefore heavily focused on teamwork, tactics and the right timing of execution much more than on the frenetic and frenzied attack. Attacking head-on is by far the least desirable strategy and for this reason Wizard Wars is best played in the company of friends using a headset and microphone. Structural problems The difference in skill between a new player and an experienced one therefore becomes palpable, underlining once again how easy the titles related to Magicka are to approach, but extremely complex and profound as it is about mastering them to perfection. This could discourage most, especially in view of a very slow character growth system which in this sense rewards those who decide to put their hands on their wallets. However, since these are experience point boost purchases, fortunately everything does not affect in-game performance with the players still called to show off their skills to get the better of their opponents. Keys can be purchased to unlock random daily rewards, but if you play consistently Wizard Wars canIt can be enjoyed entirely as a true free to play title. If the economic model has proven to be sustainable, it is the online infrastructure that has surprisingly made a hole in the water, compromising much of the playful experience of the Paradox North title. As in any MOBA, the best way to deepen its mechanics and progress faster is certainly that of online matches which, however, suffer a lot in the player aggregation phase. The player's level is determined by the most important statistics such as the number of kills made, the points obtained in each game and the total game time, only to be completely ignored in the matchmaking phase. The result is often very unbalanced teams where neophytes and veterans are equally at the expense, both from a playful and entertainment point of view. Finding yourself against very strong opponents during the first few games is certainly a traumatic thing that can only discourage players from continuing their path, as well as having a game thrown away even before starting because the system has placed a player in our team it makes no sense at first. This situation is certainly the daughter of the still limited community of the title, but a similar system can really undermine the gaming experience by rowing in the opposite direction to the excellent, satisfying and fun gameplay. Furthermore, a system of notification to developers for incorrect behavior and a penalty for disconnections is completely missing, all too frequent given the unhappy combinations mentioned above. In addition to the classic team PvP mode, there are one-on-one duels, a mode with control points to conquer and a third type in which you face creatures controlled by artificial intelligence to be killed quickly to break down the enemy defenses and destroy their base . Not a lot of variety therefore, which certainly does not help to patch up the full-blown matchmaking problems.", "date": "2015-05-16", "grade": "7.3"}
