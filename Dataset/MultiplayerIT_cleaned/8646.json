It is always difficult to deal with a recent technical terminology that does not admit errors because it plays with memories and nostalgia, two fundamental elements for any video game enthusiast of the past. Just one step and you make the mistake of judging a product for what it isn't, or criticizing it for flaws that are actually alien to its current re-design philosophy. One ventures into a glass floor when talking about Silent Hill HD Collection, a remastered high definition proposition of the second and third chapter of the psycho-horror saga par excellence, developed for the occasion by Hijinx Studios (Frogger Terurns, Vandal Hearts: Flames of Judgment). Widely appreciated exponents of the last generation therefore return to have their say with new, eligible fans of today, tired of a monopoly of videogame genres that leaves no room for dirty, dark and scary niches where you can experience the deepest of fears, the mental one. Toluca, Brookhaven and many historic places are back, but something seems to have changed. Doubly up the hill Who remembers James Sunderland, charismatic and depressed man looking for his wife with only his last letter in hand? Konami welcomes you to the distressing multiverse of Silent Hill 2 by immediately offering the possibility of choosing whether to play the main story, Letters from Silent Heaven, or the spin-off focused on Maria, Born from a Wish, and the events that see her involved before and after meeting James. But if it is always a pleasure to find yourself displaced in front of the unhealthy filth of the proposed environments, whether they are bathrooms colored with rust and blood or buildings with decaying furniture, it is even more interesting to open your ears to the brand new dubbing made for the occasion. Historical fans will be able to choose whether to play this second episode with the original voices of the time, but the work done to give quality to the new applied acoustic acting is undeniable, with tones and spasms closer to today's films than they were at the time. Engaging with a watchful eye, one cannot fail to notice a slight phase shift of the new dubbing compared to the lip movement in the interlude scenes, but evaluating how sometimes even today's double or triple A productions present defects in synchronization and audio leveling in the mixings, one cannot certainly for this to punish a qualitatively superior product to the old-gen counterpart. A tear falls between words and memories noting how inspired and passionate the Japanese developers of those times were, with settings and gameplay designed to remain fun even over time. Unforgettable are those moments of Silent Hill 3 spent with Heather inside the Lakeside amusement park, where the mental and artistic perversion of Team Silent combined with the skilful partial lighting and points of absolute darkness still today throw into despair like little else. Alessa, Claudia, the perverse carousel of meat and all the abominable monsters return to welcome players to the cult of Silent Hill and the dark machinations behind which lies an adult plot and not for the faint of heart. The revived universe of iron, disease and oppression of the third episode in this Collection strongly underlines the singular way in which Silent Hill 3 manages, yesterday as today, to consume the player's mind and heart, with that omnipresent state of tension chasing even in apparently safe points, praying that the torch never illuminates the enemy who in the background is emitting gasps and screams of distant dimensions of death. Once again a note on the audio: unlike the second, for the third chapter of Silent Hill Konami does not allow players to choose the old dubbing or enjoy the new one, as the only present is the one redone for the occasion, which however it is of good quality. Playstation 3 trophies The collection divides its list of trophies between the chapters, respectively 28 in Silent Hill 2 and 22 in Silent Hill 3. The trophies of the second episode focus on the various unlockable endings, on the choices to kill or not certain enemies and on the amount of monsters which you will overcome along the various playthroughs. The third episode puts emphasis on the time it takes to beat some opponents, the endings that will end and on specific special weapons scattered around the city. Darkness in high definition The fate of HD remastering is sometimes obvious, forced a priori to deal with the technical load it carries with it. A double job therefore, which places Silent Hill HD Collection in front of its original counterparts that compose itgono, with the aim of determining if the work done by Hijinx Studios in the phase of cleaning up and rejuvenating the textures, animations and everything that engages the eye leads to a pleasant result in the end. The answer is hopelessly affirmative, although a couple of factors preclude technical analysis from being without demerits. The expert eye of those who have played both chapters at the time cannot fail to rejoice in the face of the technical update of some parts, with sections enriched by sparkling new textures and embellished with cleaner lighting that makes exploring environments more satisfying dark, especially in Silent Hill 3, where the work done leads the player to almost doubt if this or that shader was ever so pleasant to view. A sort of embellishment therefore, where the upscaling of the definition can be viewed immediately on models, objects and background parts, now much more enjoyable and defined than the counterpart. Everything would seem perfect, except that the clearing and general cleaning inevitably lead to moments in which the oppression of the fog in the external environments, particularly visible on Silent Hill 2, is lower than it was in the originals of the last generation, particularly over long distances, where the fear of the unknown is now replaced by sharply defined far edges that take away some of the thrill. The defect that really amazes is how, especially in Silent Hill 3, the framerate is so dancer in some moments. The least to expect from a remastering on much more powerful consoles than the previous ones is certainly a consistently high number of frames, which therefore does not weigh down the game but makes it fluid and enjoyable. Unfortunately Heather's adventure, much more than that of James who is affected much less, is marred by some moments (fortunately few) in which the game frames drop incredibly, making it very heavy to move, fight and explore, with annexed problems related to audio and sound effects, not as clean as in the rest of the adventure, thus offering a game system that is difficult to manage in these situations. Programming defects without a doubt, fortunately occasional, but which certainly leave doubts as to why the game was not completely cleaned up, thus making it a definitive experience for old and new fans. The basic audio, excluding the moments described above, is as always incredible; even after years, Yamaoka's melodies are amazing as are all the sound engineering that accompanies it, with background noises that, now in Dolby 5.1, worthily compose two of the most beautiful horror adventures ever.", "date": "2012-03-26", "grade": "8.0"}
