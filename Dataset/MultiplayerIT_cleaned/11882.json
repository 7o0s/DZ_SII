{"name": "Dead and Furious - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-and-furious-recensione.html", "text": "Namco has already demonstrated, with Point Blank, that it is possible to transport the old concept of light gun shooters directly into the Nintendo DS, replacing the gun control with the touch screen one. The idea may not sound too exciting, but in practice it works, and in the end it is also quite fun, although not at the level of the original ~manner~, and it was therefore only a matter of time before one of the applications appeared on the market more successful than the shoot at the screen dynamic: House of the Dead. In truth, this has not yet been seen, but Eidos has decided to intervene in place of Sega, filling the gap with this Dead and Furious, which takes practically everything from the arcade with gun and living dead: setting, setting and, obviously , the living dead themselves. The story sees the inmate Rob Steiner, inside the Ashdown Hole penitentiary, suddenly freed from his imprisonment: the doors mysteriously open in the middle of the night, while absolute silence seems to reign in the surroundings. Just long enough to pick up a revolver strangely left unattended (and, even more strangely, equipped with infinite magazines), and our protagonist finds himself facing an invasion of zombies and various undead creatures, who attack him in furious waves. Practically nothing else is explained, and frankly there is no need: when it comes to zombies we know that bullets easily take the place of words, especially if the protagonist and the setting have not been developed at all , so let's arm ourselves with a stylus and see what Dead and Furious is all about. Dead hand The setting of the game corresponds exactly to that of House of the Dead: it is a question of going through scenarios created in 3D and viewed in subjective shooting at everything that moves on the screen. The game action takes place ~on track~, this means that we do not have the possibility to move freely in space, but we are forced to watch while the view moves automatically within the scenarios, in some cases being able to choose the path to follow, when we find ourselves at crossroads. All we have to do is essentially touch the screen: instead of shooting with the good old light gun, in this game we press the stylus on the touch screen, thus reproducing the shots. The only interaction with the world around us takes place through firearms, so apart from hitting enemies we will find ourselves shooting locks to open doors, shooting crates and containers to collect power ups and select the path to follow. obviously by shooting on the warning signs. The only elements that create diversions in the basic action, inserting a minimum of strategy, are the loading of the weapon and the possibility of changing it. The rounds in the magazine are in fact limited, at the end we have to reload: to do this it is necessary to drag an icon representing the new magazine above that of the old magazine. By doing so, of course, precious seconds are lost, in which the zombies approach the screen inexorably. This is essentially the main dynamic that makes up the gameplay of the game: hit enemies quickly and try to gain the right time to reload the weapon while avoiding excessive damage. To tell the truth, the CPU plays quite dirty, since the action is structured in such a way that, in different situations, it is practically impossible not to suffer damage, forcibly increasing the difficulty and effectively eliminating the strategic element. Continuing in the game it is possible to collect new weapons, from the (in this case) limited ammunition. They can be selected by pressing the corresponding direction on the digital cross, and their power is obviously better than the basic gun. The ammunition for these weapons is collected by shooting (obviously) at the boxes scattered around the scenario, inside which it is also possible to find energy and power ups capable of improving the characteristics of all the various weapons. There is also a LAN multiplayer mode, which allows you to play the game together with a partner, but the structure changes little, and curiously both players will find themselves seeing practically the same thing on the screen, as if both were impersonating the same character at the same time. Horror in three dimensions The graphic design of Dead and Furious is extremely spartan: despite the predefined itineraries, which abundantly lighten the computational graphic calculation, the developers have not managed to create good-level settings and characters. Therethey are more convincing moments, and on closer inspection certain scenarios manage to recreate a distressing climate at the right level, but the textures used have an extremely low resolution, and if we also consider the game's tendency to frame the characters in the foreground, we find ourselves most of the time to closely observe some really ugly polygons: from a stylistic point of view one thinks that the graphics sector of Dead and Furious is a sort of homage to the gigantic pixel, and the nostalgics of the era of the first productions characterized by modern graphics in 3D they might almost find it fascinating. Nowadays, the Nintendo DS has shown that it can do much more than what has been inserted into this cartridge, and the choice to set the whole game on pre-established tracks does not in any way justify such a neglect at the graphic level. Of course, Dead and Furious plays on many other factors, first of all the frenetic action and the stress of ~sudden appearance~, but the technical realization makes it at times more ridiculous than engaging and scary. House of the Dead, at the time, knew how to compensate for narrative shortcomings with an impactful atmosphere, given by a good use of graphic resources. The same thing cannot be said of this Dead and Furious, which fails to remedy the lack of identification given by the flatness of characters, plot and settings with a graphic sector that is little more than sketchy. The audio sector, on the other hand, plays its part discreetly, with minimally invasive music that manages to create the right climate, together with good environmental audio effects. Comment Dead and Furious looks like a B-series production which in turn refers to second-rate productions. If desired, this game finds its redemption in its purely trashy essence, which can make it attractive to fans of this genre, or to those who in any case manage to take it with due irony. The main problem, however, even considering the limited technical sector, and the inability of the product to create the slightest disturbing and engaging atmosphere, is that the gameplay itself is lacking in many respects. The reduction of light gun gameplay (itself rather limited) to furious point and click on the touch screen works up to a point, cutting out some of the fundamental elements that made shooters of this ilk successful : above all the identification given by the use of a weapon and the particular form of interaction with the screen. Clicking on the screen to hit enemies, and dragging an icon to reload your weapon is far from deep and lasting fun. For short light-hearted games Dead and Furious can work well, but even in this limited case it is unlikely to be a first choice. Pros Fun in small doses Horror always has a special charm Cons Very poor technical sector Short and with little incentive to be replayed Simplistic and repetitive gameplay", "date": "2007-10-29", "grade": null}
