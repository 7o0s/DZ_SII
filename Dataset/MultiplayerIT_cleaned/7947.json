{"name": "Un Gears of War europeo!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/116194-gears-of-war-judgment-un-gears-of-war-europeo.html", "text": "Sera is one of the most famous planets of this console generation, theatre, as it was, of the Gears of War trilogy, one of the strongest Xbox 360 exclusives and capable of launching Cliff Bleszinsky into the Olympus of the most important game designers. After three chapters and in the need to give the Microsoft console an exclusive while waiting for the end-of-year news, after Cliffy B has left the parent company, here Epic strengthens the collaboration with the Polish developers People Can Fly who had already given birth to the spectacular Bulletstorm, FPS always moved by the Unreal Engine. Gears of War: Judgment was born with the aim of making the gameplay of Gears more frenetic, difficult and replayable, perhaps adding that arcade and cinematic feel of the previous People Can Fly game. At the end of the campaign, there is no doubt that some of the objectives have been achieved, but it is equally true that someone has been missed, leaving the game halfway between the old and the new. A different prequel The narrative setting of GOW has always been classic with tight events, told in a rather linear way and with the personalities of the protagonists entrusted to the exchanges that managed to make their way through the thousands of dismemberments and shootings. Epicness, however, was never in question. People Can Fly for Gears of War: Judgment imagines the city of Halvo Bay, seaside town home to the academy that forges an Elite group of soldiers, the Onyx, and theater of the development of the emulsion-based weapons of war: Judgment, for the first time in the series, it is set entirely in this location. Baird and Cole are two kids, with the latter having just stopped enjoying the star life of Trashball, or Epic's version of American football, and both are part of the Kilo Squad, along with two new entries for the series, namely Sofia , cadet of the Onyx guards, and Paduk, a soldier who survived the last terrestrial civil war that led to the union of the fighting armies under the aegis of the COG. We are thirty days after the Emergency day, the invasion of the locusts, and Halvo Bay is devastated by the armies led by Karn, an elite that seems unstoppable. Desperate, our heroes decide to resort to a weapon still in the prototype stage, designed by the same inventor of the hammer of dawn, and they do so in contravention of COG orders, submitting themselves to the judgment of a ruthless court-martial. Gears of War: Judgment is the story of this summary trial, told through the depositions of the four protagonists that lead the player towards the somewhat obvious epilogue that does not fit well with one of the central events of the plot itself. From start to finish, however, between the excellent technical realization and the novelties to the gameplay that we will talk about shortly, you certainly have fun for the whole seven hours (approximately) of the campaign, if played at a normal level, which then leads to unlock another additional hour with Aftermath, a parallel story, which takes up the mechanics of Gears of War 3, narrating contemporary events in the last chapter of the trilogy. The sepia and dark tones of GOW bend to the brilliance of the sets so loved by the People Can Fly with bewitching sunsets and pastel colors full of details. However, compared to the other chapters, there is a lack of locations that leave their mark through the chapters of the game, not balanced by the spectacularity that characterized Bulletstorm. In short, the level design of Gears of War: Judgment is not of the same level to which Epic has accustomed us for its mechanics and this lack is not completely rebalanced by the caciarona adrenaline that the team had put on the track in its previous title. The fact remains that GOW always works and that the code is disarmingly clean. Novelty? Gears of War: Judgment takes the gameplay of GOW and wakes it up, shakes it up and makes it go at a faster pace, placing hordes of enemies, one after another, in front of the necessarily entertaining player. The dynamic spawn system, which changes the locusts you face in a level (if you die or if you replay it), depending on the player's tactics, works when needed, leaving a sense of uncertainty in those who play, especially if decides to tackle at least the third of the four difficulty levels available (which we highly recommend). People Can Fly takes the level up system of Gears of War 3, transforming it into a star system, three for each level section, ranging from bronze to platinum, depending on the difficulty, and which accumulate by doing executions, not getting killed and above all, by activating the missions called Declassify, the most successful novelty of the game. In each level section, a red skull is found which, ifobserved, leads the witness on duty to tell a secret and tougher version of how the events that are being played out unfolded, increasing the evaluation that is achieved at the end of the same. It's not just about more difficult enemies, but about shortage of ammunition, energy that doesn't recharge or extreme climatic conditions that limit visibility and safety in movements, up to situations where you have to pass a stage within a time limit that , at higher difficulty levels than the basic one, becomes asphyxiating, greatly increasing the degree of challenge and satisfaction. Hence the great replayability of Gears of War: Judgment that pushes you to look for friends and strategy to get up to the last star so as to unlock the dozens of objects with which to customize your character in multiplayer. In addition to what is written, only two weapons can be carried at a time, the characters move faster and the ammunition left by the locust bodies is collected simply by passing over them, making everything even more frenetic. In short, People Can Fly, on balance, has introduced a good number of novelties, only that the feeling is that there hasn't deviated that much from the central structure of the classic gameplay of the series, arriving at a good result, but creating a title that will hardly be able to change the mind of those who have already received what they expected from GOW. Those who, on the other hand, appreciate the series and still want action, made excellently, will find something for their teeth here. Xbox 360 goals Gears of War: Judgment is not a very generous game in terms of objectives, considering that finishing the campaign, without getting lost in looking for all the insignia, at a normal level leads to getting less than 200 points. To get to a thousand, the road is long and winding and passes through many hours spent in multiplayer, even in the new modes, as well as, of course, finishing the campaign at all levels of difficulty. In short, the hunters of the 1000 points know that they will have to work hard, but GOW fans have been used to it for a while ... There is also multiplayer Like every chapter in the saga, Gears of War: Judgment brings with it a nice load of multiplayer, in addition to the usual possibility of playing the entire campaign in four players via Xbox Live. Several innovations introduced, some very interesting, which, however, record the premature departure of Horde and Beast, among the best things of the last GOW, in favor of OverRun and Survival. The first (described at length in the article that you can read at this address) confronts two teams of five COGs and Locusts, in an attempt, respectively, to defend and destroy three objectives on a map that gradually opens up as the Locusts manage to conquer the land outposts. The beauty is that, unlike the single player, each of the COG characters has access to a set of skills, collected in a class between doctor (who heals his companions), engineer (who repairs defenses and turrets), soldier ( who can distribute ammo crates for everyone) and scouts (who can climb certain areas of the levels and can signal the presence of enemies with appropriate grenades/radars). For their part, the Locusts have the same skills as in the campaign and, by accumulating points like in Beast, they become bigger and more devastating. A nice mix of action and strategy even if you realize that, in the long run, it is almost impossible to resist the advance of the locusts, in the two timed rounds, and that the winner is the team which, in the guise of the COG, manages to resist the advance of the team playing the monsters for longer. Survival takes up the same distinction in classes for the COGs who have to face 10 waves of enemies moved by the CPU, in what might seem like an evolution of the Horde, but which leaves the strategy of version 2.0 that asked to buy defenses and weapons by the wayside more powerful to redistribute to fellow players. Another novelty to report is the introduction of free-for-all, in which up to 10 COGs can face each other with no holds barred in the most classic of individual deathmatches. It all works, but the classic modes remain on another planet. Beautiful on Evening Gears of War: Judgment was born, in part, within the walls of Epic and it shows. People Can Fly evidently had access to the latest evolution of the Unreal Engine (we're talking about the one capable of running on Xbox 360, obviously), creating a colorful title, with defined textures and full of details, in some ways even superior to Gears of War 3. The Polish team also takes the trouble to push even more on the atmospheric effects and volumetric mists and fumes, creating situations in which one cannot see close to one's nose and uncertainty reigns supreme. Yesmore could have been done, especially by remembering certain epic sequences of Bulletstorm (with immense objects and mass destruction), but here the focus was on the number of enemies and on the desire not to make Gears lovers feel too disoriented. The result is good, but not unforgettable, above all due to the lack of that couple of extra locations that would have made one cry for a miracle, leaving an indelible mark. The frame rate is solid and the gaming experience flawless, leaving the feeling that it will not be the last collaboration between Epic and this talented European development team. In terms of sound commentary and audio effects, we move on the typical levels of the saga with an excellent production, always up to the different situations. We don't know much about the dubbing, which should be all in Italian, given that the promo sent to us for the review was completely in English, both in speech and in the subtitles.", "date": "2013-03-19", "grade": "8.6"}
