To the original recipe, Pirates of the Black Cove soon adds elements tending towards fantasy such as encounters with mermaids, giant octopuses and undead pirates. Oddly we haven't found any fishmen yet, but the hope of scratching the barrel of Disney's Pirates is evident. So much so that even the main characters seem to be the umpteenth transposition of the typical characters of Jack Sparrow (with somatic features more similar to Er Rubbish, but oh well) of Elisabeth Swann (but the physical model is Penelope Cruz from the last episode) and of the dear Will Turner, with an abundance of pompous governors, Barbossa-esque pirates, Biggs-esque boatswains and other clichs, including the Cotton parrot, among the supporting actors. Regardless of the influences, more or less bordering on plagiarism, Pirates of Black Cove presents itself as a role-playing RPG with strategy elements, in which the protagonist, to be selected from the 3 aforementioned characters, levels up, accumulates objects with which to upgrade if himself and his ship, directly manages the action on water and the various crew members during battles on land, precisely in the style of the simplest RTS. The first impact with the game is quite encouraging: the Caribbean is presented in all its grandeur, from the coasts of Mexico to Cuba passing through the myriad of islands that dot the Gulf and with the usual names of ports (Port au Prince, Tortuga, Port Royal) which will immediately become familiar to fans of the aforementioned Pirates. The graphics are quite pleasant at first glance, with deliberately opulent and tacky ship models, vaguely similar to those seen in the Warcraft saga and much less realistic than those, albeit parody, present in Pirates, but certainly pleasant and curious to look at. Same thing for the towns, portrayed with a style very close to that of the villages of Asterix (inhabitants included) and for the numerous marine animals that peep out from among the waves, in a generally satisfactory picture but undermined by an inexplicable basic heaviness, which it brought the game to numerous shots in our test configuration, although, sympathy aside, the graphic effects tend to be very few. You have never been to Singapore! The first minutes slip by quickly, we laugh at the little jokes, we face the first naval battle - a big flaw, the total absence of boarding - and little by little we realize how, proceeding from mission to mission, the difficulty always remains at the same, woefully low level. We also realize that at any moment our ship will have the same speed, because there is no bar indicating the direction of the wind. And that hitting the rocks or the banks does not cause any damage to the hull. And that the shots from the cannon on board do double the damage of those of the opponents, so much so that already from the first 24-gun ship it will be possible to face and defeat 36-gun frigates. Or that in less than three hours of playing you can already have a 70-gun ship of the line and that ships have no differentiation between damage to sails or hull. It comes to the point that a damaged ship will always be able to maneuver as well as intact, until the moment of sinking. We add that, despite the open world, the missions are quite linear (go to the pirate hideout, take the order kill/conquer/defeat the enemy on duty, go back to the hideout to get the reward), that not even the few bosses will be able to stop and that during our peregrinations we will be able to sink any ship that crosses our path, without ever finding military vessels chasing us or any other vessels allied to our victims intervening in defense of their compatriots. Among other things, on the rare occasions in which you will suffer damage, the pressure of a button will be enough to magically repair the ship in an instant, provided you have boxes of tools on board (they are released regularly from downed ships). Land battles are no exception: for the most part these are battles with either militias or pirates. There are theoretically several classes of pirates and defenders, and enhanced versions of the classes themselves, but the number of enemies is often so low that even just sending the troops ahead sprawling you get the most complete victory over the few and ineffectivemilitia. Not to mention the possibility of healing the entire team in one fell swoop by making the protagonist swallow a bottle of grog and an enemy AI that does more than make the seriously wounded men retreat, when it could at least send others as reinforcements. Even the many goodies scattered here and there - such as the ability to create potions by bringing the right ingredients to the chemist that can be found in missions on land, or that of upgrading the ship with more precise projectiles, more solid plating and more or less fantastic weapons - seem to be been included, as well as to increase the ironic verve of the title, to further reduce the difficulties, giving the player a further ace up his sleeve the very rare times he finds himself in difficulty.", "date": "2011-08-11", "grade": "5.0"}
