Zombies, Zombie HQ and Guns 4 Hire, the mobile division of Rebellion has decided to abandon inflated themes and devote himself to a rather original production, creating a medieval joust simulator for iPhone and iPad. Joust Legend therefore puts us in the shoes of a knight in search of glory and wealth, who participates in various tournaments and challenges to impose his name and enter the legend. The first steps in the game take place through a sort of tutorial that introduces us to the dynamics of combat and the importance of equipment, which includes not only the spear but also the various parts of the armor, the horse and finally the ~shield~ that in this case it is fixed on the left shoulder of the cuirass, placing itself as a target for the adversary to hit. Each challenge is resolved to the best of three rounds, with an indicator at the bottom of the screen that reminds us of the progress of the battle and a scoring system that ultimately decides the winner. In fact, hitting the other knight's body produces the least number of points, whereas hitting his shield, helmet and above all the crest proves to be the best rewarded manoeuvres. Furthermore, at a certain point, ~perks~ are introduced which can be spent individually and which multiply the score if we hit certain parts of the body, amplify our power, allow us to recover energy, stun the opponent and so on. Joust Legend is certainly an original title, with a good side dish, but with a somewhat limited gameplay Question of balance Rebellion has worked very well around Joust Legend, building a hint of plot around the individual tournaments, trying to diversify the challenges and providing us with a large number of items that can be purchased with the gold coins earned in battle. All without the slightest presence of in-app purchases: after paying out 1.79 euros to purchase the game, you will not be asked to spend anything else. However, it is the fulcrum of the production that raises some doubts, as the gameplay is based solely on the pressure of the touch screen, with the aim of making sure that a mobile indicator falls within a particular range. In this case, at the beginning of each duel you have to press on the screen to raise a gauge until it stops in the middle of the ~hot~ area, which determines the quality of the throw and the speed of the horse; after which you must first press the touch screen once to make a second indicator ~fall~ and press again for it to rise towards the two markers representing the helmet and the shield, all within an inertial system that involves multiple pressure of the display to obtain small movements and counterbalance the force that pushes the indicator downwards. As a solution it's original, there's no doubt about it, but if we're talking about accuracy then it probably would have been possible to think of something else. Also because two problems arise: firstly, the experience becomes very repetitive after a few fights, being limited to adjusting two bars using the touch screen; secondly, the numerous objects that can be purchased seem to have a minimal influence on the progress of the battle. Which is a pity, because from the point of view of technical realization the guys from Rebellion have done an excellent job, with graphics full of objects and details, whereas the sound did not impress us well.", "date": "2013-10-01", "grade": "7.2"}
