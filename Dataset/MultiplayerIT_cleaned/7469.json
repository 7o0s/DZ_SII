Just think that, after completing the game and placing the PlayStation Vita in a case, where it will probably remain for a long time, we decided to wait a few days before writing down these lines. We felt the need to digest our journey, to reflect on what the Media Molecule guys wanted to communicate to us through a simple platform. This is probably Tearaway's biggest problem: not everyone will get involved in the same way by an experience that takes place in the balance between reality and abstraction and that touches on themes and concepts that are perhaps even a little too leveraged on the personal sensitivity of each of us. From this point of view, however, we got carried away: we embraced Iota's journey and enjoyed its splendid ending. We are aware that not everyone will appreciate it in the same way, that someone will scratch their head and that someone else will remain indifferent, ready to dive headlong into levels they haven't completed 100% to unlock every Trophy. Tearaway will appeal to them too, but not to the same extent. And in that case, its minor flaws may weigh more than they weigh on us. PSVita trophies To win the Platinum Trophy, you must first unlock five gold, twelve silver and thirteen bronze trophies. Getting them all is quite easy: you have to complete the game, of course, but also find all the hidden gifts, get all the blueprints and perform small special actions. The paper messenger Rivers of words have been spent on the story of Tearaway in our previews, but it is worth summarizing it for the latest arrivals who may be reading it today for the first time, also because it is so peculiar, and it is so intertwined with the gameplay, that it one can talk about the game without talking about its storyline. The player becomes You, the ~god~ of the paper world in which Tearaway is set, and the recipient of a letter who will immediately transform into the protagonist of the game: Iota, if we choose the male gender, or Atoi, if we choose the female one . We have chosen Iota, and we will talk about him for the rest of the review: his goal is therefore to deliver this message, that is himself, to the You who scrutinize him from the sky, or the player constantly filmed by the front camera of PlayStation Vita. The journey will be long (well, almost) and full of dangers: Iota will have to solve the problems of the inhabitants of his paper world and face the ~litter~, creatures made of sheets that seem to belong to newspapers and that are slowly corrupting the environment. Iota's adventure is divided into different levels or scenarios, separated from each other but at the same time connected a little on a physical level and a little on a narrative level. At any time it is possible to select and replay the levels already unlocked, perhaps to reach those points that previously it was not possible to reach without having acquired this or that skill; Iota, in fact, will learn various ~powers~ that will allow him to defeat his enemies and overcome numerous environmental puzzles. The first power you get is that of the jump, which officially transforms Tearaway into a platformer almost half an hour after the start of the game. As you continue, Iota will learn to curl up in a paper ball in pure Samus Aran style, to defy the laws of physics thanks to the glue spread on some walls and even to use a sort of vacuum cleaner, very convenient for sucking in and then shooting the enemies or move certain elements of the environment from a distance. If Iota's abilities already offer a good variety of situations, thanks to the ingenuity of Media Molecule, things are complicated by the possibility of interacting with the world of Iota through the features of PlayStation Vita. Whether it's tapping the rear touch pad to drum on some platforms or shaking the console to cause earthquakes, the picture you get is that of a varied level design that cleverly combines various control systems and hardware features. There will be moments in which we will have to record our voice for a scarecrow and others in which we will have to photograph ourselves or our surroundings to satisfy the requests of Iota's funny compatriots and give a pinch of personality to a story that is basically our. Most of the time, however, we will spend it acting on the touch screen, moving the platforms for Iota or pulling tabs to transform the environment as we would with a pop-up book: in these situations Tearaway surprises us with decidedly original platform sequences Andfun, but way too easy. The progression is dotted with checkpoints: the impossibility of ~dying~ or going to Game Over and the general simplicity of many steps will allow the most experienced players to complete Iota's journey in just a few hours. The platform side of Tearaway, then, really explodes only in the very last levels, when Media Molecule begins to combine together, in the same passages, the multiple mechanics learned up to that moment, with jumps that must be calibrated, platforms that must be moved by moving the console, paths that need to be ~browsed~ at the right time. Although rather simple, and above all never frustrating, these sequences are a real riot of level design, an authentic gold mine of ideas that exploits the Sony handheld with great skill. Tearaway is one of the most original and creative games we've ever played A strong bond As we said, often the inhabitants of the world of Iota will ask us to carry out missions for them: there are many of them, and they are often very different. In some cases we will simply have to collect objects and place them in a certain point; sometimes we'll have to take a picture of something, decorate something else, solve a little puzzle and so on. Be that as it may, the reward is always the same: confetti galore. Iota will also find them in his path and sometimes it will be worth deviating from the intended path to collect a few more. Keep in mind that their usefulness is only one: they are spent, in fact, to unlock new functions of the camera (such as the various types of lenses) and a very long list of accessories and decorations. By pressing your finger on the spot where Iota is on the touch screen, you can zoom in on him and change him almost completely. Don't you like her eyes? Well, replace them. Do you think he looks better with a star on his chest? Please go ahead. And if there's nothing you like in the list of decorations, you can always create your own. A special option will allow you to access a real work table: choose the colored paper, draw the shape of what you want to create, cut it out, and you're done. That same decoration you can use to change the appearance of Iota or possibly one of his friends. Between squirrels who want a crown on their heads and little men who have lost their whiskers, snowflakes to be redrawn and moose who want a photo of your world printed on their fur, Tearaway allows the player to change the look of the game at will, limited only from your own imagination. In this sense, the Media Molecule title manages to fill the gap between the player and the software, building a real bridge and involving them in a sort of mutual collaboration. Even the paper blueprints hidden throughout the levels help to reinforce this link: they are completely white and placed in inconspicuous places, sometimes even hidden in previously inaccessible places. Just take a photograph to give it back color and unlock the corresponding project on the TearawayMe website: by connecting with your PlayStation Network account, the user can download the instructions to create a paper model, a real origami like those that the developers by Media Molecule have crafted to bring the world of Tearaway to life. In reality, it is a nice but certainly not transcendental idea, which probably very few will seriously exploit, and which represents only a playful ~plus~ aimed at ideally bringing Iota's paper world into our real world. Origami Since its inception, Tearaway has attracted everyone's attention due to the peculiar graphic style adopted by Media Molecule. Having abandoned (for now?) the LittleBigPlanet cloth puppets, the Anglo-Saxon developer has focused on the so-called ~paper craft~. It's not the first time that this style has been opted for - think of Nintendo's Paper Mario - but it is certainly the first time that ~paper craft~ has been used in such a convincing way. The result, in one word, is wonderful. Iota, his friends, his enemies and the world around them are made entirely of sheets of paper, assembled, folded and cut to shape almost anything. Ironically, the number of polygons employed isn't all that high, partly because most objects are two-dimensional being, well, simple sheets of paper. The point is that each of them is animated independently of the others, in a kaleidoscope of delicate movements and colors that leaves you speechless, thanks also to the usual, very high quality of the PlayStation Vita OLED screen. If you believethat the forest at the beginning of the game is spectacular, wait until you see Sogport and its stormy sea waves or the sci-fi research laboratories suspended in the void. Some scenarios are nothing short of breathtaking, and the temptation to stop for a moment to take a picture of the panorama with our trusty camera is always huge. However, all this goodness comes at a price. At first we believed that those little stutters noticed from time to time were a sort of stop motion animation of some elements of the scenario, then we realized that, indeed, there are also visible drops in frame rates. Here and there the game suffers more or less evident slowdowns, probably caused by the amount of elements animated simultaneously. A game of framing that is not always precise also thinks about causing some havoc: in some levels we will be able to move the camera freely around the vertical axis, while in others its position will be fixed and, in these cases, it is not uncommon for it to choose some strange and annoying angles. Apart from this and some small bugs of very little importance, Tearaway is a real joy to play and to watch, but also to listen to: beyond the discreet Italian voices chosen to dub the narrators, Tearaway follows the events of Iota and Tu with an enchanting soundtrack, full of pressing songs and ballads reminiscent of Scottish folklore and which contribute to immerse us even more in his fantasy world.", "date": "2013-11-20", "grade": "8.8"}
