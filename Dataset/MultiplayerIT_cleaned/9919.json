At the time there was talk of the evolution of MUDs (online role-playing games text or ascii graphics) towards complete virtual worlds, equipped with jaw-breaking graphics, full of unimaginable possibilities and capable of evolving independently. After thirteen years we can finally say that those anticipations were colored by a certainly appreciable and justified, but excessive euphoria. In fact, Ultima Online has met almost all the forecasts regarding graphic representation capacity and game possibilities. But of dynamic worlds, leaving out the possibility of cultivating or that of asking for castles or shops by large guilds, there has been no trace. On the contrary. We realize today that most of the mmorpg has gone back, and has done so, it is said, to be more accessible to the general public. But there is a strong suspicion that the brake has been placed to reduce costs, given that in the race for the number of subscriptions, good gameplay and a captivating setting can make up for a static world with practically no exploration. And World Of Warcraft has embodied this philosophy, giving us a calibrated, unique and simple combat system but framing it in a rigid system of statistics and objects. All sipping the news to lengthen one's existence. Profitable, popular and understandable choices but which have given a resounding blow to the evolutionary drive of mmorpgs. A blow that only two games have avoided. The first is EVE which, facilitated by the spatial setting, was able to offer free gameplay without generating excessive management costs. The second is Wurm Online. An Mmorpg developed with java and with a handful of megabytes of data that offers more possibilities than Uol and EVE combined. And it is the latter that is at the center of our attention given that it has been able to attract that of the public, despite the evident savings on the technological front and the high difficulty of approaching it. A choice that is clearly against the trend with today's videogame productions and that is aimed at all those players who dream of ever-changing worlds that they can shape day after day with their own actions. The hard work of the player In short, Wurm Online is a graphically limited but monstrously rich title. An online universe that, to begin with, is able to offer all those elements that have made Ultima Online the cross and delight of the true hardcore mmorpger. The character gets tired walking, running and carrying equipment and must increase his stamina to increase the possible load and to be able to face the steepest climbs. The world offers seeds to plant and lands to cultivate to increase our connection to the earth. Trees provide wood for making arrows, and arrows are essential for procuring meat. The work of the miner allows you to collect precious materials and strengthen your back. And each of the dozens of activities we can do in Wurm increases our skills, strengthens our muscles, brings us closer to spirits, teaches us how to survive and builds our way along the slow path to becoming heroes. But, in the immediate term, the collection of material is used to create everything we need such as food to stay fit, fabrics, tables, tools and objects to sell to buy more or to buy basic equipment. And it is here that Wurm clearly breaks away from Ultima Online and takes a step forward towards those dynamic worlds that populated the videogame fantasies of the 90s. The entire game universe is in fact built by the players who at the dawn of time found themselves abandoned in desert lands and uninhabited islands. Lands to be shaped and made your own without any limit other than that of the materials available. Each building can then be repaired, finished, furnished and retouched. Each abyss can be bridged with a bridge to be built piece by piece. Every tree can be cut down and every terrain can be leveled or penetrated to its most hidden secrets, digging real caves in search of the earth's treasures. And digging too deep doesn't mean that only pleasant things emerge from the depths. In short, these are the elements that justify the not exceptional graphic rendering of the OneTooFree AB title. And the saving in terms of hardware resources also allows the software house to connect and disconnect the servers at will. It allows you to place 16 kilometers of map on a single server and let us explore every corner of it, provided you have enough breath and enough courage; yes because among the forests of Wurm, contrary to what happens in any alter mmorpg, it is still possible to get lost. Create and destroy The first steps are tiring to say the least. The world is vast, food scarce and our legs just weak. But at least in the starting realm there is no danger of being massacred by angry invaders and building a house can be a good starting point to strengthen physique and mind. In fact, it is the actions, similar to the aforementioned Ultima Online, that form the physical abilities and skills of the character and there are no specific levels or skills to mark and limit the possibilities of the game. And it is advisable to take full advantage of the Golden Valley to learn how to manage every aspect of Wurm Oline and to bring the skills that interest us to 20, the maximum value allowed in the newbie area. Leaving the protected lands for the open world is in fact dangerous and it is necessary to prepare for the impact with an even harder and more tiring reality than that represented by daily survival. Shooting alone becomes a gamble and the fights against monsters suddenly get tougher. And it is at this juncture that the gameplay shows some weakness given the poverty of the animations and graphic effects which in longer fights generate the feeling of an almost desolate static. But the most experimental mmorpg in videogame history certainly doesn't aim to rival the dynamics of World of Wacraft, which has managed to enliven even the less fun activities such as farming and grinding. In Wurm Online, repeating the usual action for hours, including fighting, is almost torture and it is far more fun to get lost behind the construction of objects and buildings, the maintenance of animals or direct cultivation without GMOs. Businesses that have their own space on the Freedom server which also includes a faction called Freedom, which does not respond to the policies of the three major factions. Yet the combat, albeit spartan, is needed, and even a lot. In fact, the title explodes all its potential in the PVP realm, or in the Wild server. It is here that the peculiarities of the three factions that inhabit the lands of Wurm Online make sense. In a world contested by huge alliances that change borders, build fortresses and fight for the conquest of territories and artifacts. In this context, the very ugly horses become essential and the lack of excitement allows you to focus attention on the strategy, often focused on the conquest and transport of artifacts endowed with cosmic powers. Entering enemy buildings has a unique charm as they are buildings made by players following always different and often surprising tactics and imaginaries. Traversing man-made villages is a unique thing that transcends the barren rows of pre-cooked tenements of Ultima Online or Star Wars Galaxies. And being surprised in front of an enemy fortress built in a hurry for the war, gives a priceless sensation. The Ugly Duckling The title that OneTooFree AB has been supporting for the past eight long years is a real paradox. On the one hand we have the maximum evolution of online role-playing games and on the other one of the poorest and most antiquated graphics engines of the decade, managed through cumbersome and ugly text menus. And if the general graphic poverty is justified by the need to keep management costs low, to run on every existing hardware and to give players infinite possibilities, the flaws of fighting monsters are not equally justified. Indeed, when the focus is on a single static combat, bad animations and spartan models are harder to digest than a head of garlic in its skin. And the bigger the monsters, the worse the effect is by showing us huge badly modeled dragons whirling ridiculously interpenetrating the player characters. And it is only in PvP that these all too obvious flaws somehow fade into the background, when strategy, exploration and mass battles come into play. The title offers a Realm against Realm formula superior even to that of DaoC, provided, of course, that you swallow the bitter pill relating to graphic poverty. In any case, not all the aesthetic component of Wurm Online is to be thrown away. Ambient lights, climatic effects, forests, deserts, reflections and streams are not bad for a title developed completely in java and with only 100 megabytes of data. And without a doubt, the towns built with some care really seem like unique places with a story to tell. In addition, sound and ambient music surprise in quality and manage to give a unique atmosphere by balancing, at least in part, the enormous shortcomings of the graphics engine.", "date": "2010-07-07", "grade": "7.5"}
