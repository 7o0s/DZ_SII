{"name": "Metal Slug 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-slug-5.html", "text": "Despite its failure, SNK still lives on. He lives in the hearts of his fans, of gamers who grew up with his titles, who grew up on the rhythm of fisticuffs in The King of Fighters, on the sound of blades crossing in Samurai Spirits, on the rumble of explosions in Metal Slug. Paradoxically, it lives much less as a brand, a pale shadow of the great softco of the past, a mask of the work of minor houses, which do little justice to its glorious past. It's hard to say for those who loved SNK, but it's the pure, sad truth. It was already clear to us, it was confirmed to us by shoddy titles like The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact, and by the merciless SNK-branded conversions we've seen running on our consoles in recent months. Unfortunately Metal Slug 4 is no exception, on the contrary... it confirms that to relive the SNK that was, we might as well go back to the Neo Geo. Unfortunate conversion Metal Slug 4 is precisely a faithful conversion of the original arcade. So faithful that one wonders how such stuff could run on PS2 at the dawn of 2006. The animations are all there, the huge sprites as well, and so there are also slowdowns and pixels as big as houses, dull and grainy colors, in short. .. Certainly not a show that a PS2 user accustomed to polygons, cel-shading or even the refined 2D of Guilty Gear can 'swallow like a glass of water. The strength of Metal Slug has never been in its audiovisual realization, but in pure and simple gameplay: it is a statement on which we all agree, yet this Metal Slug 4, although not contemptible, is certainly not very digestible, above all due to the numerous delays mentioned above. Fortunately, the funny and sometimes a little grotesque humor that characterizes every moment of the action has remained unchanged, thanks to the hilarious animations of the protagonists and opponents. On the other hand, the rocking and incisive music accompanies the action without ever tiring, but they go totally into the background and end up being forgotten immediately, in the passage from one level to another. ... he shot me down, bang bang... However, the essence of Metal Slug has remained intact, so here we are again choosing one of the four protagonists and diving into a battle divided into five missions: the various horizontal and vertical scrolling stages are set in different areas of the world and present a good variety both structurally and visually, but the basic mechanism remains unchanged. Everything that moves is destroyed, and that huge boss at the end of the levelwell, more is destroyed. Going through each stage, you will be able to get your hands on different and increasingly devastating weapons: from the machine gun to the flamethrower, from the rocket launcher to the laser rifle, pace of Molotov cocktails that can be thrown in limited numbers. Without forgetting the vehicles that you can drive, fully armed and an excellent way to mow down the Germans on duty. The secondary objective of each mission is to free the hostages: these poor bearded men will always find themselves in the most bizarre and unfortunate positions, but once saved they will reward the player with ammunition and other useful items. It would seem fun as always, but things don't go quite as they should. First of all, the difficulty of this new chapter is truly disproportionate. Not that Metal Slug was ever an easy shooter series, but it borders on the ridiculous here. Often, especially from the third stage onwards, there really isn't a blind spot on the screen to be safe in while fighting opponents who attack from behind, in front, from above, even from below. Jumping like mad hoping to find a free millimeter and discovering that it actually isn't there isn't exactly the best of fun. Metal Slug 4 thus becomes a senseless race to Game Over: thanks to the infinite credits (well, we're not in the arcade...) you find yourself proceeding like a kamikaze, using Molotov cocktails until they run out and then letting yourself be killed and starting over to bomb. Once the ~lives~ available to our protagonist are finished, you keep or change him, continue the game and go in a loop. In this way Metal Slug 4 is completed in half an hour, and the satisfaction is practically nil. One can be loyal, so to speak, and limit the number of credits available to start over after a while, but the simply frustrating difficulty of the advanced stages discourages any shred of playful honesty, leading the player to adopt the kamikaze solution described, somewhat mortifying the story of a series that has always been based on skill and reflexes, rather than on cheeky luck or virtual tokens. The two splendid Metal Slugs for Neo Geo Pocket Color that SNK produced years ago, a clear demonstration of ingenuity and videogame design. Yet, after all this time, on a PlayStation 2, we find ourselves in front of an extremely mediocre product, both from a technical and a playful point of view. Technically it's so retro that one wonders if it's really a conversion from an arcade or from PSOne, from a playful point of view instead it seems like a programmer's entertainment, who probably laughed while inventing the most wicked evolutions of the difficulty in front of their monitors. commitment that disintegrates in the face of the absurd infinity of credits, which cancels out any element of challenge. The result is a disappointment, especially considering the snooty name it bears. We would like to recommend it exclusively to aficionados of the saga, who just don't feel like leaving a hole in their collection. Pro It's still Metal Slug. Good game variety. Against Frustrating. Mediocre technical achievement. Not long-lived at all.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
