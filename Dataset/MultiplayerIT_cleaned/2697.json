Do you want for the inevitable reference to a Silent Hill of which hopes have now been lost, or for the presence of a composer of the caliber of Akira Yamaoka, or even for the choice to abandon development on the old gen in favor of the new one. The fact is that the new Bloober Team game has created a generous expectation, especially in a landscape such as horror where it is easy to find titles that are always the same and less and less satisfactory. Fear is something that goes beyond the simple sensation itself, as they told us in the recent interview, and one must not limit oneself to building it: one must cultivate it, manage it, insinuate it into the player's head so that it has the desired effect and not limit yourself to a sterile fright. The premises of the last few months have told of a product capable of satisfying even the finest palates of the genre, if not above all them, but how did the title behave in practice? Was it just talk and badge? Let's find out together in the review of The Medium. An ever growing story The Medium is a game that owes a lot to old-school Japanese horror films such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill: in particular, from the latter it recalls all the purely psychological atmosphere that defines Marianne's story through the Niwa and beyond. Where Bloober Team's previous works, by their own admission, made heavy use of jumpscare, The Medium all but abandons a now overused and stale gimmick in favor instead of building tension, not anticipation. It is a very important distinction to make, because the sense of anticipation is the basis of those predictable experiences in the long run, devoid of a bite that does not reside in a scare telephoned and destined to run out a moment later. On the other hand, tension is something more subtle, difficult to articulate but even more complex to maintain, waiting to reach a climax which will then yes, be broken with a sharp blow - a breath of air to then return to a suffocating apnea. we can only applaud Bloober Team for how they handled the situation, proving capable of fueling sensations that are only in our heads, making us tiptoe through the ten hours and more of the game needed to complete it: the danger is really real ? If so, how can I say with certainty that I am safer in the material world? Questions that accompany us step by step, as we unravel a tragedy whose roots sink into the history of a popular Poland to then have repercussions in a present-past (we are, after all, in the 90s, far from our 2021) which still bears its scars . We therefore discover, exactly as in Silent Hill, that horror is often inherent in man more than it is in fantasy or folklore; that in our minds beasts more dangerous than any other can lurk, because the darkest thoughts take the form of grotesque creatures freeing themselves from the chains to which they have always been forced; that no one is truly immune to their demons. In a beautiful intertwining of plot and gameplay, therefore, The Medium tells a tragic story, elaborated piece by piece up to a conclusion that will leave you wanting more - a sense of emptiness built on the illusion that, despite everything, the happy ending exists and can save everything. Marianne is a strong woman, very well characterized, who seeks in her curse a way of being useful to others and does not back down in the face of the unknown or danger because they have always been part of her life. Around her, very often smoky figures, but equally present thanks to a very articulated narration, help and hinder her, always showing themselves to be essential in understanding the events. Marianne is alone in reality, she is not alone in the spirit world through which she always moves, often against her will: repeating her words, she lives in two realities but does not really belong to either. He accepts his fate as it is, he doesn't try to change it, rather using it to try to make sense of a past he remembers nothing about. It's not difficult to become attached to her, share her struggle and hope for a better future. Bloober Team has given life to a multifaceted, human character within a continuously growing narrative that, even in moments when the gameplay shows its side a bit, does not lose its bite, taking horror in its most wide to make it its driving force, the means through which to tell and tell oneself. Gameplay: Two interconnected worlds From the gameplay point of view, it goes without saying that the simultaneous experience in two worlds is the flagship of the game: fluid and never invasive, portto a mechanic already known in the past at a higher level. It's not just about moving and acting simultaneously on two different planes of existence, but about the fact that the real and spiritual worlds interact and influence each other, making themselves essential without this feeling like a stretch in terms of game design. In some cases it will even be necessary to resort to the so-called extrasensory experience, i.e. abandoning one's physical body to become one with the spirit, if one wants to overcome certain segments - bearing in mind, however, that the spiritual world is a greedy mouth that will soon devour us, if we spend more time there than necessary. An effect that the development team rendered well by causing Marianne to slowly disappear, starting with her legs, as she stays on the other side; a consequence which, moreover, remains if we were to run into a movie, effectively creating yet another connection between gameplay and narration. Learning to master the extrasensory experience could prove useful when we find ourselves faced with the threat of the Maw, the creature that inhabits the spirit world and hunts down our protagonist non-stop: in The Medium there is no form of combat as we usually understand it, perhaps armed with an iron pipe or a rifle, but there is confrontation: another important distinction. We are able to react to danger, confront it precisely, however we cannot fight it as a Chris Redfield or even James Sunderland himself would. Our survival is all a matter of ingenuity, timing and sometimes a fair amount of luck when we are called upon to make a critical decision: if the Maw catches us it is game over but we always have one last chance of defence, if Marianne had accumulated spiritual power - a form of energy which in its own way is also reflected in reality, as you will discover by playing. In this sense, the stealth phases are the least convincing of the package, daughters of a certain clumsiness and a fixed camera that does not benefit our movements due to a shot that does not help to manage movements and spaces well. Beyond the excited phases, The Medium is an experience mainly based on puzzles, where our brain is the main weapon: they are not complex but rather well articulated, divided between the two planes of existence and often distributed over several phases. However, it is a linear experience overall, as are these productions that wink at the old schools, and rightly so: excessive dispersion would have played against the tension with which the game is cloaked. It is also a breath of fresh air in a landscape that has seen a lot of open-world productions or productions that in any case require a large amount of hours to be completed lately. The exploration itself, vital for finding the clues but also the collectibles around which the plot insights revolve, is indeed encouraged but in any case reduced to identifying the out of tune point - the detour, the hidden area, the out of place detail - in the area within which we are moving. There is scope to look around without however losing the main objective. An interesting detail when exploring is that, when examining a point of interest, the view switches to first person: a useful ploy not to miss any details that the fixed camera would not allow you to notice (provided you don't go back to the old , familiar luminescence on the screen), and to increase the tension because one is never sure that the fright cannot come from a slightly darker corner. The fact that Bloober Team has almost completely abandoned jump scares, after all, it means that these are completely absent and the team plays a lot on this constant uncertainty. The distribution between puzzles and narration is generally balanced, there are just a couple of occasions in which you perceive more of that walking simulator feeling that characterized the previous games (Layers of Fear and Blair Witch in particular), but for what they offer in terms of lore and art direction they are ~slips~ that we can safely forgive. Being something out of Marianne's control, the phases in the spirit world cannot be activated and deactivated at will, they occur in particular moments of the plot, however in the moment in which they arise we have full freedom of interaction. The Medium is capable of offering much more in terms of gameplay than you might imagine and above all from points of view that are not limited to Marianne's: in short, there is much more than meets the eye. An exceptional artistic direction Sebwell the performance of The Medium is excellent and does not go unnoticed, with stable frame rate and ray tracing ready to enhance even the smallest details, they necessarily give way to a simply wonderful artistic direction: where the real world returns those disturbing sensations  la Silent Hill, the spirit plane is something beautiful and distressing at the same time. An incredibly heartfelt homage to the Polish painter Zdzisaw Beksiski to the point that, were he still alive, it would be hard to believe that he didn't paint the scenery. Figures with bandaged, disfigured or erased faces; barren, arid, desolate landscapes; mutilated, corroded and decaying objects. A current of dystopian surrealism that comes to life and becomes art in the true sense of the word, moving paintings from which, despite a natural repulsion, one cannot look away. Bloober Team perfectly paints Beksiski's hell, the pain and anguish of a world where those who still have an unfinished business with their lives walk. The Medium should be played even for this alone, to walk in the most disturbing and concealment of the individual - enjoying an extraordinarily tragic and emotional art. For once, and we reiterate this despite the fact that they are more than satisfactory except for the somewhat awkward animations, we can leave aside all the rhetoric of the performances and enhance an excellent artistic direction. Excellence also extended to the purely cinematographic management of the movies, which offer different shots when the two worlds are involved at the same time and emphasizes the attention to detail desired, sought, found by the developers. All this is accompanied by a soundtrack of the highest level, the result of the collaboration with that living legend known as Akira Yamaoka: in The Medium the music never takes over the game, it follows it, accompanies it, flatters it at times and as many knows when to keep silent, letting silence have its say, but never trying to impose itself. From an artistic point of view there is really nothing that can be attributed to The Medium and, in marrying very well with the gameplay, it is proof that Bloober Team has seized the moment: from the decision to exclude Xbox One, avoiding castrating the game , up to the abandonment of some approaches that have characterized their games but risked being stale and repetitive, the development team has shown a courage that cannot be ignored.", "date": "2021-01-27", "grade": "9.0"}
