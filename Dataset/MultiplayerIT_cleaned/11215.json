{"name": "Transformers G1: Il Risveglio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/transformers-g1-il-risveglio.html", "text": "Who doesn't know the Transformers? Born as a toy line by Hasbro, who had the idea of importing products from the Micronauts/Diaclone line (made by Takara) into the USA, these robots that could be transformed into vehicles were entrusted to Marvel to invent their origins and tell their stories. adventures. Thus a cartoon series and a comic were born: both met with enormous success all over the world, renewing themselves year after year with the arrival of new characters and new settings. The recently made film represents only the latest act in a campaign that is bringing all the animated series that characterized the 80s and 90s to the fore, but longtime fans know well that there is a big difference between what was brought to the big screen and what is commonly referred to as the ~Generation 1~ of the Transformers. It is above all to them that Glu dedicates this Transformers G1: The Awakening, which tells the story of the awakening of the Autobots on our planet and their fight with the Decepticons, following a plot that differs from the original anime only for a few elements. The game has three different modes: the ~Story Mode~, in which the stages tell a story that is gradually enriched with new elements; the ~Showdown~, which is unlocked after finishing the ~Story Mode~ and which puts us in front of a series of scenarios unrelated to the plot; the ~Cybertron Arena~, available after completing the first two modes, which allows us to organize matches even for two players (in turn, on the same mobile phone) or to face the AI in a series of battles without too many frills. Once you take the field, you realize the enormous similarities that exist between this Transformers G1: The Awakening and any episode of Super Robot Wars: arranged on a map virtually divided into square tables, the robots can move, attack or transform during a turn. Each of these actions is closely linked to the characteristics of the character: the huge Metroplex can only move one square at a time and does not transform, but acts as a mobile fortress and with the right amount of Energon it can activate new Autobots; Optimus Prime is very strong and resilient, improves the morale of companions who are adjacent to his position but can only attack from close quarters; Sideswipe and Prowl transform into fast cars and thus can cover long distances, but only have the ability to attack from range; Blaster does not transform into a radio as in the cartoon, but exactly like Metroplex it can exploit the available Energon to give life to new Autobots, in this case its transformable ~cassettes~; Jetfire, who is initially presented as a Decepticon, and then freed from their mental conditioning (just like in the original story), is the only Autobot capable of flying; Grimlock, the only Dinobot we'll have to deal with in the game, isn't very agile but has extraordinary strength in his tyrannosaurus form; Finally, Ratchet is the classic medical unit that can repair part of a teammate's damage (or its own) during a turn. To complete the stages, very often we will simply have to eliminate all the enemies on the map; more rarely, we will have to reach particular areas or take over all the energy stations. The latter represent an element of great importance, when the fight goes on for a long time, since they allow us to collect a certain amount of Energon at each turn, which makes the various Metroplexes and Blasters (but also the corresponding Decepticons, or Trypticons and Soundwave) capable of recruiting new characters to add to the starting group. The technical realization of the game is excellent in many respects. You can choose whether to listen to the music or the sound effects: in the first case we have fairly well made MIDIs, but which unfortunately do not reflect the original Transformers theme; in the second case, however, we can enjoy the characteristic ~noise~ of the transformations, really well done, a joy for the nostalgic. The graphics are basically in 2D, with a good design of the various characters (each in the form of a robot or a vehicle), who however are a little too small to be able to admire the details, and move on scenarios that are too often meager and repetitive in the elements. The situation changes when a clash occurs: the two contenders are represented in an excellent way by a polygonal graphics full of details and well animated; just a pity that each character has only one type of attack, and that the ~fire support~ is not represented on the screen. However, these sequences are skippable.", "date": "2008-09-08", "grade": "S.V."}
