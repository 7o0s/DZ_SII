{"name": "Recensione di Area 51", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-di-area-51.html", "text": "Close encounters of the third kind As anyone will have guessed from the title of the game itself, the action takes place inside the American military base called Area 51, where the legends related to the existence of aliens (you think whether with a grain of truth or not) narrate they are preserved spaceships and bodies of extraterrestrial beings found in Roswell after an accident that occurred more than fifty years ago. But something inside the structure goes wrong and a kind of alien viral infection is released that transforms anyone who is infected into a bloodthirsty beast, according to the model of Resident Evil. Ethan Cole, a member of the special forces, is sent together with his team inside Area 51 to eradicate these strange creatures: he will also have to contend with strange conspiracies that will obviously be revealed as the game progresses. Unfortunately, the gameplay of this title does not offer anything original compared to any FPS released in recent times, risking relegating the gaming experience to a series of dejavus for those who are used to eating bread and shooters: in any case, once having come to terms with what has previously been said, the gaming experience is quite satisfactory in terms of fun. In fact, especially at the beginning, the player finds himself having to face large groups of aliens with the help of his team and you will imagine how all this translates into an infinite series of bullets and pure adrenaline ... add also that your bullets however they will not kill your teammates, even if hit, and that's it. Unfortunately, the gameplay of this title offers nothing original compared to any FPS Close encounters of the third kind Similarly to what has been seen in other titles, shortly after the start of the game Ethan will have the possibility of obtaining special powers, thanks to the virus spread inside the base, of which however he becomes a kind of ~healthy carrier~: every time in which he transforms, Ethan's strength increases and he also has the ability to carry out two different types of viral attacks against his enemies. The protagonist of the game is also equipped with a scanner, through which to analyze some elements of the environment as he progresses (various objects, corpses, etc...), thus allowing the gamer to unlock some special contents. The multiplayer of Area 51 is also subjected to the introduction made previously regarding the single mode: practically nothing that is present has not already been seen in other multi-player FPS. The game modes present are in fact the classic deathmatch, capture the flag and a Splinter Cell type, in which players can take part as aliens or as special forces. All modes support up to 16 characters. The technical sector The graphics are probably the most interesting aspect of Area 51: while not reaching excellent levels like other sacred monsters of the genre, the game gets along by fielding a good range of pleasant and well-crafted effects, one above all what you can see when Ethan transforms into alien. However, the impression is that of a mere conversion from console to PC, without worrying too much about exploiting the greater power available on the machine available. The graphics are probably the most interesting aspect of Area 51 The technical sector Characters and circumstance environment offer a very good level of detail, which contributes to the player's identification with the story, just as the different creatures will make you want to destroy them just by looking at how ugly they are. If the graphics are of a good level, even the sound is not far behind, especially in the English version: as we have already had the opportunity to say in fact, David Duchovny, Marilyn Manson and Powers Boothe have lent their voices to the Anglo-Saxon version of the game, and it's not every day you see characters of this caliber dub the voices of a video game. The Italian version, while not being able to count on so many speaking characters, also defends itself admirably in terms of acting, which can only represent a merit for this title. The sound effects are also very well done, sounding adequate and believable, but the soundtrack could probably have done more than a few lacklustre, lackluster tunes. Comment Commenting on a game like Area 51 is quite difficult, in fact how can you say that you can have fun playing it but that at the same time it offers almost nothing original compared to the competition? Yet it is like this: once you accept that there is nothing new under the sun (and this concerns specially who has been playing FPS for a lifetime), you have the opportunity to spend a fairly pleasant fifteen hours. On the other hand, those who are not used to titles of this genre but intend to approach them can consider this game among their possible purchases without regretting it, given that on balance it is a fairly interesting title but which probably if it had come out a few years ago would have obtained a most successful. Pros: Good graphics and sound Fun with numerous firefights Cons: Lacks original Soundtrack not up to par Innovative multiplayer ET phone home! What passes for Area 51, the Roswell case and alien invasions in general, has always been a gold vein for the entire entertainment industry, be it paper, cinematographic or videogame. In fact, we could mention countless masterpieces that are at least inspired by this theme (one above all, Half-Life, not to get too far from our context) as well as hallucinating ciofeche that have been produced over the years. Among this multitude of titles dedicated to the subject, Midway has also decided to have its say with Area 51, a title whose pros and cons we are about to dissect: the first thing that catches the eye (although it would be more correct to tell ear) but, alas, only for the English version of the game, is the list of famous voices who have participated in the dubbing of the characters in the game. The first that obviously could not be missing in such a title is David Duchovny, who after X-Files and Evolution seems to have gained some experience in the alien theme. Within the cast we also find Marilyn Manson and Powers Boothe, Senator Roark in the recent Sin City.", "date": "2005-07-14", "grade": null}
