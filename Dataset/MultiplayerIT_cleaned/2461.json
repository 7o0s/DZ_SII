{"name": "Kuru Kuru Kururin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kuru-kuru-kururin.html", "text": "An easy ~plot~. The background to our vicissitudes is easy to tell: a mother (belonging to an unidentified species of birds) and her ten little children are walking in a meadow, when all ten of them go away disappearing behind their parent's back. So mother bird, in the throes of despair, goes to Kururin (the older brother) telling what happened and asking for his help. Our task will therefore be to find his missing brothers and bring them back to their distracted mother. How do I organize you a game Before embarking on the adventure we will be introduced to the Training section, in which we will learn the basics of driving Kururin's aerial vehicle (a sort of rotating cylinder with the cockpit in the centre) through five lessons given by the flight teacher Hare, who will offer us useful suggestions even later. We will then begin the actual rescue operation through ten levels (one for each little kid) made up of three schemes each. Each level is themed: there's grassland, ocean, jungle, cave, etc.; moreover, for each level it is also possible to recover ~modifications~ for Kururin's helicopter, capable of altering its color and shape to our liking. To complete the various schemes, the greatest foresight must be reserved for the walls and the obstacles of the same, because every time we hit them we will lose an energy point (from a maximum of three) and we will also be penalized by three seconds. The aim of each level is to find the right and fastest path to recover the little fugitives and the ~upgrades~ for the helicopter, all this while avoiding colliding too many times (in the more complex schemes there are often points to recharge one's energy ). In addition to the main adventure, the game offers the classic Challenge and Vs modes. In the first we will have fifty different schemes available for which the objective will be to establish the best time, while the second mode allows us to challenge up to three friends ( equipped with as many GBA) or on a single pattern of our choice or on the length of several rounds. The patterns used in Vs mode are the same as in Challenge. A relevant detail is the possibility of playing up to four having all the options available, even with only one cartridge. When special effects are not needed The technical realization of KKK (not to be confused with the much better known ~social movement~ of the same name) is almost good. The graphics are clean and colourful, even if a bit bare, but very functional and very pleasing to the eye. Again and again you will surely find yourself admiring the humble beauty of certain patterns. The few animations present deserve a sufficiency, even if, as in F-Zero, some rendered polygonal models were then converted into two-dimensional sprites. Scrolling is always fluid and no slowdown is felt even when playing multiplayer. The sound sector of KKK is equally pleasant and themed with the various levels, the repetitiveness of the musical accompaniments is not annoying, on the contrary the tunes are very catchy and someone, sooner or later, will get into their heads and stay there for a long time. The sound effects are reduced to a minimum, in fact the animated elements of the backdrop do not have them, but those few are adequate and pertinent. The controls are simple: with the directional cross we impart the movements to the helicopter, with A or B we accelerate (their simultaneous pressure instead provides greater speed), while R and L produce two different horn effects. They are precise and sufficient in their shortage, even if the directional pad often proves inaccurate in managing the most daring movements; in fact, it would have been preferable to have a stick to facilitate the finesse in the movements, but this is a flaw of the machine and not of the game. Concluding Ultimately KuruKuru Kururin demonstrates solid and satisfying playability and hardly gets boring, although at first glance it may appear repetitive and monotonous. The level of difficulty is very well calibrated (in any case the usual frustrating passages of the genre are inevitable), longevity is high thanks to both the thirty schemes of the main game and the fifty of the Challenge and Vs modes and the technical realization is more than discreet. all in the name of the essential. Finally, a last note attributable to the personal experience of the undersigned: KuruKuru Kururin is really fun and satisfying in its ~littleness~, however it risks becoming a real drug, causing numbness and tiredness in the eyes. A new and beautiful game which, in spite of an essential realization, is the harbinger of a graditor wind of innovation in the puzzle-game genre. Concluding Pros: finally something original very funny extremely long-lived technically satisfying Cons: regular difficult passages (as per the script) Much loved originality The game reviewed here is the classic example of how a simple idea works a thousand times better than an ultra-complex project. Taking into consideration the puzzle-game genre, but also more generally all current videogame production, we can sincerely say that we are finally faced with something innovative, extremely fun and rewarding. We really can't stand all these latest Puzzle-Bubble or Tetris clones any more, which bring some, mostly unpleasant, novelties to the original concept by only weighing down its shape and redoing the trick. KuruKuru Kururin, on the other hand, offers something very original. The concept behind the game is extremely simple, in fact the only thing to do is to be able to pass unscathed through different labyrinthine levels, piloting our Kururin's bizarre helicopter. That's all. Or rather, this is the fulcrum around which the very interesting playful experience that Eighting (on behalf of Nintendo) has packaged for all GBA owners revolves. 11", "date": "2001-07-05", "grade": null}
