{"name": "Red Dead Revolver", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-dead-revolver.html", "text": "The West according to Rockstar Red Dead Revolver is the classic third-person shooter centered on a typical action-game structure ala Max Payne, obviously set in the old Far West. But rather than ~telling us~ about a wild west with Indians and bandits in pure Hollywood style, the Rockstar title seems more to wink at Sergio Leone's films (a positive thing to say the least - Tanzen's note). I don't think I'm exaggerating in defining this RDR a sort of videogame ~spaghetti western~. The west represented here is dusty, vulgar and dirty. All the classic elements present in the Italian director's films are evidently re-proposed during the game phases: from Clint Eastwood's worn poncho to dirty and rough bandits, from the poor and semi-deserted villages on the border with Mexico to the music, clearly inspired (if not even literally sampled) to the soundtracks of Maestro Ennio Morricone. The protagonist himself, Red, looks just like a gunslinger out of the movie The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and even the plot follows the films of the genre. The stereotypical story of the young Indian half-blood Red, who sees his family massacred before his own eyes, saving himself by a pure miracle, and then after a few years becoming a skilled bounty hunter in search of revenge, immediately brings to mind dozens of western films 70's. I saw three dusters just like these a while back. There were three men inside and three bullets inside the men  Jason Roberts -  Once Upon a Time in the West  Even the situations we'll face in the Rockstar title are typical of the western films mentioned above. All the key moments that we have learned to enjoy in the films mentioned above we will now be able to relive them firsthand as protagonists. From shootings on the dusty streets of a ghost town to those on a train attacked by banditos (which we will have to defend by preventing the latter from crashing into a ravine after the murder of the driver) up to the proverbial ~free for all~, the very famous brawls in saloons where you must only and exclusively hit left and right. Moving in levels structured like arenas, you will have to make your way through dozens of enemies armed to the teeth and determined to kill us, relying only on their own strengths and on a respectable paraphernalia made up of pistols (the legendary Colt!!! ), rifles (Winchester), knives, gatlings, sticks of dynamite and so on and so forth. In this sense, the possibility that the gamer is given to manage the level on his own is positive, in the sense that each of us will be able to decide on the basis of his own abilities and ideas how to deal with the situation that arises at that moment. Even if it seems inadvisable to launch headlong forward as nine times out of ten this will lead to a premature end. Especially if we consider that in RDR the targeting system of the opponents has not been conceived in an optimal way and therefore the intrinsic difficulties of a shootout are also added those due to a technical limit. In fact, there is no automatic ~lock~ of the enemies so from time to time it will be the gamer himself who will have to aim the weapon aiming the opponent to hit with the right analog stick, which is not the best of life if you take into account of the fact that this PS2 analog stick is not very precise and that often the opponents on the screen are many and hidden on the roofs of the city. From this point of view, the introduction of a bullet time called Dead Eye, also borrowed from Max Payne, is welcome, thanks to which it will be possible to carry out certain actions by aiming comfortably at the targets to be hit (everything will move slowly at that moment, allowing you to aiming easier). However this possibility is not always usable for obvious reasons related to an otherwise too simple gameplay. The aforementioned Dead Eye reaches its maximum usefulness as well as spectacularity in duels to the death against the end-level Bosses, when the perspective changes to a truly atmospheric first-person view. If the ~mission~ just completed has not been completed as expected, it will be possible to replay it several times, in order to be able to complete it 100%. Precisely this last aspect, combined with the fact that thanks to the score obtained at the end of each level it will be possible to unlock dozens of extras, make RDR a fairly long-lived title. Mind you: if you play it linearly, it can be completed in less than eight to ten hours. If, as mentioned, you are committed to discovering all the secrets, then things change a little. Sore points with regard to the graphic aspect: unfortunately this sector turns out to be poor and not in line with the latestme productions for Ps2. Well, to be honest, not even with the penultimate ones. RDR aesthetically resembles the first generation titles for the monolith. Poorly defined characters, simple and a little angular polygonal models, clean but not excellent backdrops, an unsatisfying overview for eyes accustomed to very different shows on the consoles of this generation. The ~washed out~ effect adopted by the programmers to give the gamer the feeling of being really in warm environments, complete with a ~video~ rendering of the blurring typical of places excessively beaten by the sun, seems to be a ploy to mask the gaps we just talked about rather than a simple visual effect, although the final result is not bad at all. Xbox vs PS2 As often happens in multiplatform titles, also in the case of Red Dead Revolver the technically preferable version is the one for the Microsoft console: a double (30 vs 60 fps) and more stable frame rate, better graphic effects and a more appreciable cleaning of the textures are the points in favor of the Xbox edition, without forgetting significantly faster loading. Similarly, the sound side is in favor of the Bill Gates platform, with most of the sound effects having twice as many variations compared to the Sony monolith. A further advantage should also be mentioned the presence of an exclusive and unpublished showdown level and an additional multiplayer mode, Coliseum, not present on Ps2. Finally, it should be borne in mind that the multiplayer mode proves to be much more appreciable on Xbox, thanks to the aforementioned frame rate that is less subject to collapses during the most agitated phases. On balance therefore, being able to choose, the version for the Microsoft console is certainly preferable from all points of view, so much so that it can deserve a half more vote overall.Andrea Palmisano Conclusions Red Dead Revolver represents the classic game that is destined to remain in the limbo of titles in some ways ~unfinished~. A game that could have been but isn't. In short, a title with great potential but which a not excellent technical realization limits at times. Yet... Yet it may seem absurd, perhaps it will be the setting, perhaps the particular atmosphere that one breathes while playing with it, the fact is that despite the linear and at times repetitive structure and an A.I. of enemies not excellent, the Rockstar title manages to fascinate, to involve the player, proving to be damned fun to play. In short, the defects do not undermine a title that will not fail to make all fans of spaghetti westerns on the big screen happy. Rarely has a game had as much trouble seeing the light as Red Dead Revolver. Repeatedly announced, cancelled, announced again, the title initially produced by Capcom has seen its debut in the panorama of the many productions for Ps2 postponed for months, effectively risking on several occasions to remain in the oblivion of those announced but never published products for reasons that often escape us mere mortals. Fortunately, Angel Studios' latest effort ended up under the watchful eye of Rockstar, who judged it up to their expectations (and those of the public obviously) to the point of deciding the completion of its development and the respective publication.", "date": "2004-06-23", "grade": null}
