{"name": "SBK 08 Superbike World Championship - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sbk-08-superbike-world-championship-recensione.html", "text": "After having developed countless excellent racing games, such as Alfa Romeo Racing, Screamer and Evolution GT, the very Italian software house Milestone is back to have its say on two wheels, with the 2008 edition of the Superbike championship. Experience is not lacking in this sector either, given that there are already three of their titles based on the top motorcycle category. SBK-08 marks the moment of the great return on the most important gaming scene and it certainly does it with quality. We are at the next-gen debut of the most beautiful and powerful bikes on the planet, which, like MotoGP, gather millions of fans all over the world, especially in Italy. SBK-08 is an accurate simulation of 1000cc motorcycles and races, but with the necessary modifications to the settings it can also become a good arcade. We certainly aren't talking about a new Hang On, the basis of the simulation remains intact in any case: it's the handling and the aids to the rider to vary and modify the driving sensitivity and the ease or otherwise of ending up with the bike on the asphalt. Engines warm up... The driving experience in a racing game is the fundamental and by far the most important part to develop, it is the main factor of identification and fun that the player can discover by simulating the driving of a vehicle, in this case powerful Superbike motorcycles. The maneuverability of the latter is certainly not very simple in reality, and on the other hand a video game must be able to offer the right compromise in order not to sacrifice playability on the altar of extreme realism. It is precisely in this aspect that Milestone has hit the mark, skilfully managing to build a decidedly convincing, but above all fun, motorcycle riding model. The emotion in embracing the saddle of a motorcycle and giving gas is indescribable and resides a lot in the sensation of power just under our body, first of all, and secondly in the gratification given when the vehicle reacts exactly as we wish to our solicitations, curves and bends . Unlike other motorcycle games, in SBK-08 setting a curve, braking, decelerating and then reopening the gas is definitely satisfying and fun, above all because if done with precision it leads to concrete results. in SBK-08 setting up a corner, braking, decelerating and then reopening the gas is definitely satisfying and fun Engines warm up... When our gestures imprinted on the joypad manifest themselves in ever better performance in the virtual world, the game is successful: often, however, the feeling of randomness and helplessness dominates one's skill and therefore the gameplay itself. The use of the analogue is impeccable here: a hairpin taken at the right speed allows us to push the button all the way down and see our bike leaning completely to one side, right up to the end of the bend. By acting on the realism settings, it is possible to deactivate many aids for transmission, braking, starting and so on, creating a handling of the vehicle that is much more similar to reality. By setting all the parameters to ~off~, our solicitations must become more sensitive, more cautious, more precise and moderate. On the contrary, the immediate fall is almost guaranteed. Everyone can choose their own favorite settings, trying to create the handling that most enjoys them, thus avoiding the frustration of excessive simulation, or on the contrary the effect of crash cars always on the track. There are many middle ways, and everyone is invited to find their own within a myriad of modifiable options. Tactics are key to winning. Each team has a different mechanic, who always gives new and valuable advice. Precisely to better customize the bike, SBK-08 offers the player a series of tutorials aimed at better teaching the various aspects of riding such as cornering, braking, acceleration and choosing the best trajectories. Milestone has also created a mode very similar to the one appreciated in some Konami football games, called ~scenario~, in which we have to face particular race situations: a head-to-head duel a few laps from the end, the last corner before the straight , a lightning start and so on. There are dozens of them and they are all very well studied, in order to bring the right level of challenge and not be too easy or excessively difficult. The picture of the options is completed by a free mode and the quick race, which starts without being able to decide on the track, team and options. For those who want to get right into the action. Comment SBK-08 is obviously a title for motorcycle enthusiasts, but not only. The great work done by the developers on balancing difficulty and realism offers multiple ways toplay that can be adapted to anyone. For once, driving a virtual motorcycle is also fun and almost as satisfying as a real one. The pre-race part is excellent, with the possibility of setting up your vehicle in many ways and with the help of a trusted technician: the feeling of experiencing the grand prix is amplified by the care placed in many details. Thanks to the online mode and the scenario mode, SBK-08 can virtually last indefinitely. The only pity is that as much care has not been placed on the graphic side, which is not exactly exciting. The scenarios are very bare and the game suffers from too many graphic defects. SBK-08, in its new next-gen incarnation, therefore fails to amaze as it should and as it could have. Xbox 360 - Goals SBK-08 provides the player with the canonical 1000 points, to be earned both by proceeding in the championship mode and by completing the scenario and some online challenges. Proceeding in the game you will get points automatically, but to unlock certain objectives it is necessary to go and look at them, as they are linked to particular situations or events. Better to set the level of realism high, so that the bikes can crash and the pilot retire, otherwise some special objectives will remain forever in the drawer. Extreme simulation for the hard core, soft for beginners SBK-08 offers a high degree of simulation of both physics and artificial intelligence of opponents; after having set each type of parameter regarding the bike's performance, it is also possible to change the general difficulty level, which actually modifies the behavior of the other riders on the track: ~Basic~, ~Arcade~, ~Advanced~, ~Simulation ~ and the last, very difficult, ~Extreme~, dedicated to the true hardcore fans of two wheels. SBK-08 is therefore an extremely level product on multiple steps, and each player can choose the most suitable one on which to lay down, or climb them over time. Increasing realism also means allowing damage to the vehicle, and also enabling the health of the driver, who in more advanced levels can get injured so that he cannot continue the race. During the online races, the host decides the level of difficulty, realism and the various parameters: in the various multiplayer modes that we tried, the game did not seem to suffer from a particularly hindering lag, rather from some small graphic defects on the bikes due to the internet connection: flickering vehicles, disappearing polygons and some inaccuracies on the trajectories. SBK-08 offers a high degree of simulation of both physics and artificial intelligence of opponents Extreme simulation for the hard core, soft for beginners It is precisely on the graphic issue that SBK-08 gives way. Although the models of the Superbikes and the riders are ok, albeit with some textures that aren't too defined, it's the tracks and everything around them that suffer from a certain lack of detail. In the background there are often large bitmaps that collide with the polygonal track, in terms of resolution and definition these two elements are far too distant and the eye notices it immediately. SBK-08 has excellent animations, fluid and realistic, which however suffer from a debug phase that is not 100% perfect: glitches and imperfections are sporadically noticed with a few too many polygons that flicker, appear and reappear out of nowhere. Finally, few effects on the screen, but someone really well done like water during wet races. The rain splashes the screen and slides off, and the track reflects the bikes in a very realistic way. SBK-08 disappoints thinking that it is his next-gen debut: the now accustomed eye of the shrewd player wants to be amazed and satisfied at least when his fingertips. From this point of view, SBK-08 not only does not take any steps forward, but takes some backwards. The audio is captured directly from some real races, as well as the rumble of the various motorcycle models. The sampling is discreet, not so the various background music that accompany us, with a style that is certainly suitable, but too anonymous. The heart of the game is obviously the championship, recreated in great detail both in terms of teams, riders and bikes, and in the pre-race aspects. Tactics are important to win, and must be established in the box even before the qualifying tests. With the help of the mechanic you can go and interact on the bike settings such as suspension, tyres, brakes and much more. It is possible to carry out tests and qualifications, but also to jump directly to the real and pr racesown, set in all the real official tracks of the Superbike championship. The available teams, which use Ducati, Honda CBR 1000RR, Yamaha R1 and Suzuki GSX-R 1000 motorcycles, enjoy all reproduction rights as regards riders and sponsors, thus achieving an excellent degree of realism. The interventions to be prepared on the motorbikes in the garages are many, and concern modifications in all their aspects, even the most minimal and apparently irrelevant. Milestone has spent great resources trying to implement this effectively. Testing our bike after each modification, we are pleased to discover that the changes have had an effect on the targeted aspects, helping to trigger a positive reaction to the desire to infinitely perfect one's racing car.", "date": "2008-07-11", "grade": null}
