{"name": "Star Trek: Elite Force 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-trek-elite-force-3.html", "text": "Heading for crisis Troubled waters on the videogame front for Star Trek enthusiasts: the will of Activision, the publisher who holds the rights to exploit the Star Trek brand in the videogame field, is news of these days to terminate the contract with Viacom, the group that owns Paramount , producer of the show. In recent years, the star of the series seems to have tarnished, and the brand has become much less attractive to the general public, making the economic outlay by Activision unjustified in order to exploit its image: hence the intention of the publisher to renegotiate the contract or even to terminate it and no longer produce Star Trek-inspired video games. Worse still at Ritual: the development and support of Elite Force II seems in doubt  by now we have sadly become accustomed to the fact that a game when it comes out on the market is not one hundred percent completed  making the releases for the next patches uncertain, additional maps or packs. Elite Force is a brand of sure success, the first episode had sold very well: it is therefore logical that Ritual aimed at this sequel to replenish its coffers and be able to devote itself to the other projects it is working on with greater ease: there are already two teams of Ritual working on (high-level) AAA titles, including Counter Strike: Condition Zero, it was therefore unlikely that it would also be able to finance a third team: which is why the Elite Force team was resigned, partly incorporated into the others in part sent home. Which makes the future support of Elite Force II, despite the denials of Ritual, if not uncertain at least not rosy. Mom I lost Voyager! Perhaps you don't notice it immediately but the reference to Voyager and the homonymous television series has disappeared from the title. To understand the reason for this lack, you need to immerse yourself in the story set up by the screenwriters. The game starts from what is practically the last installment of the latest ST Voyager series: we thus find ourselves with the lost spaceship in the delta quadrant captured by a Borg sphere. Also this time it will be Alex Munro, commander of the Hazard Team, who will have to solve the problem, and he will do it in his own way: more with phasers and cannon fire than with oratory and diplomacy. Teleported to the Borg sphere together with his assault team (we will obviously find Tesla and an increasingly bluer Chell) he will succeed during the first mission - which acts as a bit of a prologue to the actual story - to deactivate the force field and free the Voyager who will thus be able to return home after seven long years. Elite Force II follows the deeds of our characters after retirement, or rather after the end of the Voyager series: the Hazard Team will be judged too unorthodox to the methods and standards of the Federation and therefore dissolved: Alex and Tesla - which we discover to have intertwined a relationship  they are forced to split up. Our Munro will then be sent to the proverbial star station forgotten by all to train Klingon rookies: two years go by and it seems that Munro's career is all destined to run out between holographic bridges and study rooms until fate puts a hand in it and a certain Captain Jean-Luc Picard doesn't happen to pass by those parts. Picard, noticing Munro's qualities, understands that he is just the man he needs on the Enterprise: having said that, the Hazard team is reassembled with a lot of Tuvok again to act as ~brain~ and plan the missions. On board the most famous spaceship in the fleet we will immediately be called to action: Picard received an s.o.s. from the USS Dallas, adrift without a crew after the attack of a strange and unknown alien life form, and tasks Munro and his men to board the wreck to investigate Let's avoid spoiling the surprises that the plot will be able to reserve for the player in the course of the story and let's analyze the Activision title a little more closely. Like the first episode, the Quake III engine will always move the virtual world prepared by the designers. Engine suitably modified to adapt it to the current videogame panorama, of course: thanks to Uber, the system developed by Ritual to improve the animations and physics of the world. The result is very pleasant graphics, adequate for the times even if not striking: able to run on older computers without jerks or hesitations. The detail is very good as are the textures, especially those of the characters, a little more stereotyped than those of the environment. The levels are well thought out but rarely manage to impress with complexity or variety, generally resulting very linear and sometimes evenboring  especially when repetitive tasks are imposed on the player. Similar speech for the sound: excellent sound effects, one of the best 3D environments heard in a game, but music that, while echoing the typical Star Trek themes, is a bit anonymous. Who resents! As in any self-respecting Star Trek game, known faces could not be missing: or rather known voices, given that the graphics engine takes care of the faces! Both Picard and Tuvok will be able to enjoy their voices, performed as usual by Patrick Stewart and Tim Russ. Avid Trekkies may also recognize many other voices from the 24th century universe: Dwight Schultz, Jeffrey Combs, Tony Todd, J.G. Hertzler, Robert O'Reilly, Martha Hackett. Set phasers to kill! Moving on to the gameplay, the sore points also begin: sorry to admit it but the magic has not been repeated. The alchemical balance of the first episode has been lost: the cinematic sequences  made with the game engine  are less cinematographic, less evocative and less integrated with the rest of the game: that feeling of being inside has been lost an interactive TV show opting for a more classic setting, conforming to the videogame canons of the most classic first-person shooter. The mechanics will always be the same repeated throughout the missions of the game: briefing on board the enterprise, mission, cutscene, return on board and so on. In short, a more predictable narrative scheme for the videogame medium, but certainly less engaging and innovative. The actual game sequences are decisively driven towards action, relegating the use of gray matter to simple absolutely non-functional appearances: linear levels, devoted to pure action, increasingly weighed down by a tendency towards worrying repetitiveness (at the fourth consecutive sequence and at a short distance of ~closed door, go down the corridor, activate the switch~ we invoked a black out that would turn off the computer!). In a nutshell: a game design of rare flatness, without the slightest spark of genius, or at least of inventiveness that allows Elite Force II to stand out from the mass, from the canon, from the unwritten but too faithfully followed rules of the good FPS. Like those beautiful girls, moderately nice, but so dull and predictable that you prefer someone less pretty but more interesting, lively, ~vital~. The numerous weapons are incapable of innovating the clichs of the genre, limiting themselves to accumulating variations on an already heard theme: the tricoder itself, the only real novelty of the game, is used little and badly, resulting in the end as a useless accessory: the only required ability is that of trigger easy and quick. Again with the tricoder we will be forced to solve some simple puzzles: it is a pity that the latter are impromptu and totally unrelated to the rest of the game. Finally, a positive note from the multiplayer, solid and well implemented (and God forbid, coming from the developers of Counter Strike: Condition Zero), to which we will dedicate a separate special. First contact For a few weeks now (July 2003) the new Star Trek series, entitled Enterprise, has also been on Italian television screens (on those of La7, to be precise), which collects the burdensome baton of Voyager (one of the most successful and loved series since of the Next Generation). Despite the presence of Scott Bakula (Quantum Leap) as the protagonist (he plays Jonathan Archer, first captain of the first Enterprise) the series has proved to be a tremendous flop, criticized by the public, fans and critics. Yet the basic idea could have been stimulating: to follow the adventures of the first Enterprise, when humans took their first steps in the universe and made their first timid encounters with all those races we know well: Vulcans, Klingons and so on. Are the criticisms founded? You just have to check for yourself. Comment It's hard to pan the Elite Force II across the board. It is a title worthy of attention, well done, excellently cared for in all its aspects: there is no element of Elite Force that deserves furious criticism, indeed there are many more positive aspects. Not the gameplay though: the gaming experience is almost frustrating in its flatness. Totally devoid not only of originality or innovations that allow it to get out of the most predictable tracks of the genre but also of just a minimum flicker that makes the game memorable, addictive, adrenaline orat least funny. A professional product: well done but soulless, heartless, without entrails that could involve the player, immerse the subject in a parallel universe from which one does not want to leave. Recommended for Star Trek fans  but only if they manage to get over a flat and uninspired game design  and for those who have never picked up an FPS: the latter will find a canonical product, a sort of summa of what the genre has said up to now, mediocre if the adjective didn't sound stroncante: instead if you are looking for something that knows how to stand out from the average and get out of it, it is better to go elsewhere. Pros: Good graphics, even on underpowered computers Great sound effects Multiplayer Cons: Uninspired Predictable Unrewarding Three years after Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force Activision summons us back to the bridge to take up phasers and tricoders and immerse ourselves in a universe populated by aliens with pointy ears, blind spaceship pilots and ship captains in pajamas. Allow us this tip of harmless irony: by now Star Trek is an authentic monument of pop culture, an immovable phenomenon from the collective imagination and to which countless essays and studies have been dedicated. The Trekkie universe seems to know no breaks in its continuous expansion: despite the recent audience crises of the new Enterprise series, the disappointing result of the last film, and even some controversy in the videogame side, fans of the most famous science fiction series in the world (Star Wars permitting) they have nothing to complain about: the market never stops churning out new ~objects of desire~ that satisfy their hunger for Star Trek. Like this Elite Force II: sequel to what is still considered the best game inspired by ST, the new FPS from Activision inevitably has to deal with its predecessor. The prequel, shaped by those geniuses of the Raven, was one of the first titles to use the then futuristic Quake III engine: and it did it very well knowing how to build an engaging and beautifully narrated story around it. The perfect blend of action, puzzles and filmed interludes made the Raven title very similar to a real episode of the show with the added value of an extremely engaging play experience (without particular flashes but with solid and perfectly thought-out gameplay): all this has made Elite Force a milestone in the history of cinematic exploitation. The responsibility inherited from Ritual with this second episode is therefore not light: it is, in fact, up to the authors of Heavy Metal F.a.k.k. 2, Sin and Blair Which Project 3 the difficult task of repeating the success of Elite Force. But apparently nobody in the Ritual house suffers from inferiority complexes and the differences from the first episode are immediately noticeable, starting from the title", "date": "2003-07-10", "grade": null}
