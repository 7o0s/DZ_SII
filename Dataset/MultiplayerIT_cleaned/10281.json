Over time Phantasy Star Online has undergone several transformations, eventually taking the form of Phantasy Star Universe on PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2. Phantasy Star Portable is a kind of port of this latest incarnation of the franchise, but at the same time it is even a sequel, inheriting its strengths and weaknesses in one way or another. Space dungeon-crawling The closest video game example we could make is Diablo: with Blizzard's masterpiece Phantasy Star Portable in fact shares a structure divided between single-player and multiplayer but concentrated, at the same time, on the simple growth of our alter ego and its equipment. The creation of the character is very enjoyable, the modifiable parameters are numerous and include clothing, hairstyle, complexion and hair color, height and weight: the player can choose between the typical races of the saga, more or less suitable for various fighting styles ( for example, Cast androids are excellent snipers but bad wizards) and complete the genesis of his character by assigning him a name to undertake the two proposed game modes, offline or online. As for the first mode, we will find ourselves completing various missions on behalf of the GUARDIANS, dealing with a mysterious saboteur and the return of the SEED alien threat. The story, set after the conclusion of Phantasy Star Universe, is rather disappointing and lacking in depth, told through the dialogues between the characters, represented by questionable static polygonal models rather than artwork, as in the vast majority of similar productions. Before starting a mission, we move from room to room through a menu to shop, assemble the party, customize our character and prepare him for battle. At this point you are thrown into a completely three-dimensional area, divided into various areas, where our only goal will be to massacre all hostile life forms, collecting the money and objects released or contained in various containers. The interaction with the environment is minimal: you can't jump or climb slopes, at most you can collect the keys needed to open the gates to continue exploring. A very basic and at the same time addictive mechanic: the variety of equipment is incredible, the types of usable weapons range from single swords to spears, from pistols to double machine guns, there really is something for all tastes and each weapon requires a different approach in its use and execution of combos and special attacks. The player is thus involved in a spiral of systematic exploration and destruction of enemies, in search of increasingly bizarre and effective weapons to show off, perhaps in multiplayer. Till boredom do us part During Story Mode, the player can be accompanied by various characters controlled by a really bad Artificial Intelligence: the group will constantly behave like kamikazes, rarely healing themselves, without running away or avoiding enemy assaults... really frustrating, especially when already for the our own business we find ourselves managing a lock-on system that is nothing short of terrible and the often inconvenient camera. Fortunately, Phantasy Star Portable offers features that make clashes less frustrating, first of all a simple scrolling menu that can be called up by pressing the Circle key, which allows us to change weapons or use objects on the fly. Of course, Phantasy Star Portable shines in multiplayer: in local or Ad Hoc the game becomes much more enjoyable in the company of human players and repeating the missions in order to recover the rarest and most powerful objects is certainly more pleasant, at least until the lag makes the game sessions slow-motion or boredom does not come. From this point of view, Phantasy Star Portable comes out defeated by the merciless comparison with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite: the Capcom product is not only more enjoyable when played online, but also technically much more advanced. If the models of characters, enemies and equipment in Phantasy Star Portable offer a remarkable variety, the same cannot be said of their woody animations and the discreetdetail level. The locations, on the other hand, suffer from considerable pop-up even over short distances and are reduced to a sequence of open ~rooms~, connected by short paths, surrounded by rather flat and anonymous backdrops, from this point of view the porting it would have deserved some graphic tweaks in order to make it much more attractive.", "date": "2009-12-29", "grade": "6.5"}
