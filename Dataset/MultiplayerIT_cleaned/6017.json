{"name": "I signori delle ombre", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/156663-endless-legend-shadows-i-signori-delle-ombre.html", "text": "The genre of strategic 4x (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) has always exerted a great fascination on PC users. Titles like Civilization are among the platform's best sellers, with players dedicating hundreds, if not thousands of hours of their lives to them. Could it be for this reason that at the arrival of each expansion there are very few people who complain? Why in perspective are these limited investments for a very large amount of play? When producing a new 4x it is therefore a good idea to plan expansions, working on the requests of that part of the community that has proved to be more active. This is what Amplitude Studios is doing with the excellent Endless Legend, which has been enriched in these days by the second paid add-on pack, Shadows, which fills a lack of the base game by significantly altering some aspects of the gameplay. The core of the expansion is the addition of game systems related to espionage, enriched by a faction master in stealth techniques, the Forgotten. This is no small addition, because by installing Shadows a whole series of behaviors must be changed, on pain of defeat. We reviewed Shadows, the second paid expansion of Endless Legend. Let's see how it is spy vs. spy The average Endless Legend player knows that the first rounds of the game are the most relaxed and that there is no need to immediately raise the defenses, unless you have had the misfortune of being surrounded by enemies. Well, that's not the case anymore, because armies got the ability to pillage cities and hence, you need to build troops now, otherwise you risk running out of resources. But this is the tip of the iceberg, because cities are the center of espionage techniques and have therefore undergone a whole series of additions necessary to integrate the new mechanics. The troops that can sneak into opposing cities are the heroes, who have different actions once they penetrate behind enemy lines. For example, they can reduce the visibility of the city's territories, or go to slow down scientific production, or still tamper with industrial production, obtain scientific discoveries, affect the city government and so on. The risk is that of being discovered, but the game is worth the candle, given the advantages that can be drawn from it. It goes without saying that a sabotaged city is easier to conquer than one in full force. Obviously it is possible to defend against infiltrations, but at the price of sacrificing part of the production. The diplomacy panel has also been updated to include espionage-related topics, such as prisoner swap bargaining. In short, each side of the game presents new features, more than what happened with the previous expansion: Guardians. The forgotten ones All factions feature the new espionage options, but the masters of the genre are obviously the Forsaken adherents, purpose-built around the new gameplay. They are a people of assassins, not very strong in combat, but capable of using the shadows to their advantage. Their specific units: the assassins, the mists and the predators; they are skilled manipulators. For example, assassins aren't very strong in close combat, but they can kill by striking from behind, or they can stun opponents by weakening them. The mists, on the other hand, can change their state, turning into fog, so as to become very difficult to hit. Finally, the predators are skilled crossbowmen armed with poisoned darts. Using them means changing the approach you have in combat, especially against stronger units in frontal combat. As it should be, you need to develop some lateral thinking to make the most of this faction. So lovers of direct confrontations better keep it away with a stick. What is Endless Legend? If you are interested in learning more about Endless Legend, feel free to read our review of the base game. Then move on to the review of the first expansion, Guardians, which adds very different content than Shadows. In this way you will have the complete picture of the game. Is it worth it or not? Summing up Shadows, our judgment can only be positive. What has fully convinced us is above all his intelligently modifying the gameplay by adding a new level of complexity, but without destroying the game balance. The most dedicated players will certainly benefit from it, thanks to the amount of new content, while the doubters may find in Shadows the leverage they were missing to buy Endless Legend and play it. As mentioned, the only ones we recommendto evaluate the purchase well are the lovers of direct action, that is, who do not like to act furtively. In reality, Shadows does not destroy the previous gameplay, but complements it, so the game system as a whole remained standing. In short, only if you despise the world of espionage with all your strength is it the case that you look elsewhere.", "date": "2015-09-25", "grade": null}
