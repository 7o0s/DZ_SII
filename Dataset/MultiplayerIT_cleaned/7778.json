{"name": "Kaiju Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kaiju-wars-recensione.html", "text": "The kaiju theme is well known to fans of Japanese productions, with the first film of the genre released way back in 1954. We are obviously talking about Godzilla, the progenitor of an enormous amount of giant monsters who in turn invaded and trampled the largest cities in the world. Japan with the devastating power of an atomic bomb. In recent years the genre has also undergone a substantial boost in the West with Pacific Rim, which has further expanded the audience of fans of a certain type of representation, while on the video game front this narrative has been represented quite often, just think for example of the recent 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. Well, the guys at Foolish Mortals Games have seen fit to combine their passion for classic films with kaiju, the strategic genre and a retro style that incorporates the color palettes of 8-bit platforms to give life to their latest title: here is the Kaiju Wars review. Structure Kaiju Wars, the album illustrated with the campaign missions The main menu of Kaiju Wars comes in the form of an 80s command post, with a series of monitors at the top, a few devices and a sort of sticker album at the bottom. Where the former allow you to access a curious archive of vintage footage, adjust the (few) options available, try your hand at the map editor or the local versus mode, the album can be ~flipped~ to reveal the sequences of intermezzo and the campaign missions. Composed of six chapters for a total of over sixty stages between main and optional, for a duration of at least fifteen hours (depending on how many times you have to repeat the more difficult levels), the game campaign will see us take on the role of administrators of some cities threatened precisely by the arrival of the kaiju. The monsters are not very numerous, just four, but they are virtually unstoppable creatures: a clone of King Kong, a cross between a wolf and Godzilla, a variation on the theme of Rodan and a sort of gigantic snake-dragon. Within scenarios of very small dimensions, characterized by an isometric view and a graphic style which, as mentioned, takes up that of the era of 8-bit platforms, our task will be to defeat the monsters by resetting their full-bodied bar health or, alternatively, keep them busy long enough for our reference scientist, Dr. Wagner, to develop a serum that forces them to flee. By unlocking the objectives of each mission we will be able to earn medals which can then be spent on upgrading the troops , so as to at least try to reduce the enormous gap between the effectiveness of our defensive systems and the unstoppable fury of the giant monsters, which in the final missions of each chapter is even exaggerated, greatly expanding the times without however the possibility of speeding up significantly the development of turns or to save the game: a rather frustrating aspect. Gameplay Kaiju Wars, a monster and a bunch of planes trying to slow it down The strategic gameplay of Kaiju Wars is the result of a very particular balance: the enemies we will have to face from time to time are few but very powerful, while our military vehicles have rather limited mobility and will be crushed like flies at the first attack, the which will present us with tactical decisions based mostly on the objectives of the monsters, which tend to hit the buildings that provide the money needed for the production of weapons each turn. The movement of the kaiju is predictable and it is the interface itself that tell us what could happen in the boxes that surround them, but there are a thousand obstacles to prevent us from any offensive maneuvers, available only in the boxes adjacent to the monster: the inability for vehicles to move on water or a potentially deadly fire, for example. Kaiju Wars, the city devastated under the blows of monsters Since the killing of Dr. Wagner arises as the condition for game over, in the event that the kaiju get too close to her laboratory, we will have the possibility of transferring it by land with a convoy, however agreeing to pause at this juncture the production of science points necessary for the creation of the aforementioned serum capable of repelling the invasion. To slow down the advance of the kaiju we will be able to count on tanks, planes, missile launchers but also special weapons that require several shifts to be prepared and include a ship that transforms into a robot (but what a bad cutscene, though), a hovercraft, a laser, a freezing ray and more. Some special cards will give us more options than yourno in turn, but also the monsters will be able to draw from their deck and thus obtain advantages that are sometimes frankly exaggerated, capable of canceling any possible counter-move and determining our inevitable defeat. Graphics and sound Kaiju Wars, the short cutscenes are sometimes enjoyable, other times they leave a lot to be desired As mentioned, the graphics of Kaiju Wars are characterized by a distinctly 80s style, especially as regards the very limited color palettes. It is not clear what is the result of this inspiration and what instead depends on a productive constraint, the fact is that visually the result is certainly peculiar and boasts a lot of character, but it also shows the side of really ugly solutions, especially on the front of the animations. The sound sector probably takes advantage of this type of characterization better, and so the chiptune-style music of the game damn enters the head without wanting to leave it, accompanying what we see on the screen in a very apt way. Only the sampled effects are essential, as expected for such a product.", "date": "2022-04-29", "grade": "7.0"}
