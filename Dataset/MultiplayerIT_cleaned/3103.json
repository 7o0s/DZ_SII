But is it really reality that he is observing? There is no time to ask questions, however: her girlfriend, Wren, has been kidnapped by a disturbing creature, so we will have to use all our resources to save her . As? Starting from the piano of his old house and exploring the various places of a mysterious scenario, inhabited by characters apparently suspended between this world and another. It is a real dream that we will have to deal with in Neversong, as part of a campaign that offers platform, adventure and even metroidvania mechanics as we solve simple environmental puzzles, eliminate annoying spiders wielding a large club, jump from one handhold to another, unlock new abilities and awaken the frightening bosses that separate us from the final confrontation with the monster responsible for all of this. Gameplay Originally titled Once Upon a Coma, Neversong immediately presents a particular gameplay, characterized by physics at times very light and inconsistent, at times solid and convincing: the game's author's attempt to plausibly represent a dream world full of characters that move like puppets and seem a bit at the mercy of the wind, only to then express a certain weight when it comes to enhancing the impacts during fights and boss fights. The contrast displaces a little but certainly has its own reason, in connection with the disturbing and peculiar atmospheres of the adventure, which in certain situations pushes us to carry out unseemly actions (feeding a plump but obnoxious boy to a giant spider ?) but then somehow self-absolves itself thanks to some narrative device, describing the progress of the story in rhyme and thus helping to immerse us further in its settings. Basically, the situations are those of a traditional action platform, as demonstrated by the simple controls at our disposal: an invisible virtual stick to move, a pressure on the right side of the screen to jump and a small button for attacking. The system works reasonably well but tends not to guarantee the necessary precision in some phases, when for example you have to jump from one ~pendulum~ to another with perfect timing. Fortunately, the game supports Bluetooth controllers, which greatly improve the experience. For the rest, beyond the jumps and the occasional fight in Neversong you explore a lot, operate elevators and switches, but above all you unlock new abilities that allow you to overcome certain obstacles and therefore visit portions of the map that were inaccessible up to that moment. Nothing particularly original or complicated, given that the duration of the campaign doesn't go beyond three hours, but it's the style that makes the difference. Technical realization To give the idea of a dreamlike, disturbing and mysterious world, the author of Neversong has made precise stylistic and chromatic choices, representing the characters as funny zombies who move like puppets (taking advantage of this expedient also to save on animations , apparently) within an angular, often dark scenario, full of NPCs with whom to interact in some way to complete the missions that will lead us from time to time closer to solving the final enigma. It comes by itself that an experience of this type, which bases most of its charm on atmospheres, needed an adequate sound design. Here, from this point of view we can speak of a goal half achieved: some pieces of the soundtrack are certainly valid and inspired, others betray a bit of superficiality. Instead, we appreciated the narration in English (subtitled in Italian) of the cutscene, which undoubtedly adds something more to this strange, peculiar journey through dreams.", "date": "2020-05-11", "grade": "7.5"}
