We did it on the first, original release when the title was only available on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, we did it again when Rockstar released the game on the newly released new generation of consoles, and we're ready to go back now that the The world's best selling free roaming has finally decided to reach the PC market. It's true: it lasted longer than we would have imagined, but such a long wait has definitely paid off since this edition is, without risk of contradiction, the best incarnation of the exceptional bestseller. Rockstar, having stated this on multiple occasions, has truly learned from its mistakes by leaving behind all the chaos and drama of the PC port of Grand Theft Auto IV, delivering us this time a product that works perfectly; of course it has some bugs here and there as one would expect from a production of this size, but the optimization of the engine is really noteworthy and the incompatibilities seem to be close to zero. But before launching into our analysis, it is essential to make two remarks: if you have reached this point without knowing anything about GTA V, our advice is to follow the links written above to learn more about the game and read our evaluation at three hundred and sixty degrees. In fact, in this writing we will focus on the technical analysis of the PC version, on its graphic settings and on the results achieved by the game engine, then leaving some space for the video editor and director mode, the only truly unpublished content of this port. Grand Theft Auto V on PC is the epitome of Rockstar free roaming How to use your own music? Getting your music into the PC version of GTA V is super simple. Simply copy the files to the My Documents/Rockstar Games/GTA V/User Music folder and at that point we will find it again in the game. The supported formats are MP3, M4A and WMA but the songs must be DRM-free, i.e. free to be played on any device. At that point, once GTA is started, the one called Self Radio will also appear among the various radio stations. If not, just go to the Audio options menu and select ~Quick/full scan of music~ to have the game recognize the songs. Also from this menu it is also possible to choose the ~Personal radio mode~ to ensure that your songs are played sequentially, randomly or with the same style as the other radios complete with commercials and dialogues between the speakers inserted automatically by the game . Lots of stuff on screen! In addition to natively supporting the Xbox 360, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers, plus all the various compatible pads on the market and even some steering wheels, GTA V for PC perfectly supports the combination of mouse and keyboard, allowing for a complete configuration of the keys and the various sensitivities, as well as allowing the change of the control system used on the fly. When using the specific controls of the computer, the game automatically sets the aim completely free and, needless to say, especially with GTA Online, this control method returns precision and vigor in shootings, especially when using the visual in first person, which dramatically increase the playability and frenzy of this chapter of the series. Not only did the management of the sprint and the race drive us crazy which, with the basic settings, is rather difficult to manage with the keyboard and will need some tweaking to work at its best. But where the title reaches the pinnacle of customization is in the graphic settings: GTA V for PC allows you to really go deep as regards the scalability of the graphic engine. From the various anti-aliasing filters, to the density and variety of populations and cars, passing through the quality of textures, shaders, shadows, reflections, water, particles, grass and so on. Do not miss the tessellation that can be set on three different levels, ambient occlusion, post-processing effects, the version of DirectX to use, as well as a series of advanced settings for managing shadows and rendering distance. As already seen in Grand Theft Auto IV, tinkering with these settings modifies the occupied video memory indicator in real time, always clearly visible in the options and which represents a rough indication of the load on your GPU. As if this were not enough, it is also possible to start a benchmark on the fly which shows in sequence a series of scenes from the game in ever-changing environments, times of day and weather conditions, showingThe frame rate reached was fixed on the screen, so as to allow the player to get an immediate idea of the quality set and the fluidity achieved. Whatever the settings are set, once the title is started, what strikes with disarming violence is the number of frames per second that are fired from the monitor. Unless your computer is in fact heavily below the recommended requirements, GTA V for PC amazes first of all for its incredible fluidity since the frame rate is completely unlocked and, as long as you have Vertical Sync deactivated, it will not happen rarely even touching 80-90 frames per second, returning a feeling of play and precision to the commands which, on certain occasions, thanks to the first person view, even reminded us of the various incarnations of Call of Duty. To all this we must also add the incredible visual distance reached by this port which, especially during sunsets, sunrises and perhaps while driving a helicopter or a jet, is able to offer breathtaking views that they are lost as far as the eye can see with minimal pop-up and pop-in effects (which are still present anyway) and practically devoid of that mist on the horizon typical of the console versions. Among other things, the game allows you to go quietly towards 4K resolutions with full support for dual and triple monitor configurations and 3D. However, it must be said that during our extensive test we encountered various ~stuttering~ phenomena (when the game visibly slows down) and obviously the frame rate is extremely dependent on the game situations experienced and it happened on several occasions that during the most crowded scenes or in particular phases of the day, especially when there are many light effects, the number of frames per second drops drastically. It is possible that on this front Rockstar can still improve something in the coming months and we are convinced that the patches that will be released will go in this direction. Does this editor have to be distributed? Many are wondering if the video editor and director mode will remain exclusive to the PC version and Rockstar has not yet released an official statement on the matter. What we can say, based on the information we gathered during our exclusive test of the game a few weeks ago, is that the editor will also be released later on next-gen and old-gen consoles with several changes to the interface to make it more easily usable with the joypad. When it is not known and furthermore the recorded clips will obviously take into account the processing capabilities of the platform used and this means that on consoles the resolutions and the frame rate will naturally be limited. Editing galore As for the contents, as also written at the beginning of the article, the PC version of GTA V is in all respects identical to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One editions, including the first person view. Also as regards GTA Online, we are faced with the same, identical offer, shots included and it is possible, at the time of the first start, to transfer your character from any other version (old-gen included) to the computer one without losing the 'original. If we really want to be specific, this new iteration of Grand Theft Auto V contains about two hours of never-before-seen music, commercials and radio speaker dialogue, all poured into the new radio station The Lab. It is what is under the hood that has been boosted. Not only on a technical and graphic level, but through the support for MODs, with already the first minor experiments that can be downloaded from the Internet, the possibility of uploading your own royalty-free songs and then being listened to in the game and above all the incredible video editor, with attached director mode which, we are convinced, will amaze us in the months to come for what players will be able to create and distribute. Accessible from anywhere in the game, the editor allows you to work on clips recorded in the game, trim them, fill them with effects and filters, add text overlays, insert songs from the game and a whole host of sound effects and background music. atmosphere working on the timeline in an extremely intuitive and simple way, approaching what can be seen with the various Adobe Premiere and Final Cut but with an extremely lower level of complexity (and obviously versatility). To then export everything to your hard drive and upload it to both the Rockstar Social Club and YouTube. In the latter case without the risk of receiving reports on the popular video distribution platform since the publisher has already agreed with the copyright holdersproduction to allow the distribution of all the movies made with his game and to ensure that the licensed music is freely usable. Recording clips is very simple and can be done in two ways. The classic one allows the start of recording with the F1 key and its interruption with F3. The system will automatically divide the clips into segments of about thirty seconds, connecting them together. The second possibility allows you to start a sort of buffering that keeps in memory, without actually writing them to the disk, about the last thirty seconds of gameplay. At that point, just press F3 to actually record the desired piece of the game. In this way, a bit like what happens with the various sharing systems of the new generation consoles, it will be possible to play freely and only after something incredible has happened, to record it on the fly, without having to fill the hard disk with useless clips in an attempt to catch the best moment. But the real treat developed by Rockstar jumps out when you try to work on editing individual clips. In this mode it is not only possible to work with a chisel to shorten the videos and work on the speed of editing but also to modify the camera in real time by moving the shot regardless of how the recording was actually made. Obviously the possibilities are not infinite but we guarantee you that this freedom granted in the editing phase allows you to achieve excellent results in an instant. As if this were not enough, the director mode comes into play which allows you to set a whole series of values on the fly, from the location to the weather conditions, the day-night cycle and the police, selecting the hero you want to play among the dozens made available and which also allow you to command special animals and costumes that must first be unlocked in the single player campaign. In this way we will be able to create real scenes to record in a moment and then import them into the editor. There is also a series of tricks that can be used with this mode such as infinite energy, gravity reduction or a series of explosive or flammable projectiles. It's natural that for the more 'normal' gamer this is a practically useless addition, but we can't help but appreciate the incredible work Rockstar has done to offer an option that seems to perfectly meet the characteristics of those who play on PC.", "date": "2015-04-20", "grade": "9.7"}
