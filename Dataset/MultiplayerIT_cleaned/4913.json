As mentioned, the ~offline~ campaign is gratifying: someone may turn up their noses at the fact that we have to alternate at the head of the three factions (Space Marines, Orks and Eldar), but basically this ~Call of Duty~ choice was studied at the table. The new Relic title is in fact heavily oriented towards multiplayer and the single player mode, not without some poetic license (there will be missions very similar to those of the second chapter, situations that cannot currently be replicated online), is essentially a gym for challenges with other players. The hard and pure will not appreciate the new gameplay, also penalized by the lack of content M'OBA or not M'OBA? There are several question marks that the public beta has not managed to dispel, and the first of all at the bottom is the one regarding the future development of Dawn of War. Three factions on the table seem too few, although a sacred monster like StarCraft has ~recently~ demonstrated that quantity does not make quality. Yet a little bitterness remains in the mouth above all turning away and looking at the offer of the progenitor, born in 2004, who at least also added the Chaos Marines to the list of selectable races. The most striking thing, however, is the presence of a single game mode, called the core, which is taken from the MOBA universe. In fact, in order to win the game it is not necessary to eliminate the opponent, but instead it is necessary to pull down an energy nucleus, placed in a critical point of the map, not before having eliminated two support structures that defend it: in order, the shields and turrets. It is not necessary to knock down all those present: just open a line that reaches the nucleus to be able to launch the definitive attack. This is one of the aspects that risks creating more confusion, since many believe that with this choice the Canadian developers have directed their latest effort towards an exaggeratedly arcade drift. Suspicions also confirmed by other clues, such as the absence of cover (now there are only outposts in which to keep the units, but which return to the mercy of the adversaries as soon as they leave), the less importance given to suppression fire, the absence of details such as morale and experience that made both the protection of the territory and that of the health of the individual units important. The role of defensive turrets has also been drastically reduced: the only race that can count on ~traditional~ structures is that of the Orks, who in any case can build a maximum of five. The Eldar have portals that can provide bonuses to nearby troops, but are unable to defend themselves; the Space Marines however have nothing approaching a support building. Tin elite The introduction of the Elite units has shifted the focus of the gameplay because, if used ~correctly~ (i.e. by exploiting their various active skills which, moreover, increase with experience), these super soldiers, especially those of a high level, significantly shift the balance of battle. Yet it is not entirely correct to declassify the standard units as mere cannon fodder: at the moment there are some inevitable balancing errors (for example the Ork Helicopter seemed to us basically useless, and even the Pikkoletta elite did not prove to be equal to the majestic Lady Solaria of the Blood Ravens), but each has its own dignity especially when related to the number of resources needed to produce it. It will soon be understood that the listening points never seem to be able to satisfy the player's war needs, at least in the initial stages of the game; in fact, things change as the playing time increases, based on the rule called Escalation. Following this logic, in the first ten minutes of the game the player recovers 25% from the death of his units; from the tenth to the twentieth the percentage drops to 15, but both the amount of resources collected by the listening points and the health of the buildings increase by 50%. From 20 to half an hour, the recovery of resources from killing your own units is further reduced, but the extraction rate doubles, until you reach the final level where there is no longer any benefit in slaughtering your own men. but on the other hand the resistance of the buildings and the resources arrive at stellar values. These dynamics, in the ideas of the designers, should prevent players from spending an eternity waiting to fully upgrade the army and then conclude the speech in pbeaten geese. In practice, the effects that have arisen are not so strong, but it is still clear that, in terms of multiplayer, Dawn of War III is quite different from the first. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing: what's shocking is rather the malice in presenting a product which, even the least circumspect understands, is clearly incomplete and designed to be updated for a fee. Since the press release, paid elite units have appeared ( 0.99 to be precise), which are added to those normally unlockable with the skulls earned with victories. Given the non-definitive nature of the product, it was not possible for us to understand whether they were mere cosmetic variants (which would be acceptable, albeit with gritted teeth) or real enhanced versions, with regrettable pay-to-win drifts. Beyond this albeit important observation, one cannot fail to point out that the lack of the elementary unit extermination mode in the presence of only eight maps is a decidedly low blow for a title that is offered at the price of  59.99.", "date": "2017-04-25", "grade": "7.8"}
