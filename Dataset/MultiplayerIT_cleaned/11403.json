{"name": "Park or Die", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/park-or-die.html", "text": "An undercover police officer, who must get accepted into a gang and find the evidence needed to carry out a raid. Does it remind you of anything? Let's also say that Park or Die, in terms of plot, owes a lot to The Fast and the Furious, where we have the protagonist who pretends to be an illegal racing enthusiast to collect evidence on a group of thieves. In this case, let's say that racing is a bit of a side element compared to maneuvers, and it is precisely in maneuvers that this new HandyGames title finds its dimension. The most characterizing trait of Park or Die, in fact, is the difficulty with which to maneuver the car... it's just that it's not clear whether it's something the developers wanted or not! From the start screen you can access the different modes: ~story~, ~stunt park~, ~slalom challenge~, ~drift challenge~ and ~destruction challenge~. Completing the first one unlocks all the others, through an already tested ~reward~ structure, which has always proved effective in increasing the longevity of a video game. After a short tutorial, we will find ourselves taking the first steps to introduce ourselves into a gang, an operation that develops from level to level, through a series of GTA-style dialogues that make a plot flow that is certainly absurd and at times demented, but at the same time well written and engaging. To complete each internship, objectives must be achieved that are different each time: in some cases there is a predefined path to follow, passing over some signs placed on the asphalt; other times we will have to carry out precision parking within a time limit. There will rarely be racing, but even in those cases it will be a matter of respecting a timer, trying to avoid any unwanted collisions. Furthermore, at a certain point, our car will be equipped with two important upgrades: the ability to perform ~drifts~, i.e. to steer by squeezing to dedicate less time and space to manoeuvres, and the classic ~nitro~, which gives us the car a searing acceleration but only for a few seconds. The absolute protagonist of Park or Die is not so much the story behind the game, nor the missions, but the control system. For better or for worse, depending on the interpretations, the controls designed by the developers have a very heavy influence on the experience, making it more or less cumbersome depending on our ability to assimilate them well. The movement of the car, in fact, takes place in a context relative to the screen: this means that if the car proceeds to the right and we press the joystick up, we will steer upwards; if the car moves to the left and we press the joystick to the right, it will start to reverse. The technical realization of the game is really excellent, both in terms of quality and quantity. Of course, the drawing of the characters during the dialogues could have been better, as well as the sprites could have been a bit more sophisticated; but we have a series of well-made locations, very ~populated~ and characterized by a certain level of detail. And our car deforms and gets damaged depending on the bumps... It's a pity that the sound sector is not up to the graphics, with a series of MIDI music of decent quality but which adds nothing to the action and much they often smack of ~heard it before~. PRO Technically excellent Very original basic idea Lots of levels and lots of modes AGAINST ...which often make the action frustrating A huge wasted potential", "date": "2008-05-23", "grade": "S.V."}
