This time, however, we start from the end, or from the discovery of the relic of the moment, the ultimate goal of every self-respecting explorer, since the time of his cinema colleague famous for the hat and the whip. The object in question is the Mirror of Smoke, an ancient relic kept in the heart of the South American jungle and brought to light by our heroine in the company of some not too friendly guys who, as usual, they show themselves ready to forcibly steal the loot from the protagonist. So far we could speak of normal administration for Miss Croft were it not that the desecration of the object will open the doors to events that are nothing short of extraordinary. Supernatural archaeology If ~do not touch~ is clearly written in museum cases around the world, there will be a reason and a lesson in this regard is offered to us by Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. Indeed, the recovery of the Mirror of Smoke causes the awakening of the ancient and evil deity Xolotl together with the warrior Totec who had imprisoned himself and the demon for three millennia thanks to the ancient relic. Needless to underline Xolotl's bad mood and his desire for revenge on the whole world, it will therefore be up to Lara and her improvised companion who has just risen to find a way to prevent the success of his evil intentions. During the game we will have to chase Xolotl along an intricate complex of ancient temples and tombs divided into linked levels (14 in total) crossing all kinds of traps, natural obstacles or enemies that will stand between us and the exit, the big news is in the overhead isometric view that accompanies the action that is so reminiscent of Blizzard's Diablo series. By abandoning the third person in favor of a wider shot, a range of previously precluded game solutions opens up, transforming the latest videogame incarnation of Lara into an interesting combination of shooter, platform and puzzle elements to solve. The presence of two characters offers the possibility of tackling the game in cooperation and this certainly turns out to be the best way to fully enjoy the experience that leaves players with maximum freedom in approaching the levels, in the light of this it is surprising how there is currently only local co-op without any online component, a lack that hopefully will be filled in brief with a providential patch. The Lara-Totec couple proves to be excellent for tackling the challenges scattered throughout the levels. The former can take advantage of the excellent athletic skills and make use of numerous types of firearms as well as a very useful grappling hook often essential for solving puzzles, while Totec is able to exploit his large shield both as a defense and as a support for the archaeologist's jumps, the same thing for the use of spears which as well as an offensive tool can also act as a platform on which Lara can balance and reach places otherwise precluded to her. Xbox 360 goals Lara Croft is giving away the 200 canonical points of each Live Arcade divided into 12 objectives, two of which are secret. To achieve them all it is necessary to recover all the weapons and all the artifacts, complete the game also in cooperative mode and carry out certain actions contextual to the levels or abilities of the two characters. Lara gets her makeup done Another interesting novelty is the use of the cell-shading technique, used wisely without ever being invasive but useful in giving the game a personal and pleasant style. The level design is certainly of a high level, with settings often extended even vertically and with complex architecture served for the equally excellent development of the puzzles that also accompany the exploration in this isometric incarnation. The challenges that Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light offers will hardly make you regret those faced in the Tomb Raider mother series and, although never too complex taken individually, they never sin of excessive woodiness or repetitiveness so that the action always flows without particular dead moments . The enemies we are called upon to face are well diversified in offensive capabilities and attack patterns but despite their large number they do not represent serious threats, in this respect we advise more experienced players to immediately start the game on a difficult level, in particular mode when played cooperatively. Much moresatisfying is the resolution of the puzzles and the deactivation of the numerous traps with which the temples and tombs that we are called to explore are full, thanks also to an excellent implementation of physics which not only has a decorative function but plays a fundamental part in the game mechanics . There are also numerous objects to be recovered that can be equipped to modify the protagonists' statistics while others offer special abilities that are activated when the relative bar is filled, which can be obtained by attacking enemies without taking damage. Useful for replayability are the various challenges present in each level, challenges ranging from the completion of the scheme in a certain time limit to the discovery of particular relics or the success of specific skill tests. The typology of these challenges is such as to make it impossible to achieve them all together given the often conflicting nature (some require careful exploration of the areas while others require you to get to the exit as quickly as possible) so as to make it necessary at least one second or even a third round for those who want to achieve perfection in scoring, a useful solution to lengthen the longevity of the game in a single game which normally stands at 6 hours for the more hurried adventurers up to a maximum of 8 hours for those who he wants to take it more calmly.", "date": "2010-09-15", "grade": "8.7"}
