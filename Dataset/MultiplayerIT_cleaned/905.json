{"name": "Ridge Racer DS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ridge-racer-ds.html", "text": "Fast and detailed. As mentioned at the beginning, starting to play with Ridge Racer DS we immediately understand the true nature of the title: it is in fact the direct conversion of the chapter released for Nintendo 64, which in itself represented a sort of remix of the previous episodes released for Psone. Ridge Racer DS therefore betrays its distant origins which date back almost 10 years ago. In all respects it seems more like a ~tribute~ to this racing game, rather than a real game from scratch. The tracks are the same, the cars too. The polygon count is not very high, certainly NintendoDS can do much better. And the reason for this modest use of triangles is known: to maintain a stable framerate. Justification more than honorable and acceptable. Despite this, the amount of detail on the screen is excellent: trees, tanks, houses, helicopters and planes, elevated. Ridge Racer DS betrays its distant origins which date back almost 10 years ago Often only a handful of pixels, as if to ~guess~ the detail, but still to underline the willingness not to program a meager game. The game, seen up close, is very reminiscent of the first Sega Rally for Sega Saturn: very solid framerate, few polygons but well done, details pulled away but present, and a great speed. Pixelloss reaches peaks that have been forgotten for years: lumps of colored squares replace walls, houses, streets and everything else. It is reasonable to imagine that a higher image quality would have benefited Ridge Racer DS, at the expense of a handful of animation frames. In addition to the excellent speed, other positive points for the audiovisual component. Some typical Ridge Racer goodies have remained, such as the lens flare of the brake lights. In the tunnel, the car bodies have a pleasant reflection effect. Too bad the programmers forgot to turn it off in unlit galleries. Speed is nothing without control. We've talked too much about the graphic aspect of Ridge Racer, now it's better to focus on the novelties it brings to the gameplay and control system, specifically designed to take advantage of the hardware features of our portable console. You can choose between three control modes: directional, stylus or strap. Playing directly with the cross is strongly recommended, even if not optimal. Once you get used to using the analog control it's hard to go back to putting your fingers on a cross (apart from rare cases where, mysteriously, someone prefers the inverse). The real problem with the D-pad is that the car responds to our controls very late, causing a significant loss of precision in the timing of corner entry, or overtaking. The driving style is thus very ~random~ and pulled away, and the feeling that the player's true skill never comes out is felt. Playing with the stylus is crazy, that's for sure. playing with the stylus is crazy, that's for sure Speed is nothing without control. Trying to select the third mode, strap, we would find ourselves having to place our fingertips directly on the lower screen, above a 2D animated ~virtual steering wheel~. In the latter case, on the contrary, the controls are unmanageable as they are too sensitive and exaggeratedly fast, causing countless skids and inaccuracies. Even by refining our sensory capabilities to the maximum and managing to tame the Ridge Racer DS cars, there is the presence of bad polygonal collisions between the participants in the race. The real positive note is instead the audio department, which includes dozens of original and remixed music of excellent workmanship, beautifully sampled voices and effects worthy of a racing game. Ridge Racer DS is playable by up to 6 participants wirelessly, all with the use of a single cartridge. Final comment. At this point it is easy to understand how much Ridge Racer DS tastes like an old game revived from a distance of light years; apart from the new control systems and very little else, it is in fact simply the version released for the Nintendo 64. A good game is still a good game, but unfortunately in this case there have been many steps backwards with the control system to such point to undermine the very goodness of the series. Ridge Racer DS has the flavor of a half game, and while it has some goodies like the wireless 6 player mode, it's still half a game. No wonder then that even the final vote, inevitably, is a vote that is right ... ~halfway~. Pros: Fast and fluid Wireless multiplayer with a cartridge Music and sound ok Cons: Too many pixels and few polygons Insufficient and imprecise controls Collisions all to be reviewed Ridge Racerback to basics It 'just the case to say. Seeing a Ridge Racer car whiz by is always a feast for the eyes. Seeing a Ridge Racer DS car whiz by instead is a show we have already seen, because we are faced with a version taken from the Nintendo 64 screens and re-proposed on our favorite dual screen. Not that graphics are everything in a game, of course. But the sense of dj vu that one feels when turning on the small (so to speak) Nintendo DS is palpable and heavy. Let's find out in this review if the programmers have managed to add new features and change the playability of this title, and how they have tried to make it attractive to old fans and new players.", "date": "2005-06-24", "grade": null}
