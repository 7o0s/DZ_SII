{"name": "Donut County", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/donut-county-la-recensione.html", "text": "We've been several things within video games but this is probably the first time we find ourselves being a hole in the ground: however, we are in the Donut County review and you should expect everything. For example, that a selfish and video addicted raccoon finds himself sinking an entire county to 999 meters below the earth's surface, dragging with him all the shocked fellow villagers victims of the strange business put up (or rather down) by the raccoon in question . Yes, because the work of BK, this is the name of the anthropomorphic procyonid, would have to do with the home delivery of donuts through a mysterious app, only that this only materializes the hole, which has a tendency to swallow everything that finds on its path increasing in size progressively. Delivery after delivery, or destruction after destruction, as illustrated in the levels that act as flashbacks (at least up to a certain point), the entire county finds itself sucked 999 meters underground and in that uncomfortable position finds itself having to work out a plan to return to the surface. Then the various characters of the area intervene, halfway between the villagers of Animal Crossing and the cast of some caustic animated sitcom: crocodiles, cats, coyotes, ducks and even what appears to be a real girl, at the end of the day with B.K. As they search for ways to fix things, they discover that something deeper lies behind the mystery of the hole, adding yet another layer of weirdness to the goings-on in Donut County. The style that pervades the game clearly demonstrates how this is not just any indie production and in fact the signatures of Annapurna and Ben Esposito, among the authors of The Unfinished Swan and What Remains of Edith Finch, speak for themselves: on the other hand, a a title that collects nominations and awards already under development seems destined for great things. The bottomless hole A few glances at Donut County are enough to think of what seems to have been an obvious source of inspiration for the game Annapurna: the legendary Katamari Damacy by Keita Takahashi, which comes to mind for the light-hearted and colorful style of the game but also, above all, for its particular puzzle mechanics, which is configured as a sort of opposite of Katamari by developing the same conceptual basis in a different way. In Donut County we find ourselves moving a hole in the ground within various levels, trying to swallow everything on the surface and as happened in Takahashi's title, also in this case we find ourselves having to act in a certain order : the hole is initially very small and gradually expands by swallowing objects and characters, until it captures the main objective of the level, which usually coincides with the total destruction of what is presented on the screen. However, growth must follow a regular progressive trend, so you find yourself having to first ~capture~ the smaller objects to gradually advance towards the larger ones, usually having to solve some basic puzzle linked to the possibility of reaching certain objects. The concept is very simple and in fact it is developed in a rather elementary way, representing one of the major defects of the game: there are variations on the theme and some brilliant ideas scattered around, but during the levels it is almost impossible to find a real challenge , with situations that slip away as fluid and fast as the objects inside the hole. It's a shame because the design of the game is really well done, the implications of the physics on the elements of the scenario are very convincing and every now and then some very interesting variations on the theme are proposed, such as the catapult or the behavior of fluids and fire with the hole , but everything seems sketchy, inserted in a level design that has only a few hints of puzzle solving, making the game flow smoothly from start to finish, which actually comes quite soon too. Let's be clear, the game is a real pleasure: fun to see, to read and to play for its entire duration, but precisely for this reason it increases the regret for what could have been with a slightly more accurate study of the structure of the levels and with a level of challenge befitting a real challenging puzzle game. A hole with style around it To give videogame depth to such a simple concept, as demonstrated at the time by Takahashi with Katamari, it is necessary to build a game with a certain specific identity and Donut County can count on a good dose of character. Ben Esposito and his team have remarkable command of their craft and that is evident in every yessingle screen, which exudes style from every pixel, both in the simple representation of the levels within the actual gameplay phases, and in the interlude sections, where nothing seems left to chance or vaguely banal. All this contributes to making Donut County a particularly enjoyable experience, even in its extra-playful elements, perfectly integrated into the crazy context set up by the developers. The graphic style, the dialogues, the animations, the implementations of the physics, the audio accompaniment and the game solutions themselves invariably impose a smile from the beginning to the end of the game. On mobile devices, the touch screen based control system works perfectly and is probably the best way to interact with the moving hole. In fact, we are faced with a title that is more convincing on tablets and smartphones than on consoles and PCs, both in terms of the control interface and its very structure, which in the underlying simplicity and brevity perhaps finds a better expression in the more fragmented use typical of portable devices. In any case everything, from the graphics to the characterization of the characters, contributes to creating an atmosphere that is difficult to forget, giving this game an unmistakable identity as only the most artistically valid productions can do, but all enriched by a good dose of irony that can only make Donut County likable, albeit within the evident limits of some of its more properly playful characteristics.", "date": "2018-09-15", "grade": "8.0"}
