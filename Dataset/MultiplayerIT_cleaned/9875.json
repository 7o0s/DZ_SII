{"name": "Dance On Broadway", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/79352-dance-on-broadway-pronti-a-salire-sul-palco.html", "text": "Let's go on stage! Dance On Broadway brings the musical into the homes of the most passionate of the genre, who will thus be able to go wild, alone or in company, to the rhythm of famous hits such as ~Fame~, ~Let the Sunshine in~ (taken from ~Hair~) or ~Time Warp~ (from the ~Rocky Horror Picture Show~). All that is needed is simply a WiiMote per player and a good dose of rhythm: the goal is in fact to dance the proposed choreographies by copying the steps of the chosen dancer as closely as possible. Not only that: thanks to the ~rhythm bar~ the next steps are suggested by some explanatory icons, so as not to be caught off guard and accumulate maximum points. As in front of an attentive and critical audience, each move is judged according to the rhythm, the precision of the movements and the ability to execute particular combinations proposed during the ballet (there are three possibilities of judgement, from the disheartening ~X~ to the gratifying ~Good ~, passing through ~OK~). Obviously, as in a self-respecting musical, there is no ballet without a song: the text is shown in the upper part of the screen and those who are not too busy following the sequence of movements could also try their hand at singing; in any case, no one will judge the singing performance, apart from the neighbors. The mess tin? No thank you Despite the authoritative playlist made up of 20 very famous songs, danceable from the first to the last note, without cuts or reworkings, and the pleasant multiplayer mode, up to 4 players, the thing that immediately catches the eye is the total absence of a mode career or in any case a story on which to set one's goals. Right from the start all songs are playable and the lack of new titles to unlock is glaring. It would undoubtedly have been much more interesting and stimulating to be able to get ~to the Broadway stage~, perhaps starting from an anonymous little theater in the suburbs and doing some healthy apprenticeship. Instead, in this panorama, the game gradually loses its edge and becomes almost repetitive if played alone, reducing itself to being just a simple way to have fun especially with friends or family. The lack of a goal to reach also affects the variety of choreographies proposed, making everything much more homogeneous than it actually is. In fact, it should be admitted that the individual ballets are sufficiently detailed and that, despite some moves being naturally repeated, overall something new is always danced - a sensation which, for the reasons mentioned above, is not always perceived during the game, lacking a real sense of progression. Another non-negligible flaw is the absence of a ranking that celebrates the best dancers: the best score made is associated with each song, but, since one is never asked to enter a nickname, the result will be nothing more than an associated number to the title and never attributable to the player. Another element capable of dampening the competitiveness and grit typical of a ballet company worthy of Broadway. Dance without thoughts Looking at the more practical aspect, Dance On Broadway is presented as an immediate game, usable by everyone. In the initial menu it is possible to find a tutorial that explains the right way to approach the different pieces with images and simple words; the same advice is also given before each performance, in such a way as to remind even the most forgetful of everything that needs to be done. To facilitate the player in choosing the choreography in which to try his hand, there is a small ~identity card~ under each title: for each ballet, one to three stars are assigned both for the level of difficulty and for the effort necessary to ~ take home~ the song. These two elements do not go hand in hand and so you can find choreographies as simple as steps as frenetic in rhythm and vice versa. Even the game mode is immediately clear, just hold the WiiMote firmly in your right hand while performing the various movements. Unfortunately, these are not always recorded in the most correct way possible, but for better or worse, the right compromise between precision and ease has been reached, a positive factor especially for the little ones. Finally, it must be noted that the mistakes made are only represented by an X above one's dancer, while it would certainly have been more fun to see one's character ~trudging~ on stage; instead, what you see on the screen are four dancers always in time, who are never wrong. But, after all, we are on Broadway.
