{"name": "Bionicle Heroes - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bionicle-heroes-recensione.html", "text": "Infinite Universes The title produced by Eidos belongs to the large group of action-shooters with a third-person view, with the character moved to the left side of the screen and the camera located just behind, a bit like Resident Evil 4 or Gears of War to be clear. We will immediately be catapulted into the center of the action, leading one of the six Toa Inika, cyborg warriors, available on the island of Voya Nui. Once we arrive in Voya Nui, in an area exclusively for passage, we will have the possibility to choose one of the four caves that will lead us to the respective stages. When starting the adventure we will be able to choose only one of the very strong robots called Toa Inika, continuing in the course of the story we will also unlock the other protagonists. The aim of the game is to free the twenty-five zones into which the island is divided and recover the Kanohi masks; we will have to deal not only with the evil enemy robots, here called Piraka, but also with the difficulties that characterize the island setting, such as jungles, deserts and erupting volcanoes. Being a LEGO product, obviously the reference to the bricks famous all over the world could not be missing, the Toa Inika are composed of detachable and interchangeable parts but above all what characterizes them, and above all that supplies them with powers and new abilities, are the Kanohi rubble . These artifacts to be recovered during the adventure will provide our hero with new abilities and new weapons; Hahli's mask allows our Bionicle to swim and characterizes the robot's rifle with a very rapid but not very powerful shot, Nuparu's mask gives a grenade launcher and the power to climb walls, Kongu's mask instead allows you to make long leaps between certain platforms, Matoro's provides a sniper rifle that immobilizes any opponent. However, the strongest masks remain that of Hewkii and the golden one: the first is capable of assembling objects, living beings and even the parts of means of transport destroyed by the Pirakas, a function that will be fundamental during the progress of the levels. The golden artifact is instead a sort of temporary bonus, given that it cannot be worn but is obtained by collecting a certain number of LEGO bricks and makes the Toa Inika very powerful but only for a few moments. The way to upgrade your character is therefore based on the collection of bricks, pieces that we will find not only during the exploration of the levels but above all by collecting them after defeating the enemies who patrol the various areas. Thanks to the Hewkii mask we will also be able to make them emerge from the ground in which they are buried, and then assemble them. So with the combination of this artifact and the golden mask we will be able to boost ourselves to an optimal extent to be able to face the difficult end-of-level bosses. It will therefore be essential to destroy as many enemies as we meet on our path, in order to obtain the fundamental bricks to transform us into ~heroes~ and for the upgrades between one level and another; purchases that take place in a sort of virtual shopping thanks to which we will be able to further make our Toa Inika stronger, giving him capabilities thanks to which we will be able to reach areas of the island that would otherwise be unreachable. Technically The gameplay of Bionicle Heroes does not introduce anything particularly innovative, referring to the scheme of the classic third-person shooters aimed at destroying every enemy that appears on the screen. The resolution of some small puzzle has been introduced as per tradition only to break the monotony of the different levels. Technically, the title developed by Traveller's Tale is sufficiently detailed, especially as regards the environments and particle effects that characterize the explosions and fire shots. The polygonal models of the Bionicles themselves are quite good and well defined in detail, however you will never see any damage to your armor and armor. In the Xbox 360 version we tried to capitalize on the potential offered by the handsome Microsoft hardware by introducing blur effects and ~bloom~ lighting. Unfortunately both effects did not succeed as they should have and lend themselves to more than one criticism. Of all the versions, the most successful is the one for PC, however we must admit that the general level on all three consoles is sufficient, guaranteeing a fluidity that is still high even in the presence of several opponents on the screen, except for some drops in the frame rate episodes that occur in front of the end-of-level bosses. The last notation concerns the Xbox 360 achievements that guarantee 1000 points, to obtain them it will however be necessaryfinish the game at least twice. Comment Bionicle Heroes is a game that follows the long tradition that sees titles developed under license, with rare exceptions, quite mediocre. The third-person shooter developed by Traveller's Tales is linear and provides for a sort of canonical destruction of any opponent who reaches our vicinity. Technically we cannot say that Bionicle Heroes is evil, on the contrary it has sufficient quality that makes it playable as long as you don't dwell too much on the details. On the other hand, we feel like underlining a particular lack, also due to the fact that it is inexplicable, unfortunately there is no multiplayer or cooperative mode, or versus. Pros A new third-person shooter Sufficiently maintained Cons Absolutely linear Certainly not an unforgettable game and technically only decent Lack of a multiplayer mode Bionicle Heroes is available for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2. The version used for this review is the Xbox 360 version. One of the last articles of this 2006 that draws to an end we dedicate it to the most recent production based on license of LEGO bricks released for Xbox, PlayStation 2, PC and Xbox 360. The products that are based on important licenses do not always manage to be at the height of the reference brand, indeed many times they are very superficial titles that are loved only by enthusiasts. Bionicle Heroes is based precisely on one of the LEGO universes that enjoy greater distribution and fame, we will see if this video game developed by Traveller's Tales will be convincing or will not deviate from anonymity.", "date": "2006-12-29", "grade": null}
