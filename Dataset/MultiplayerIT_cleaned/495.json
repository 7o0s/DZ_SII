{"name": "Snowboard Kids", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/snowboard-kids.html", "text": "The thing you immediately notice, obviously having played the previous episodes, is that the graphic style, the main peculiarity and one of the greatest strengths of Snowboard Kids, has been completely transformed. The characters with the huge head protagonists of the old editions have been replaced by teenagers created with the most banal Japanese style. All this probably to make the game more attractive to the general public, to make it cooler; the only result obtained, however, was to make the title lose its trademark. The graphics engine does not behave badly, in fact, except in some situations where there are many elements on the screen, however very rare, it flows very smoothly. The quality with which the polygons were used is questionable, not their quantity, which is high and allows you to create, together with good light effects, a more than respectable visual aspect. Even the sound sector does its duty, except for the disturbing little voices of the protagonists, proposing songs that help fuel the winter atmosphere of the game. The audiovisual aspect of Snowboard Kids therefore, despite the loss of its characteristic style, fulfills its task admirably. Where the game lacks, in fact, is in everything else, namely in the quality and variety of gameplay, made up of an incredible series of ups and downs. One of the first peculiarities that you encounter, scrolling through the initial menu, is the total absence of a classic game mode, the one that is generally called ~Exhibition~. In Snowboard Kids, in fact, there is no way to get a quick race against the CPU, let alone a tournament of four or five races typical of this racing game genre. There are only three types of game: the World Tour (the absence of Italian among the available languages should also be underlined, given that by now the DS has accustomed us more than well even in this respect), the Slalom and the battle against a Boss. The World Tour is the main mode, it also includes the other two, is divided into three levels of difficulty and offers various objectives. There's obviously racing against three other CPU-driven opponents to deal with, sadly representing one of the worst parts of the game. During the race you will be able to collect and use, as is now customary, bonuses to attack enemies or to defend yourself from them. However, these objects have been created in an incredibly unbalanced way, so much so that it is practically impossible to defend oneself from the attacks of others (only a bonus allows it), and the races are dominated by chance rather than skill. These objects are enhanced by doing 'tricks' in the air, i.e. performing numbers with your board while in flight. The control system is quite intuitive, it has a button to shoot, one to tighten the curves and one to go faster and jump. The biggest problem is that it is impossible not to jump at the end of a head-down section: in short, when you hold down the button to increase the speed of your descent, there will be no way to leave it without taking off. Often it would have been useful to dose the speed by continuously alternating the position of the runner, but unfortunately this cannot be done due to this error of judgment on the part of the developers. Another big flaw lies in the lack of care with which the interactions with the terrain of the slope and the rocky walls that often delimit it have been managed: there are only two types of snow, which moreover do not change much from each other, and the rocks that fence the course all influence the runner's trajectory in the same way, behaving as if they were a single long invisible wall; very often it is even convenient to crash into it, because the character does not tip over and we are thus allowed to keep the speed button pressed. Where the game picks up is in the management of jumps, which despite not being particularly complex is certainly intuitive. Each key is associated with a trick, which is then directed through the traditional keyboard. Sometimes it is possible to perform preset evolutions, much more spectacular than the others, by pressing the parts of the Touch Screen that are indicated while in flight. On the other hand, the start is decidedly uncomfortable, during which you have to tap the lower screen of the DS to accumulate speed. The second display is also managed unwisely, since it does not indicate the path of the track, represented by a generic straight line, but only the position of the competitors and the weapons at their disposal. The other two challenges that the World Tour offers are the Slalom and the clash with the Bosses, bothand, as mentioned before, they can also be tackled separately (which is not feasible with the race against the CPU). The slalom is essentially a timed race, during which you will have to pass, before the seconds at your disposal, pass through a series of circles scattered along the track. To move on to the next stage you will also have to accumulate a certain number of points, which can be earned by performing tricks of various kinds during the descent. Surely the Slalom is the best managed section of the game, since there are no weapons that determine the outcome of your race and the boss fights are incredibly repetitive. In this last mode, your goal is not to arrive before your opponent at the finish line, but to annihilate him using weapons that can be upgraded thanks to Tricks. Once you understand the mechanics, eliminating bosses is very easy, especially considering that they are all small variations of a standard enemy. In conclusion Snowboard Kids does not offer a great challenge, there are only eight tracks and the incentives to replay it are scarce: the bonuses to be unlocked are all superficial extras, without which the title ends easily, but above all a mode dedicated to tests is totally missing time. The only positive note from this point of view is the multiplayer, since four people can play even with a single cartridge. With Snowboard Kids for DS, Atlus has chosen for presumably commercial purposes to give up the graphic style that had characterized the series since its debut on Nintendo 64, replacing it with a much more banal and obvious one. Despite this, the audiovisual sector is the best aspect of the game, which demonstrates deficiencies in all other fields. It incredibly lacks a mode that allows you to compete quickly with the CPU and is based on game types that would have been secondary in other titles, offering only eight tracks. A realization that could have given life to a valid game collides with totally incorrect evaluations in the design phase. Recommended only for those who love this sport. Pros Valid audiovisual sector Intuitive and fun tricks Multiplayer in 4 with a single cartridge Cons Only eight tracks Absence of the Time Trial Lack of a classic racing mode The new graphic style is banal Weapons very badly managed Short life The Snowboard Kids saga saw the light for the first time on Nintendo 64, thanks to the work of Atlus. The super-deformed style, combined with a good blend of traditional snowboard racing and a Mario Kart-like racing game, allowed the game to achieve good success, also thanks to the limited number of games available on the N64. A short time later it had a sequel and was also converted to PSX, without changing its backbone. After several years of silence, here it is reappearing on Nintendo DS, still developed by the same company.", "date": "2006-05-25", "grade": null}
