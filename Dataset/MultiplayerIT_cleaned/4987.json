{"name": "Toukiden 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/181192-toukiden-2-i-quattro-con-gli-oni.html", "text": "Announced during the Tokyo Game Show 2015, Toukiden 2 finally arrives on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita with an episode that sets itself rather clear objectives: to further enrich the formula we had appreciated in the original game, to introduce new mechanics and to act as a valid alternative to Monster Hunter, contrasting its popularity both within the Japanese borders and overseas. However, the final result fails to meet these expectations, despite a particularly full-bodied structure, capable of easily guaranteeing a hundred hours of action, and some interesting narrative twists. Toukiden 2 tries to make the leap in quality, but is abruptly held back by a number of factors Ten years and feel them The first thing Toukiden 2 asks us to do is use a simple character creation editor, a demon hunter who finds himself fighting the terrible Oni during the ~Awakening~, an event that occurs in the setting of a Yokohama of the feudal era and sees the invasion of infernal monsters through the streets of the city. Swallowed by a mysterious vortex just when the final battle was reaching its climax, the protagonist of the adventure finds himself projected ten years into the future, devoid of memory and in another area of Japan, where he meets a young scientist who it has achieved important results in the field of technologies useful for dealing with the threat of demons: on the one hand the Machina, sentient androids which in certain cases contain a human soul and are endowed with different abilities; on the other hand, the Demon Hands, devices that allow hunters to emit a claw of energy against their enemies to hook their weak points and quickly project themselves to attack. In the role of the warrior with no memory, we will first have to gain the trust of the village leaders by completing a series of simple missions against the imps that infest the area, then receive a Demon Hand and fight against increasingly powerful enemies by exploring the map together with three companions (controlled by artificial intelligence or by as many human players) and gradually unlocking new territories with a view to a rather vast but at the same time dull and very unspectacular open world. To achieve our goals and complete the many missions that make up the seven chapters of the campaign, as well as possibly those reserved for the online cooperative, we will be able to count on a fairly rich arsenal, which alternates between long sword, double sword, daggers, maces, sword and shield, battle gauntlets, chain maces, whips, bows, and rifles. Each tool boasts unique characteristics in terms of effectiveness and speed of execution, with the most disruptive ones requiring precious moments to be able to unleash their devastating power and others that instead guarantee many hits but little damage inflicted. They represent an interesting variation on the theme of long-range weapons, which allow you to approach fights in a detached way, hitting the vital parts of the Oni while they are busy dealing with other party members. Compared to the Capcom blockbuster, the rhythm of the combat system changes in any case, with more frenetic battles and therefore a lower dose of strategy required to bring home the loot. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty trophies of Toukiden 2, mysteriously not translated from the Japanese, are obtained by completing the seven chapters of the campaign and all the missions (including the online ones), buying all the weapons and carrying out all the upgrades, as was to be expected for a product of this type. To get Platinum you have to spend several tens of hours exploring the scenarios and finding the objects. Slow carburetion As a good action survival, Toukiden 2 focuses strongly on a rich structure, made up of many main and secondary missions to be exploited mainly to obtain the money and materials necessary for the purchase of new weapons and armor, as well as for their enhancement. It is in fact very important to have tools equipped with the necessary power to prevent the clashes from going too long, also taking advantage of the perks represented by the Mitama, spirits that can influence our abilities by affecting attack, defense and healing ability; as well as the special attacks that can be performed during fights, which evoke some luminous ~orbs~ that are thrown at the demon on duty to weaken its resistance. The mechanisms that regulate the crafting are much more accessible than in Monster Hunter and the experience is generally friendlierand, although the developers have made a couple of missteps, it's not funny: on the one hand, the initial phase of the adventure is dull, repetitive, slow and trivial in terms of challenge, which does not play at all in favor of involvement and indeed creates a certain discomfort that tends to disappear only after several hours, when more interesting situations take shape; on the other hand, the team claimed to fill the narrative sector with very long and boring dialogues, however completely in English and impossible to skip, which in most cases revolve around an all too tested plot, with few (albeit interesting) exceptions. To close the picture we find the aforementioned open world of the ~seamless~ type but empty and generic, devoid of evocative panoramas and with the usual alternation of little monsters to slow down our march, fortunately made faster by the possibility of moving instantly from a portal unlocked to the other and thus reach the ends of the map in seconds rather than through tedious walks into thin air. From a technical point of view, Toukiden 2 is in fact modest, much closer to its nature as a portable game than to the characteristics of PlayStation 4 (least of all Pro), with graphics that run at thirty frames per second but suffer from drops during more agitated phases (just like in Toukiden Kiwami, therefore no improvement on this front) and uses very generic assets, which determine a certain lack of personality. The design of the Oni is an exception, which thanks to some good intuitions manages to limit the damage to a visual sector which, however, remains well below expectations. The music, on the other hand, is excellent, with themes that effectively underline the various situations: it's just a pity that some songs, repeated endlessly during the phases in the village, end up getting boring.", "date": "2017-03-21", "grade": "7.0"}
