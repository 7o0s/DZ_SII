All the additions made by Gameloft to the title, both from an aesthetic and structural point of view, are absolutely not invasive or clumsy. We note the trace left by the last 3D chapters of the saga, with new movements for the Prince and also an appearance for the famous dark ~double~ of the protagonist, but everything blends well with the timeless gameplay of the progenitor. The technical realization is excellent, and it's nice to rediscover the pleasure of jumping between platforms, avoiding obstacles and fighting enemies, and also having to repeat the same actions over and over again to try to overcome a particularly difficult point, in this return to a platformer archetype. The biggest flaw is certainly the longevity of the game, which having to be completed in 60 minutes will certainly not be able to offer many hours of entertainment, and the stimuli to play it again are scarce, beyond the simple pleasure of re-immersing yourself in its particular atmosphere. Finally, the presence of the original game would have been appreciated together with the remake, which was not included due to space problems. However, Prince of Persia Classic represents one of the (few) spearheads of the Live Arcade catalog, and more generally an excellent game at an extremely favorable price. Pros: Excellent technical realization Gameplay that captivates Very tempting price Cons: Really very short Some unclear dynamics in the fights Absence of the original version of the game Race against time The story behind the game is the same as the original: with the good Sultan of Persia away from his land, the evil Vizier has taken control of the palace, and has imprisoned the Princess in her luxurious rooms. This one has one hour to decide her fate: marry the Vizier or die. Obviously, the evil usurper did not calculate the capabilities of the man in love with the Princess and aspiring Prince of Persia. Indeed, the latter was thrown into the dungeon of the palace, but he has every intention of fleeing that place within the hour, reaching the Vizier and settling him down once and for all, subsequently marrying his beloved. The story is therefore the most classic there can be in a video game: overcoming obstacles and saving the Princess, but the introduction of the ~time~ element substantially modifies its structure. The hour of time granted to the Princess to decide her fate is in fact a real hour, which is reflected in the playing time. We will therefore have only 60 minutes to complete all the levels of Prince of Persia, which pushes us not only to be cautious among the numerous traps scattered throughout the levels and the enemies to face, but also to waste absolutely no time, and try to perform all the necessary actions in the best way and in the shortest possible time. The original Prince of Persia is also remembered for its difficult level of difficulty, and this remake, although more polished in the structure, seems to want to reproduce its characteristic. However, we note the interventions of the developers, aimed at making the game more accessible to the public, with choices that are also spot on: one of these is the presence of checkpoints within the level, which by restarting from an intermediate point, in case of death of the character, avoid having to start over all the actions from the beginning of the scheme. Traps and duels The structure has remained practically the same, from 1989 to today. For those unfamiliar with the original, it is an integrated platform game with various bladed combat, although most of the gameplay is still based on the careful management of the character's movements between platforms. These take on a decidedly more ~physical~ role compared to normal platformers (such as Mario or Sonic, for example): they are structures on which it is possible to climb, descend or crash, designed in such a way as to require the player to take a more ~acrobatic~ approach , compared to what happens in the more classic exponents of the genre. In Prince of Persia, complete mastery of the character and perfect control of his various movements are essential. For a jump to be successful, for example, it is necessary to calculate exactly the distance between the platforms, and choose the best run-up to make, or decide whether to jump from a standstill, with less momentum but without the danger that inertia could cause too long a landing. To complicate the already difficult journey of the Prince between the hanging platforms, there are floors and ceilings that collapse, traps of various kinds such as spikes that come out of the pavement, assorted and mobile blades. Although it is not difficultill identify threats and how to avoid them, the fact of having to finish the game within 60 minutes keeps the player under constant pressure, forcing him to decide quickly what action to take, and carry it out as quickly as possible. The levels are gradually more and more intricate, more complex than those that made up the original game, but the new introduction of the luminous ~butterfly~ (which can be deactivated), which indicates the way to follow, greatly simplifies the work of finding the way right. It should be noted, however, that each level hides many secrets, such as power ups or energy refills, which in the long run become absolutely necessary to better face the continuation of the game, even if you always have to deal with the limited time available . In Prince of Persia, complete mastery of the character and perfect control of his various movements are essential Traps and duels The fights are the other pillar on which the gameplay of Prince of Persia is based. In the first minutes of the game we will pick up a scimitar from the ground, and with it we will have to defeat the numerous guards (human and otherwise) who will stand out in front of us. The fights can be extremely frustrating, at least until you understand (at least in part, as some points remain rather obscure) the dynamic. It is all based on defense and counterattack: with the right timing, it is possible to dodge and protect yourself from attacks, and then find the right moment to attack and strike the opponent. The first encounters are rather flat, but soon the enemies will level up and start attacking in fast sequences of blows that must be answered with perfect timing. When you get the right sequence of parries and jabs right, the fight becomes exciting, but often you get the impression that the game tends to overcomplicate things, such as when an attack carried out simultaneously (or even in advance) by the player with respect to the guard, the blow goes in favor of the latter, which happens very often. However, given the game's relative brevity, they are probably necessary gimmicks to ramp up the overall difficulty. A classic reborn The Gameloft development studio has so far been known, above all, for its titles dedicated to mobile phones and mobile platforms, products that notoriously do not involve a huge use of resources in terms of the technical sector. However, the team managed to craft a remarkable looking game, completely rebuilding the look of Prince of Persia and masterfully using 3D without distorting the atmosphere of the original. The visualization is the same as the old progenitor, with levels composed of fixed screens framed from the side, with a strictly 2D structure, and the polygonal graphics rest on this system without distorting or weighing it down. The dungeons and rooms of the palace are embellished by the minute details that characterize the scenarios, by the discreet use of lights and by the excellent choice of colors which contributes to reinforcing the Arabian Nights atmosphere linked to the game. Unfortunately, as was legitimate to expect in 2007, the animations of the Prince no longer arouse the amazement that arose from the movements of the character created in rotoscoping in 1989, but this loss is amply compensated by the prominence that the scenarios have instead acquired: it is impossible not to dwell on the arabesques and the furnishings of some rooms, or admire with pleasure the glimpses of the city illuminated by the sunset, which extends outside the large windows of the building. It is nice to note how, despite the use of 3D, fidelity to the old graphic layout brings back the taste of the design and the purely aesthetic background detail in front of the player, which is typical of 2D graphics. Little to say about the audio sector: the music is almost completely absent, except for the excellent remake of the original theme in the menus and in very short sections between the levels or in the rare cut-scenes. Much of the time, just like in the old Prince of Persia, ambient sound effects and various noises caused by the characters such as footsteps, blows and the clashing of blades dominate. Speech is completely absent, even in the interlude phases: a choice in line with the ~old school~ policy adopted by Gameloft. Xbox 360 goals As a rule for every Live Arcade title, the game contains 12 unlockable achievements, for a total of 200 points which will add up to the Gamerscore. Some of these are obtained simply by continuing in the game, defeating bosses or reaching particular points, while for others specific actions will be required to be performed, such as ~killing a guardmaking her fall into a trap. In general, also given the (relative) brevity of the game, it will not be excessively difficult to unlock all the objectives, for which it will still be required to replay the game several times, even once finished. In the history of video games, among all the pearls of the past, there are some that shine in a particular way, for the emotions they have given by playing them and the memories they bring back. Prince of Persia is undoubtedly one of these: Jordan Mechner's game has remained imprinted in the imagination of the gaming public, inserting new elements into the dynamics of the platform and becoming a cornerstone of the genre. Back in 1989, the Prince of Persia made its first appearance on the Apple II, subsequently being converted for a plethora of different platforms, practically all those on the market at the time, with diversified adaptations according to the different potential of the hardware. The cornerstones of the game were the particular atmosphere created by the Arabian Nights setting of ancient Persia, a rather unusual element at the time; the avant-garde technical realization and the particular game dynamics, which proposed a more ~acrobatic~ approach to the normal platform, also combining sections with white weapon clashes. The first impression, faced with the graceful movements of the Prince on the screen, was that of thinking that that character was endowed with a particular vitality, and it was a real pleasure to see him run between the platforms, jump and climb, with animations that at the time were unattainable, obtained through the rotoscoping technique, until then used only to obtain certain effects in animated cinema. In fact, the story tells how, to draw all the movements of the protagonist, Jordan Mechner had filmed his brother running and jumping between improvised platforms for hours, then tracing each frame on the computer and obtaining a faithful digital copy of a human being. This Prince of Persia Classic by Gameloft, published by Ubisoft, is presented as a real homage to the original: having abandoned its by now normal entirely three-dimensional structure for a moment, the Prince of Persia returns to play his original role, in a platform 2D, although made with polygonal graphics.", "date": "2007-06-13", "grade": null}
