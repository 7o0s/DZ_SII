{"name": "Death's Door", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deaths-door-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "A few months after its debut, Death's Door arrives on Nintendo Switch, a platform elected by popular acclaim as a place where indies not only feel good, but above all play. It is no more disturbing than the light of time exclusives or conversions that are brought to the Kyoto hybrid console in a short time: by their natural conformation, independent titles - compared to the AA or AAA market - draw on other types of fundamentals, unrelated to the heavy element polygonal, offering perfect experiences to be played, lived, completed in portability. Death's Door is no exception: the little gem Acid Nerve also shines on Switch, feeding that large group of isometric metroidvania-style action, a term which, in this period, we abuse with pleasure because there are never enough. Then the reaper raven returns, a bird whose context is all to be defined in a melancholy limbo between life and death. We tell you everything you need to know in the Death's Door review. Temple of the Doors Some moments of Death's Door are particularly agitated The Hall of Doors is a strange place: it is a bit of a parody of some government offices, whose employees arrive calmly by bus and sit at their desks to chat. Our moment of glory comes soon, when we discover we must recover a soul unlike any other, one that requires more effort than usual. We set off on the adventure in what will gradually reveal itself to be a labyrinth of doors that act as portals, initially getting to grips with a three-dimensional world with dull colors and a solemn air of temporal stasis. The atmosphere that surrounds Death's Door, although sometimes almost comical, remains a strong point of the product from start to finish, in what represents research on the border of the sibylline, told in pieces, dealing with important issues with personality. The first we enjoy hours of Death's Door on Switch in portability, because after all what is the point of playing it on this console if not being able to do it from anywhere? On balance, the playability of the title has been transposed very well, also thanks to a certain lack of general complexity which certainly helped the conversion: we are faced with a well-developed combat system, not particularly stratified, but rewarding, which lends itself well to be enjoyed with Joy-Con. It is therefore with ease that we find ourselves tracing the journey of our warrior crow, breathing again that solitary parallel dimension air that so much personality gave to the software this summer. Beautiful everywhere Colors and shades of Death's Door are not the brightest, but it is a precise and pleasant stylistic choice The aesthetic quality of Death's Door relies on art rather than on polygons and this allows Death's Door to run smoothly at 30 frames, net of some micro drops here and there that can be easily fixed. The maze proposed by Acid Nerve also works well on the small screen: style, colors, level design and enemies mix well, even if the opponents don't always have the same level of quality, but it's understandable. So by eye, the idea is that as often happens in portable mode, the developer has sometimes opted for a dynamic resolution, which slightly scales the offer to keep the frame buffer constant: let's go back to saying that it is now a widespread practice that that's fine with it, because - especially in this videogame genre - the king must remain the gameplay, even better if supported by a certain aesthetic minimalism. The same beautiful fate happens to the game in docked mode: on the big screen we find a slightly more stable flow and a visible resolution boost, making the dual soul of this Death's Door conversion beautiful to play anywhere. The sound sector is also excellent, designed to accompany a story that probes the approach to life, death and goals that can change and mutate quickly in an existence.", "date": "2021-11-23", "grade": "8.0"}
