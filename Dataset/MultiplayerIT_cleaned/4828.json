Not all Sims have party attitudes and there are those who prefer starting a family and marrying rather than launching into night raids in search of the undead and skittles! And here is that Parenthood introduces the relationship between parents and children into the universe of The Sims, putting us in the shoes of any father or mother grappling with the thousand despairs that only children can give. The possibility of taking care of a child has existed in the simulator since the beginning but what the developers have achieved in the fourth chapter is a system based on a particularly refined character evolution dynamics, while remaining very simple to manage and understand. What to expect when you're expecting Maxis has been pushing the ~emotions~ button for years and like all the past innovations introduced by and in The Sims 4, Parenthood too gravitates strongly around the Sims' feelings, desires and attitudes. The parenting activity therefore takes on a more complex connotation because it is no longer enough to satisfy the basic needs of the Simmers and keep them out of danger: the veterans will remember well what happens to leave a child near the stove unattended, but we will have to worry about their education. To prepare for this mission, our Sims will first of all be able to read up on reading books or surfing the net even if, as with all things, the only way to learn well is to practice on the field. As a parent we can therefore give orders or support our children and it will be up to us to decide whether to use an iron fist or more gentle ways: the important thing is to remember that as in reality, every decision we make as a parent is irreversible and will permanently affect young people Sim. This happens thanks to a new character value system, a new gameplay feature that affects only infants, children and adolescents. This system is based on five pillars: education, responsibility, conflict resolution, empathy and emotional control. In the game interface, the character values are located in the ~Symology~ menu (the face icon in the lower right corner, Y hot key in Live mode), where the traits related to the Sim's personality are displayed. Each value has a horseshoe indicator where positive (green) and negative (red) points can be accumulated and each starting trait of the Simino or external action operated by the parent acts permanently; to give a concrete example, the tidy and sloppy traits affect the education value in a positive and negative way respectively, to increase the positive points the Simmer will be able to express a compliment or set the table, while burping and swearing... well, you understand ! Obviously there is no right or wrong way to be a parent but you can only try to be the best parent possible and doing so will not always be easy: we will have to understand when to use a kind tone and encourage our Simmer not to mess up anymore or when to raise the voice and show us more resolute and just like children in the flesh, each little Sim will react in his own way, depending on his primary values and traits. If we then find ourselves in difficulty we can resort to punishment, one of the many social interactions added for the occasion which, for those who were wondering, works in the exact same way in which our parents punished us: sitting in the corner! If you've been a mischievous kid, you'll also know that a stool in a corner isn't a real obstacle for a child, so be prepared to have to chase and scold the most nasty Simmers. Someone think of the children! A slightly different discussion should be made for newborns because, while children and adolescents have language properties and cognitive abilities that allow for an understandable relationship between parents and children, this does not happen with newborns. It will therefore be necessary to sharpen the ear and learn to distinguish a cry from ~I'm hungry!~ from one to ~change my diaper!~, in the hope of being able to provide the attention desired by the infant. The whole character value system then ceases and settles as the Sim comes of age and once the transition from teenager to young adult is made the game will convert the points of the five character values into definitive personality traits: this dynamic is incredibly fascinating and refined because in the end our ~children~ will really be the result of hours of education, efforts, sacrifices, victories and failures as a parent... after all, isn't that the case in reality? The character value system is a novIn our opinion, it is particularly full-bodied and we are surprised that it was introduced by a game pack: thanks to this change in the management of children and teenagers, the game acquires a depth and realism never seen before while always maintaining the typical The Sims level of humor. Managing a family with children is more difficult and tiring for the player precisely because he has to deal with a more difficult test than the previous ones, where the factor that creates more tension in the gameplay is not the real-time management of the youngest Sims but the awareness that they our actions will have an impact on that small, that feeling that every person theoretically experiences for the rest of their life after giving birth to a creature: ~Did I do the right thing?~. Obviously to say that Parenthood will help you to be better future dads and moms is really risky, but the emotional strings that this new gameplay drift is going to pluck are the same ones that vibrate in many of us when it comes to children  and if all this realism wasn't enough for you, know that the tantrums and cries of a child, even if fake, wear out the nerves as much as the real ones, with the difference that when you get bored of the first ones you can turn them off and put them to bed! Last note to add at the end of this game pack is the variety of objects for the buy mode, perhaps a little too unbalanced on the children's side... to be clear, there are many things for young children and few for parents. Usually in all the expansions of The Sims 4 there has always been a good balance of additional elements while remaining faithful to the main theme of the expansion itself but in this case, thanks to the children, we have an avalanche of chairs, drawing tables, cots with bright colors and to be affected by this mood are also the furniture in the living rooms and kitchens, a little subdued and which in terms of style and design do not come close to the previous game pack in the slightest.", "date": "2017-06-05", "grade": null}
