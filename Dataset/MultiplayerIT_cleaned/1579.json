{"name": "Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtua-fighter-4-evolution.html", "text": "Virtual technique Suffix, it should be specified from the beginning, this time inserted with precise reasons. The proposed innovations concerned above all the gameplay, with obvious retouches to the rare perfection of Virtua Fighter 4. As is known, the Sega title is centered on the typically Japanese thinking of matches, i.e. a slow and reasoned rhythm, favoring technique over speed of execution, contrary to what one might assume from the control system, based on just three buttons. In reality, the variety of styles and movements is remarkable, allowing different strategies for each game, also thanks to the two-way setting of the virtual arenas, divided into the canonical rings from which it is possible to fall into the void and into claustrophobic environments limited by icy steel. Criteria certainly not suitable for everyone, intelligently mitigated by a very complete training mode and open to any solution, both for the beginner, who will be able to practice with the mechanics of the game, and for the expert, ready to refine his tactics and learn new ones entered moves. Evolution in fact includes two unpublished characters, Burns and Hogh, and overall several novelties in the existing techniques, making the wide choice of fighters even more balanced if possible. Even the artificial intelligence of the CPU has been revisited, a change made relevant above all in the new Quest mode, borrowed from kumite mode, where we will be committed to triumphing against as many opponents as possible in the Japanese Arcades, in matches with the most disparate conditions and which closely resemble those of soul calibur. It is interesting to note how these missions are often presented to us also in the Arcade mode. The fees obtained from the fights can be used to unlock a whole series of gadgets for the protagonist of the adventure, making the AM2 title very long-lived even in single. As usual, the last considerations are addressed to the local edition, not localized but on the other hand equipped with the very useful 50/60 Hz selector. Audiovisual sensations As already anticipated in the introduction, the technical realization of Virtua Fighter 4, however enjoyable, was not exactly a conversion identical to the original, an aspect which highlighted Sega's inexperience regarding the architecture of the monolith. Evolution sensibly remedies the ingenuity of the first edition, creating a technical sector that is valid in all its many aspects. The first positive sensations concern the virtual arenas, redesigned in terms of detail and made particularly realistic by pleasant animated elements. Japanese miniature panoramas such as superbly carved wooden platforms in the shade of cherry blossom trees, underground caverns where pure water flows, desolate beaches at sunset barely touched by the wind, naturally coexist with modern but no less evocative landscapes such as aquariums under construction, tops of skyscrapers illuminated by the powerful beam of a helicopter and imposing castles immersed in eternal snow. The stillness is not in the least interrupted by the fighters, but rather underlined by their precise and believable movements, usually accompanied in their oscillations by dynamic light sources. The faces of the fighters are deformed by expressions of pain, passion, ancient respect for the opponent. The cinematographic cut of certain shots perpetuates the more technical moments of the encounter, enhancing the peculiarity of the style, and highlighting in the negative poorly defined textures and the reduced ladders. The soundtrack is acceptable, with rather lively hard-rock tracks, while the sound effects are on their usual excellent levels. Comment The evolution of Virtua Fighter 4 demonstrates how it is possible to re-propose current titles without reducing them to simple aesthetic updates. AM2 has not only updated the technical implementation, previously limited by reduced conversion times and now much more accurate in every sector, but has also adjusted the balance of the gameplay, with the introduction of two new fighters who, together with various modifications to those already available, have made VF even more technical and realistic if possible: a structure so complex as to be a natural prologue for an exciting longevity, even in single player, with excellent training and quest modes, not neglecting the various extras present and the excellent multiplayer mode. Unrewarding therefore to define it as the greatest exponent of the genre on PlayStation2. More correct to make him enter the Olympus of the best of all time. Pros: Technically sound Considerable depth of gameplay Quests and Training mode well-kept Cons: It's still a reissue Not suitable for everyone A second opinion... I certainly couldn't help but have my say on the latest iteration of one of my all-time favorite sagas. Evolution amazes, and for the technical realization finally up to par and for the very significant updates on the gameplay front, brought not only by the addition of two new wrestlers, characterized by decidedly interesting and atypical fighting techniques, but above all by the maniacal recalibration of the balances between existing wrestlers, with the addition of new moves and the elimination, or downsizing, of otherwise too lethal and unbalanced techniques. Evolution is therefore the ideal incarnation of one of the most successful fighting games of recent years and one of the greatest exponents of the genre, but it's not for everyone. The slow game pace that suddenly explodes into very fast attacks, which usually end the match in a few moves, and the poor accessibility for the novice make it a title for a few passionate players who are not afraid of losing hours and hours to study at 360 degrees the strengths and weaknesses of one's character to start reaping the first, timid results. However, fans of the saga will adore it unconditionally. One last tip: get yourself a nice arcade-style joystick. Any pad is simply inadequate. By: Mauro ~Skyrise~ Fanelli Virtua Fighter is one of the milestones of the three-dimensional video game. That sounds like a big statement, but it actually limits Yu Suzuki's arcade interpretation. The creation of a realistic fighting game, antithetical to the unserious exponents of the time, had in fact proved to be an even more significant intuition than polygonal graphics, influencing an entire generation and giving life to numerous hybrids. The same fate would have awaited the transpositions on consoles, epochal for several reasons: Virtua Fighter 2 was the definitive technical consecration of the Saturn, together with Sega Rally, while the bad conversion of the third chapter on the Dreamcast gave rise to several doubts about its actual potential. However, the most sensational event of the saga remains the transposition of VF4 on Ps2, announced following the inevitable decision of the historic software house to switch to multiplatform. The aesthetic results were not up to one of the most famous Sega teams, jointly due to the inexperience of AM2 on the new machine and the complex Sony hardware. Evolution, therefore, aims to remedy this hiccup, and at the same time to insert real innovations to justify the ambitious suffix.", "date": "2003-07-21", "grade": null}
