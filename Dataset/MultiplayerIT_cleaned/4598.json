GT Sport has finally completed its long, long journey and is available to all orphans of a series that can clearly be superimposed on the PlayStation brand, available since the dawn of the console and able to accompany it through several generations. In this regard, it is strange to think that it has given way to other titles - especially Forza Motorsport - on some of its strong points such as the number of cars and the presence of dynamic weather. This is why the suffix ~Sport~ is more eloquent than you think, a decisive change of direction to be verified if it is temporary or also adopted for future chapters. Before going into the review, we feel obliged to make a further clarification: if your console is not constantly connected to the Internet, forget it because most of the features and options will not be accessible, if you don't like racing EVEN against other opponents humans, the duration of your experience will be shorter than you are used to. Like a car show The initial menu is as always elegant and full of information, almost overwhelming. At least initially it is difficult to remember where the present modes are located, subsequently we appreciate some shortcuts such as the contextual one with the triangle key. Also from the interface Gran Turismo Sport therefore seems to be an automotive showcase almost more than a video game, thanks to a series of sections that in fact allow you to deepen the subject as never seen before. Inside the dealerships, for example, it is not only possible to buy the machines for each manufacturer - complete with a detailed description - but there is usually a channel with videos and a museum which traces the history of the car manufacturer year after year, with lots of historical photos and a parallel timeline that tells the most significant world events. A fantastic addition for enthusiasts, which tries to partially distract from one of the shortcomings of this chapter: yes, there is no career in the classic sense of the term, one that proposes objectives and races to be tackled in sequence, with requirements increasingly higher or with a story linked to the pilot. The concept of progression is entrusted to the player's profile: each activity on the track increases, for example, the credits, the mileage points accumulated, the experience gained. The latter defines the growth of the level, which allows you to get bonuses and above all unlock the tracks, up to the Nurburgring in the GP, 24 hour and Nordschleife versions. The miles can be exchanged in the dedicated section for helmets and overalls, cars not available elsewhere, special colours, driver poses and even upgrades, in such a way as to be able to increase the spectrum of weight and power available and use them when there are restrictions related to these two factors. Dulcis in fundo there is a section with objectives to be unlocked which flows into one's personal page, within which the photos taken, the replays, the liveries, the feed of one's friends are collected, with a system of followers in the style of Twitter. This, if we will, is the only really connecting part between the contents present, the one that pushes us to explore. The fulcrum of solitary play, in fact, is found within the section called ~Campagna~, which in turn is divided into three modes which have a very specific purpose, that of teaching how to drive and know each track by heart, in such a way to be competitive online. The Driving Academy replaces licenses with 48 tests/lessons which in fact expose the basics such as cornering, oversteer and understeer, and off-road driving. Each test is accompanied by a video that explains in detail how to tackle it, but also what it is talking about: in this way you really learn something, beyond the need to get the bronze to continue. The Missions mode is perhaps the closest to the classic career, as it offers 64 challenges ranging from complete races to one-make races, on dirt roads, endurance races over 15 or 30 laps complete with tire and petrol consumption, up to an entire streak dedicated to the Nurburgring Nordschleife, the wonderful ~green hell~. Dulcis in fundo the Experience on the Circuit: for each of the tracks it is possible to face specific sections up to the complete lap, with a view to at least obtaining the bronze medal and acquiring maximum knowledge of the track. An interesting way to keep leveling up and facingtare all the available circuits, giving importance to an aspect that usually does not have so much. Kazunori Yamauchi's graduation in Italy On 17 October Kazunori Yamauchi obtained an honorary master's degree in vehicle engineering at the ~Enzo Ferrari~ engineering department of the University of Modena. It is the first time that a gaming personality has received such recognition, and it is a historic moment for the whole industry beyond the sympathy for the Gran Turismo saga and its actual ability to simulate driving on the track. The merit was that of having brought the concept of virtual guide associated with its educational value into over 70 million homes, being the first to create a connection between the virtual video game and the manufacturers. Celebrating motoring with a disarming passion and sincerity, which have allowed many players to fall in love not only with the series, but also with motoring in general. Virtual driving school To successfully deal with the contents of the Campaign, it takes 10 to 15 hours if you are very good or are satisfied with bronze. To get to silver and gold, which allow you to get special machines, that value can easily increase. Then there is the Arcade mode, with three difficulty levels for each track and 19 opponents, the local split screen, the VR experience (to which we will return shortly) and the personalized race. In the end, there are things to do, but at the same time there would be room for more content because the missions, for example, although they are fun, almost seem to be a preparation appetizer for competitive play. Think that in the customized game you can change an impressive amount of parameters, from fuel consumption to mechanical damage, power restrictions and much more: the Polyphony developers could have used the same tool to create a more full-bodied and compelling single player mode. above all because in the current configuration the sense of progression is labile and the player is required to be ~enterprising~ in maximizing his knowledge of each track. In this aspect, Gran Turismo Sport succeeds very well, in any case, because never in a car title has there been so much dedication in superimposing virtual driving on teaching real concepts, applied to the granular knowledge of the circuits. The title of Polyphony makes you want to really improve and delve into elements that perhaps in the past were not considered, a bit like in general a good trophy system for a video game can do; it also encourages those who are not inclined towards competitive racing to try their hand online. Standard multiplayer provides a series of largely customizable user-created rooms, with the option of also assisting as a spectator; the Sport mode acts as a suffix to the title representing the foundation of the production and the litmus test for the future duration of the game. There are currently three daily races that repeat alternating every five minutes, but are always available to improve one's qualifying time and start the race ahead on the grid. Their rotation scheme is not yet clear: during the weekend there have been some changes by Polyphony on the entrance requirements and on the tracks, we assume that the developer is experimenting with the servers before changing every day and proposing a number major of competitions. Among other things, the first seasons will start from 4 November with the Polyphony, single-brand and advanced level championships; they will also serve as a testing ground for the official championships in collaboration with the FIA, the International Automobile Federation, which will give access to local and national prizes up to live racing, sublimating the GT Academy concept inaugurated a few years ago. The Sport mode is also governed by an interesting matchmaking system, linked to two main parameters: speed and sportsmanship. In the first case, the system selects opponents of similar skill to yours, in the second, those with the same degree of correctness. In fact, when you compete, smacking your opponents, cutting curves and performing other incorrect maneuvers lowers your rank, with the result of finding yourself in races full of new licensed bimbominkia; the goal is to encourage you to play clean at the cost of losing some positions but still gaining experience and credits. The system is far from perfect and is clearly still under balance by Polyphony, but actually improving our degree of sportsmanship we found ourselves pista with decidedly less aggressive and incorrect opponents, for a feeling that we have rarely experienced by playing online with a driving title. It remains essential to lower your qualifying time to start in the first positions, because especially in the initial corners there is the risk of getting entangled in the classic cauldron after which you end up off the track, but like iRacing it seemed to us one of the most advanced ever dedicated to online multiplayer in driving games. To make a first summary, if you don't go online in Sport or classic mode, or if you don't appreciate the extra components present, the title is a little short of breath, especially for those who until now were used to a classic Gran Turismo overflowing with cars (here there are only 165, at least of excellent quality), tracks and things to do without the need to stay connected to the Internet. However, what it offers has an aura of freshness and is less dispersive, always taking into account its new vocation. Guide for everyone Before making our judgment we were able to try Gran Turismo Sport in a multitude of configurations: with the pad, with 100 euro and 800 euro steering wheels, in VR, with all the aids activated and the exact opposite, to confirm that the model of guide of the production of Polyphony proves to be the most accessible available in a video game of the genre. Clearly less sophisticated than that of the best exponents, but not simplistic like an arcade game, since all the laws of physics that govern track driving are well present, and each car has a different driveability based on traction, torque and the other factors. Simply Gran Turismo Sport is more permissive in the application of simulation parameters, preferring pleasure to rigorous realism; this does not mean that playing with a good wheel equipped with force feedback (attention, the Thurstmaster T300 seems to have driver problems that we hope will be updated soon) and reducing the aids to a minimum, the involvement is rather satisfying, the roughness of the asphalt is well perceived and changes of direction, understeer and oversteer must be managed and each curve must be tackled in a different way, even more so if with a gradient. Compared to the previous chapters it is possible to see improvements in terms of physics of the cars and, as mentioned, driveability for each one, clearly the veterans of the series will immediately find themselves at home while lovers of extreme simulations will be disappointed, net of that ~Real Driving Simulator~ that it is good to remember that the term was coined at the time of the first PlayStation: now the mantra of the initial trailer is ~Driving for everyone~. The Achilles' heel remains, however, the damage and collision system. The aesthetic ones are reduced to the bone and limited to a few dents with many scratches, the mechanical ones we would define as ~scholastic~: if you crash at high speed the car loses power and control compromising the race, but never to the point of not being able to reach at the pit stop; especially the parts that are damaged are few. Among other things, the damage is practically absent in the single player Campaign and at the moment in Sport mode, available instead in custom games and suppose in future events. More interesting, however, is the penalty system, which adds seconds to recover by slowing down before the end of the race: a hybrid system which in any case induces you to drive correctly, but a solution which is not always able to fully satisfy you when you are rammed or taken from the side, always due to a balance still in progress. In short, with GT Sport you have fun looking for clean trajectories; facing pilots governed by artificial intelligence we noticed less immobility than the classic ~trains~, in fact we happened to see them go off the track or end up spinning due to single errors or in the overtaking phase. Endurance racing adds spice to the experience as you have to take into account tire and fuel wear, so plan your pit stops to minimize them but also go faster than your opponents as you can adjust the power curve in the race to consume more or less fuel in each lap. The tracks are quantitatively sufficient (17 settings for a total of 40 layouts) but the real ones are very few, as always the Nurburgring represents the non plus ultra of automotive satisfaction and is reproduced down to the smallest detail. Among the fictional tracks, the one we liked most is Lago Maggiore: with its curves, it has one of the best track designs we have appreciated in a car video game.
