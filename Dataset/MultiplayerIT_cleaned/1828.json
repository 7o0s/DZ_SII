{"name": "FIFA 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-2003_b.html", "text": "Audio Video As usual, the graphic aspect is simply stunning, with skins (facials above all) and an attention to detail (shirts, sponsors, stadiums, referees and linesmen included) that is sensational. The animations of the players deserve a separate discussion: they are probably the best ever seen in a football title. These run, bend, kick and lose their balance in a beautifully realistic way, thanks to the refinement in the use of motion capture. Particularly impressive are the animations that the players have during the sequences in which there is no play or moments of dead ball, such as during free-kicks or celebrations after goals: it's all a riot of movements, looks, smiles and truly hyper-realistic glances . From this point of view, Fifa has no rivals and also Winning Eleven 6 F.E. it is one step below. All this contrasts with a menu which, however beautiful in its simplicity and cleanliness, can be difficult to navigate. The audio section is also of the highest level with a stadium that experiences the match, complete with service voices, and a fairly punctual commentary even if Giovanni Galli sometimes speaks with a really marked Tuscan accent. It should be noted that sometimes the pairing formed by a Bruno Longhi in top form and a Galli in Pieraccioni mode is really hilarious. Finally playing football! The most important thing about this latest version is the already mentioned and finally happened, ~maturity~ of playability. The relationship with the Konami masterpiece is always merciless, but we can finally say that Fifa is a REAL football game and no longer a simple frantic and simplistic trivialization of the most loved sport in the world. Playing we notice a greater attention to phrasing and teamwork, with more careful defenses and tighter markings. That aptitude for hyper-fast and frenetic gaming that had caused the EA title to be mistaken several times for an 11 against 11 version of a pinball machine or at least an old-fashioned shooter has completely disappeared. The action is therefore more measured with launches and through balls to be made that require a pressure of the keys in charge with timing and measurement. Even the feints, particular moves and double steps, no longer occur by repeatedly pushing the back buttons of the pad, but by using the so-called ~Freestyle control~ which makes the player's control completely manual, giving the possibility to stretch the ball favoring the overcoming of the defender. So we will no longer see solo runs of a player who produces feints and assorted rotations worthy more of a samba dancer than a footballer. Now everything that was previously done with your eyes closed must be done with extreme timing and skill: it is natural that now the learning curve is no longer equal to zero as it once was, gratifying the player more. However, the usual defects of the title remain, i.e. the usual automatism in the conclusion phase (despite the inclusion of the power bar which works like in a rhythm game), and the extremely annoying sensation of players skating on the grass, historical problems, but which in the light of the latest improvements no longer appear to be insurmountable. Summing up Ultimately FIFA with this version skips the barricade, goes from a simple arcade to a decidedly more simulative game, always however remaining in the perspective of ease of use and superficial and immediate fun. The Winning Eleven series remains unbeatable but it must be admitted that the Fifa programmers have done an excellent job, putting an end to those excessively arcade characteristics of previous versions. If we add a cosmetic component of absolute value to this, we can draw a final picture which, strange but true, is certainly positive. Pros: graphics and detail of the highest level finally more realistic and simulative playability Cons: automatism subnet simulation component to be refined Change everything to not change anything? Like every year, as punctual as the Rai canon, the new version of Fifa arrives. The 2003 edition of the EA game rewards the patience of those players who have been waiting for a decent soccer game on pc for years. Mind you, we are not dealing with the definitive football simulation on the model of those created by Konami, but with a title that has been able to come to terms with a more adult game mechanic by partially sacrificing its extreme arcade component. First of all let's talk about the roster of the teams, as usual very complete and updated to the last stages of the summer transfer market: all the championships are presentThe most important European and non-European including gems such as the Swiss championship, rather than the Austrian one or an essential tournament like the Korean one. There are many competitions available to us, in addition to the classic international tournaments and the complete season, we can now try our hand at a sort of super league golden dream european league of Europe's most ambitious and generous presidents. But let's go in order.", "date": "2003-01-08", "grade": null}
