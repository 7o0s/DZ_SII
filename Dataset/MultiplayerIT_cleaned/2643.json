{"name": "NBA Live 2001", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-live-2001_a.html", "text": "Ball in play A few moments after turning on the black Sony monolith we are faced with a succulent introduction that shows images of the game based on a splendid R'& B' song. FMV more similar to a music video than an introductory film but capable of arousing excitement. And finally here is the good main menu where the choices will be wide and all capable of providing considerable entertainment. Let's start with the first available option: Play Now. It will catapult us straight into the heart of the action and in a few moments you will be running after that cursed ball that once again the opponents have intercepted. Exhibition offers the possibility to choose some parameters before sending us sweating on the field: game style, that is you will choose whether to play with the rules of an arcade or a simulation; skill level, i.e. the level of difficulty; finally you can adjust the duration of the times during the game. Season is what all fans of this sport want to undertake, that is a complete or customized season in which you will have to make your favorite team win the title of NBA champion. If you want a shorter championship you can always choose the Playoff mode. One on One instead allows you to play head-to-head between only two players. They will compete on a neighborhood field in a points match where whoever misses the fewest shots (from different positions) wins. Finally, EA Sports also includes the now usual Inside EA Sports mode in this game in which you will see tasty videos that contain various games from the software house. Many players love to customize their video game and even on this EA Sports meets us thanks not only to the usual options, but also to the Rosters mode. Within the latter you can create your own player or modify existing ones and you can form your personal team or make changes to the official ones. I highly recommend that you try to create your own basketball players because, thanks to all the modifiable features, you can create very funny characters. If, on the other hand, you are interested in statistics, the Stats option is for you. Here you will find everything about the players of the NBA and the teams of this incredible league. Now let's move on to action on the field. What makes this NBA Live 2001 a fun and extremely enjoyable title is the incredible simplicity with which you can create dizzying action and spectacular baskets. The controls are disconcertingly intuitive and it won't take you more than a while to have full possession of them. Every movement of the team is natural and realistic and for once the artificial intelligence of the opponents offers us a balanced challenge, neither too frustrating nor too easy. In short, an explosive mixture for a playability that is truly out of the ordinary. Indisputable quality EA Sports is the largest sports video game company on the planet. You can make use of the best programmers on the market and it won't take you long to understand that once again ~the licensing software house~ has put its staff to the test to create the best basketball game out there. Graphically we are at levels never reached by a title of this kind: the models are exactly like the real ones and all the details of the real players have been faithfully reproduced. The facial expressions will give you even more the semblance of being in front of a televised match. All the effects, from the reflections on the parquet to the spotlights, have been perfectly programmed. As far as the animations are concerned, we are on good levels even if the basketball players can sometimes be a bit plasticky. A final note to make concerns the audience which, despite being well done and polygonal for the first time, seems a bit approximate. I must say that, in my opinion, the best choice would have been to leave the audience in bitmaps (ie two-dimensional). Overall, however, we are at monstrous levels. As for the sound I can say that everything was done superbly. From the screeching of shoes on the pitch to the players' voices talking to each other, everything has been taken care of down to the smallest detail. Surely, however, what impressed me the most are the accompanying music (all rap), or rather the ones you will hear when entering the menus. Absolutely exhilarating and appropriate to the frenetic pace of the action. Inevitable conclusions Nice nice nice. This NBA Live 2001 really convinced me. Not only is it splendid dfrom a technical point of view, but it will keep you entertained for many and many games. In short, I can't help but recommend it to everyone, regardless of your personal tastes, since a title like this is better not to let it get away! Pros -Stellar gameplay -Graphics and sound at levels never reached in a title of its genre -A very long-lived title Cons -Sometimes the players seem a bit too stiff -Approximate audience NBA Live Few Software-houses have managed in recent years to give due importance to a sport often mistreated by the European public. A team game that especially in Italy took a long time to establish itself. I'm talking about basketball, a typically American sport which, thanks to legendary sagas such as NBA Live, has finally achieved notoriety all over the world. EA Sports has always worked excellently on the titles of the NBA Live series and again in this 2001 edition it offers us an amazing title that lives up to the most optimistic expectations.", "date": "2001-01-22", "grade": null}
