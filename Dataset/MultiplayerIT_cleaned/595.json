{"name": "ATV Offroad Fury 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/atv-offroad-fury-3.html", "text": "Never change a winning team In reality, ATV Offroad Fury 3 immediately reveals itself for what it is: the classic ~alternative~ racing game made in the USA. This means quad-bike (or motocross, in other cases), aerial acrobatics and a signed punk soundtrack, together with a technical realization that in most cases barely exceeds the sufficiency. The mix is proposed again as it is for this title too, with some differences that we will slowly illustrate. After the classic (that too!) filmed introduction, which shows an incredible series of evolutions and stunts on quad-bikes, it is possible to choose between the various game modes. Again there is nothing new under the sun: it is possible to play single races or an entire career, but it is advisable to start with the detailed tutorial which will explain exactly how our vehicle works, how to set the curves in the best way and how to tackle the jumps. It must be said that the control system is rather immediate and the only difficulties are found only in the correct setting of the tricks, which for this kind of products are indeed a constant but are also generally ends in themselves: the moment you you will realize that they are worth little in the competition economy, you will drastically limit their use for a less spectacular but more effective conduct. The product created by Climax Studios boasts a graphic realization well above the average. Game structure and quad-biking psychology The immediacy of the control system has been mentioned. It is more or less the setting that is usually found in ~very arcade~ racing games, therefore without the use of the gearbox, and which in ATV Offroad Fury 3 proves to be practical and effective. Fortunately there are no problems in responding to the commands: the quad-bike reacts promptly to the stresses of the analog stick and you can immediately set each trajectory in the correct way. The developers have focused heavily on ~controlled drift~ to remain competitive in the race, and this means tackling tight curves by holding down one of the back buttons to be able to overcome them without losing speed. Speed that varies according to the vehicle selected before departure: you can opt for a ~balanced~ solution or prefer a better ~stretch~ rather than a dazzling recovery. As previously written, during the inevitable jumps you can perform various stunts that will make us earn precious points, even without counting that much in the race itself, which is still won by whoever crosses the finish line first. Performing tricks is quite simple once you understand the mechanism, but unfortunately, even in this game their importance is marginal and you will tend to prefer a safe landing to a risky one, with the potential loss of time and positions. Technical realization Even if the premises for ATV Offroad Fury 3 weren't the best, and even if the game remains essentially identical to many others of the same vein, the product created by Climax Studios boasts a graphic realization well above the average. Accustomed to dancing frame rates, poorly detailed polygonal models and sparse settings, you will find a pleasant exception in this title: the polygons move fluidly and without particular uncertainties, no defects are noticed in the construction of the objects and the level of detail is decent. Comparing ATVOF3 to Gran Turismo 4 is obviously blasphemy, but the comparison with other motocross, quad-bike, tricycle and various stroller ~simulators~ is won without too many problems. The speech is different as regards the sound commentary, given that these are songs taken from the repertoire of some punk groups combined with a series of effects that do not shine for originality or quality. The whole thing is decidedly ~heard before~ (a million times?). Comment ATV Offroad Fury is a decently made title, which offers the same contents as most of the games of the same genre in a decidedly more refined form, both in terms of aesthetics and gameplay. Tackling the races and the ~minigames~ is quite fun, even if the feeling of having to do with something that is neither fish nor fowl is felt right away if you are a lover of racing games in the strict sense. So it is a product that is aimed at a specific target, certainly not for everyone but to buy if you like the genre. Pros: Good level of graphic design Reliable control system Signed soundtrack Cons: Virtually identical to other titles of the genre You have to love the genre and in Italy this is not at all obvious. The fall of a meteorite causes a terrible and extraordinary event: quad bikesand from all over the world they acquire their own evil conscience. And so they set off on their own and go around towns and cities, bouncing happily on every human being who recklessly finds himself crossing the road when they arrive. When the situation becomes clear, a handful of brave men storm a military arsenal to face the terrible scooters with grenades and bazookas. Well, maybe you fell for it.", "date": "2006-03-06", "grade": null}
