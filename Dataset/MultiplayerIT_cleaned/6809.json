After the pairing Monsters University and The Lone Ranger that accompanied the first episode of last year, this time the link is with Guardians of the Galaxy, a successful feature film directed by James Gunn based on the comic of the same name, finally released in the United States in the summer recently arrived in Italian cinemas, among the last ever to receive the film. Within Disney Infinity 2.0, the Guardians of the Galaxy inspired the creation of an entire dedicated Play Set, which goes alongside the Avengers one contained in the Starter Pack and the Spider-Man one available separately and which we have covered on these pages . The one from Guardians of the Galaxy is the best of the Worlds so far available in Disney Infinity 2.0 Also in this case the sale price is set at  29.99, by paying out which you can take home a couple of characters - Star-Lord and Gamora - together with the totem to be placed on the portal to access the game world. Three other statuettes can be purchased individually, at around 13 each, dedicated to Ronan, Rocket and Drax. By collecting the appropriate tokens it is also possible to use Iron Man and Nova, within a somewhat forced crossover but which increases the total number of missions. Once the description of the premises has been completed, it is therefore time to move on to the playful contents of this Play Set, which as usual result in an unpublished adventure with strong action colors structured in missions. The first and most evident advantage of this World is evidently that of offering - finally - a different setting compared to that of Manhattan which instead acted as a theater for the other two similar contents previously mentioned. It is in fact the space colony Everywhere, a familiar location as it is used both in the comic and in the film. It is rather interesting to note that the developer in charge of bringing this Play Set to life is Studio Gobo, a London team that already distinguished itself last year for the World of Pirates of the Caribbean, probably the best of the initial trio included in the first Disney Infinity. In this case, the programmers have chosen a decidedly more linear approach than that found in the adventures of the Avengers and Spider-Man: although there are missions and secondary activities, the main thread passes through tasks that practically do not contemplate any free roaming ambitions, preferring accompany the user towards the goal without digressions. Usually the missions are also quite short, thus ensuring the achievement of the set goals more frequently. A choice, we have to say, that we particularly appreciated: in the other Play Sets, the freedom offered to the player was actually more of a facade element, mortified by the lack of interaction with the environment and the limited density of contents and things to do. By reducing the ambitions, Studio Gobo has managed to give more sense and pace to the adventure, ultimately making it simply better than the others already available in Disney Infinity 2.0. The same goes for the technical component: smaller environments have made possible a more concentrated use of resources, and the result is a decidedly pleasant graphic component, with clean textures and more than discreet effects, and above all with a dynamism and a quantity of elements in movement absolutely extraneous to the rather bare and static Manhattan of Spider-Man and the Avengers. The sound is also great, but this is a trademark for the franchise. Certainly the London team did not do a perfect job, mind you, above all - and it is rather serious - as regards the exploitation of the material available: the plot is in fact very weak and the characters have little characterization, factors which are rather incomprehensible considering the goodness of the source original. The overall duration of the main adventure is also modest, shorter than the other Play Sets, thus reducing its value in terms of the relationship between price and content. More generally, this world of the Guardians of the Galaxy suffers from the intrinsic flaws of the gameplay of Disney Infinity 2.0, which we have already extensively described in the dedicated review. It is therefore ultimately obvious that this new Play Set is aimed at the public who appreciated the offer of Disney Infinity 2.0, and who want to be able to expand it with a new world based on the universe of Guardians of the Galaxy. Our criticisms remain addressed to the weakness of the Starter Pack offer for this kind of content, referring to the necneed to buy separate Play Sets to be able to strengthen it accordingly; but turning a blind eye to the marketing choices, we feel we can evaluate this World as the best among those made available by Disney production so far.", "date": "2014-10-27", "grade": null}
