{"name": "Beat Saber", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beat-saber-recensione.html", "text": "Before starting the real review of Beat Saber, we allow ourselves a sincere applause to the small Beat Games team authoring the title: despite a double debut (both in the virtual reality and in the rhythm game fields) that would have made wrists even to far more proven companies, the Czech studio has been able to juggle great, completing what is undoubtedly one of the most valid exponents of the genre this year and also one of the best experiences for PlayStation VR in an absolute sense. So let's find out what are the ingredients of Beat Saber that have contributed to the creation of such a successful formula. Gameplay and mechanics Let's immediately clarify that to play Beat Saber the use of the Move controllers is essential, and the reason is obvious: in the virtual space, the user holds a red lightsaber in his left hand and a blue one in his right, and these are the the only two tools he will need to be able to deal with the 15 musical tracks that make up the package. The gameplay takes up the classic Dance Dance Revolution mechanics that are the basis of practically every existing rhythm game, but reworking them in an absolutely fresh way and building a structure around them that finds fertile ground in the VR environment. Basically, it is necessary to cut the red and blue blocks that move to the rhythm of the music towards the player with the sword of the same color, directing the blow in the direction indicated by the arrow above them. Landing hits in succession activates the well-known mechanism of combos and score multipliers, while missing a block or making a wrong cut decreases an energy bar which, if completely depleted, leads to game over. What might seem like a trivial operation is obviously made more demanding by a whole series of variables that increase the level of general challenge beyond the obvious differences between one song and another: ranging from the presence of mines that touch the walls with the blades that must be avoided by physically moving to the side or crouching down, until you get to blocks that change arrangement at the last moment forcing sudden changes of posture. The software is decidedly precise in detecting the movements of the Moves, and rewards with more consistent scores every slash that is performed with sufficient rotation of the arm and that hits the central part of the block. As it is easy to understand from what has been written so far, Beat Saber is one of those products that are so immediate to assimilate in their fundamental mechanics as difficult to master at the deepest layers: it literally takes a few seconds to find yourself dancing, waving your swords left and right, but being able to get to the bottom of the most complicated tracks at Expert level is truly something for the chosen few. Straight case and neon lights The campaign mode of the game serves precisely to lead the user by the hand along the difficulty curve of Beat Saber, making him face the various tracks several times with the addition of specific objectives or particular modifiers: not everything always works perfectly (certain parameters seem almost counterproductive and there are potentially frustrating bottlenecks), but it's still a well-crafted component that instills some healthy single player longevity into the product. Free Play and Party are the other two sections of the main menu, which respectively allow you to dance to individual songs with a handful of customizable settings and to play multiplayer by passing your helmet and marking your name in the ranking at the end of the performance. In whatever solution you play it, Beat Saber remains a very fun and also decidedly training experience, considering all the calories that are burned to move in time with the objects on the screen. In any case, a rhythm game cannot be defined as such without a tracklist worthy of the name, and fortunately also in this case the work done by the Czech team was impeccable: specially composed for the occasion, Beat Saber's songs offer a discrete variety (although they all fall within the great ensemble of dancing electronics) and are extremely engaging, also thanks to a game design capable of making the most of them. It's just a shame for their not astounding number, which we hope will be integrated with future updates. The overview is closed by an extremely functional but very pleasant technical realization in its use of neon and which does not disdain some concessions to style, with valuable light and distortion effects and geometric shapes that move on the backdrops.", "date": "2018-12-19", "grade": "8.7"}
