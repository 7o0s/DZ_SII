Will it work? Fiat Rhythm Neon Drive presents a playful offer without too many frills, which manifests itself in a very simple main menu in which it is possible to select one of the three levels that make up the game, customize the license plate of the car or spend 1.99 to remove the (few ) advertisements that serve as a sustenance to the product. That the one created by Fraoula is a very direct title is confirmed by the actual playful action, so immediate and intuitive that it does not require the support of any tutorial. On the screen stands a car traveling on a four-lane road, and the player's task is to move it left and right by tapping the edges of the touchscreen to avoid the obstacles encountered along the way. The interesting thing is that these barriers reach the bottom of the display to the rhythm of the background music, making Neon Drive's gameplay a sort of Guitar Hero in reverse: where in fact in the Activision title (and in all similar rhythm games) it is required to press a key when the corresponding indicator reaches the bottom of the screen, here you have to move the car in order to occupy the empty spaces left by the obstacles placed along the road with the same timing. Although there isn't a system that rewards the most skilled users to keep in time with extra points, the model at the base of Neon Drive works well, and following the music track can actually help to better dodge the barriers: however, Fraoula it got a bit carried away on the challenge level front, considering that the three levels are all quite long and minimal contact means having to start over. It would have been decidedly better to propose a greater number of internships characterized by a shorter duration. Neon Drive has style and originality but suffers in content and difficulty balance Beautiful at night If in terms of gameplay Neon Drive stumbles into some ingenuity, from a technical point of view it proves to be an absolutely mature and well-made product. The graphic component of the Fraoula title is a real feast for the eyes, even if it is not incredibly complex: working mainly on light effects and color palettes, the developers have set up a fluid, highly polished and especially style-laden cosmetic system as for the futuristic settings that form the backdrop to the races. There are also some touches of class that embellish one's progress along the way, such as sudden changes of scenery or decisive camera movements, for a truly well-finished title in this respect. Considering the emphasis placed on the rhythm, the soundtrack plays an important role that Neon Drive has managed impeccably: the music by the Swedish artist Pengus performs their task in a big way, proving to be not only perfectly in keeping with the style 80s that pervades the entire work but above all managing to provide real audio support to the gameplay of the product. It is a pity that, beyond the unholy balancing of the difficulty we mentioned earlier, the developers of Fraoula have also proved to be not very clever with regard to the amount of content included in the package: with only three progressively unlockable levels and no semblance of an alternative mode or a system capable of stimulating players to seek a better score, Neon Drive is likely to end up in oblivion very soon.", "date": "2015-11-19", "grade": "7.0"}
