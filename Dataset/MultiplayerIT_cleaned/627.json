{"name": "Urban Reign", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/urban-reign.html", "text": "Urban Reign looks like a kind of hybrid between a massive fighting game and one with polygonal encounters. In some ways it is similar to the scrolling ones of the eighties and nineties, reinterpreted a bit in the manner of the successful Spike Out. However, the fact that it presents itself with a huge range of characters with individual characteristics, combined with the search for a certain variety in the shots available and in the various methods of confrontation as an alternative to mass ones, it would seem to betray a desire to bring it closer to games like Tekken in terms of depth. In reality, things turned out differently than expected. Urban Reign basically splits into two possible game types. The first is the story mode. In this mode the player has to go through one hundred battles spread across a city map. So, whoever picks up the controller thinking he's facing a great myriad of enemies like in the old days of Final Fight actually takes in a hundred encounters with a variable amount of enemies or allies, preceded by a spoken briefing that goes back to the main storyline and by an animated and dubbed presentation. In the other type of game, the player has access to a multiplayer that puts up to four characters, human or computer controlled, in teams ready to fight each other. The practical mode and the extras, with the ritual options, complete the playful offer. Now, the point is that Urban Reign feels like a kind of game-wide extension of some extra mode from the Tekken series or Soul Calibur, repurposed and prepackaged to make a new game out. And an extra mode of any code, with a more limited control and set of actions and accompanied by an obvious and stereotypical plot, is not enough to make a new fighting game. Urban Reign offers the player a set of attack combinations, a dodge, the ability to run, various special shots including one at three hundred and sixty degrees to get rid of enemies, and a series of interesting moves to perform with allies, among which stand out the passage of the weapon, the attacks in two and the call of the ally to beat together the unfortunate victim blocked by the player. Additions, like others we'll talk about, that are well thought out, but never work as well as they should. We take the opportunity to hit enemies at different heights of the body, directing the damage to certain already stressed parts of the enemy. The continuous rotation of the perspective makes it in fact impractical to direct the shots with the direction of the controller, with the consequence that the procedure is only useful to the CPU, which will rage against the player. Then there is the question of targeting the enemy, borrowed from Z-Targeting introduced to the world of battle in tredd by Zelda. The fact of being able to select an enemy is more often resolved in turning your back on all the others than in a real advantage over the single enemy targeted. We come to dodges. In the game it is not possible to parry blows, only to press the dodge key with timing for each blow to dodge, trying to gain the adequate advantage for the counterattack as a reward. All this only produces frustration, especially when enemies and dodging shots are all around and the dodging process is completely invalidated  dodging no longer works, turning the player into a training bag that is forced, if he ever desperately succeeds to free oneself, to regain the ~two-dimensional~ position with respect to the row of enemies to be beaten. Finally, let's move on to the difficulty of the opponents and artificial intelligence. They are badly calibrated, suddenly going from slow and stupid enemies to monsters of ultraviolence that don't even make the player touch the ground, peppering him with juggling combos and area grabs, counter-counter-countering every possible move and frustrating any attempt to build strategic combat in in favor of constant, unsatisfying, frustrating button mashing. Even moves such as flying combos, aerial grapples, counter moves and tag moves are soon thwarted by the type of interaction required to survive: the overlapping of enemies and their frantic hyperactivity can only be defeated with timing button mashing, and they nullify any strategic attempt. Then there are choices that are only apparently incomprehensible at the level of game design, such as the decision to progressively make the available moves available during the progress of the missions, which makes clear the attempt to lengthen an attraction that the player loses around the tenth, chaotic match. Or the useless gesture of insertion by Marshall Law and Paul Phoenix from Tekken: if video game characters really exist ina parallel world, the two will be busy producing snot complaining about a ruined curriculum. In short, once again the contemporary attempt to produce a massive three-dimensional fighting game fails completely. The presence in Urban Reign's credits of many of the talents working on quality Namco series such as Tekken - programmers, artists, and so on - is not enough for a project without strong game design to be meaningful and enjoyable, and it says a lot about the kind of deadline assigned to the title by the production. You've never seen a scrolling beat 'em up so fragmented and uncontrollable, and not even a match fight so superficial. To annoy the player, not too satisfied with a game that could have been played in a very different way, the now obligatory narration, which we all adore, will take care of it. This is the usual variation on the theme of urban violence, and features a tough guy so tough, but so tough that, during the introduction, he hits up two guys on the street discussing the latest gang violence in the city for no real reason: just because they insult him because he is eavesdropping on their conversation. .The protagonist, evidently an incarnation of a cynical reflection on urban violence so subtle as not to be understood by most, obeys the orders of a buxom oriental underworld woman who, one day, feels threatened by her rivals and logically decides to hire him - alone - to eliminate all others, without exception: one after another. The contemporary chart music and the clothing styles of the various urban thugs and gangsters complete the, so to speak, contemporary and plausible dimension of the events. Urban Reign is a game, unfortunately, not very successful. It's a shame, because it presents a good amount of ideas that could have said something sensible in the attempt to revive the genre. But at the same time it demonstrates that, in today's desire to produce massive fighting games, hasty production, without solid game design, is not enough. At Namco they have packaged an often chaotic game that tends to be played in a superficial way, because good ideas get stuck in the player's confusion and frustration. Let's overlook the fact that you should always have a plot even when it's not needed, and necessarily uninteresting. The marketing sector of Urban Reign would almost seem to want to suggest that those who want to beat their hands with a joypad today must be someone who likes rushed products. Now, there is often a bias in the video game industry and critics that ~new~ is always better than ~old.~ That's not always the case. If we want to be ultra-violent and controller-virtuous, let's go back to playing Streets of Rage. And if instead we want to hit but also think, let's turn to The Warriors. Pros The set of shots and combinations is varied There are many ideas and potentially great gimmicks Cons The interaction is very chaotic and prevents you from fully exploiting the shots The challenge level is too low or incredibly frustrating Plot without a minimum of irony or inventiveness <strong>Urban Reign</strong> Urban Reign is yet another proof of the fact that the digital games industry has been thinking insistently, in recent times, of dusting off the classic genre of massive scrolling fighting games. Yes, just the ones we talked about recently, those of the smoky arcades that are no longer there and sixteen-bit consoles. At the same time, Namco's fighting game is yet another demonstration of another fact: this industry has understood the reinterpretation of the genre in a very superficial way, allocating very little investment to the search for gameplay remodeled on new hardware and styles of play. Urban Reign looks more like a hasty commercial production, set up to cover a market niche reopened by titles like Capcom's Beat Down, than a real attempt to adapt the old genre to contemporary tastes and beautiful polygonal engines. Now, Urban Reign, while remaining superior to very low-caliber titles such as Beat Down and presenting itself not without interesting ideas, fails to revive the genre or to be played in a really fun way.", "date": "2006-02-09", "grade": null}
