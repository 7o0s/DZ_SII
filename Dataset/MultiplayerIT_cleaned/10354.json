{"name": "L'eliminatore", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72432-eliminate-leliminatore.html", "text": "In the overcrowded playful panorama of the iPhone, Eliminate managed to make a name for itself even before its actual appearance on the App Store: developed by ngmoco (famous for the excellent Rolando), the game not only stood as the first FPS focused on multiplayer online, but was the bearer of an innovative commercial logic linked to its distribution. Let's see if, behind all these beautiful premises, there is also a noteworthy game. We were so eliminated First of all, let's talk about the particular way in which ngmoco has decided to monetize with this Eliminate: the title can be downloaded for free from the App Store, and the software house's profit is generated by the micro-transactions that regulate the purchase of the battery packs essential to deal with profit online matches. It starts with twenty units of energy, which are consumed game after game: once the stocks have run out, the user can decide to wait 90 minutes to enjoy a recharge and thus start playing again, or buy one of the various packages available at various price points. In the intention of the developers, this last opportunity is made attractive not only by the alleged involvement of Eliminate's gameplay, but above all by the upgrade race that forms the backdrop to the real FPS action: doing well in deathmatches against human opponents, in fact, you earn credits that can be spent to buy new weapons and armor capable of giving your digital alter-ego an edge. It is still possible to play with flat batteries both offline and online, but this does not bring any benefit in terms of credits. Moving on to a more strictly playful level, there is no doubt that Eliminate is a product that is in some ways revolutionary: beyond the original distribution method, the title offers the possibility to try your hand at online matches with great ease (using both the Wi-Fi fi is the 3G one), without a shadow of lag or various problems. Of course, the clashes are open to a maximum of four players and the arenas are not particularly large, but the result obtained by the developers is still remarkable. Too bad that, in the face of all these positives, Eliminate is decidedly less exciting if taken as a stand-alone FPS. First of all, the control system turns out to be substantially unsuitable for managing the frenzy of a deathmatch: you move using two virtual sticks placed on the side of the screen, you touch the center of the HUD to shoot and the lower part to jump. The result is absolutely cumbersome, and requires a good dose of patience to be assimilated: it must be said that the autofire option improves things, but even in this case it is not always easy to aim the crosshairs at a moving opponent. Again, the balance of weapons is off in favor of a pair of absolutely devastating tools, capable of making anyone who knows how to use them with a minimum of skill essentially invincible. All elements that can lead to abandon Eliminated after a couple of games, causing all the upgrade mechanics that make up its essence to fall into the void.
