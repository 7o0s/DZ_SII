In fact, it is not every day that a new bestseller is pulled out of the hat, and indeed one can even end up stumbling upon less fortunate projects such as the latest Fish Out of Water and Band Stars: with this Colossatron: Big World Threat, however, Halfbrick she immediately got up... The colors of devastation As has happened so far for many titles produced by Halfbrick, Colossatron: Great Threat World is also the result of a mix between different sources of inspiration that lead to the creation of something that perhaps cannot be defined properly new, but which certainly smells like such: therefore here is that influences from Snake, Zuma and the Japanese cartoons of robots therefore constitute the basis of an experience to which the Australian developers have given their very personal trademark. The protagonist is the modular mechanical monster that gives the title to the game, which must be helped by the user in the not very noble enterprise of destroying planet Earth one city at a time. As per Halfbrick tradition, the gameplay is extremely simple to assimilate, to the point that the application doesn't even bother to provide large tutorial screens: framed from a top view, Colossatron therefore moves autonomously, while the main task of the player is to drag the pods that float on the screen and assimilate them into the body of the destructive machine to form a sort of train and thus increase the fire capacity. These components are distinguished by three main colors (red, yellow and blue), to which a different type of weapon is associated, and by lining up three identical units, these merge to form a single larger and more powerful wagon: it is also possible to combine the right pods to obtain specimens with secondary colors (green, orange and purple) which in turn have particular offensive characteristics. Then there are special components that guarantee Colossatron temporary benefits (shields, smart bombs and so on), but even the pods that are destroyed by enemy fire are subject to user control: before they explode causing damage to the protagonist, in fact, they can be removed from the convoy and launched towards the desired target, using their conflagration to their advantage. These are the foundations of a product that immediately proves to be very exciting and amusing due to the rate of devastation that it is capable of producing in a short time, but which in any case hides a depth and a Colossatron enhancement system that prove capable of keep the entertainment alive for quite a while. Colossatron: Great World Threat marks the return of Halfbrick in a big way A colossus for a friend Every time the capital of one of the seven continents that make up the fictitious world created by Halfbrick is destroyed, Colossatron levels up and the user can choose one of the various persistent upgrades that are offered to him, which more or less modify noticeably the playful feeling. The money earned by razing cities can instead be spent between one stage and another to repair the convoy, change the order of the pods or add new ones, while the so-called Prisms are needed to access the actual upgrades: these they allow both to increase the armor of each of the six types of wagons, and to make one of the three weapons assigned to each color available forever, which otherwise rotate with a cadence indicated by a special counter. Although they are the protagonists of the inevitable in-app purchases, Prisms can also be obtained simply by playing, albeit in limited quantities which make the upgrade process much slower. The grinding is somehow encouraged by the possibility granted to repeat the internships already passed at any time to aim for a better score to compare with that of one's friends in the appropriate online rankings. Furthermore, Colossatron: Great World Threat is so fun and messy (in the best sense of the term) that the conventional path of progress in the levels almost takes a back seat: the title is in fact also suitable for short games, good only to welcome the disaster that can be developed, otpromptly reproduced by two-dimensional graphics that literally fill the screen with military vehicles, laser beams, explosions and so on and so forth, even making it difficult to distinguish the elements with which to interact in the most agitated phases. Then the newscast imprinted on the entire product is really nice, with a bust describing the exploits of Colossatron between one level and another and a correspondent on the field who comments on the actions of the mechanical monster on the game scenario, all accompanied from the graphic elements typical of the news.", "date": "2013-12-19", "grade": "8.8"}
