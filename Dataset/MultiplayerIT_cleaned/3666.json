{"name": "VA-11 HALL-A", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/va-11-hall-a-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Cyberpunk is one of those subgenres of real science fiction that has made more contributions to the gaming world in recent years, and we're not just thinking about the highly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 from CD Project Red. Minor and indie productions remind, even more frequently than the more famous titles, how the genre still has many stories to tell, many characters to present and even gameplay mechanics that would not even occur to the most imaginative player. VA-11 HALL-A was released on PC in 2016 and probably should have carried the flag for all the other indies born with the same intentions; instead it ended up being known only to a niche of enthusiasts. But perhaps its most recent release on Nintendo Switch (whose conversion we will examine in this review) could represent the moment of redemption and greater notoriety. So let's take a closer look at the story and the offer of a title as atypical as it is fascinating. Plot: dystopia and bartender The most successful indies are those that start as an amateur product, and then receive enough funding from interested players and enough patience from the developers to be successfully completed. The story of VA-11 HALL-A is therefore one of those with a happy ending: the game was released in 2016 on Windows, Linux and OS X, with the promise of subsequent porting also for PlayStation Vita and iOS devices. Not that the conversions were technically a published feat: this is a title that draws heavily from 1980s PC-98 games; if you are easily enraptured by the pixelated graphics, by the extreme stylistic care based on inlays of the aesthetic sector and by the sufficiently varied electronic music, you will hardly be able to ignore the new conversion that has recently also landed on Nintendo Switch. The idea of a new port seems decidedly sensible: VA-11 HALL-A belongs to a niche genre but very valid in its structural elements, and above all in the plot it wants to tell, therefore the arrival on the Nintendo portable console could contribute at least a little to greater notoriety among the general public. Unfortunately, the latter will undoubtedly be hampered, and unfortunately we must tell you right away, by the presence of only the English language, even three years after the original publication: it is probably a problem linked to purely economic aspects, but in a work that is fundamentally narrative will be a major obstacle for all non-English speakers. Even considering the frequent puns, slang, metaphorical language and other far from marginal details. Before even talking about the plot of VA-11 HALL-A, to try to frame the genre to which the title belongs, it is worth starting from the initial definition provided by the developers themselves, i.e. the Sukeban Games team: a visual novel that at the same tempo is also a bartending simulator, which puts the player in the role of a professional bartender (we'll come back to this later). The Cyberpunk of VA-11 HALL-A can therefore be framed in the context of dystopia, an imaginary future in which technology has progressed very, very quickly but without really leading to an improvement in the lifestyle of the population, or even to its happiness. The world is now in the hands of a few powerful corporations, human beings are contaminated by nanotechnology and the regime of the White Knights (the White Knights, a sadly ironic symbolic combination) checks that the law is respected, always and by everyone. In this context not exactly marked by collective happiness, the player plays the role of Julianne Natalie Stingray, for friends Jill, a 27-year-old girl who works at VA-11 HALL-A, a bar in the fictitious town of Glitch City affectionately called Valhalla by its patrons. The irony of the developers is a characterizing trait of the entire production: just as ~the bad guys~ are the White Knights (a color traditionally associated with goodness, peace and purity), a simple and anonymous bar in the slums of a super-technological city is called Valhalla, the most majestic of the halls of Asgard in Norse mythology. Gameplay: between visual novel and simulator The context of VA-11 HALL-A is essential to be able to appreciate and fully understand the production of Sukeban Games, but all those who are fascinated by a generic Cyberpunk must be aware of the strengths and limitations of the gameplay. On balance, the game is nothing more than a pleasant story, told through the many dialogues between Jill (the bartender) and the otherre personalities, frequenters of the place where he works or colleagues and friends. Among the latter we note the presence of Gillian and leave you the pleasure of discovering all the others: Gillian will guide the player in the first moments of the title, grappling with a short tutorial dedicated to what on balance is also the only, precise, interminable, unavoidable game mechanics, that is bartending. We'll explain it more simply: Jill is the employee of the bar, and as such she has to prepare the drinks for all those who order one. The player's task is therefore to know the recipes of the drinks and mix the respective ingredients easily and in the right doses: a practical notebook will allow you to get a more precise idea of the main ingredients to draw on (there are about seven), but the freedom of combinations will still remain in the hands of the protagonist. Depending on how we dose the various components, our patrons will be more or less satisfied with the service, they will remain more or less lucid during the conversation, they will decide to stay more or less long in Jill's company: each of them has precise tastes and a particular nature, and from the encounter between all these components (and from Jill's answers) it will be possible to unlock the different answers and narrative lines. A badly dosed drink, therefore, will preclude certain lines of dialogue; an excellent bartending instead will open all the doors of the various narrative junctions. The only problem with VA-11 HALL-A is basically just that: the obvious limitations of a gameplay that asks the player to always do the same thing in different ways, sometimes with a truly manic level of precision; the level of refinement required in the preparation of drinks certainly cannot protect against boredom and the repetitiveness of the actions, identical for all the hours necessary to complete the main adventure (and there are many). On the other hand VA-11 HALL-A is in its essence a story, an articulated, pleasant and inspired story in a futuristic and dystopian world: those looking for just this (and preferably only this) in the production will hardly have anything to complain about of the developers. The narration continues pleasantly without major twists and turns, but one always has the feeling of revealing important and fundamental details in the life of the various personalities who frequent the bar: these are original and ~similar~ characters, who belong to various social strata of the local population. Everyone seems to be perpetually looking for a solid point in their existence, for a glimmer of happiness in an existence that is all in all programmed and gray. The influences of Blade Runner and 1984 are many and clear: in itself the narrative approach is not a limitation of the production, but its supporting structure. A few not bad goodies before saying goodbye: it is possible to furnish Jill's room, select some songs from the soundtrack to play on her smartphone and read the main news of the city in the local news App.", "date": "2019-05-18", "grade": "8.0"}
