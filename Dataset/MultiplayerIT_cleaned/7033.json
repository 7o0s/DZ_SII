Just scroll through the catalog of a store like Steam to find dozens of 8 and 16-bit style platformers or shooters alongside more modern productions. The problem is that often these are very mediocre attempts to leverage the nostalgic soul of gamers, rather than games properly cared for to remember the classics of yesteryear. Fortunately, this is not the case with Shovel Knight from Yacht Club Games, which we can define as an act of love towards the NES and those 80s that meant so much to our world. Scheduled for September 2013, then delayed until today, Shovel Knight has been a success since its appearance on Kickstarter, where it raised approximately three hundred and eleven thousand dollars, far exceeding the seventy-five thousand initially requested. But what is so fascinating about the adventures of an armored warrior armed with a shovel? To find out, you can just grab a good joypad, perhaps an 8-bit console style, and start playing. Will a shovel be enough for Shovel Knight to bury the competition and be the best platformer of the year? Differences between versions Each version of Shovel Knight has unique features that are worth mentioning, although we can guarantee that they do not change the overall gaming experience. Above all, these are some extras linked to the platform of use or some additional options that those who own the specific gaming machine might like to know. So let's see the exclusive features version by version: Wii U Miiverse support from Digger's Diary. In each scenario you can leave comments similar to what you do in Dark Souls, so that other players can read them Shovel Knight supports virtually all official controllers that connect to Wii U: WiiU Gamepad, WiiU Pro Controller, Wii Remote, Wii Remote + Nunchuck, Wii Classic Controller and Wii Classic Controller Pro You can use the touch screen for quick item selection on Nintendo 3DS 3D support (obviously 3D is absent if playing on Nintendo 2DS) StreetPass Battle Arena. Added support for Play Coins (can be exchanged for gold) You can use the touch screen for quick item selection on PC / Mac Added Steam Trading Cards Support for Steam Achievements Cloud saving Support for Big Picture mode Support for all compatible controllers Shovel and wisdom Shovel Knight and Shield Knight were always together. The armored pair cleaned up towers and castles at will, restoring justice and candor where the forces of evil had planted roots. Then one day it all ended. The two fell into a trap that cost Shield Knight his life. Shovel Knight, inconsolable and guilt-ridden, withdrew from the world by digging daisies on the steep slopes of despair. Some passages require a lot of coordination But the bad guys are always lurking and running away doesn't turn off remorse. The kingdom soon comes under the yoke of his enemies. Shovel Knight then decides to return to action, shovel in hand, to permanently erase the forces of chaos from existence! Even if we dramatized it a little too much, this is the story that binds together the unlikely hero's wandering through the levels, capable of slaying gigantic dragons like lizards with his sharp shovel, but also of digging up precious mounds of earth as if there were no tomorrow. Yacht Club Games, oscillating between irony and awareness of one's means, has packaged a perfect representative of the times that were, starting from the tutorial, in fact non-existent. So you have to find out everything yourself? Yes, in the initial level, very simple, which allows you to practice the basic controls. If you want, once you enter the first village, where you can buy secondary weapons, armor and health upgrades and participate in some mini games; talking to the inhabitants gives you additional information on some aspects of the gameplay, including a complete account of what has been done in terms of collecting treasures, secrets found, mounds of earth dug and so on. There is also a bard whose sheet music found in secret areas of the game levels can be sold to unlock the soundtrack. In short, there is no shortage of information, only it is not given in a didactic and, above all, brutal way, blocking the game to give often unnecessary and unsolicited explanations. Organic classicism Navigation between levels takes place via a Super Mario Bros.-style map, so new areas are unlocked from time to time in which you can choose whichWhat levels to tackle which, once passed, unlock more. Every now and then there are special events, such as secret bosses, maps dedicated to collecting jewels and more, which break the rhythm. Each of the main levels has its own characteristics which determine its geography. One of the bosses You will certainly not be surprised if we tell you that there is all the sampling of the genre, which ranges from the classic underwater level full of angry fish, passing through a cemetery overflowing with ghosts and various undead, and arriving at a castle full of machinery of death, where the good Shovel will have to sweat seven armor to come out alive. At the end of each level is a classic Mega Man style boss. These are other knights who have embraced the cause of evil; stronger enemies with special attacks, generally not very difficult to tame. Between one level and another it may happen to witness dream sequences related to Shovel Knight's guilt for the loss of Shield Knight. They are short and strangely intense moments, given the genre, which do not clash with the context. Of course, there are secrets. Indeed, there are plenty of them and they are essential for the gameplay: each level is full of secret passages, breakable walls, niches with chests positioned in inaccessible places and other extras that make exploration pleasant. Some secrets require you to replay the levels, perhaps to take advantage of an enemy who has understood too late to be an excellent trampoline to reach a secret platform, or to jump on a stone destroyed too hastily. In short, the gameplay offers all the typical elements of the genre, which are magnified by the precision of the control system, based on two buttons (jump button and attack button) and by the particularly inspired level design. It doesn't matter that some maps are really long and offer very difficult passages (don't worry, there are checkpoints to help): remember an 8-bit platformer worthy of its genre that ends without first cursing some supernatural creature?", "date": "2014-07-01", "grade": "9.0"}
