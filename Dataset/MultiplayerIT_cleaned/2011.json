{"name": "Turok: Evolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/turok-evolution-8.html", "text": "Live in Lost Lands! Though endowed with plot, Turok is one of the few days that can do without it. The mere fact of being in a jungle full of reptiles as tall as skyscrapers makes us want nothing more than to run from one side to the other, in an attempt to find a way out and therefore our spirit of survival will have the upper hand. every situation, more than anything else. However, at the beginning of each level we will be explained what to do to continue. For the more curious, we will impersonate a certain legendary hero Tal'set called to clean up the Lost Lands, the place where the story is set. And let's get to the point: how is this Turok? But, above all, will this multi-platform leap have done him any good? For a few months now, the interest surrounding this title has skyrocketed, both for the fame of the series and for the pumped-up previews and footage found. All this has done nothing but increase the anxiety of waiting. The team had made its promises and now I'll tell you if it has fully kept them. First of all let me remove this weight, I know that you are all there looking for the phrase that will lift your spiritsNo. Turok is no better than Halo. So whoever wants to continue reading can do so, the others can go back to wearing their armor of Chief. Technically the game felt like it was going to destroy every parameter, but in reality it's enjoyable but not earth-shattering. On the hunt for dinosaurs! Graphically there is nothing wrong but nothing that makes you cry for a miracle either. The dinosaurs are beautifully modeled and animated, but up close, especially in zooms, they leave a certain perplexity in terms of texture definition, which seem quite washed out. The environments are quite inspired and despite a certain general angularity they recreate the torrid settings that inspire them very well. It will often happen to get lost in the middle of the tall bushes looking for the way back. Trees can be cut down and also used as a means of defense and the graphic engine that intelligently manages these collisions is very interesting: if, in fact, a tree falls on another, it stops exactly on the branch on which it leans. The water effect appears ugly, especially in the very first level, while, later on, strangely it improves a bit, even if a little bump mapping would not have hurt. The enemies are so many and among the many dinosaurs there are some that will always keep you wide-eyed, especially the raptors, who, if they discover you, will start calling for help with their characteristic cry, like Jurassic Park to understand each other. Oddly enough, the plausible behavior of the animals contrasts with the stupid and illogical behavior of the guards who sometimes don't notice us even two cm from their nose: not being a game based on realism, you can pass over it but it can also annoy the ~perfect ~. Highs and lows, but better highs and ~mediums~ in the technical realization so that it never excels, but never leaves anything to be desired, thanks also to an engine solidly anchored on fluidity values that I think I can correctly estimate on 30fps, (exactly like Halo which however it boasts a higher graphic complexity), and which proves to be decidedly superior to the Sony console version which leaves much to be desired from a technical point of view, while the one for Cubo could reserve surprises being the native one, but I haven't had the opportunity to try it yet, and in any case it should be on the standards of the Xbox game. Really exaggerated weapons! Playability is influenced by two factors: the difficulty and the control system. The first is really very high, and you will rarely be able to perform a mission without having to start over at least a couple of times. The control system works perfectly, very similar among other things to the Halo setting, in the foot section, while it is insufficiently precise and comfortable in the flight section. This is because from time to time you will have to sit on a comfortable pterodont armed with cannons and machine guns and fly over narrow landscapes like canyons or valleys. And here the troubles begin: first of all it is not clear why an animal should explode on contact with the ground, ending up in a thousand pieces; you really can't govern the flying ~beast~ as you would like. The range of action in the flight phase is too limited and we often find ourselves either pointing to the sky or a few centimeters above the ground, making flying missions a real ordeal. You get used to these too with a little patience but you could have done much better in this type of internship. And the rest!? Well, the rest is fun. The rest are weapons, devastating weapons at the highest level in the Turok-nian tradition. Ultra destructive exaggerated weapons that poi are the real pearl that the game offers: hilarious and ultra-exaggerated. Your task: extinguish the dinosaurs! Turok is a good game, in my opinion, different, strange, could be improved, but beautiful. For those who have also played the previous chapters it won't be difficult to find themselves at home, even with some tone drops and inaccuracies in the control system (yes, yes...there are still the cursed jumps!!!). There is no doubt that it could have been better, but even so it is fun to wander around the jungle observing the fauna, this time dinosaurs and animals, trying to figure out who to watch your back and who not. Being able to knock down natural elements such as plants or boulders and use them to your advantage is stimulating while it's too much fun to make massacres with the devastating weapons that the game offers us. The flight sections are a bit jarring but you get used to it and although they are really unnerving you can finish them. Graphically we can complain, but considering that it is not a native game for this machine the result is not that bad, although Halo surpasses it on all fronts, despite boasting inspired and suggestive settings. Finally, the sound is very good with excellent music and effects, all orchestrated by a powerful dolby digital to which the Microsoft home console has now become accustomed. In short, you know when the teacher said to your parents ~the boy is fine, but if he tried harder he could do much better~? Turok is a good game, suitable for those looking for immediacy and not simulation or AI routines bordering on the human, for those who want to devastate everything that moves around them in peace, for those who love reptiles, and for those who have a a little patience and free time to devote to it. Finally, the good localization of all texts, even in game, in our language. Not a game for everyone, but fun and well done enough for everyone else. Your task: extinguish the dinosaurs! Pro Apt and inspired settings Weaponsweapons. Lots of devastating weapons Well done graphics and good animations It's Turok Control system FPS Cons Frustrating flight sections Control system in the ~flight~ levels Some graphic lightness and poorly defined textures. It doesn't use the full power of the console. Very questionable AI at times Materials First Look Image Gallery Tricks Movie Let's discuss it in the Forum Nintendian Amarcord I remember it like it was yesterday. I was flipping through the pages of my favorite gaming magazine, when suddenly my attention was captured by a game whose rating bordered on perfection. I was kidnapped. Those images so realistic, violent but at the same time intriguing made me immediately want that game and its console since I had just bled to death for my first psx! And so I did. Incredible! It was amazing! Never before had my eyes seen such polygonal magnificence on a console. The N64 was proving its real worth and Acclaim was starting to resurrect after a very bad period. The success was enormous, either for the violence, or for the dinosaurs, or because they could be devastated with incredibly powerful weapons. And it was beautiful, really beautiful. At the time, almost no one paid attention to the limitations of gameplay, visuals and everything else. There was blood violence, primordial instincts that came out, and above all for a machine considered childish like the N64... in short, it was such a success that they even made two sequels, or rather a sequel and an enhanced version for four-player multiplayer. No one managed to repeat the glories of the first, because in the meantime the limits that initially passed into the background came out more and more vehemently as the game tried to repeat itself with a formula already seen and above all not being able to count on adequate hardware resources. On closer inspection, in the long run even the game mechanics showed obvious limits especially in acrobatic maneuvers: for example, occasionally there were platforms... try to jump in first person to the millimeter!! Now history repeats itself and the new Turok is among us. As the title announces it will be evolution!! But will it be true!? Let's find out together. First of all, the technical problem related to the hardware has been overcome. The new generation consoles have all the necessary power to allow programmers to express themselves in the best way in every sector, so we can say goodbye to the hated fogging of the previous versions and enjoy a more or less unique audiovisual show, but let's go with order.", "date": "2002-09-12", "grade": null}
