{"name": "King of Seas", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/king-of-seas-recensione.html", "text": "The pirate epic often does not correspond to the historical reality of buccaneers, but in its romantic interpretation it has given us perfect protagonists for books, films and for some of the most popular video games ever. Just think of Monkey Island, the modern Sea of Thieves or Pirates! by Sid Meier, progenitor of a genre that unfortunately today has in its remake the only title worthy of the original. Others, however, have contributed to enriching the panorama of top-down pirate naval games, attracted by the fascinating combination of naval exploration, intuitive gameplay and captivating naval duels that also characterizes the new title from the all-Italian team 3DClouds. But they are not the only elements that we found ourselves evaluating in the review of King of Seas, a single player title ready to embark on PC, Xbox One, PS4 and Switch, which adds spells, ghost ships, fishing and a high customization of the vessels. The departure An all-Italian pirate adventure Although based largely on obtaining ever-greater loot and on a procedural map, in the style of modern looter action RPGs, King of Seas is a title that, excluding the ranking system with score multipliers based on difficulty, is entirely single player. But precisely for this reason it can afford to link the evolution of the gameplay to that of the narrative, causing certain mechanics to be unlocked only by discovering certain places or by completing main and secondary missions. And it is a setting that on the one hand guarantees an evolution of the experience, allowing us to conquer ports and obtain missions from governors and pirate hideouts, and on the other it makes exploration vital, necessary to obtain missions and mechanics capable to lead us to special power-ups useful for defeating the most powerful enemies. Improving your equipment isn't the only motivation to do battle on the open seas, however. In fact, there is no lack of a plot, however simple and entrusted to exchanges (obviously also in Italian) between almost immobile portraits and without dubbing. He is therefore satisfied with a simple narrative but capable of giving us a context, interlocutors, a male or female character in which to immerse ourselves and a reason to take the sea route again and give battle to those who forced us to live as pirates. And this is how our adventure begins in an anonymous world that exudes a pirate spirit but is enriched by steampunk elements and voodoo spells. The gameplay Turning and shelling are the funnest part of the fight Designed for the pad, but still playable without too many problems with the keyboard, King of Seas effectively resumes the classic mechanics of the genre between top view, four levels of sails to stop the ship or adjust the speed, the wind that can greatly reduce or increase the navigation speed and two independent batteries of guns, one for each side of the ship, combined with two different keys. The rest of the action revolves around the player's skill in tacking, essential for hitting enemy ships while dodging their broadsides, and special abilities, which can be up to four like the respective ship's equipment slots. In fact, they are among the objects that can be bought or recovered from the loots like sails, castles, crews and cannons which, interestingly, among the parameters include the speed of the bullets, decisive for reducing the possibility of the enemies to dodge. The equipment improvements also include bonuses to the resistance of the sails or the hull, as well as the number of sailors we can accommodate on board, three parameters that determine the health of our vessel, as well as three types of projectiles that we can choose and which they respectively go to damage one of the three elements that keep the ship running. But while losing sail or crew decreases efficiency, losing all hull health spells a lethal trip to the bottom of the sea. Hence the importance not only of having a port at hand - where it is possible to visit the carpenter, shop at the market and recruit new crew members at the tavern - but also repair kits that allow you to fix the material parts of the boat. And it is good to use them when you are in the open sea. Lots of equipment slots and different stats to watch out for The equipment, classified with the classic colors ranging from white to orange of legendary items, increases the chances of survival, but giant octopuses, pirate hunters, ghost ships, consecutive attacks and special abilities used by other navi - which, for example, could also set the ship on fire or poison the crew - can put us in difficulty in a few moments. But the same possibility is granted to us, and once you have a set of powers that allow you to run away from the enemy, negate his abilities and automatically hit him, there are few opposing ships that can oppose him. There are some surprises, but in general the challenge is destined to flatten out, regardless of the difficulty level selected at the beginning, also reducing the usefulness of the cannon battle which remains among the funniest things in a title of this type . Those looking for a little more spice can select between different degrees of difficulty, also adding the possibility of losing loot when sunk, but at a certain point the limits of gameplay and skill balancing are felt anyway and the experience loses its edge. Customization includes talents that affect maneuverability, damage, and health of ship, sails, and crew Among the plus points are the relaxation of placid navigation, the sense of discovery and wonder in finding treasures, or the thrill of coming face to face with a special ghost ship, tougher than other encounters; all while riding through storms or battling alongside active volcanoes that fill an area with flaming lapilli and rock. Then there are naval routes to guard to intercept more vessels, fish to catch, cartographers to find, ghost ships to hunt and goods to buy in one port and sell in another to obtain revenue. Not to mention that the map is full of abandoned chests and treasures, some richer and linked to the classic maps. During the entire adventure you can get hold of five vessels, from the classic sloop to the massive galleon, all to be equipped and which differ in basic characteristics. In fact, if large ships have a greater load capacity and greater resistance, they are also slow and less agile in combat. But they can also be interesting due to some special powers that can only be used with a specific model of boat. In addition, there are three skill trees that affect various characteristics of the ship. Each mast is divided into segments, with the next one unlocked by spending enough points in the previous one, and allow you to increase your ship's speed, agility, stamina and so on. There are many levels but it is not possible to unlock everything, and this forces the player to choose based on the style of play and the preferred ship. Compromises, more or less successful From naval duels to the conquest of ports With intuitive gameplay and high customization of equipment, King of Seas certainly does not rest on the slender narrative structure and is designed to be replayable thanks to the procedural map, the loot system and the various builds related to talents. But the action loses momentum already during the first game, however destined to last dozens of hours if you want to reach the maximum level, and this is also due to special abilities that are not well balanced and often impoverish the gameplay rather than enhance it. From time to time there is some flicker, some surprises, especially with the experience that evolves to include the conquest of the ports scattered around the map, but the novelties are not enough to compensate for the repetitiveness of situations and secondary missions. King of Seas is a very focused game, offered at the budget price of 24.99 euros (currently 19.99 euros in preorder) and destined to evolve sooner with a finishing patch, which will include among the many new features the possibility of reassigning the keys , and then a massive update dedicated to content. However, we would like to see an enrichment of the map, now still anonymous and poor in detail, and some improvements in the interface, which does not make it particularly intuitive to compare the pieces of equipment. Some glimpses are delightful despite the modesty of the technical sector Although limited in the variety of assets, in the definition of textures and in the count of polygons, the graphics of King of Seas draws strength from an inspired design that makes good use of bridges, trunks, wrecks, saplings and structures, putting us in front of a imaginary so limited but still pleasant, and which gives its best in the case of ships, animations and some effects, such as reflections in real time. Other elements, on the other hand, are decidedly less successful, including the wave shaders, but overall the work done can be said to be more than functional. Also thanks to a sound sector which, while not shining for originality or variety, does its job between pirate symphonies and effective samplings that include skiingaboard the waves, the shouts of the sailors, the creak of the hulls and the dull roar of the cannons. Enough to create that atmosphere which, despite the flaws, makes King of Seas a good pastime for those looking for a looter with a pirate atmosphere capable of entertaining for a few dozen hours.", "date": "2021-05-24", "grade": "7.2"}
