{"name": "Quella sporca ultima meta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/156458-blood-bowl-2-quella-sporca-ultima-meta.html", "text": "Blood Bowl 2 is the long-awaited sequel to one of the spearheads of the Cyanide line-up, a brave title that harks back to one of the most peculiar strategy board games out there. The setting is that of Warhammer Fantasy but is reinterpreted in an ironic key to justify the existence of a football league in which humans, goblins, dwarves, beasts of chaos, elves, orcs and trolls collide. On the one hand, essentially, there is the sporting soul made up of roles such as pitcher, receiver, defender and so on, while on the other there are the rules of a classic turn-based strategy game based on a board divided into boxes, regulated by shots dice that decide the success of an action, fought with attacks that can make an opponent defenseless and influenced by modifiers typical of role-playing games. This mix allowed the first Blood Bowl to sell a million copies, a success that is very likely the founding reason for this sequel. A graphics engine and a new interface are Blood Bowl 2's excellent calling card A racial issue A field twenty-six squares long is the stage for Blood Bowl 2 games, which begin with the classic coin toss followed by kick-off. Whoever receives the ball can move all his athletes and try to break through the opposing defenses with the aim of going for a touchdown. Players can collide with opponents within attack range or they can try to move as much as possible, extending even the maximum movement by a couple of squares, but with the risk of falling badly. Between the forwards and their goal is obviously the opposing team whose job it is to recover the ball, reverse the flow of play and score a point. Even without knowing football, understanding the basic rules is a matter of a few moments and part of the credit goes to the completely redesigned and decidedly intuitive interface. To complicate things, however, we think about the eight available races which are all characterized by specific skills that directly impact the gameplay. Furthermore, each player has unique specificities, which are often clearly visible in well-characterized models and sometimes even very different in size. For example, the troll has the particularity of being able to launch a smaller companion, but as a stupid beast that is, there is the risk that it decides to eat it. Then there are the physical characteristics, visible in a card that appears on the screen when a player is selected, which influence the precision in throws and the distance covered, a vital element to say the least in the game economy, forcing us to preserve the most deserving members of the team to make the most of them. Finally we find the passive dynamics that allow the players of a team to automatically trip the opponents who pass by them. This mechanic is one of the most important as it allows players to be placed strategically so as to make it difficult for opponents to advance, although there is always the failure rate that can allow an agile runner to get away with it. Among the novelties of this sequel there is an artificial intelligence rewritten from scratch that starts calmly in the first games of the campaign to gradually become more aggressive by making better use of the possibilities offered by the game system. The behavior of the opponents is not always impeccable but apparently it is destined to improve over time thanks to a feedback system that could even lead to the opening of the artificial intelligence scripting to the community. Any gaffes by the players, however, are not always attributable to the code. The athletes of Blood Bowl 2 belong to very different races that are moved by different impulses as in the case of dwarves who lock themselves in a very effective defense, skaven who bet everything on speed or orcs who prefer direct confrontation as opposed to elves who, also for reasons of physical characteristics, prefer a less violent approach. We can obviously mix the various approaches, taking into account the peculiarities of the chosen faction, or try to perfect one. All this in a title that allows us to wait for the opponents, calculate the movements and position the team to play long balls, but also allows us to try to knock out as many enemies as possible, perhaps using tricks and spells, to throw a runner to touchdown. We therefore come to the blocking action, or the physical interaction between our players and the opponents' ones, which is one of the most complex elements of the Blood Bowl 2 gameplay. With the blocking it is possible to push an opponent into an adjacent square and decide whether followmoving one square in the same direction or less. But when the action is decided, which is obviously influenced by the size and characteristics of the athletes, one or more dice are rolled which determine the outcomes, not always positive, selectable by the attacker. Possibilities include the affected player falling, stunning the latter, a simple push that opens a gap in the opposing defense or nefarious events such as the fall of both players involved and nothing. Some skills can in fact protect the athletes and that is why it is even more important to place the right men in the right places also taking into account the position. In fact, a player pushed off the field ends up in the arms of the public and the Blood Bowl public is one of the disreputable ones. Team play The multiplayer dimension is obviously important and in this sequel it can count on the possibility of creating personalized competitions and an online market of players, who can also get injured or retire, adding a pinch of spice to the whole. Furthermore, the turn-based formula allows two users to challenge each other without problems on the same platform for old-fashioned clashes, perhaps accompanied by beer and chips that go hand in hand with fooball. But one of the most striking elements of Blood Bowl 2 is undoubtedly the Campaign. Cyanide has wisely decided to exploit the setting to give us a fifteen-game long run towards the final sporting victory. The Campaign, a sort of career mode enriched by the narrative component, is all about the dialogues of the two commentators and, despite being modest, it is capable of adding depth to the experience. Among other things, the story is differentiated according to the chosen faction, spiced up by random events such as the invasion of the field and seasoned by the aforementioned commentators and animations that often include a lot of violence. The crudeness is partially defused by the ironic tones, the colorful graphics, the cartoon models and the cheerleaders, but it is nevertheless marked and is able to give a little drama to the numerous moments of suspense that are created as our player passes by enemies ready to knock him out during a run to the area. After the first match that acts as a tutorial we can create our team, keeping in mind that finances are limited and top athletes cost a lot. Central players, such as the massive ogre, are the fulcrum of the team but they can do very little without the support of a team capable of stemming the opposing runners who, as in the case of the Blitzers, can perform two actions by stringing together lethal combinations such as running, recovering ball and fly ball to touchdown in a single turn. In essence, a desperate situation can turn into a point in no time and the same goes for opponents who can never be underestimated, given that a long throw to an unmarked teammate can guarantee an easy point. Nonetheless, matches can get pretty long and some rounds be dramatically slow; Blood Bowl 2 is not a game for everyone. Furthermore, the managerial dimension is not the most complex in circulation, but on the other hand it is played on the field between sweaty ogres and fireballs. In any case, the extras are numerous, including player level ups, signings, fan satisfaction, sponsors, fouls and consequent referee corruption. In addition, the multiplayer is seasoned with detailed statistics, home stadium, team motto, various liveries, tournaments, online transfer market and the possibility of seeing community replays through Cabal TV. Who comes last... The rules of the board game are all there and we are faced with a rather complex product that allows us to move several characters per turn, asking us to anticipate the moves of as many opposing athletes. All seasoned with interface refinements that make everything easier by highlighting the athletes who have already completed their action with a red marker. Considering the evolution of turn-based strategy, it would undoubtedly have been possible to increase the number of available actions, especially in the defensive phase, but the complexity is still high due to race differences, unforeseen events that influence the game and the partial randomness of the dice rolls. Inevitably these elements make the absolute balance rather difficult to achieve but the role-playing soul of the experience compensates for this shortcoming and offers us a particular title which, at the same time, has the not inconsiderable advantage of enhancing the strategic soul of football. The new graphics engine guarantees a clear leap compared to the first chapter and the design and attention to detail sonot grown as substantially. Five massive stadiums packed with angry fans host dozens of players featuring countless delightful animations. It starts with the simple run complete with an action camera to various gory skits that include uppercuts, flying kicks, violence galore and malevolent-eyed goblin referees who probably take sadistic pleasure in watching motorized unit charges, assassins stab behind, powerful heel strikes, goblins jumping on helpless bodies, lightning raining from the sky and fireballs. The differentiated stroke for each model is another element that captures the attention together with details such as the sinuous tentacles of the minotaur of the Beasts of Chaos that hypnotically undulate making this particular unit one of the most successful. Unfortunately the fact that two extra races, specifically the Wood Elves and the Lizardmen, are bound to reservations has made more than one fan turn up their noses despite the knowledge that they will be purchasable later as DLC. And as far as the boot of Europe is concerned, the negative note is the total lack of the Italian language. Furthermore, the commentary is not tight, the jokes are not particularly effective and the soundtrack tries to be epic but unfortunately ends up being negligible. Commentaries from commentators, however, are as essential to creating atmosphere as are the numerous and rather well-crafted sound effects.", "date": "2015-09-22", "grade": "8.5"}
