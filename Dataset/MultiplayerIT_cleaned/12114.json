Professor Ryuta Kawashima returns to the chair with More Brain Training, which is nothing more than a collection of new exercises for brain training. The title is in all respects identical to its predecessor, from the menus to the music, passing through Dr. Kawashima's comments on our performances; the container stays the same, the content changes. Those who have been familiar with the first BT will find the exact same formula in MBT: the method for calculating brain age, the section with daily training tests, the graphs to appreciate any progress over time, and the sudoku appendix certainly welcome. What changes are of course the exercises presented in this new edition, studied ad hoc by the Japanese luminary. Unfortunately, the new tests replace - and not add to - those present in the first BT. In total there are therefore eleven training exercises and six for calculating your brain age, all quite intuitive and intended to stimulate different areas of the brain and different skills: fast arithmetic calculation, short-term memory, concentration, musicality, etc. . Some of you have probably seen a perplexed Nicole Kidman struggling with Chinese morra on TV. This is one of MBT's most successful exercises, the only one that requires the use of a microphone. One of the three morra symbols (paper, scissors and rock) is displayed on the screen, together with the indication ~you must win/you must lose~. Paper beats rock but loses to scissors. The player is tasked with saying the right sign as fast as possible, and then again, and again, 30 times in a row. Forb.. no um, cart.. rock rock! Always present are the arithmetic exercises: 'Memocalcolo' hides the addends of a chain of additions, stimulating at the same time to memorize and calculate the result. 'Arithmetic Signs' proposes a pair of digits and the relative result, it's up to you to identify the right operator. 'Accounts and balances' puts you behind a cash register dealing with coins and coins. The last exercise based on numbers is not actually an exercise in arithmetic but pure mnemonics: a matrix of 25 numbers to be memorized in two minutes. Not just numbers More curious and less scholastic are the exercises that stimulate vocabulary and attentive functions. 'Parole Scomposte' is the classic quiz of anagrams, from four to eight letters (but it often happens that valid complete meaning words are rejected). It is one of the exercises in which handwriting recognition comes into play, quite effective as long as you follow the advice in the manual. 'Alexander the Great' is the name of the test that tests your ability to distinguish two or more words emitted simultaneously by the DS speaker. Another test, not very successful, presents a musical score to be performed accurately by playing the keys of a piano. 'Date Calculation' prompts you to think mentally based on the calendar: what day was the day before yesterday? And five days less than the day after tomorrow? What was the number last Saturday? In short, without having to present them all, you will have understood that the exercises collected in MBT are quite varied, although not very numerous. There is no shortage of tests, mainly of a creative nature, which do not provide for an evaluation but rely on the good will of the person who undergoes them. A screen of randomly arranged dots, to be joined with segments to create a design. Or the acrostics, Dr. Kawashima's personal passion, which consist in providing descriptions of a word starting from the letters that compose it. It is important to point out, at the end of the review, that More Brain Training is offered at the recommended price of 29.90. Comment If I were a teacher grappling with the More Brain Training report card, I'd say that he does his homework well but doesn't apply as much as he could. The new trials won't disappoint, being brighter and overall more varied than the first BT. But the title could have been enriched and developed in many directions compared to the first episode, and instead Nintendo limited itself to a simple replacement of the old exercises with a package of new ones. ~More of the same~ par excellence, we could say. After all, the name says it all. Pros: Suitable for anyone New successful exercises Includes over 100 Sudoku puzzles Budget price 29.90 Cons: Not many exercises Structure unchanged Repetitive by its nature Many of you will remember that the summer of last year recorded unusual phenomena, some pleasant, some incredible, some still inexplicable. The undersigned remembers some of them in particular: Juve punished in Serie B and forced to deliver the snackna stolen in the hands of Inter, who thus became champion of Italy after thousand thousand years. Gulp! And then squares full of half-naked and screaming people: Italy was the world champion. Poo-popo! But one event in particular struck me in such a way that I hypothesized an alien invasion, or that some strange virus was spreading across the planet, driving people crazy. What ever happened, you will think. Well, last summer I saw my technophobic aunt playing my NintendoDS. It was the dawn of the Touch! Generation, the opening of Nintendo towards non-gamers, the era of games for the whole family. Well folks, here we go again.", "date": "2007-07-20", "grade": null}
