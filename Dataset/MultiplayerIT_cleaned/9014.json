Cars 2: The Video Game is a title where you don't need to be an engine expert, but you need to be clever during the various operations and above all lovers of action games if we want to define it that way: a sort of world where you win as a prankster and fun motorized spy , always with the joke ready! In Cars 2: The Video Game the aim is to embark on wild rides in the company of all the classic characters of the film who aim to challenge each other in international spy stories. And it is the entire planet where you can play the role of the unsurpassed Lightning McQueen or the likeable Mater adventure companions of all the Cars characters from both the first and second films. Full of grit, the title shows the absence of an initial story mode as a peculiarity which is generally able to summarize the story in broad terms and facilitate the game by refreshing ideas before the start of the race. However, he has the plot on his side that does not exploit the story of the film in a total but partial way, rather using it as a pretext to contextualize the races. 1,2,3...Go!!! Considering the race inside the story, Cars 2: The Video Game somehow manages to satisfy the needs of the driver by offering virtual reality driving and tracks full of shortcuts, but never going out of what its target is: a built game on cartoons and made for those who actually love them. The routes are of a fairly discreet quality and inspired by the places seen on the film such as London, Paris and some Italian-style glimpses. Being precisely a ~spy~ story, the game offer, in addition to being made up of individual races and time runs, consists of particular C.H.R.O.M.E. missions. where the protagonist must be able to achieve several objectives before achieving the coveted victory. The races are of various types and it is difficult to get tired thanks to their variety, since it is possible to change the game mode at will: it ranges from a simple race to reach the finish line up to the challenge to the last acceleration, or a race between cars where the aim is to eliminate the enemy ones within an arena, as difficult as the other mode which simulates a sort of checkpoint where you have to collect cumulative energy bonuses in order to run out of fuel with consequent game over. Every time you finish a race, Cars 2: The Video Game gives you a handful of experience points which are useful for unlocking other objectives such as characters and tracks to be exploited in the Free Race mode. Each car in Cars 2: The Video Game has a soul that embraces two realities: energy and speed. On the second there is little to say, the energy instead the title accumulates through our ability to jump, drift or even ram other cars, running in reverse or on two wheels. Thus the accumulated energy can be released as needed in the form of a turbo to reach the objectives faster, to be able to accumulate points in record time and beat the enemies in a single blow! With you... it's a whole other story On its side, the title has the ability to satisfy the needs of expert players but also of the little ones, in fact thanks to the different types of game that exploit different scenarios as well as variable difficulties. Choosing the simple race that takes advantage of the race on time there are no particular difficulties and above all if you are in company you can choose these mini competitions to play all together (even with the little ones) without necessarily resorting to multiplayer mode. Speaking of the latter mode instead, you have the ability to play up to four players simultaneously in split-screen on the same console. The race is called arena it is very exciting thanks to the different rules to use and it is interesting because you can choose which parameters to set. One flaw to acknowledge is the absence of an online multiplayer mode. Cars 2: The Video Game is given substance by the cast that brings together all the characters from the first and second film: talking cars react individually to the game with their own driveability and personality. In fact, while you're in the middle of the race, the real gem of the title is the ability to change the story every time thanks to the car and the route since it's not always necessary to follow the same itinerary, indeed if you don't follow it and chooseand to move towards other directions it is probable that it will be possible to reach the goal first and thus make each race performed strictly unique. In fact, originality is never lacking in Disney Pixar titles, and here in fact it is also possible to view it during the races, where taking missile or machine-gun fire on your opponents turns out to be real fun combined with the pressing pace of the race.", "date": "2011-10-17", "grade": null}
