{"name": "Earthfall", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/earthfall-recensione.html", "text": "Earthfall is a clone of Left 4 Dead, and when we say ~clone~ we mean that often, during the ten missions that make up the two campaigns currently available in the game, it seems to be dealing with a simple reskin of the shooter weblog Valve. Holospark's intention was probably just this: to exploit the desire for a new cooperative shooter for four participants with waves of enemies, bosses and devices to activate and then defend the position. But how to differentiate the project at least? Simple: inserting aliens instead of zombies. A potentially valid solution, even if with the undead you win easily: the degree of tension that these pathetic creatures know how to instill in people is always very high, especially when they move fast and in a large herd. Naturally, the extraterrestrials of Earthfall are anything but harmless little green men, and the design of many enemies appears more than decent, albeit with some unfortunate blunders (see the Whiplash, which look like small brontosaurs). The plot of the game projects us into a not too distant future in which the planet has been invaded by a hostile race that has taken possession of the cities, leaving a handful of survivors the task of freeing them, guns in hand. Weapons and gameplay As mentioned, there are currently two campaigns available in Earthfall, and it is possible to play them in sequence, one episode after another, so as to dissect the not very exciting narrative sector of this shooter. Just like in Left 4 Dead you can play alone, entrusting artificial intelligence with the control of our three companions, or online, joining a random match, selecting some criteria (for example the mission) before carrying out the search or giving the off to a game that other users will be able to access freely, again in a very similar way to the Valve title; without having to wait for any loading at the entrance of each new participant, as instead happens in Payday 2. However, a browser is missing for the manual selection of matches, and we fear that this is a precise choice, aimed at preventing the lack of users scare away newcomers, prompting them to promptly request a refund from Steam. There are four characters from which to select your survivor (Maya, Roy, Danny and Jonas) but there are no differences between one and the other, nor do you remain bound in any way to any equipment: along the way you will be able choose to pick up a second pistol or a bludgeoning or cutting weapon for melee attacks, shotguns, assault or sniper rifles, or light machine guns, adding the inevitable medikits (which, if desired, we can use to treat our comrades) and some types of explosives. In short, the arsenal does not lack variety, but the moment you press the trigger it is clear and evident that something is missing from the point of view of the solidity of the gunplay, the famous sensation of impact that makes the difference between successful and unsuccessful products. Let's be clear: having become familiar with the game mechanics, in Earthfall you shoot which is a pleasure and there is no lack of spectacularity within sequences in which you try to block the arrival of a crowd of aliens, not only by emitting targeted bursts (put headshot always returns a certain satisfaction) but also by throwing a few grenades or exploding incendiary barrels. In these situations, however, one of the few differences that the Holospark title can boast compared to Left 4 Dead is highlighted: the possibility of using ~automatic networks~ to close the entrances of a strategic point before the arrival of a swarm and to place autonomous or manual turrets with which to literally tear the bulk of the enemies to pieces, thinning their ranks. When these situations occur, which in fact abound in every mission, and you manage to coordinate with the other players so that they cover specific areas of the scenario, the experience meshes and is fun. The problem with imitating in all respects a shooter from ten years ago, however, is that at a certain point one realizes that in the meantime the trend has taken steps forward, and this awareness hits violently on Earthfall when we analyze the possible replayability of the stages, which is indeed scarce and limited to adjusting the difficulty. In fact, almost all of the events occur according to a rigid script with no surprises, which transforms yet another mission in the same scenario into an inevitable deja vu. Missions and scenarios From the woods to the countryside, from industrial plants to urban views, Earthfall's maps generally develop in a linear fashionare, although in some cases there is no shortage of variations on the theme and strategic points to which perhaps return to recharge energy and ammunition, thanks to special medical stations and 3D printers that manage to make brand new weapons in a matter of seconds. In the final stages of the two campaigns there are some different situations than usual, but in this sense it was necessary to push much more, starting from the solid foundations of the classic Valve but demonstrating that you have understood which direction the trend of cooperative shooters of this type should take. Earthfall is therefore afflicted by a clear personality problem, which the rich bestiary does not solve in any way. With the only exception of the Blackout, a tentacled creature that manages to create an energy barrier, shoot lightning and teleport from one point of the location to another, even the bosses lack imagination and end up reproposing the figure of the big and bad, without even bothering to try and experiment with something different. It will now be necessary to understand how Holospark will decide to move, but the numbers of a not exactly easy debut will be fundamental in trying to smooth out the edges of this production and enrich it with new contents: an undertaking that we consider feasible and even desirable, but not very probable. Technically, a fair job has been done, even if played at 4K and 60 frames per second, the title never boasts assets of adequate quality for the resolution, on the contrary giving in to the temptation to place some poorly made polygonal models or some mixed texture in our path. However, it seems that the proven versatility of the Unreal Engine and the various adjustments available are not yet sufficient to guarantee a wide scalability of the experience on less demanding configurations. Will this aspect be improved?", "date": "2018-07-18", "grade": "6.8"}
