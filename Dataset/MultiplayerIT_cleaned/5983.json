However, if Civ IV, although greatly improved by Warlords and above all by Beyond The Sword, was already a very complete and intricate game at the base, the fifth episode at the exit raised more than one eyebrow: it seemed a step backwards compared to the predecessor, and when then Gods And Kings and Brave New World made it almost completely new, many players, while enjoying the state of the art of 4X, could not help but think that it was planned from the beginning. I suspect it's even more legitimate in the case of Beyond Earth. Civilization V had on its side the fact that many things were new and still had to be calibrated well, the futuristic / space spin-off had instead immediately seemed too simple, similar to the previous one, devoid of personality. Of course, a policy of this type, with large expansions released after a year or more, is still preferable in a world of DLC and microtransactions, but still questionable, unless the expansion in question revolutionizes the system for the better gameplay and set new standards in the genre, as happened with Brave New World. Is this also the case with Rising Tide? Here comes Rising Tide, the first expansion for Beyond Earth. A dive where the water is bluer? Nothing more? Sea, the last frontier For those who have no idea of the original Beyond Earth system, we refer to our review, having to devote space to the innovations which, let it be said right away, are many and potentially able to significantly affect. The first substantial change, the one from which this expansion also takes its name, concerns the aquatic expanses: it is now possible to build cities even on oceans and lakes. The lack of this possibility had actually caused discussion, in the light of the futuristic setting and above all of the fact that both Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, in some way the inspirer of Beyond Earth, and Civilization: Call to Power, the attempt (beautiful, but not very successful) of Activision to continue the series at home after Meier's departure, contemplated it. Aquatic cities have several differences from normal ones, most notably the fact that their borders do not expand as culture grows. In order to acquire new boxes you will have to either buy them or... move the city. It is possible to do this, one box at a time, by selecting the appropriate item from the construction projects, and exactly as with these you will take a certain number of shifts depending on the productivity of the base. The introduction of this concept leads to a series of heavy changes: if on the one hand, increasing the playable area and bringing it to the level of the entire planet, it tends to dilute the action a bit - more territory for everyone equivalent to a lower possibility of wars for the same - on the other hand, a portion of the ecosystem that in the base game was of little use and indeed made it almost a nuisance to organize large colonial or military expeditions to other continents, now assumes primary importance, also introducing a number of new resources, buildings and units that we will talk about later, and it is ultimately a very positive innovation. Rather, the movement mechanics raise some doubts, above all because of the time it requires: two times out of three you will find it much more advantageous to limit yourself to acquiring the boxes by buying them rather than completely rethinking the displacement of a center and in case of discovery of a rich marine territory of resources, creating a new colony that exploits it instead of moving one even very close is always a faster way, unless the health level of your state allows it. House of Cards The second big change concerns the totally renewed system of international relations. It is now governed by two factors: the first is Diplomatic Capital, a resource that goes alongside the classic ones of Energy, Culture and Science and how these are produced thanks to buildings, marvels and so on, as well as by virtue of agreements that the other factions will want to make with you. The second is represented by two parameters, the Respect and the Fear nourished by the competitors towards you, which change according to behaviour, Affinities and military strength. The diplomatic capital acquired gives access to various possibilities, starting from a system of ~perks~ that modify the character and political traits of the leader you impersonate. Each leader has one unchangeable personal one, and three others that can be chosen insteadchanged, increased and if necessary changed: ranging from the one that allows you to obtain more culture, to the one that gradually increases the chances of success of a secret action up to cover practically every aspect of the game. However, agreements can be made above all with diplomatic capital. Completely away with the old more or less equal exchange system, also set aside the new concept of favors, now it is possible to make pacts only in exchange for this resource and each colony has its own characteristic ~area of competence~ so, if you want to increase the energy you should contact Hutama, while for health Kozlov is an excellent idea. Each pact has its cost, it goes without saying that the most valuable ones are the most profitable for both parties, and can also be made more convenient by improving relations, an action that no longer occurs automatically but always in exchange for diplomatic capital, being however be careful that the parameters of respect and fear are high enough. The matter seems complicated but we assure you that, in good Firaxis tradition, a few turns are enough to master it, thanks to the always excellent interface, the very complete tutorials and the Civilopedia, which we do not deal with in this article because they have long since reached levels beyond which it would be hard to go. More interesting is the ambivalent impact this new system has on the gaming rig. On the one hand, it gives more personality to the various leaders, letting their preferences and idiosyncrasies, hitherto only existing on paper, really come to fruition in the game: Barre will be more willing to cooperate if you have top-notch satellite technology, Daoming will be fascinated by a large number of trade routes, and they will not fail to inform you with messages that now no longer interrupt the flow of the game but appear as notifications. They can be too intrusive, especially in the case of a new agreement stipulated that will shift the balance a lot, but they undoubtedly make the feeling of being truly inserted in a context of peers who vie for the domination of a planet much more vivid. On the other hand, however, it seemed to us an inflexible system, all too dependent on precise parameters, reaching the paradox, for example, that a civilization much inferior to yours cannot help declaring war on you if relations are at their lowest, even facing certain death. Even the peace conditions are now automatic, dependent on a war score similar to that of Europa Universalis and whoever raises the white flag cannot offer anything other than what is automatically foreseen by the CPU. Furthermore, there is still a little something to adjust, especially some pacts that are really too advantageous. In essence it is a novelty promoted, but not with full marks; we have the feeling that it will characterize the next Civ but, balancing aside, it wouldn't be a bad idea to recover trades in some way, independently deciding what to get and what to give in return. Is happiness in the little things? From the diplomatic screen you can also access the Affinity screen, which leads us to talk about yet another novelty: the Hybrid Affinities. Those who know Beyond Earth know how impossible it is, while focusing on the development of only one of Harmony, Purity and Supremacy, not to accumulate scores in the others as well. Scores that, useless in the base game, now finally give access to a series of benefits and units: an expected change and about which there is nothing negative to say. And finally with the major additions, the new factions: the German-loving INTEGR, the Arabic-style Al Falah, the North Sea Alliance and the Korean-inspired Chungsu. Each with its own starting characteristic (Chungsu with his predilection for espionage seemed to us the most fun and fresh to play), however they do not solve the problem of the lack of personality of the leaders, compared with the previous Civs and especially with Alpha Centauri, problem that has been tried to overcome more with the diplomatic system and with new text screens than with the creation of charismatic characters. In the face of all these highly publicized innovations in the months preceding their release, however, there are still a couple to deal with, less heralded but which also seemed to us to be more successful, starting with the new emphasis given to exploration: the introduction of Artifacts, to be recovered with the classic Expeditions and which give access to a series of even significant bonuses (how about being able to control a Siege Worm?), and new missions, longer and better written than the previous ones, make the role of the Explorers and increase the aura of mystery and discovery expected on a planet totally unknown to humanity. The units, the resourcesand the buildings introduced are excellently balanced and enrich a picture that was a bit poor especially as regards the oceanic sector - the Wonders instead continue to suffer from poor effects and charisma - and in general a meritorious work of balancing has been carried out, which it also affects the basic Beyond Earth, a bit on all game parameters. Very brief hints to finish with the online multiplayer with its now well-tested netcode, which gives the pleasure of dealing with human intelligences, more unpredictable than the artificial one, and the technical sector, in all respects similar to the original one, only perhaps a little heavier but still perfectly scalable and able to hold up well even on non-state-of-the-art machines.", "date": "2015-10-12", "grade": "8.4"}
