Those unfamiliar with the series curiously wondered why other people online were so enthusiastic, indulging in galvanized posts on forums and Reddit. After all, for fans of the Nickelodeon series it was bombshell news: after a slew of mediocre tie-ins dedicated to Avatar: The Last Airbender, finally the universe created by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino has been entrusted to one of the developers most competent and appreciated in the action genre. Despite the team's track record, however, doubts remained: with most of the team working on Bayonetta 2 and Scalebound, our fear was that Platinum couldn't treat a Western license like Korra with the same care and attention. to which he has accustomed us. Fear which, unfortunately, proved to be well founded. The Legend of Korra is an action with some successful moments, but that does not honor the TV series Playstation 4 trophies Although in The Legend of Korra there are more than 30 Trophies to obtain, there are very few original ones, and practically none represent an interesting challenge for the player. In fact, most of them are unlocked by continuing in the story, obtaining new powers and objects or collecting the collectibles scattered throughout the various levels. Platinum Dominatrix The fact that The Legend of Korra is an American series never broadcast in Japan is not a trivial detail. When Activision commissioned the project to Platinum Games, neither director Eiro Shirahama nor producer Atsushi Kurooka were familiar with the franchise, and despite efforts to stay true to the spirit of the animated series, the hand of newbies has not escaped the watchful eye of the fans. After all, The Legend of Korra has accustomed to interesting subplots and multifaceted and non-trivial characters: Amon in the first season and Kuvira in the fourth are examples of subversive and extremely multifaceted enemies, who fight for a cause that fans of the TV series are able to understand and, in some cases, even sharing. Instead, the plot of the game revolves around a very stereotypical enemy, a sort of evil sorcerer who deprives Korra of her powers in order to dominate the world. Why? Because yes. The developers have given very little or no space to the acclaimed cast of the TV series: Jinora acts as a guide, as Navi for Link, Iroh sells items and power-ups, Tenzin is only mentioned, while Mako and Bolin appear only in a very short scene of 'animated interlude. Not to mention dialogues that don't have the verve and humor seen in the TV series, and with the game exclusively in English, the total absence of subtitles represents a big problem for those who don't know the language. From a digital game sold at a budget price and made by a tiny offshoot of Platinum Games, a technical level equal to a Bayonetta was certainly not expected, but The Legend of Korra fails to be artistically interesting. Republic City is a gray corridor in the middle of all the same square blocks, there is very little artistic variety among the enemies and overall the game's settings do not communicate the charm of the series in the slightest. At this point one would think that, at the very least, Platinum's know-how has ensured a frenetic and fun combat system, but unfortunately even in this case the developers have done a far from flawless job. In full Metroid style, The Legend of Korra allows the player to test all the abilities of the protagonist in the first five minutes of the adventure, to then deprive her of her bending powers and force her to slowly recover them. The problem is precisely this: the entire first part of the game is spent with a bare and unfunny combat system, which does not allow interesting combos or spectacular techniques. Fortunately, things improve after gaining the power to dominate water, thus being able to perform ranged attacks or chain different techniques. It is clear that the further you go, the more you unlock new skills, and the more varied and frenetic the fights become, but when you are able to use the four elements, move around with the air scooter (so dear to Aang) and even entering the Avatar State, it is now too late and the adventure comes to an end. One of the things that bothered us the most is seeing the same bosses recycled over and over again in the four hours of the game: we lost count of how many times we faced a Mecha Tank or the Triple Thread Triad, having to use small variations of the same strategy to get rid of them . The lieutenantPlatinum's attempt to add variety through pro-bending challenges and short Temple Run-style sessions isn't enough to pick up the pace of the game, with the adventure ending in a mediocre and frustrating final fight.", "date": "2014-10-28", "grade": "5.5"}
