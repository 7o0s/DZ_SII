If you manage to look beyond the ocean of clones and carbon copies without art or part, however, it is not uncommon to find some product with the qualities necessary to make it emerge, and this is the case with Platfrom Panic here. Panic platforms, brother As an expert producer of flash games, Nitrome knows very well how to make a play structure completely understandable after a few seconds of gameplay, and Platform Panic is no exception. From the start screen, three pictograms are more than enough to explain the simple but effective control system, with the character moving independently (as in all self-respecting endless runners) and the user having to swipe his finger in horizontally to make him change direction or up to make him jump. With these few tools you have to try to move forward by following a path structured in quadrants, with each screen representing a level with particular pitfalls and obstacles: a counter in the upper part of the display indicates how many rooms have been overcome, and the goal is to so that this figure is as high as possible when death occurs due to contact with spikes, bullets, enemies and so on. The peculiarity of Platform Panic lies in the fact that the levels have a well-defined structure, but their succession is completely random, therefore the old rule of memorizing the path does not apply: passing from one level to another is always a surprise , and often and willingly good reflexes are required to be able to dodge the dangers that present themselves in front of us in time. Fortunately, the control system performs its task very well, proving to be reactive and precise enough to ensure that the game over occurs only due to any user deficiencies and not due to alleged disloyalty of the design. Another element exploited in an interesting way by Nitrome is that of the coins scattered (also randomly) within the levels: often deliberately positioned in risk areas, they constantly put the player in the position of having to decide whether to jeopardize progress to increase your loot. Platform Panic is a fun platform variation on the theme of endless runners The coins serve both to unlock new playable characters (there are nine in all, each inspired in a more or less evident way by the protagonists of 8 and 16-bit platformers), and as a duty to pay to continue playing in case of death: you start with a request of 15 units for the first grant, with the price multiplying for each subsequent event during the same game. Following what is a new course in the free to play philosophy, Nitrome does not push the hand with in-app purchases, preferring to support itself with advertisements that appear from time to time with pop-ups that are not too invasive or annoying: they are however, three packs of coins are available, sold at decidedly honest prices, given that the largest (5,000 pieces) costs only 3.59. Also considering this aspect, Platform Panic does not struggle to prove itself to be an absolutely advisable product for anyone looking for a fun and immediate game to be exploited as a pastime in the short daily downtimes. This is, in fact, the ideal dimension of a product which is in any case fundamentally repetitive in its essence, and which has not been conceived for particularly prolonged sessions. Even the technical sector seems to confirm this thesis, offering a deliberately old school approach which inevitably becomes monotonous in the long run. The various levels that make up the game are based on a handful of always the same graphic elements, and the very limited color palette certainly doesn't help to make the game more lively. Even the sound does its part in this sense, with only one background music that can be really irritating if listened to for too long. All elements that in any case cannot be considered as serious sins for a ~hit and run~ title like this.", "date": "2015-01-08", "grade": "8.0"}
