{"name": "Medabots AX (Rokusho e Metabee Version)", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medabots-ax-rokusho-e-metabee-version.html", "text": "Medabots Robatlle!! Medabots AX is the first videogame transposition of the new series in the style of Digimon, Pokemon and various clones that is raging in Japan at the moment. Natsume has decided to start with the Nintendo laptop to delight us (theoretically) with this new saga, already announcing the versions for the new generation consoles (PS2 and Gamecube above all) expected in a short time by the end of the year. What are Medabots?? Modular robotic monsters made to fight each other in arenas by their respective masters. And this is precisely the aspect on which the entire GameBoy Advance game revolves: fights.. fights... fights... and more fights in a multitude of arenas; not the slightest mention of the plot of the animated series, no further development, only the Medabots protagonists together with a multitude of gadgets to obtain and use and lots of fights...combattim...(yaaaawn).. But first things first. As you can already imagine knowing another much more famous series, the difference between the two versions of the game (Rokusho and Metabee) lies in the Medabots that will be assigned to you at the beginning (Rokusho .. which refers to an unspecified beetle and Metabee too, according to the info of the game, represents the armored scarab) and in the different components that you will get during the game. Obviously, therefore, it will be possible to exchange objects and challenge each other with friends through the use of the Link cable and only in this way will you be able to complete your collection (did it really need to be said??). Starting to play you will immediately find yourself in front of the map where the various locations of the arenas in which you will fight your Medabots are marked; the initial purpose is to clean up the first areas (Lake, Glacier, Forest, Ruins and some others) in order to finally access the main tournament that will take place in the Dome. Really, I haven't skipped anything, the choices that appear before you are exactly these: with the Select key you will save the game, with Start you will call up the menu and by moving the cursor you will select the destination ... neither more nor less ... no tutorial, no preamble that explains what the aim of the game is (very predictable however) no mention of various Advice or Help; you will be thrown into the unvarnished action without much ado. Medabots Robattle!! Again... Before each battle you will have the possibility to organize your ~robot~, modifying the pieces it can mount: head, right arm weapon, left arm weapon, legs and medal; this is for both the main robot that you will command and for your partner that will be controlled by the computer. Each component will have its own statistics: strength and range for the weapons, resistance, speed, passable terrain for the rest. A separate note should be made for the Medals, they could be defined as fighting styles, and in a certain sense it would not be wrong since your partner's AI will undergo drastic changes depending on which one you mount him on, while your Medabots will vary the various statistics such as the usual ones: Strength, Agility, Defense, Special attacks and so on. You will get the various medals by finishing all fights within an area or by defeating certain opponents in the main tournament. Once you have set up your ~robot~ you will enter the arena to beat each other up. The clash will be 2 vs 2, to win you will have to destroy the opponent's Leader's head being able to ignore his partner who will often pick on yours. Commanding your character is not difficult however, thanks to the absence of a simple tutorial, it will take a minimum of practice to understand all the mechanics of the game. However, with the A key you will use the Right weapon, pressing Down+A the Left weapon, Up+A the weapon planted on your head, with B you will jump, with L you will parry, with R you will select the type of AI of your partner and finally with Select you will launch the special attack once the usual bar is loaded. The arenas are different from each other, each characterized according to the place where it is located, therefore water on the seashore, many floors in the forest, ice in the icebox, traps and elevators in the factory and so on ... at least until you arrive at the Dome where you will always be forced to fight in the same arena made up of simple platforms. Obviously each stage will have repercussions on the robots, fighting in the water for a biped will not be an easy undertaking, as well as for a crawler to extricate itself between the branched platforms of the forest; however, you soon realize that all this originality will go down the drain with a little practice and you won't have any problems with any configuration of your character.BoredomBots.... Medabots AX offers colorful and fairly detailed graphics, the protagonist ~robots~ are faithful 2D reproductions of their drawn counterparts. The arenas are quite varied, but they certainly don't shine for originality both stylistically and conceptually; one realizes very soon how completely superfluous the environment in which you will fight will be. The action is frantic, fluid and fast, perhaps too confusing and above all repetitive.. dare I say.. tedious and frustrating. Frustration that increases with the dosage of the truly RANDOM difficulty, given that the order and the enemies to face is completely random, therefore you will face impossible opponents even immediately and then fall into the ridiculous with encounters that I know will end with two moves in the advanced levels . A note of merit goes to the truly above average sound, both for the effects with accurate use of speech, and for the music that also includes the reproduction of the main theme of the TV series. The longevity in single player seems really negligible, unless you are a huge fan of the series it won't last you long, you will get tired of this monotony and repetitiveness very quickly; multiplayer adds something more but the above discussion is still valid, given that most of the objects are obtained by playing in single. Comment Summing up if you are a fan of the series you might like it but I don't know exactly for how long: despite being packaged well as a product under the other departments it is enormously flawed perhaps under the most important profile, namely that of longevity and also of playability to be picky. It can be defined as a fairly fun little game that certainly doesn't shine for originality even if it is clear to everyone that it is a shameless clone that takes its cue from here and there to mix everything together in cocktails ... as mentioned before. ..difficult to digest. The advice is to try it before buying. Pros: Pleasant and colorful graphics Good sound Fairly fun Cons: Confusing gameplay Zero originality No real interest Take the Pokmon, add bolts and metal, a pinch of Platform-game, a sprinkle of Super Smash Bros Mele, a little ice, lemon... Mix everything and shake to the bitter end... what will you get?? A sour, bitter, acidic and not very digestible cocktail. Call it Medabots AX.", "date": "2002-12-11", "grade": null}
