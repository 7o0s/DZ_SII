{"name": "Ultimate Fighting Championship: Throwdown", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ultimate-fighting-championship-throwdown.html", "text": "What is that? On November 12, 1993, the world of combat was revolutionized by the advent of the UFC, a sport that allowed all the fighters in the world to challenge each other with all the fighting styles most congenial to them, from boxing to capoeira, in spectacular matches broadcast via pay per view. Now, after years of waiting, Crave Entertainment has decided to bring a game dedicated to this singular discipline to all the latest generation consoles, taking up the road opened years ago by minor titles such as Best of the Best (Mega Drive), Fighting Simulator (Game Boy) and K-1 Arena Fighters (Playstation), as well as trying to leap to the top of the still small list of fighting games on the Game Cube. Despite the aforementioned initial dismay, I must admit that this UFC enjoyed and intrigued me a lot, especially in the early days: in fact, it is really tempting to be able to choose from more than 25 characters - all of them really existing - with completely different fighting styles and a code of behavior that varies according to their characteristics, with wrestlers who will only try to throw you to the ground and kickboxers who will attack you with long distance kicks. Obviously, in addition to the arcade mode, different modes are added, such as the knockout tournament or the championship, after all all rather repetitive, given that it will always be a question of landing the same opponents in the same ring without too many variations on the theme of the game. The only breath of fresh air in the single player mode is therefore brought by the career mode, in which you can build your own character by choosing his personal data, face, shorts and fighting style (and there are so many, believe me): so far everything ok, even if I believe that a greater variety in the choice of faces and the possibility of changing the skin would have been welcome .. Having built your little - not so much - assassin you will have to get busy facing sparring partners of increasingly higher level to increase your skills and, unlike most Boxing simulation titles, your skills will rise exclusively with the fights, with no training sessions of any kind. It must be said, however, that this mode manages to make the game more durable, although it can get tired easily after a few games. And since we're talking about longevity, how do I define UFC's? Of course, as I already said, creating your own fighter is interesting, just as it is a good challenge to complete the game by beating all the opponents and finding the secret characters, but in the long run the game no longer offers challenges, making the lack of alternative modes heavily felt which, after all, would have also added an extra touch to the title. The technical part and the conclusions Graphically, the game is presented in a discreet way and while not exploiting all the technological potential of the GameCube it manages to at least keep up with its counterpart on Ps2, with clean graphics, quite fluid and equipped with not bad effects, although as I have already said and repeated does not have to manage situations and scenarios that are so different from each other. On the contrary, the sound appears insufficient both from the point of view of the almost non-existent music and for the sound effects and the voices which are also inadequate and absent. The introductory movie, to go back to the graphics, is a selection from real fights. Simply put, at least technically, the X-Box version is superior to both the Nintendo and Sony versions. We are faced with one of those classic ~average~ products that will however make the fans of more realistic fights chuffed. However, for the average gamer, the title can be as entertaining and entertaining as they want, but 90% of it will end up gathering dust on a shelf after a few months. Obviously the best way to play with it is to have it given to you by a relative instead of some sweater. Pros: More than 20 fighters Realistic Lots of fighting styles Cons: Technically upgradable Little variety Only men in thongs The hard life of the editor Being an editor, of course, has its ups and downs. Sometimes an unexpected masterpiece can fall into our hands, other times a title that we have been waiting for for months, but in some cases What to do when you find yourself in front of a game based on the Ultimate Fighting Championship? Seriously, this little premise only served to make you understand my dismay at what I believed to be one of the many even more unrealistic wrestling-like beat'em ups of the various Tekken & company. But let's go a little deeper...", "date": "2002-10-01", "grade": null}
