{"name": "Cart Fury", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cart-fury.html", "text": "Arcade perfect = state of the art? Let's start with the positive notes, which are not few: the speed of the game, with a frame rate of 50 frames per second, is really hair-raising, the tracks available (excluding the secret ones) are almost twenty, the pilots are quite famous (Andretti above all) , you can play in arcade mode, simulation or start a season and you rarely find such an immediate title: select the game mode, the driver, the track and you play, without problems, it is certainly not an exaggerated simulation like Gran Prix Legends, undisputed masterpiece of pure and raw simulations. Listed the good things of the Midway title, however, the inevitable sore points begin: the aforementioned screaming speed suffers some slowdown when there is a bit of tussle on the screen, a forgivable kitten defect if we were in the presence of a screaming graphic impact . The backdrops, scarcely bare, are ~embellished~ by elements such as buildings and trees, incredible but true, two-dimensional (two-dimensional, 2d, you got it right!!) which for a moment made me wonder if I had before my eyes the trust Playstation 2 which gave birth (excluding a CERTAIN game with the initials Gt3 for obvious reasons) racing games of the caliber of Formula 1 2001, Le Mans 24h and Ridge Racer V. Looking back, not even the Dreamcast would have deserved such poor visual programming but, to be honest, the coin-op is like this. The single-seaters, very lightly embellished by a bit of environmental bump mapping (obviously fictitious, as in Le Mans 24h, to be clear), are made just enough in terms of number of polygons and textures while the effect with which the reverb was made of the sun is certainly the worst ever seen in a driving game: always a sight for light gun games like the one for the future Time Crisis 2 and Vampire Night, both Namco coin-ops in the pipeline on Playstation 2. Arcade perfect = state of the art? We close the technical side of Cart Fury with some notes regarding the sound part of Midway's product: dance and rock music to make your skin crawl (now who is surprised anymore by some songs sung?), all in all acceptable sound effects and typically spoken by American commentator who is more reminiscent of a Wrestling match, despite having been sampled with a more than good quality. Arcade(a lot) and Simulation(a little) Cart Fury features, among others (such as the 2 player mode via split screen), three game modes: arcade, simulation and season. Choosing the first, with a handful of clicks you'll be on the track to battle for first place in the rankings with your opponents, reward many juicy extras by finishing first on each available track. One of the first things that catches the eye is the spectacularity of the accidents: seeing a couple of cars fly as if they were flies and recompose themselves despite the loss of ailerons and tires leaves one dumbfounded, even if clearly, one has winked at the assiduous visitors of arcades, which want spectacularity, fun and immediacy for the entire duration of the game. The presence of nitro, obtainable at the end of each lap, is further confirmation of what was said a few lines above: by pressing the key used for temporary acceleration from almost 400 km per hour (gulp!!! ndLL), your single-seater will go into a rage, giving off a flame that will last for the handful of seconds that the turbo will last. This feature, obviously, is missing in the simulation mode where one expects, always within the limits of a driving game for consoles, a stiffening of the game structure as regards the control method and a certain rate of adherence to reality: well, nitro aside, the driving model does not change, the accidents bordering on the absurd still peep out and the presence of the qualifying lap makes its appearance, as the only tangible difference from the arcade mode. The season mode closes the review of the types of races included in the package: the practice laps have been eliminated, the ~flaming~ nitro is back, there is no difference from the arcade mode, except that the order of the tracks to be tackled is established by American coders. Conclusions Cart Fury comes out at the wrong time, gripped by a fatal grip from Gt3, Le Mans 24h and F1 2001, to mention the exponents of the genre on Playstation 2 (and not only) and leaving aside the previously released crap. Graphically bare like few others, acoustically forgettable, Cart Fury can only be recommended to those who like to play senza too many frills from the point of view of adherence to reality and the difficulty of keeping your racing car firmly on track. Only in this case, the purchase of Cart fury gets some points of merit, by virtue of the frenzy due to the great speed of the game, the large number of tracks available and the fun that can be obtained from overcoming flocks of opponents on the screen without too much difficulty. For all the most demanding fans of this kind of racing, Formula 1 2001 by Studio Liverpool (formerly Psygnosis) is still the recommended choice, while if you want to buy just one racing game.ah yeah, sorry, I'm distracting you from your daily game to Gran Turismo 3, I know so well that no owner of Sony 128-bit black has dared not to buy it. Pros: a lot of tracks available immediate and fast like few others... Cons: not fun technical realization too scarce terrible music From the arcade to the Playstation 2 Midway is a software house now well known by gamers who, like myself, preferred to spend entire days in arcades instead of playing sports or something else: games like Nba Jam, San Francisco Rush and Mortal Kombat have yielded staggering sums to the famous American brand which has expanded its profits with conversions always up to the chosen hardware and which have climbed the sales and approval ratings of video games all over the world (who remembers the hype around Nba Jam Tournament Edition and Mortal Kombat 2 for Megadrive and Snes? ). Since the arrival of the 32-bit consoles (PSone and Saturn), the situation has gradually changed: despite the conversions becoming better and more faithful, the coin-ops (contraction of coin operators, videogames running on tokens) are , gradually decreased (after all with all that computing power available to the home player, things could only get worse); now it's home consoles that are so powerful that some coin-ops, recent or not, are already, technically, outdated. As an example of these words, we have the Cart Fury here, also from the aforementioned Midway, an arcade racing game, perfectly converted from a coin-op, with some extra modes, without, alas, adding however peculiarities such as to make it come out victorious with the racing games available for the Sony black monolith, never in such splendid shape as it is now and, above all, never so equipped with very high quality driving games as at the moment.", "date": "2001-07-27", "grade": null}
