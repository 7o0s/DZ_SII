In the new market structure, games of this type seem to find fertile ground only among independent productions, but if the results are comparable to what we examine in this review of Grand Mountain Adventure: Wonderlands, then we can be quite calm about the quality that the genre sportsman on snow is still able to reach. iOS version) and now also available on Nintendo Switch and PC in the new expanded edition with new challenges, multiplayer and the subtitle ~Wonderlands~. It is an original interpretation of snowboarding and skiing, centered above all on the pleasure of wandering freely on the snow, in a certain sense approaching - as hardly happens normally - the real experience of skiing. In a video game based on a sport or a real activity, when it is not a question of valid subjects proposing pure and simple simulations, usually one tries to build superstructures that make the experience a real ~game~, focusing on competition or on less realistic elements and spectacular, potentially more engaging for the general public. In this case we are instead dealing with a rare example of a more reflective and contemplative transposition of the original experience, which is in many respects more realistic than normal videogame reinterpretations, capable of generating good sensations without having to push too hard on the accelerator . Zen and the art of skiing Grand Mountain Adventure: Wonderlands, one of several explorable locations All there is to do is simply ski: once we have chosen whether to go skiing or snowboarding, we find ourselves wandering around some mountain locations following different slopes and progressively opening up new routes. The gameplay is extremely basic, yet it manages to create a complete and meaningful gaming experience, even if it always feels light and not very demanding. The mechanics involve taking part in various tests, usually already descending from various slopes in the shortest possible time and trying to go through all the doors, in order to obtain new ski passes as a reward and progressively unlock further slopes and settings. There are a total of 12 different environments, each consisting of various tracks and landmarks to unlock, and then explore the scenarios with freedom. The tests are broadly divided between Super G, Slopestyle and Big Air slalom, or rather they focus above all on the ability to follow the trajectories between the gates as quickly as possible, face obstacles and various grinds and jumps or dedicate oneself to acrobatics, with the possibility moreover to take part in multiplayer challenges for up to four players, thus expanding the game possibilities compared to the initial mobile version. Grand Mountain Adventure: Wonderlands, a picture of the game with an immaculate track If, on the other hand, you simply want to devote yourself to free exploration, the Zen mode allows you to enjoy the mountains without much pressure towards particular results. This ~Zen~ style makes Grand Mountain Adventure: Wonderlands a particular game, capable of reproducing the experience of being on the snow is quite convincing: obviously there are challenges, in some cases even spectacular such as when special events such as avalanches or jumps occur, but also thanks to the particular framing adopted, always rather distant and centered on the vision of large portions of scenario, there is never the tendency to paroxysm that is typical of games of this type. This obviously also means that it is not a gameplay suitable for all palates: those looking for adrenaline at all costs will hardly find the challenges of Grand Mountain Adventure: Wonderlands exciting, which rather focuses on the flow of movements and on the contemplation of snowy scenarios. Digital mountain tourism Grand Mountain Adventure: Wonderlands, a screenshot showing the breadth of the game camera Much of the appeal of Grand Mountain Adventure: Wonderlands comes from the impeccable style in which the art of skiing/snowboarding is portrayed in this game, which brings out a certain poetic note in the vision of the mountain that mixesto realism and idealization. The polygonal constructions are clearly very simple and we are far from the graphic complexity that larger titles such as Steep, for example, can offer, but the coherence with which Toppluva has built his vision makes everything perfectly accurate. The strange distant shot from the character opens the perspective on a wider breath, also taking advantage of a sort of bokeh effect that embellishes the scenarios making them similar to precious and detailed dioramas. Around our character, the surrounding environment seems alive among passers-by, skiers and mountain tourists intent on enjoying their holidays. In all of this, however, the starring role is taken by the snow itself: the shading used, the material effect which returns to the contact with the snowboard or skis, the possibility of leaving traces at different depths seems to reflect precisely the different consistency of the snow underfoot, contributing to the impression of being right on a small real mountain. The front shot, to be honest, is not the most comfortable: although the idea of the reversed perspective is appreciable, this is not particularly functional and sometimes it does not optimally follow the movements of the character or the curves of the paths inside the challenges, which can be a real additional obstacle.", "date": "2022-03-09", "grade": "7.8"}
