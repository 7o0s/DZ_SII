{"name": "FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flatout-ultimate-carnage-recensione.html", "text": "Dirty driving The comparison with Burnout is inevitable, given the similarities in terms of concept and structure of the two games. FlatOut is somehow the bad, dirty brother of the Criterion game: while the latter makes us race on shiny city streets, aboard fast and modern highly polished racing cars, the title of Bugbear instead has the flavor of the automobile rodeos of the American suburbs, full of mud, dust and twisted metal. The general look of the game reflects this trend: the cars are dirtier (that of the Derby class are really on the verge of scrap), the circuits wind in most cases in off-road sections, on mountain paths, on muddy tracks and dusty or run-down city areas. The structure of FlatOut is based on the two parallel lines of pure racing and brutal destruction: there are modalities that tend specifically to enhance one or the other ~specialty~, while in normal races both characteristics are kept in due consideration, with cash prizes ranging from leaderboard placement to destructive capabilities. The balance between driving and daring collisions is also optimal from a technical point of view, with a good model of car behavior on different types of terrain that places the game on the same level as an excellent ~normal~ racing arcade, and shock management between the cars and against the highly satisfying background elements. This balance determines a certain freedom of action for the player, who can enjoy the race by simply trying to drive well and finish in the top positions, concentrate on total destruction or devote himself to both activities equally: in all cases, the fun it is insured. The driving to the limit and the search for the clash is encouraged here through an expedient similar to what we saw in Burnout: the most dangerous manoeuvres, the clashes and the killing of elements of the scenario determine the recharging of the ~nitro~, which can be activated by pressing the A button, which gives the car a sudden super-acceleration with devastating effects. The approximately 40 tracks present are full of elements of the scenario that can be interacted with: this entails not only the possibility of knocking down anything that stands out on the edge of the track, but also to open real and proper gates, allowing access to shortcuts and alternative paths that can gain precious seconds on your opponents. Imagine the scene: during a race you notice a shed on the side of the road out of the corner of your eye and an idea comes to you; on the next lap instead of setting the curve you normally decide to cut directly through the shed, breaking through the doors and crossing it up to the opposite wall, returning to the road directly after the curve. One thing that can't help but elicit a smug smile. Professional demolisher Among the numerous modes available, the main one is obviously the ~FlatOut~, which can be associated with the traditional Career, in which we will have to earn money by winning races (or obtaining special awards for our ability to destroy) and advance from level to level. There are three fundamental categories: ~Derby~, ~Gara~ and ~Classe da Strada~, each characterized by a particular driving style required, and by suitable cars when necessary. All three classes are made up of different championships (made up of two or more races), and a series of special events of various types: there are time trials, Deathmatch Derby in which we will have to destroy our opponents within a arena and stuff like that. Concluding the various races with a podium finish, the championships and the highest level trials are unlocked. At the beginning of the game we will have the opportunity to buy only a Derby Class car, which represents the lowest level, based on mostly dirt tracks and low category vehicles. Once we have raised the necessary funds to buy the corresponding cars, we will consequently be able to unlock the ~Race~ and ~Road Class~ categories. The money is awarded in proportion to the position achieved within the various races, or by obtaining coveted awards such as ~Master of Destruction~, ~Demoman~, scoring the fastest lap and so on. The money can be invested by buying new cars at the dealership, or by upgrading the means already at our disposal. Clearly, we are far from the extreme customization of other titles of the genre, but the amount of modifications and new components that can be purchased to increase the performance of the cars is still more than decent. The level of challenge in the FlatOut mode remains high, also thanks to an artificial intelligence that at times oftento excessively favor the cars controlled by the CPU, making the cars in front of us always very difficult to reach and those behind us excessively close, so that a minimal mistake can compromise the entire race, especially when reaching the last meters of the track. However with perseverance, and the right investments in machine upgrades, you can advance from level to level without too much effort, while encountering some truly frustrating moments. Of course, this is not a particularly long challenge, but all the other modes present, and above all the multiplayer, intervene to increase the longevity of the game. Many ways to destroy a car The amount of different options and modes present in FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is commendable, providing a large amount of different challenges and varying the gaming experience considerably. In addition to the FlatOut mode, it is possible to engage in a series of other activities and types of racing: there are different options for multiplayer, and various specialties that can be tackled alone. One of these, which is particularly fun, is the Carnage, which contains a number of assorted tests, fragments of gameplay based on cars and accidents. Some are absolutely ~hit and run~ experiences: being able to perform a certain jump, causing certain damage, etc. Others, on the other hand, have a more complex structure, representing real alternatives to the classic race, such as the Deathmatch, which consists of a real ~Hazzard~ style rodeo, with the cars intent on demolishing each other in an arena , complete with bonuses and power ups to collect to upgrade the car or knock down your opponents in various ways. The excellent physics make this mode decidedly satisfying, with convincing and spectacular collisions: a worthy next-gen evolution of what we saw years ago with the good old Psygnosis Destruction Derby. Obviously, the most important alternative mode is represented by multiplayer, which plays a fundamental role in such a game: the single events and mini-games collected in the ~Party Mode~ represent an extremely effective way to modify the normal gaming experience, and above all to lengthen its longevity, although it is difficult to focus for a long time on what goes beyond the actual race or Deathmatch, which are ultimately the only modes capable of offering long-lasting fun. Via Xbox Live, it is possible to play together with up to a maximum of 8 users simultaneously in the race, and it is clear that this probably represents the maximum expression of FlatOut, which thus offers pure and inexhaustible fun, free from any connected limits to the tedium and limitations of simply battling the CPU. Gorgeous chaos The graphics of FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage are the most striking aspect. The tracks are full of interactable elements, the scenarios opulently detailed, while 12 cars are constantly intent on battling each other, crashing into each other and dragging objects on the edge of the track into chaos. In this orgy of polygons it is possible to see accidents involving 5 or 6 cars together, explosions, body fragments flying together with tires, logs, fences and road signs, all while the framerate remains solid at 30 fps, without a uncertainty, while racing at breakneck speed on the wings of the nitro. The polygonal models of the cars are excellent, but more amazing is the way they change in real time, with the bodies that fall apart to reveal the internal structure of the chassis, getting dirty and deforming with the accumulation of blows. Physics is the backbone of the game: its excellent implementation allows us to hit, deform and move almost everything we can see and reach with the car, with splendid results, in most cases. Unfortunately, there are also shortcomings in this system, discrepancies in the behavior of the various objects, which can lead to bizarre effects: it often happens that objects stick to the hood or roof of the car; invisible objects at first sight, hidden among others, turn out to be immovable, causing the crash of one's car or again, some elements of the scenario, mysteriously, are not subject to the same effects as the others (trees, for example, are absolutely immovable). In any case, the flaws are small, when compared to the amount of graphics moved by this Bugbear / Empire game, which truly sets a new qualitative model in the genre. The audio sector is suitable for the style of the game, at least as regards the soundtrack: the effects are absolutely anonymous and not very pleasant, but the tracklist is represented by a good assortment of ~alternative rock~ tracks. Twenty little-known songs that know how to instill the right energy, including pieces of 32 Leaves (~Waiting~), A Static Lullaby (~Hang'em High~) and Art of Dying (~You Don't Know Me~), among the others. Goals 360 The game contains 45 unlockable achievements, for the classic total of 1000 Gamerpoints. The arrangement of the achievements is quite disparate, as befits a game that makes differentiated events its main structure. Some can be reached by continuing in the FlatOut mode, passing levels and completing the various categories, but most are unlocked by obtaining specific results, such as a certain number of destroyed cars, collecting a certain number of victories or performing certain performances. A particularly hilarious achievement is ~Constancy~, which can be unlocked after a certain number of times that a race is interrupted and restarted: evidently the developers themselves have realized that at certain moments the game can become frustrating! Comment The only defects attributable to this FlatOut, apart from the problems of fraudulent AI and inconsistencies in the management of physics, are those inherent in the very structure of the genre. In particular, the game can tire, saturating the player with an overdose of speed and crashes, especially after extended sessions. However, the large amount of alternative modes and the solid multiplayer can easily remedy the problem, and considerably lengthen the longevity of the title in question. Practically everything else is positive: the technical realization is excellent in the richness of the graphics, supported by the physics applied to the elements of the scenario. The extensive interactivity with the latter allows a much freer and more facetious approach to the tracks, which can be interpreted at will, but most importantly: FlatOut is definitely fun. The fun comes from the excellent balance between the pleasure of arcade driving (jumps, drifts, off-road excursions) and that of indiscriminate destruction, properly supported by the addition of various types of races and above all by multiplayer. It is also true that this Ultimate Carnage adds practically nothing new to the structure of the series itself and of the competition, but while waiting to see the next gen developments of the genre, it stands as a reference point for ~destructive arcade racing~. Pros: Excellent technical realization Fun and immediate Large amount of selectable options and modes Cons: Fundamentally unchanged game structure Fraud artificial intelligence In the long run it tends to get boring Many studies have recently focused on the possible harmful effects of modern driving games. Can prolonged sessions with these products influence dangerous and violent driving behavior? There are those who say yes, there are those who cautiously say that the data lead nowhere at the moment, but these studies have never focused on one thing: how damned fun it is to drive beyond the limit of human possibilities, to overwhelm the car everything we encounter and cause terrible accidents, in the home security of our gaming station. One surely realizes that all of this is wrong, and may even secretly feel guilty about the damage done, yet one can't help but smile as the cars crash into each other. There must be, somewhere, a legacy of that childish spirit with which we used to play to make the cars collide as children, and this childish fun disguised under a sparkling next-gen graphics is the real strength of this genre of games. which finds in FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage one of the best exponents. The question is simple: to make money with racing, using any means, without any rule of fairness, indeed receiving incentives for incorrect and violent driving. It is an alternative trend to driving simulations that has met with increasing public acceptance over the years, from the first ~scandalous~ Carmageddon, through Destruction Derby, Need for Speed up to Burnout. The latter is the real opponent of FlatOut, with which it shares, in addition to the suffix, also a large part of the game structure and general feeling. The EA title developed by Criterion is the one that has so far stood out the most and has recorded the best results, but this new Bugbear/Empire Ultimate Carnage really has what it takes to overturn the odds and establish itself not only as the ~bad brother by Burnout, but also as the best.", "date": "2007-06-29", "grade": null}
