{"name": "Non  un paese per noob", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/78778-heroes-of-newerth-non-e-un-paese-per-noob.html", "text": "Having recently reached version 1.0.6.1, Heroes of Newerth has more than a year of beta testing behind it, a period in which some three million users have tried the game by providing their feedback to S2 Games. Over the months, the Californian development team has worked hard on the interface and on the technical/artistic sector, giving life to what we can define as the best possible tribute to Warcraft 3 or, more specifically, to the Defense of the Ancients mod. The initial idea was to somehow offer continuity to a classic (in many ways still unsurpassed) of the RTS genre, which still boasts millions of fans around the world and which therefore lent itself well to a current reinterpretation , able to distinguish itself not only from a technical point of view compared to DOTA, but also to include a series of optimizations aimed at making online multiplayer as fun and balanced as possible. Above all, the excellent management of the so-called ~leavers~, i.e. those players who voluntarily leave the game when things go badly, should be seen in this perspective: in HON, each user sees the percentage of disconnections stored in his profile, and while creating a match it is possible to add filters to prevent the less reliable from participating. Interestingly, unintentional disconnects don't end up hurting us, because in the event we are given some time to get back into the game. Furthermore, before accessing the ~official~ matchmaking, it is strongly recommended to ~gain your teeth~ (read: have them broken) within the numerous ~unclassified~ public matches for inexperienced players: at any time of the day we found at least three hundred to wait for us, and in any case creating one as needed is a matter of a few clicks of the mouse. Vertical learning curve? We can basically divide Heroes of Newerth players into two categories: on the one hand, the experts, those with years of playing Defense of the Ancients behind them, who know exactly what to expect from the game because they have actively participated in the beta testing; on the other hand, the inexperienced, with a great desire to learn, who have to resign themselves to playing the role of sacrificial victims and to collecting insults even from nine-year-old children who are much better than them. For the second category, let's face it right away, the impact with the S2 Games title can be traumatic. It's not a question of gameplay, mind you: controlling your character is a trivial operation, simply entrusted to the right click of the mouse and the keyboard; and in the same way it is easy to manage the experience points earned, using them to improve characteristics or to unlock special abilities (each character has four). It is rather a question of experience: the short tutorial explains how to move and suggests that we explore the map to get to know every nook and cranny, but the reality is that you have to play several games with each of the nearly seventy characters available to get to know them and establish at least what is the ~type~ with which we are better, as well as learning the different counters to the choices of the opponents. There are in fact three main attributes (agility, intelligence and strength) which determine the aptitude of each character and establish their basic characteristics (field of action, speed, ability to inflict damage, resistance, etc.), but the values specifics change drastically and make each warrior a story in itself. If we add that very often the games involve ~random picking~, or the random selection of the character, it becomes clear that specializing with only one of them becomes complicated. However, even more than the differences between the characters, we need to know the objects that Heroes of Newerth makes available to us through the ~shop~ that we can access from our starting point on the map. There are so many, and their use often determines the outcome of battles: we start from the less expensive, ~support~ objects, to those that substantially improve our attack and defense capabilities, passing through the potions that they restore health and mana. And let's not forget the objects of high strategic value, which in certain cases allow us to blend in or to carry out devastating attacks in a few seconds. The last will be the first To win the game you have to destroy the enemy base, with the possibility of infinite respawns which, however, weigh on the match statistics (the number of kills per faction is counted, in fact). Our character has six slots for as many objects, as well as additional slots where to place any andsuberi (which, however, will not be active). The object buying and selling system is simple and is based on the amount of gold we manage to obtain: at the start we have a handful, which slowly increases over time, but we can earn more by eliminating creatures that belong to the enemy faction or the enemies themselves , however, an operation that is far from simple if we are still at the beginning. Each faction has an almost infinite number of creatures, which are generated automatically and which, once ready, launch headlong towards our opponents' positions along three lines of attack. The matches have a maximum of five players on each side, but in public matches it is not uncommon to come across simple ~one against one~ or ~three against three~, in which these little monsters end up playing a fundamental role, since it is on their elimination that in fact the ~leveling~ of the characters is based, who from these killings earn the experience points we mentioned earlier, which are essential for making your warrior stronger or for activating his special abilities. In this sense it is essential to deny these kills to the opponents, eliminating their own creatures or defensive towers now almost without life points, so as to prevent the opponents from monetizing their destruction. The aforementioned special abilities often involve single attacks of a certain power or maneuvers that involve a certain portion of the map: if used wisely and at the right time, they can give us the necessary advantage to eliminate an enemy. However, the gameplay must always be interpreted from the point of view of the group: due to their peculiar characteristics, the characters should play a precise role within each game, avoiding throwing themselves headlong into a fight that would see them succumb in a few moments . It is therefore necessary to get organized, communicate, read up and try out: a significant commitment, which in the face of a truly fun and engaging experience can literally occupy you entire days. The technical sector, it must be said, is excellent: some elements of the interface are identical to those of DOTA, others even take up what was seen in Warcraft 3, but the integration work has been done very well and the characters are really well drawn and animated. On the test PC we were able to play at a resolution of 1680 x 1050, with all effects maxed out and v-sync activated, at a stable 60 fps and without hesitation (apart from some really messed up situations). HON therefore stands as a well-optimized and light title, within the reach of all configurations.", "date": "2010-07-05", "grade": "8.0"}
