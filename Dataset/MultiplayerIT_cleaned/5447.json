However, the Wii U version of Terraria was created with great care and is, on balance, the best of all the console editions, above all thanks to that much-mistreated GamePad. ~Too little, too late~, of course, for the game in this conversion, for the console and for the GamePad, and this, while increasing the bitter sensation in the mouth for the parable of the unfortunate Kyoto flagship, could also indicate what are the aspects of the whole Wii U experience to save, to then put to better use on NX. Finally Terraria also lands on Wii U: an excellent conversion, which perhaps arrived too late. The game... Terraria has been raging on the scene for more than five years, first only on PC, then gradually with versions for any machine imaginable. The simplest way to describe it, which is not by chance often used, is like a ~Minecraft in 2D~, an expression little loved by the community of enthusiasts and which is actually very concise and requires an in-depth explanation, but the fact is that the basic dynamics, those of having a game world and an arsenal completely modifiable by the player, are the same and, although Terraria even came out before Notch's game, one cannot but think that the idea and development were influenced by the two years that Minecraft has been in Early Access. From the basic concept, which then unites all sandbox games, the two titles certainly begin to differ profoundly, and Terraria shows a unique personality that fully justifies its success and could also do the same thing on Wii U, where Minecraft was also released only recently. The most evident difference lies in the 2D: the Re-Logic game is entirely two-dimensional, framed laterally like any platformer of the 8 and 16 bit era, and this has a profound impact on the gameplay not only in its more action part, but also in the development of the game worlds - procedurally generated - and in the consequent exploration. For one thing, Terraria strongly encourages you to dig as deep as possible not only for the extraction of the most precious minerals, but because you can come across real dungeons with their own structure, where the enemies are more dangerous and the rewards more tempting, gradually until it even flows into the Underworld. The emphasis placed on adventure and combat is another great prerogative of Terraria: there is no real story but each NPC could present his own, the various dungeons can vaguely recall those of the old Castlevanias, there are increasingly stronger bosses and, without prejudice to total freedom, also a certain sequence with which to face them so much that it is not advisable to deal with the strongest alone. Completely eradicating the most nefarious creatures could be the goal to set yourself; but the prospect of simply completing the map by exploring every nook and cranny is also tempting, just as the division of the environment into biomes should not be underestimated, two of which are ~bad~ and expand to the detriment of the others. Or maybe you just want to explore all the crafting possibilities, or start from the first refuge at the beginning of the game, because hostile creatures are very annoying at night, and then make a huge castle or part of a real city, where you can welcome as all the non-player characters we meet who, in one way or another, always give us an important help. ...and the paddock Terraria, we said, was born on PC, where the combination of keyboard and mouse provides the most natural control system for the game system based on the division of the map into many boxes on which one intervenes individually, to destroy and collect resources but above all to build. On PC then it strengthens and builds the thickest and most passionate community: the various console versions, although all of an excellent level, suffer from the control via pad a little precisely in the construction phases, not so much in the more action ones, also considered the fact that in the frequent recourse to the inventory the action does not stop and it could always happen that, intent on searching and equipping this or that among the numerous objects that you will have available at a certain point, an enemy surprises you and causes you damagehuge. The console version that behaved better from this point of view was the one for 3DS, which thanks to the touch screen could introduce the Precision Mode: with the stylus you went to intervene with absolute precision on the right box, and the two screens allowed you to always have the action under control even when you were engaged in item management. However, due to the limitations of the machine, Terraria suffered from various limitations on the Nintendo laptop, from the much smaller map size to the total absence of online cooperative multiplayer, the only way to face some of the most difficult challenges, limitations absent on the other consoles. Thanks to the GamePad, Terraria on Wii U proves capable of not giving up either the Precision Mode, which can be used with the stylus but also with the traditional buttons, or all the features available with the latest update on PC. In this sense we can talk about the best console version: although at the beginning you find yourself a little lost between the TV, the pad screen, the control system that allows you to interact both via buttons and via the touch screen, you soon understand how to proceed better and the gaming experience becomes almost as fluid as on a PC, releasing all its potential. The temptation to play exclusively on the pad is strong and in fact the action on the TV, due to the very distant zoom, is not the clearest. But conversely having two screens available comes in handy when you are in the inventory, navigation in which is obviously enhanced with touch control, and on a beautiful HD Terraria screen, with its colorful pixel art, its wealth of elements on the screen and its granite fluidity at 60 fps, despite not being a monstrous showcase of technology, overall it is a great sight. Even the music is anchored in the 16-bit era, but it never seemed up to the remarkable visual component, but this happened in all versions; and exactly as in all versions, the game can be played entirely in Italian. Finally, to further demonstrate the care placed by the team in this conversion, an internal goal system that at least partially compensates for its global lack in the Nintendo context.", "date": "2016-06-27", "grade": "8.5"}
