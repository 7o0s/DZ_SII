{"name": "Weird West", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/weird-west-recensione.html", "text": "In a competitive environment like that of independent video games, where standing out from the crowd is already extraordinarily difficult in itself, having a heavy and recognizable name is undoubtedly a very useful springboard to secure a publisher and some space under the spotlight. When the name in the field is that of Raphael Colantonio, the founder of Arkane Studios, one has the far from obvious certainty of arousing the attention of a certain part of the public with a fine palate, which immediately reconnects the character to a not to be underestimated list of critically acclaimed titles (and by anyone who loves quality level design). It is also for this reason that when the good Raphael left the caustic world of triple A, his Wolfeye Studios immediately entered the general imagination: starting from a small team of veterans and from the experience gained in the past, there were all the credentials for the creation of a small masterpiece. However, fame and hype are often too sharp double-edged swords and, if on the one hand it is legitimate to expect exploits of a certain level from a team made up of already established and capable developers, on the other the sudden change of working model can be traumatic for those who have always been used to taking advantage of considerable resources, leading to serious missteps. Colantonio and his team have also put their own into communication, portraying their little boy, Weird West, as a sort of immersive sim with a top view, and promising a mechanical and structural complexity comparable to that of the most famous productions. Today, obviously, we are here to evaluate whether or not what was promised has been respected, intrigued in particular by the fascinating setting of the Wolfeye game and by the possibilities of a team free from the ~harnesses~ of triple A productions. Let's find out together, in our review of Weird West. Narrative and setting: one brand, five destinies Weird West: You can kill whoever you want, but watch out for the repercussions As already mentioned, the narrative background of Colantonio's title is one of the main strengths of the entire production: the world in which Weird West is set is full of mysticism and violence, populated by various factions in conflict with each other and invaded by monstrosities unnatural from which it is good to avoid. In short, it is a brilliant fusion between dark fantasy and the old west, cleverly managed to represent a perfect stage for the events of our characters. The plural is not thrown there haphazardly, as your alter ego is a mysterious ~traveler~ who for some unknown reason takes control of five different individuals through an ancient ritual. It is therefore up to you to reveal the origins and motivations of this rite, in the role of protagonists connected only by the traumas of their existence and by a fiery brand on the skin that appeared at the moment of possession. We want to be honest (without running into dangerous spoilers), the plot of the game is actually not particularly elaborate, nor incredibly original, however it does its dirty work thanks to the variety of events that follow one another, to more fascinating characters than we expected, and to a very good general job done on the setting. It will be precisely the will to put an end to the events of the five protagonists that will be the main push to continue, and the possible conclusions offered are satisfactory enough not to transform what has been done into a waste of time (apart from some scattered inconsistencies). However, don't expect colossal transformations linked to your actions: there are crossroads and moral choices of a moderate strength that influence the world and characters, but now of the end, the possible closures remain a couple, apparently immutable. Gameplay and structure: many powers for nothing Weird West: Explosives are a quick and easy way to make a killing, but you have various powers at your disposal The fact that the story is a good engine of the experience should unequivocally be on the plus side; the problem is that in Weird West the narrative is the main driving force because ... the gameplay does not boast the same solidity. As already specified at the beginning of the review, Wolfeye have repeatedly stated that they want to create a sort of immersive sim with their first born and it is immediately evident how Weird West actually contains a plethora of mechanics and systems, designed to bring the player to experiment with as many tools as possible. But the whole structure collapses under the weight of the ambitions of its builders, for it lacks finesse and a strong enough foundation.missing: each of the five available characters has at least four unique skills, related to their history and able to significantly change the approach to battles; to these are added a series of common skills belonging to specific categories of weapons (to be exact, pistols, rifles, sawn-off barrels, and melee weapons), and a range of passive bonuses. The bonuses are even permanent for everyone, and must be unlocked with gold cards scattered around the game map, where the skills described above require slightly less rare artifacts. If you then apply all this goodness to a basic elemental system - which allows you to poison, electrify and set fire to enemies, or to transfer elements to some spells and projectiles - and a primitive stealth system, you get a mix of mechanics capable of making many triple A pale. Or rather... a system that could put super productions to shame, if only each of these founds were not superfluous or implemented in too rudimentary a way to really shine. Weird West: Characters have a myriad of abilities, too bad their usefulness is extremely relative Shooting is too basic, due to a practically useless cover system and the overwhelming power of a very unbalanced ~bullet time~ (it consumes the same energy as the other skills, but it is practically always the best option to dominate every fight). Crafting and resource management are pretty skippable, and even the progression doesn't offer much exploration boost due to the poor functionality of the powers compared to a simple shooting. And the most serious problem of all is to be found in the artificial intelligence: of such a rare stupidity as to crack the entire core of the fights. A Weird West fight You'll never really need to take cover against enemies who move like maniacs and run in your face ignoring any strategy. You will almost never be required to seriously exploit the elements, given that the weaknesses to them apply to very few opponents, however easily eliminated by alternative means. And finally you will never have real difficulties, if you decide to surround yourself with a ~posse~ of almost immortal companions (especially if enhanced) who sometimes manage to clean up entire areas practically by themselves. Think, from chapter to chapter it is even possible to recruit your previous alter ego with the upgrades obtained during your game (provided it is not badly cracked), to make your life even easier. Considering that these balance issues don't appear as you progress, but practically from the beginning, it's difficult to consider Weird West a game calculated with great wit. For heaven's sake, this caciaronaggine sometimes creates hilarious situations, yet the fun resulting from moments of chaos is not enough to raise everything. Technical sector and conclusions: revenge does not pay Weird West: Blood is not missing in this game The enemy AI is also the elephant in the room when it comes to stealth, due to a couple of other not exactly very clever choices by the team. The paths of the enemies are in fact normally fixed, but they can become extremely erratic if you try to distract them with noises (a mechanic that should help you, and actually complicates life in a senseless way), and that was not enough, their position resets itself in certain locations, because the saves don't keep track of their movements. You could then save once you silently reach a room, convinced you're safe, reload after an unfortunate death, and find yourself facing a guard who shouldn't be there at the time. It is a series of factors that make the whole silent approach annoying to say the least, and the idea of a ~pacifist~ modus operandi (moreover supported by the game) really to be avoided. These are shortcomings that could be partially ignored in a ~real ~ immersive sim, with such a complexity at the base that battles are almost a surplus, however Weird West is almost entirely focused on this aspect. Almost every quest in the game leads to some encampment full of enemies, and exploring the map is usually reduced to the discovery of population centers (with other side quests or bounties to be collected), or to some random events that - outside of further inevitable unwanted firefights - only rarely are they really interesting. Paradoxically, the only moments in which we had to sharpen our wits slightly by tackling some puzzles occurred in the final stages of the adventure; the fact that doors are destructible or can be bypassed by reaching alternative openings is applied in such an obvious way that it cannot even be considered aor added mental effort. Weird West: the gallery of the protagonists is more varied than you think, with some surprises Finally, since there is a physical system to support everything, there are inevitable bugs, ranging from the usual hilarious moments deriving from the absurd ragdoll of enemy corpses, to more annoying moments such as sudden deaths from chain reactions that shouldn't go wild in that way, or games to be reloaded due to essential items thrown off the map (if nothing else, this last thing rarely happened to us). All in all, it's a real shame, because Wolfeye have undoubtedly worked to churn out a more massive and surprising indie than the average: the title has a more than fair longevity, which can go from 15 to 40 hours if you decide to explore the explorable; there is a morality system linked to the actions performed, which leads certain locations to become abandoned and characters to guarantee lasting friendship to the protagonists or to swear revenge - and to intervene randomly in a positive or negative way during some clashes - while artistically the title has a certain uniqueness worthy of praise, despite graphics that are anything but exceptional. The final impression, however, is that of a team of professionals accustomed to other resources and other rhythms, who created a game far too ambitious for its current possibilities, and failed to give the desired shape to the original concept with only talent. Who knows, maybe they'll make it next time, because even bearing in mind the many flaws discussed, they've still managed to create an enjoyable and atmospheric adventure.", "date": "2022-03-31", "grade": "6.8"}
