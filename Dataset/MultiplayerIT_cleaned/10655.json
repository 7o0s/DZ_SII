Last June, between a new iPhone and serious applications, it was the turn of the guys from Rough Cookie to show the audience their Star Defense, yet another strategy able to abandon the simple and functional look often proposed by this kind of production in favor of a extraordinary production quality, flattering for the potential of both the iPhone and the iPod Touch. Universe in motion Once again, the basic dynamics are those of defense of one's base through the positioning of more or less powerful weapons along the paths followed by the enemies, so as to stop their advance and resist all waves. The arsenal available to the player will count five different types of units, from the simple cannon to a sort of plasma and flamethrower version of it, from a turret capable of slowing down the opponents to one equipped with electric shock emitters, each in turn ready to receive two upgrades. All of which can be purchased thanks to the money earned by eliminating the opponents and being careful to place the perfect offensive tools on the ground for each type of attack. A well-balanced and fun complex but not particularly new in and of itself, if it weren't for the complete three-dimensionality of each level, a small planet that is different every time capable of introducing the further complication of having to zoom and rotate continuously to follow the attacks, counterattacking at best. What on paper might have seemed like an overly ambitious project, with complex specifications beyond the potential of the machine, turns out instead to be perfectly realised, with the dozens of elements on the screen never seeming grotesque in their models or details and with the small worlds very well characterized, as well as accompanied by a more than good soundtrack and excellent effects, more or less audible depending on the distance at which the view is placed with respect to the action. The writer has played it with a first generation iPod Touch and, apart from some slowdowns and rather long loading times, there have been no performance problems; anyone with newer devices and especially the new 3Gs, shouldn't even worry about those little glitches. To embellish a handful of hours long campaign, there is the classic mode during which you resist as long as possible, then recording your score and being able to report it to friends, directly from within the application, on Facebook and Twitter. The tested version is 1.1. If you have the 3.0 operating system, some additional options and a better ranking system will become available.", "date": "2009-07-06", "grade": "9.0"}
