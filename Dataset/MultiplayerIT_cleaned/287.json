{"name": "EyeToy: Lemmings", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eyetoy-lemmings.html", "text": "Lemmings? Who has never played with Lemmings? This successful puzzle game was born fifteen years ago, and since then it has been played on any game system, from PC to Mac, from CD-I to 3DO. The game mechanic has remained almost unchanged with each new appearance: using a pointer, we will have to help a series of Lemmings to overcome various obstacles safely and get to the exit of each stage. These little animals do not seem to realize the danger, and therefore you will see them walking towards the void or meeting traps of all kinds without batting an eye. With a limited set of skills to assign to each Lemming, you will have to find a way to get a minimum number of little creatures to the finish line at each stage. In many cases this will involve the sacrifice of some of them, so the strategic component becomes stronger as you progress through the levels (many) and generally you will find the system to overcome each area in the best way, through a series of attempts . To give you an idea of how Lemmings works, let's say there's a level where these creatures are dropped onto a platform and start walking to the right. On that side there is the abyss, so we will have to check if we have the umbrella among the skills to be assigned: if so, it will be enough to equip each Lemming with the object for the landing to be smooth and the walk to continue towards the exit of the stage. Otherwise, we will have to stop its advance by assigning the first in line the ability to make the others change direction, then see if it is possible to get to the ground by falling from a short distance onto other platforms. Features of the PS2 version EyeToy: Lemmings for PS2 is the conversion of Lemmings PSP, so you'll find all the stages and skills seen on the Sony laptop. This translates into two main game modes that differ only in the type of stage, to which, however, the EyeToy mode has been added. The owners of this particular peripheral will be able to try their hand at a series of levels in which there is no pointer and there are no skills, but ourselves on the screen to prevent the Lemmings from dying for one reason or another. And so we'll find ourselves building bridges and stairs with our hands, hoping that no one sees us while we do it... Usually, each version of Lemmings differs from the others in the design of the levels and in the skills that can be assigned. As far as the levels are concerned, it is impossible to make comparisons: they are so many and different from each other that they can only represent a strong point of this product. And the skills are no less, in number and peculiarity: it is possible to transform the Lemmings into climbers, make them dig holes or cross walls, make them build stairs, make them capable of landing unharmed from great heights or reverse the direction of their companions. And explode, of course, when there are no workarounds to clear the level On a technical level, EyeToy: Lemmings is very well done. The levels are wider than the screen and therefore you need to move the right analog stick to scroll them, and in that case the movement is very smooth. In fact there is little else: the polygonal elements in the background move but do not show much detail. Let's say that it's all functional to the gameplay, plus a really successful and high quality sound commentary. [C] The skills assignable are numerous... ...and knowing how to use them well requires a minimum of practice. How to get to the finish line unscathed? [/C] Comment When you are faced with a video game that is out of the ordinary, it is usually recommended only to lovers of the genre. Lemmings is certainly an ~alternative~ game and unique in its mechanics, which however has been around for many years and which therefore has a solid base of fans. The attempt of Team 17, in this case, is to adapt their creature to the canons of the latest generation consoles, and the presence of levels that exploit the EyeToy peripheral only confirms the choice. In the end, however, the substance does not change: if you like puzzle games and Lemmings in particular, EyeToy: Lemmings is a product to be taken into serious consideration. If you're looking for more from your PS2, however well, keep at it. Pros: Very well programmed Lots of levels Fun and original EyeToy feature Cons: It's the same game as fifteen years ago If you don't like puzzle games, you're unlikely to love this If there is a platform that has been lucky enough to enjoy the work of the cream of developers, this is Amiga. Whatever the model, the Commodore personal computer has always had very convincing weapons for any budding programmer, and has seen the growth of entire generations of software housesthey challenged with parallax scrolling shots and giant sprites. This tradition has been somewhat lost on 32-bit consoles, but it's nice to be able to see on PS2, even during its inevitable senile phase, the same quality that hides nights spent in front of a code to make scrolling of 2D images extremely fluid high resolution.
