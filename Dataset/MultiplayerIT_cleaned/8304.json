The aim of Cinemax, the developer, is quite clear: to produce a classic RPG full of substance and with few concessions to the most superficial factors. Although some screenshots can be deceiving, given that the energy bars and shortcut slots scream Diablo from everywhere, the reality is that it is enough to hold the mouse and start creating the character to realize how the main source of inspiration be more Baldur's Gate. Choosing the class, you have to decide how to distribute the points of the characteristics and which schools of magic to embrace. Each class is very different from the others and has unique abilities, which can be improved by leveling up and distributing the appropriate points, and specific objectives related to their role: The paladin must rise through the ranks of his order, the thief must clear his name and the priest must become an inquisitor. In terms of cosmetic options for our hero, Inquisitor is really sparing: you can choose the name, select a portrait from the default ones and that's it. Not bad, given that the graphics are not exactly the strong point of the Cinemax title. Texture and interface At first glance, the game universe seems to have come out of the most typical fantasy, but that's not the case. Inquisitor takes its cues from Western medieval history and mythology, with the Spanish Inquisition, God, angels and so on. Sure, there's no shortage of fantastic elements (the first mission is a hunt for giant bats, for example), but we're dealing with a fairly new setting, especially given the standards of recent years. The plot of the game begins with a murder that we were called to investigate, after being freed from the inquisition. Once we reach a small town we will have to gain access by doing a job for the guards and then give us investigations by talking to the inhabitants and exploring the place. The game interface is quite simple, if you already know titles of this kind: with the left button you perform the actions (movement, attack, dialogue and so on), with the right button you use the spells or selected objects and keyboard shortcuts call up the various menus. The combat is very similar to that seen in BioWare's debut title: you click on an enemy and the fight proceeds automatically (there is no need to click continuously). It all depends on the roll of the dice. Obviously there is an inventory with the equipment to be assigned, but don't expect to find dozens of ~swords with curved points after having pierced a Sempione park weasel that were actually a drug dealer~. However, there is a higher characterization than the current average. Parties and quests You will soon discover that wandering alone is sheer madness. To face the dangers of the world of Inquisitor you need a party. There are several characters to choose from, all automatically managed by the CPU in terms of growth and equipment. The only possible interactions are generic orders given by pressing keys. In principle, the companions will behave decently and will not require too many interventions, but in some cases it will be necessary to intervene directly if you do not want to end up massacred. For example, it is not the case that they advance too much independently by activating too many enemies and sometimes it would be nice if they helped us more, without having to constantly yell at them various commands. Could there be missing quests in an RPG? Absolutely not. From this point of view Inquisitor is really well done and gives beer to much more famous titles. Luckily you don't get inundated with crazy bellhop requests (although there are such things) and many side tasks are interesting and often reveal important plot points. Here too the model seems to be more the old BioWare than a World of Warcraft or any Diablo. Indeed, let's say more: the quests can turn out to be the best part of the game, provided you are ready to accept some radical design choices. The Rigidity of the Inquisition Some aspects of Inquisitor can leave modern players dumbfounded. For example, the interface information is reduced to the bone, ie there are no indicators that tell you where to go and what to do, there are no directional arrows and there are no help of any kind. This entails two things: the first is that dialogues cannot be skipped, on pain of losing vital information (even if the latter is noted in the adventure diary), the second is that the various locations in which the game is divided must be explored from beginning to endndo. Of course, each area has its own map (the game world is structured identically to Baldur's Gate, i.e. with areas that are loaded separately and accessed from a general map), but you shouldn't expect facilitations. Such a radical vision of role-playing may or may not like it, depending on everyone's tastes. What surely no one will like is the confusion that reigns in the aforementioned adventure diary. At first you don't pay much attention to it, but when information and missions accumulate, the structure chosen by the developers becomes difficult to digest, because to find what we need at the moment we often have to scroll through dozens of annotations. Perhaps in this case it would have been better to be more modern and create a better index for the contents. Difficulties and technical aspects Inquisitor is a difficult title, as you will have understood by reading its characteristics. There is no help, other than textual directions, on where to go and you often wander around areas encountering enemies too strong for your level. Furthermore, there is not a single aspect of the game designed to make life easier for the player. Let's take the three basic characteristics: health, stamina and mana. The first and third don't reload automatically, and it can even be there, while the second does... but so slowly as to be almost frustrating. Also when you run the reload stops. It is true that one can walk, but in doing so the movements become so slow that one almost prefers to stand still. That's right, you say, because in this way you don't use special skills at full throttle. The problem is that stamina is also consumed by normal attacks and when the gauge is depleted the character hurts much less and becomes slower. You will understand that buying (or finding) potions is not only a possibility, but a necessity. From a graphic point of view Inquisitor is ugly, even if compared to the old titles made with the Infinity Engine. It's not just a problem of drawing the various locations and objects, but also of various animations and effects. Those looking for substance will not pay attention to it, and it is also true that being an indie production and having really many elements inside it, it would have been difficult to take care of the graphics without a large team behind it. Something more, however, could certainly be done.", "date": "2012-09-27", "grade": "7.8"}
