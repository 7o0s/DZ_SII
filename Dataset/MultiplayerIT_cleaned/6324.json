In general, the golden rule also applies to this genre which sees titles specifically designed for the devices in question dominate, in terms of coherence and playability, conversions or re-adaptations of games released on platforms of different types. There are illustrious exceptions to this rule, but Beast Quest turns out to be an excellent confirmation of the principle, demonstrating how sometimes it is necessary to overturn the classic canon a bit to meet new types of use. To tell the truth, MiniClip's game is more of an action-adventure hybrid than a classic RPG, but the character leveling and progression mechanics are one of the main drivers of its structure, which brings it significantly closer to the RPG family. It involves moving the protagonist within three-dimensional environments, through a third-person shot from behind the shoulders and with a simple and reactive control system based on which it is sufficient to hold down a button to move forward, with the possibility to move your gaze and change direction simply by swiping a second finger on the screen. Compared to the chilling screen command cockpits of many other productions, here we touch cathartic minimalism and it is a real joy to control the protagonist with this simplicity in the exploration phases. The cleanliness of the interface takes up a general elegance in the graphic style adopted, which, based on rather simple but evocative structures, manages to build large and open environments in which it is possible to move with great fluidity. Stride, in all this, the cheesy realization of the 2D portraits of the characters. The story develops in a rather elementary way, with the protagonist Tom and his partner Elenna grappling with the hunt for a sort of Yeti in a glacial area which then becomes more complicated in a long series of quests, ranging between different settings and with the interaction of various NPCs. Tom's great adventure in Beast Quest starts from the search for the Yeti (or something like that). The hunt continues The combat system substantially changes the cards on the table with respect to the exploration phases, but remains firmly anchored to a sensible use of the touch screen. In these phases the game is rather reminiscent of Infinity Blade, with a key to perform attacks with the sword, a key to parry with the shield (which offers limited protection, given the numbered amount of defenses possible) and keys that allow dodging in two directions, to be chosen and implemented at the right time in order not to suffer damage. Occasionally, especially when you find yourself facing multiple enemies at the same time, some sorts of quick time events also appear that allow special attacks. The system is much less cumbersome than it might seem and within a few minutes you become familiar with it, and although the level of challenge is maintained for the vast majority of the time on rather low standards, the good construction of the combat system never makes heavy the battle against the numerous enemies that are encountered around the settings. The structure of the quests is extremely simple, consisting in most cases of typical fetch quests in search of items to deliver to the NPC of turn or need to take down a certain number of enemies, however overall Beast Quest manages to keep you glued to the screen for even rather long sessions, compared to the average of mobile titles. There is something, between the general pleasantness of the controls, the good graphic scaffolding and the continuous sense of progression that pushes us to move forward even when we realize that the variety of situations in which it is possible to find ourselves is actually rather small. There is a particular system of unlockable achievements that gratifies the player for practically anything he does, and although the personalization of the protagonist is practically non-existent, with the possibility of applying experience points within a few pre-set parameters, the quick accumulation of points capable of evolving Tom soon turns into a rather addictive mechanism. The free-to-play setting allows you to speed up the conquest of objects or increases in statistics with the immediate purchase of gems, but does not distort the normal progress that can take place even without in-app purchases of any kind.", "date": "2015-05-21", "grade": "8.0"}
