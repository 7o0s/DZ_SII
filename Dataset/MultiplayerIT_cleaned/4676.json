Larian Studios was in dire economic waters and as a last resort chose the path of crowdfunding to finance a hardcore prequel to the Divinity series. A bit like what happened with Obsidian and its Pillars of Eternity, one of the best hardcore role-playing games of recent years came out of it, a true evolution of a genre that the big publishers have long since abandoned. Once the critical acclaim and sales success also arrived, it was natural that Larian would follow up on that experience, returning to Kickstarter with an even more ambitious project: to create a sequel that improved all the most critical points of the original, reported by press and players. The result is Divinity: Original Sin II, a title that amazes for more than one reason. But let's not rush too much, because there is so much to say. Divinity: Original Sin II tells of a witch who voluntarily lets herself be taken to the prison island of Fort Joy, where anyone with powers related to the magical Source energy is segregated, of which we will learn more in the course of the game (or which will know almost everyone who has played the other titles in the series) to accomplish an unspecified mission. After creating a character, or selecting one of those pre-generated by the developers, we wake up on a ship at the mercy of a storm. We wear only rags and a collar that inhibits the use of spells based on the Source. We too are headed to Fort Joy, but we immediately understand that something is wrong. Exploring the ship we discover that a murder has been committed and we talk to our future adventure companions (they will become one once they arrive at Fort Joy), who are also prisoners: the lizard man Red Prince, the assassin Sebille, the dwarf Beast, the shady Ifan Ben-Mezd, the musician Lohse and the mysterious Fane. We also meet the witch in a sequence that starts the events that will be explained and developed throughout the game. Already in this first section, obviously designed to familiarize yourself with the various mechanics, which we will discuss in the next paragraph, you are called to make a series of choices in the dialogues and you can test some of the main features of the gameplay, such as the presence of small puzzles to access certain areas, or the versatility of the combat system. The good part, however, has not yet arrived. Evolving The game system of Divinity: Original Sin II is particularly complex, but gives great satisfaction. The party can not only talk to the other characters, pick up and leave objects, interact with some elements of the scenario and fight, but also create or upgrade objects through recipes (or through experimentation), use skills to discover hidden treasures, to crack locks , to infiltrate without being seen, to identify magical items, to snatch NPCs and much more. Obviously there are all those systems related to the growth and enhancement of the characters, with characteristics on which to spend the points acquired by leveling up, equipment to manage, skills to learn by reading books or unlockable by progressing in the story. The best part, however, is not the amount of mechanics themselves, but their ability to coexist and intertwine naturally, without compromising the gameplay. After doing a little practice with the controls, easy to manage using the mouse and keyboard (at least if you have experience with the genre), a little more cumbersome if you decide to use a gamepad (we advise against it, even if it can useful for playing in split screen with some friends) it is understood that it would have been difficult to create such a deep title by cutting summary or input screens. The same game diary, which gives general indications on the missions without placing annoying indicators for amateurs on the map, is designed for those who love role-playing games in their oldest sense, that is, the one that did not provide help at every step, but it left the player free to experiment and, why not, to fail. After all, only those who consider you an idiot think they have to help you tie your shoes too. At most in Original Sin II there is a tutorial made up of pop-up windows in which the basic concepts are explained and that's it. Whoever explores more deeply is always rewarded and whoever studies the control system the most, trying to understand all its facets, too. Talking to the characters you meet during the adventure, using a classic multiple-choice system, gives great satisfaction, partly because the dialogues are written better thanto those of the first episode, partly because they offer more options, some linked to the background of the characters (each selected trait can unlock one more), others to their history (certain non-player characters could be more or less suspicious depending on the chosen travel companions), and a bit because in general the Larian boys have done a great job not only on the screenplay, but also on the mythology that is its background, creating more detailed and interesting references to follow. In short, the money spent on hiring other writers has not gone to waste. But after all we are talking about a job done with great care, which also went to review aspects that worked very well in the first episode, such as the combat system. No Italian Divinity: Original Sin II features, among other things, a huge amount of text. Unfortunately it has not been translated into Italian due to the excessive costs of the operation compared to the potential public of our country. Among other things, the English used is not the simplest, between slang and particular stylistic choices for some dialogues. The conclusion is that, although it is an excellent title, if you don't have a good knowledge of Shakespeare's language, we advise you to avoid it, because you would lose many details along the way and would have more than a few difficulties playing. Combat tactics Divinity: Original Sin II has a turn-based combat system based on spending points to perform various actions. Each turn you can decide whether to attack, move or use special items and abilities. Each action has its precise cost. Once the available points have been used up, the turn passes to the next character. On paper this is a very classic system, but Larian has revised it in such a way as to make each fight a challenge in itself. Meanwhile, we specify that there is no battle identical to the other: of course, there are similar enemies, but the circumstance in which you meet them can completely change the tactics to be used to defeat them. Let's take a practical example, which will clarify the issue better than any generic description: after a few hours of play we had to infiltrate an underground prison. Exploring it we met some magisters who were plotting. We decided to face them head on, but we couldn't do much: the group of enemies consisted of two resistant melee fighters and two archers positioned on elevated platforms that gave them excellent visibility. Things immediately went bad: one of the two fighters summoned a hellhound and we ended up outnumbered. Meanwhile the archers were shooting us from above. As you will understand it was a total failure. So we decided to completely change the approach (not changing anything in terms of equipment). We explored the prison again and developed a somewhat treacherous tactic, inspired by the historical story of the Horatii and Curiazi, which despite the centuries has proved to be decidedly effective: put the group in a room, we detached the assassin Sebille and the 'we sent in stealth mode to the magisters. We got as close as possible and threw a Molotov cocktail at the two fighters, catching their attention. Sebille is a very mobile character and it only took one turn for her to escape to the room where the rest of the party was (another character would have taken two, making the tactic futile). The fighters chased it, outdistancing the archers, who, having no visibility, were unable to attack and had to get off their positions. The fight took place in the room, where we could face up to three enemies at once. Obviously things went completely different than the previous attempt and we defeated them without major problems. It should be noted that the same tactic used on other occasions has proved unsuccessful. For example, in one case, pyromancers turned our shelter into a furnace and forced us out into the open. When we found ourselves surrounded by many enemies and we were about to lose the last character of the party, we realized that we had to study another tactic (or try again after gaining a few levels). These few examples, among the many feasible ones, should make you understand the goodness of the combat system of Divinity: Original Sin II, capable of transforming each encounter into a unique moment that requires the player to observe the battlefield, develop a tactic, keeping always keep in mind not to underestimate even a single enemy. A new world As happened for all other aspects of the gameor described above, Larian has done a truly enormous job to address the criticisms leveled at the engine of the first episode, which to be honest was not exactly great. Rest assured, because Divinity: Original Sin II is much nicer to look at than the original, with more defined and detailed characters, a world full of elements, varied and alive, capable of responding effectively to the player's requests, and with spectacular spell effects. Let's say that it is more than a head above not only the first Original Sin, but also many other representatives of the genre of hardcore RPGs (action ones are another matter... but usually they also have other budgets and offer systems much milder gameplay). Too bad for the lack of a more marked and peculiar visual style, one that makes the world of Divinity unique. Currently the chosen one is the result of a very conservative vision of fantasy, both in the forms and in the representation. Some progress has been made compared to the rest of the series, also thanks to the enrichment of its mythology, which however has been implemented above all at a narrative level, but in our opinion we could aim for something more original, which gives it greater autonomy and Force. We'll see what Larian does with the next few episodes (provided this one sells enough). Finally, it is impossible not to mention the immense soundtrack, linked in part to the musical instrument preferred by the character (selectable during creation) and made up of intense and dramatic songs, which fluidify the epic tones of the entire game, creating a remarkable amalgam thickness, which keeps you glued throughout the adventure. We leave it to the commentary to give a definitive vision of the overall quality of Original Sin II, here we can only add a couple of details of general interest: it takes tens of hours to finish the game (more or less depending difficulty level selected), but the adventure can easily be replayed at least twice, to discover all the stories of the protagonists. If it seems too much, know that it is definitely worth it, also because with different characters the fights completely change their face and it seems to play a title that is not new, but at least different, which does not make you regret the time spent on it.", "date": "2017-09-15", "grade": "9.4"}
