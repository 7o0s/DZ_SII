This game, from whatever point of view you want to look at it, always boils down to just one word: disastrous. Comparing it with Rome: Total War seems unfair to us, in the sense that Great Battles of Rome comes out destroyed in any sector. So let's try to look at the game itself without being influenced by the competition, but then we re-read the first paragraph of this article and think: ~that's all~, in the sense that there really isn't anything else and we feel slightly embarrassed because it was so much something like this didn't happen to us. In reality, faced with a little game put up in a hurry and so poor as to disfigure with titles from about ten years ago (but even more... on C64 there were strategy games of much different thickness), we did everything to look for something to to save. Unfortunately the more we played the more we realized that there is really nothing to save. Take the algorithm ~buy troops - buy upgrades - place troops on a very small strategic map - decide how they move - start the battle - watch~, armies can be placed in defensive formation or in offensive formation. The rest is chaos repeat it dozens of times and you will have an idea of what Great Battles of Rome is. The worst part is undoubtedly represented by the battles, the real fulcrum of the game, which often boil down to getting the troops right in front of the inert enemies (who never bother to take any counter-move): spearmen against cavalry, infantry against spearmen and so on. No other factor seems to really affect the outcome of a fight; forget therefore having to consider the roughness of the terrain (just mentioned here), forget the refined assault tactics of any Total War or the articulated differentiation of the troops seen in a thousand other RTS. There is none of that here. Sometimes it feels like rock, paper, scissors. The situation is resolved in some advanced battles, in which however, to produce a minimum of fun, it is only the number of troops that requires a certain attention in moving them, in order not to run out of available order points. But is it possible that in the middle of 2007 the developers didn't think of implementing an AI capable of at least attempting an encirclement? Is it possible that the AI often keeps entire armies still while others are busy fighting? In some cases, the lack of responsiveness of the AI is terrifying and makes winning more of an abstract practice than a matter of commitment. The multiplayer As with the hardware box, we must also leave the multiplayer judgment open, given that at the time of the test the servers were practically empty. The options, however, are not many and obviously many of the structural defects experienced in single player will remain. Based on the feedback on the game we will see to return to the topic. Total what? Even at the level of management we are not really there. There are few orders that can be given: you can stand still, move or load. In terms of formations, we are in even worse shape: the armies can be arranged in defensive formation or in offensive formation. The rest is chaos. But it doesn't end there. A real campaign is missing and the battles seem stuck one after the other without a real why. That is, the evolution of Rome is followed from its birth to the expansion of the Empire, albeit in an all too generic and approximate way, lacking precise evolutionary references, all divided into different sections that the developers would like to pass off as campaigns. But we were talking about historical inaccuracies. Leaving aside the troops, how about a battle between Romans and Sabines fought in the snow? The developers probably don't know the geography of Lazio well... the same can be said for countless other battles, set on scenarios that aim more at variety than at historical realism. A little attention, guys, you have the History Channel stamp From a technical point of view, Great Battles of Rome is on ridiculous levels. The graphics engine is that of Legion: Arena which was already ugly in its time. The 3D graphics look bad with all the latest RTS: the models are poor in detail, extremely blocky and are badly animated. Bad animations produce unspectacular and confusing fights, where it's never clear what's going on, except when the forces in the field are completely out of balance. The scenarios that stage the battles are equally poor and also fearfully lacking in detail, normally creating a ~wasteland~ effect that we thought belonged to the past. In short, you can't always run after all the filters and filters that become standard overnight, but usually we try to compensate for the technical deficiencies with the depth of the gameplay (see Europa Universalis). Unfortunately, there is neither one nor the other here. Total what? Let's add another macroscopic lack to the whole: an encyclopedic section worthy of the name. Honestly, from a historical video game produced by the History Channel, we would have expected something more than a few badly compressed videos and a few lines of text dedicated to the description of the units. They could certainly have wasted inserting some extra sections with some historical material, material that should abound in the archives of a television that deals exclusively with making programs on history. The little that there is has an exclusively narrative end and, so as not to deny the overall level of production, it is also done poorly, with overly compressed and full of scraps films that seem to come from another era (videogame speaking). In short... the arduous sentence to the comment. System requirements At the time of writing the review, the requirements necessary to run The History Channel: Great Battles of Rome have not yet been disclosed. We assume, however, that they are not too high. In order not to shoot at random, we keep this box pending, hoping to update it when the requirements are made official. Meanwhile, we report the configuration on which the game was tested, not presenting any problems with fluidity or stability. Test Configuration: Operating System: Windows XP with SP2 Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment We're not quite there. Seasoned gamers are used to something else and will probably spend more time installing and uninstalling The History Channel: Great Battles of Rome than playing it. Casual gamers won't be satisfied with so little. Everything smacks of sloppy and hastily put together: from the title screen, practically absent, to every other single aspect of the game that disfigures in the face of titles that are certainly not of the greatest caliber. Here the battles should be pitched, but are often only hasty (2 minutes to win a battle? What's the point?). Unfortunately, it is not even possible to talk about good ideas that have been misused, because there are plenty of games set in ancient Rome and you can't see any new ones here. In short, there is very little and what is there is done very badly. What to want less? Pros A few nice tunes The History Channel logo The selling price Cons Laughable campaign structuring Boring and silly battles Technically antiquated The History Channel: Great Battles of Rome takes place in Ancient Rome and puts us in command of the army that built one of the greatest empires in history. Our aim is to hire troops, upgrade them when possible, place them on the battlefield and lead them against opponents, who will be increasingly fierce. At the beginning there are few men available as well as upgrades. Obviously, by winning one battle after another, we will get new equipment and the troops will evolve accordingly. The main figure of our army is the general, an exceptional warrior capable of giving orders during battles. Giving orders is not a painless action and costs points, represented by a bar at the bottom left. When the points have run out, you will have to wait for them to recharge before you can go back to changing the battle set-up. This introduces an interesting planning factor, unfortunately undermined by many other problems (besides the fact that the general must also have points to be able to give orders to himself).", "date": "2007-05-31", "grade": null}
