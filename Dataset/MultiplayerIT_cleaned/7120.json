The strategic created by Zen Studios, a freemium-based mobile reduction of the version released on PC and console last year, in fact involves on several fronts, offering gameplay with various facets, which opens up to many different approaches. The plot revolves around a handful of heroes placed in defense of a castle that is threatened by increasingly cunning and aggressive troops, which we must stop using the tools that the game makes available. Depending on the mission, however, we may not only have to eliminate the enemy units that are dangerously close to the walls of our manor, but block a handful of thieves, cover the retreat of a squad of allies or even destroy the enemy castle. The first and most important substrate of the experience clearly refers to the classic Angry Birds, with a touch interface that allows you to target moving opponents by hurling powerful javelins or other types of projectiles at them to unlock as you gain experience and gold coins, such as showers of arrows, cannonballs, bricks that split in flight (just like in Rovio's puzzle game) and even sheep. To use launches, you have to touch the screen near the target and wait for our subordinates to launch the shot, which also involves quickly calculating distances and timing for the attack to hit. The inevitable ~cooldowns~ of the most effective attacks, moreover, push towards a reasoned approach rather than the release of an indiscriminate rain of bullets. From afar or up close The second substrate offered by CastleStorm - Free to Siege refers to traditional tower defense, with different units that we can generate over time and which automatically proceed towards enemy soldiers, attacking them as soon as they are within range. The arrows we shoot can also injure our men, so we must all the more be careful when we set the shots and possibly press the button that allows the allies to take cover when the deadly offensive is about to arrive around them. The generation and sending of troops proves to be a fundamental practice in missions where the objective is to destroy the enemy castle, because in this way we will be able to stop worrying about the enemies proceeding towards our walls and throw everything we have against their base, destroying their protections one by one until we manage to eliminate the commander and thus close the dispute. Then there is a third substrate of the gameplay, and it is that of direct action: by evoking the hero of the moment on the battlefield, we will be able to proceed with his commands with the traditional scheme of the virtual stick and buttons for attack, parry and maneuver special, mowing down enemies and clearing the way for allied troops. The summoning has a limited duration, but if you want you can ~cancel~ it to return to focus on throwing javelins and building units in the perspective of our overall strategy. Finally, to crown such a rich and dynamic system we find the editor to customize our castle, certainly the most curious part of the Zen Studios product but, alas, also the least valued one, to which we will inevitably pay less attention during the campaign . CastleStorm - Free to Siege is a fun and original strategy in its multiple approaches Experience pays off CastleStorm - Free to Siege can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play, but the freemium formula chosen in this case by Zen Studios prevents you from fully enjoying the experience without spending a little money. Beyond the fact that it is impossible to use the most spectacular attacks (see the meteor shower) against enemy castles without purchasing packages of hard currency, the amount of diamonds required to immediately unlock the three single player campaigns that add up to the first, for a total of over one hundred and fifty missions, it is virtually impossible to obtain without putting a hand in your wallet. In the end we are faced with a title of excellent quality, even if at first rather chaotic and a bit complicated to master (especially in its launch mechanics, which are not always precise), which means that it is entirely legitimate to ~invest ~ some money to be able to play freely. The problem is that this purpose is not easily achievable, since there is no option among the in-app purchasesthat allows you to immediately unlock everything, but hoards of diamonds that can cost up to 89.99 euros! The most sensible solution is therefore to buy the so-called ~VIP package~, which for 4.49 euros includes 25,000 gold coins, 100 diamonds, the removal of all advertising (a few videos occasionally, nothing really invasive) and most importantly, adding an additional 2,500 coins and 10 diamonds every week. Freemium blunders aside, the play system of CastleStorm - Free to Siege is confirmed as valid and is accompanied by a console-quality technical sector, with well-made sound and fluid and detailed cartoonish graphics, freely zoomable during the missions, fairly varied as regards the backgrounds and enriched by nice cutscenes.", "date": "2014-05-15", "grade": "8.0"}
