{"name": "Un magnete per amico", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/115697-major-magnet-un-magnete-per-amico.html", "text": "Ambition, like everything else in life, if brought out in the right doses is not only not a bad thing but, in many cases, it becomes a stimulus for obtaining ever more brilliant results. Remaining in the videogame field, every time a new brand is proposed it becomes spontaneous to compare it with previously released titles, to see both the similarities and, above all, the peculiarities and strengths. Generally, however, we try to avoid a direct comparison with the so-called ~sacred monsters~, those titles that have literally made the history of a genre if not an entire software house, precisely to avoid coming out a priori with broken bones. However, the developers of Major Magnet seem to have chosen a completely different approach and, in the end not even taking themselves too seriously, they have identified as the only characters comparable to their funny hero, two rather famous guys, if not real myths for generations of fans: Mario and Sonic. In short, nothing challenging ... or almost. Hunting for the Yellow Cloak Major Magnet's adventure actually begins with the protagonist intent on a quiet gliding session with a yellow cloak, when suddenly the perfidious Colonel Lastin takes it from him, for no apparent reason, thus causing him to fall to the ground. From here on, the only purpose of Major Magnet will be to get back the stolen goods, going to track down Lastin through six different worlds and using nothing but a magnet as a means of transport. In fact, given the particular conformation of the game worlds, there are no classic platforms on which to jump and move quietly; to move you must rely exclusively on the magnetic field generated by the magnet supplied, which from time to time will try to attract Magnet to the iron pins present in all levels. Activating the magnet is simple, just a single ~tap~ on the desired pin and let the perfect reproduction of the physical forces at stake act. The weight of the major prevents the magnet from sticking to the pin at all and the struggle between gravity and magnetic attraction results in nothing but a rotation. The centrifugal force is therefore the final thrust that is used for throwing from one iron grip to another, then managing with precision the moments in which to deactivate the magnet to reactivate it towards the next pin. It is therefore a game in which increasingly precise timing is required as you progress through the story, however after just a few levels you learn quite well to master the rotations. For this reason, starting from the second world, a whole series of obstacles and switches begins to be implemented, small puzzles whose goal is to make the player's life a little more difficult. It is therefore possible to find movable iron pins or pins that pop up unexpectedly after a quick fall, with perfectly timed activation, hooks that also act as timed switches for doors, lasers to be avoided, etc. In addition to the innate talents of the protagonist, however, from the shop of his friend Gus, the opportunity is given to buy power-ups and small upgrades, with game coins (but it will take a long time to accumulate them) or with the usual microtransactions. In reality, the aim can be said to be at least partially achieved, because if it is true that for better or worse the fur at home can almost always be taken away, obtaining high scores and medals will not be an easy task at all. In fact, the calculation of scores takes into account two standard parameters, namely the time taken to finish the level and the aerial bonuses collected in combos, without breaks. Naturally, in the first case speed will be rewarded, in the second the precision of rotations and throws, but in the advanced levels the bonuses are increasingly difficult to take and the falls, with inevitable restarting of the whole scheme, will become more and more frequent. Furthermore, each level hides a medal-cake, which is difficult to reach, but also necessary to unlock the next world. Major Magnet, however, draws heavily from Sonic especially when using the turbocharger, i.e. an aerial propulsive thrust that is used in many cases to reach otherwise inaccessible points. Brief but very intense, during the turbo one gets the impression, for a few moments, of using the famous blue hedgehog, a sensation which however vanishes almost immediately. Finally, the level design is fun and well cared for which, although not very original overall, helps to give the game a pleasant appearance, also thanks to the clean graphics and the always constant framerate in every situation.", "date": "2013-03-07", "grade": "8.0"}
