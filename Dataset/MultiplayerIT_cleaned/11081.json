{"name": "Far Cry 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/far-cry-2_a.html", "text": "Released by Ubisoft in 2004 for the PC platform only, Far Cry has been used for a long time as a technological reference for the FPS genre, and beyond. The CryEngine developed to move the game, in fact, immediately imposed itself for its ability to render objects in the distance, as well as for the intensive use of pixel shaders. As for the gameplay, the classic structure of the genre was made more varied thanks to greater freedom of action, which allowed you to complete the stages following different paths. A rather complete editor was also included, which made it possible for anyone to create their own stage. Both of these elements are also present in the new episode of the series, Far Cry 2, which can not only count on a cutting-edge technical realization, but also on an online multiplayer mode up to current standards. For the mobile version, created at the same time as the others, Gameloft has decided to switch to the genre of action games with a top view, which has been providing excellent guarantees on mobile for some time. At the start we will have to select our character among the three available (in practice there are no differences between one and the other), then we will find ourselves prisoners of a dangerous international criminal nicknamed ~the Jackal~, suffering from malaria and in the middle of a conflict in a distant land. The tutorial starts right here, and will see us escape from the building in which we are locked up, eliminating the enemy guards with gunshots and dynamite. Once in the open we will collapse to the ground, but we will be rescued by some guerrillas who will take us to a village which will serve as a base for our operations. There we will find some ~shops~ where we will be able to buy ammunition for the various weapons, skill tests to earn some extra money, a clinic where we can take medicines to increase the capacity of our energy bar and, finally, a wall on which they will be posted calls for mercenaries from time to time. We will therefore be able to leave for different missions (there are ten, in all), with a different objective each time, and face a large number of enemies. As mentioned above, the game is structured as an action game with a top view: to move our character we will have to use the d-pad, while the 5 key is used to shoot, the * key allows us to throw dynamite and the # key activates or deactivates a radar for detecting nearby enemies. The aiming system is automatic: as soon as there is an enemy within range, we will see a crosshair appear on his head and we will be able to shoot him. Inside the stages there will be many shelters behind which to lurk during the clashes, always automatically, and it is interesting to note how the developers have inserted stealth elements for which it will be possible to eliminate opponents with a single blow to the head, if taken by surprise or sneak up on him and cut his throat with a machete. The standard action is sometimes replaced by moving sections, in which we'll find ourselves aboard a motorbike and we'll have to eliminate our targets while running. The technical realization of the game appears to be very accurate, both in terms of graphics and sound, the latter consisting of good music together with some sampled effects. The sprites are very well drawn, rich in detail and have a decent set of animations. The chromatic choices are excellent, and manage to deeply differentiate one stage from another. Moreover, there are no slowdowns even during the most agitated phases. PRO Great sprites, great scenery Good combat system Immediate and fun AGAINST Cumbersome motion sections A little too easy... ...and therefore not very long-lived", "date": "2008-11-06", "grade": "S.V."}
