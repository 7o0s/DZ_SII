{"name": "Good Job!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/good-job-recensione.html", "text": "In this review of Good Job!, the new title from the Dutch Paladin Studios, we will try to bring back the desire to do things and feel good at do-it-yourself to all those whose muscles of each limb. It may seem surreal the timing of the release of a worker president software who, starting from the slums of a company, must learn to carry out every task to reach the top of dad, the boss entrepreneur: the ability of Good Job! to take you by the hand and make you rack your brains to understand how to work in each department is intriguing, as is that Tazmania twist that will lead you, willy-nilly, to destroy a lot of stuff, so it pays dad. It must be said, net of the always varied objective - applause to the level design - the path to take allows the player to always choose how much painstaking dignity to instill in his work, trying or not to have the grace of an elephant in devastating vases , crates and break through peaceful plasterboard walls. Featured during the recent Nintendo Direct Mini, Good Job! follows in the footsteps of older titles, but playing on style, physics and analog expertise to bring great lightness, style and a lot of sympathy into our very current home context. Social climbing Good Job! it is a small journey into the industriousness of a very varied company, where each floor brings together unique activities and dynamics; the design hat pushes to make each of the 4 level levels (except the last ones) an enigma capable of entertaining in its own autonomy, taking a little by the hand and letting one think, explore and try paths. With an isometric view that follows but does not move, the geography of each cue alternates asymmetries with design linearity, making each level a micro world in itself both in terms of reading and of the artificial intelligence of the employees present. In its short adventure, Paladin Studios collects ideas and offers rich professional environments in which to make things, transport objects, move machines and much more. A journey from the beginning to the end of Good Job! it will make couriers, gardeners, porters, scientists, warehouse workers and so on, characterizing practically each obstacle with a different activity from the previous one. What unites each objective is the park of interaction actions, naturally limited, to which a rather large number of activations corresponds, therefore, infinite ways of solving. In our experience, we admit that we have tried to balance the (little) frustration of gracelessness with the desire to immerse ourselves in the scene and do things as well as possible. Result? We restarted just 3 levels, compared to the equivalent of a small nuclear bomb going off in as many offices; in all other cases we went ahead, convinced that those thousands of dollars of damages were expendable to our skill and technique. Broken pots Net of your ability to mentally enter the corporate ranks and show your best part in carrying out the duties of a janitor, it is as amazing as the carrying characteristic of Good Job! both the transversal sympathy and the stylistic and animation system it offers in silence. Being a substantially silent game - accompanied however by a pleasant and light chill jazz in the background - all the scenic and transmission impact of the situation is entrusted to a coherent amalgam of sufficiency and serenity with which our road sign character advances undeterred and careless. It could be an office uprooted by a piece of furniture used as a cannonball to make an inroad, or a journey in a forklift with a trail of vase destruction behind us, or maybe a room flooded with water just to water a few plants, it really makes the way in which everything proceeds regardless of our actions, almost as if the rest of the company actually knows who you are and says nothing, lets you do it but just presents the bill. It's almost as if what happens is actually a mirror of a do-it-yourself routine that actually often causes damage when things are moved inside the house or things break to fix others. Physics is the flagship of Good Job!: the engine is absolutely believable and the sensations of dynamism, gravity and weight it returns are realistic, manageable and well balanced so as not to be particularly frustrating. Moreover, the whole title can be played in co-op offline thanks to an intelligent dynamic split screen mechanism which, based on the distance between the two characters, widens or splits the direction, packaging this further possibility with great dignity. How did we go? We let ourselves goto a very convinced solitary run, completing the story in a few hours, an average of 10-15 minutes per level; the software provides rather challenging but limited in ambition replayability elements, relegating the final evaluation to three metrics - time to complete, damage value and things destroyed in the scene. Although enthralling in its small way, we sincerely recognize that the mix and the consequent final evaluation are calculated on a rewarding basis, pulling out a vote often calibrated towards a high average rather than a low one and more generally we much appreciated doing more than not the end of doing to get a good grade. The bite of the metrics worked for us on the economic element - we felt part of the company and morally we didn't want to do too much damage - but not for example on the temporal element, however these are purely personal considerations. In general, the title carries grace to the variety: each level has a different goal and implements an ever-changing task. Of course, you will obviously use the same tools in the long run, but to always give a different benefit to the company and every action is truly rewarding, especially when later on in the climb you will be able to actively interact with artificial intelligence.", "date": "2020-03-31", "grade": "8.0"}
