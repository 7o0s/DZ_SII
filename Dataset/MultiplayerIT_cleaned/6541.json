{"name": "Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/145623-dynasty-warriors-8-empires-imperi-in-guerra.html", "text": "For fans of musou, a genre of action games with fighting game and RPG elements where your character finds himself fighting against dozens and dozens of enemies at the same time, Dynasty Warriors has always been one of the reference brands. Action spin-off of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms strategic saga, based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms written by Luo Guanzhong, between main series, ~derivatives~ and expansions that almost always offer few major changes to the gameplay and maintain the same structure game, this franchise of Tecmo Koei continues undeterred for years to navigate undeterred from one generation of consoles to another. Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires is the latest episode in order of time to be released by the Japanese company: it is the second expansion of the eighth chapter (the other is Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends), which represents, as it suggests the suffix, the slightly more strategic variant of the original. In this game, therefore, the user is called upon to relive once again the events of the war of the Three Kingdoms by taking on the role of one of the many protagonists, but also with an eye to tactics. Conquer ancient China of the Three Kingdoms with the Empires edition of Dynasty Warriors 8 Strategy and daily life Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires is exactly what one might expect from an enhanced edition of the standard version and Xtreme Legends. So much so that we can immediately say that it is a purchase recommended only for those who have not already tried their hand at this latest expansion in particular, and want to enjoy the main campaign, a new playable character, Xun Yu of the Wei dynasty, as well to some slightly more tactical variation to the gameplay. As per tradition, in fact, the beating heart of the production is the Empire mode, which being a sort of hybrid between action and strategy, requires the user to unify China not only by beating his hands left and right, which in any case will do for much of the adventure, but also to deal with economic, political and personal aspects. In this sense, a lot depends on the role you have chosen to play after selecting the historical and war scenario to face: in that of ~tramp~, you can wander around China in search of a specific objective, ready to build your own kingdom or to join that of others, while in that of Marshal or Prefect one is part of a warring faction, and therefore one can, for example, act as an adviser to the ~chief~, having one's say in the war council on some aspects of the campaign . In the case of the Prefect you can also control a certain area of the map where you can decide with whom to operate local alliances, deal with military and management operations, participate in raids and clashes, and so on, while in those of. In general, in the most strategic phases, military garrisons and shops can be built, or you can decide to invade and occupy those of your enemies, exploiting what you recover or produce inside them for your own needs, establish which territories to conquer and which leaders to ally with through diplomatic channels , how to train your troops and even how to take care of personal relationships. In fact, friendship ties and sentimental relationships are very important. In the first case, keeping the morale of the troops or the level of loyalty of the allies high through dialogues, aid and banquets can prove to be decisive for the purpose of finding loyal friends who are not inclined to revolt. Even if to tell the truth there are some characters, such as Lu Bu for example, who basically have a certain tendency to rebel regardless of how one behaves with him. In the second case, one can marry the loved one, but this time it is also possible to generate a child who will inherit characteristics similar to those of the parents. To make the experience more complete, new scenes have been implemented, but don't expect to be able to experience the moments of procreation firsthand... Playstation 4 trophies There are forty-eight Trophies offered by Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires in the PlayStation 4 version: 36 Bronze, 8 Silver, 3 Gold and 1 Platinum. To get them you need to spend a lot of time playing the game, since you need to complete all the missions in the game, even at the Chaos difficulty level, make certain moral or strategic choices during the adventure, have at least five children and score a certain number of battle kills. War and peace By achieving certain objectives in the field or maintaining a certain level of security in the realms, you earn a series of titles and new tricks that you can then use in battle. Extremely useful for trying to expand your Empire both strategically and strategicallyyou than militarily. In this sense, as mentioned above, there are dozens and dozens of characters you can choose to play among famous warriors, generic, or created from scratch thanks to an increasingly complete editor, where, among other things, you can conceive everything starting from predefined models: from the detailed appearance of the hero to his weapons and moves, from the horse to the battle insignia, from the equipment to real units made up of ten personalized officers with their respective soldiers, emblems and so on. There is also the scenario editor, which, even if limited in certain options, is still a nice novelty, given that it is then possible to share one's creations via the internet with friends. Each leader, who can count on allies who, together with the rest of the troops, are controlled on the field by the CPU, is then equipped with specific characteristics that must be strengthened and increased over time and can rise in rank. In fact, by fighting you learn new combos, new moves and get new equipment, but also bonus points to always spend to upgrade weapons, armor and skills, or acquire new ones. However, once you get into the real action, it is immediately obvious that the gameplay of Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires is almost identical to that of its predecessors. On the field, the user must make his way through hundreds of opponents by slashing, charging energy for special shots and taking advantage of any temporary power-ups drawn on the ground, as well as using the war orders and stratagems included in his tactical deck, which now have a greater impact on the outcome of the battle since they offer more variations and operate on a larger scale, perhaps overwhelming the enemies with an ambush, a shower of arrows, lightning and mini-typhoons. The clashes, even if a bit monotonous in the long run, turn out to be rather frenetic and lively, thanks also to a particularly easy and immediate control system, perfect for keeping up with the swarms of opponents who launch themselves against the gamer. Among other things, the large number of enemies makes up for an artificial intelligence which, in spite of the developers' claims, does not shine much for logic, at least as regards the opposing troops. From this point of view, it goes better with the generals, decidedly tougher and more aggressive than normal soldiers, especially at the more advanced difficulty levels: based on the degree of challenge selected, in fact, the player will be able to find a lower or greater degree of challenge, although never anything that could jeopardize the normal continuation of the adventure or make the experience frustrating, especially for those used to playing with this type of production. To complete the picture of the Omega Force and Tecmo Koei play offer, excluding the non-playable ones such as the Encyclopedia or Gallery, there is the Free mode, which allows you to tackle any available stage and can therefore be useful for experimentation, practice or a fast-paced fun, and online play, where among other things it is possible to play in special co-op and versus modes in split screen with other users from all over the world. During our tests, since we played a review code before the game was released, there were very few users to deal with the sessions, which is why it is not possible for us to express a definitive judgment on whether the modes are good or not. Moving on instead to analyze the technical part, it must be said that from this point of view Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires does not make one cry for a miracle, but still remains on good quality levels. The graphics, for example, are very clean, but in general the visual sector has not totally convinced us. Apart from the protagonists, in which we note the usual care for the design and for their characterization (a little less for the animations), and the use of fairly detailed textures for the clothes, hair and armor, the rest of the cast of characters didn't seem as well done to us, and on more than one occasion they gave us the impression of having simply been adapted from the minor editions of the game, and only in terms of definition. It goes better with the scenarios, which even if they don't make a miracle seem much more accurate than in the past, with more refined and less flat textures than usual, which return a good overview to the eye. The animations are less convincing, still not very natural. In short, between ups and downs there is no clear cut between the old and new generation from this point of view. In any case, for the fans everything will probably take a back seat during the frenetic large-scale battles, where the number of characters on the screen is sometimes impressive, to the specority of certain special moves, good lighting effects, or changing weather conditions. Elements that, among other things, have little effect on the general fluidity of a game that rarely drops below 60 frames even in the most chaotic situations. As for the audio part, the sound effects of the clashes are excellent, which among the noises of armor broken by sword blows or by projectiles hurled from catapults, arrows whistling in the air, explosions and war cries help to immerse the user in atmospheres typical of the battlefields. The dubbing in Japanese is also good (with English subtitles) and all in all the music that accompanies the action is fair, almost all coming from the original chapter, among other things. These range from Asian-style heavy rock to more traditionally epic ones, except for some new slower songs, mainly used during side events.", "date": "2015-02-24", "grade": "7.2"}
