The speech is actually a bit more complicated because we are referring especially to manga, anime and their eventual tie-ins: after all, it made no sense to invest in a product designed for fans in an environment where there are none of those fans 'they were very few, right? And yet, the Gundam created by Yoshiyuki Tomino has always been very popular here too, first with the animated series broadcast many years ago, then with comics and merchandising: many today get to know it by first assembling the models - the infamous ~gunpla ~ - and then watching television series. Now that publishers have gathered courage, it was only a matter of time before the Gundam-inspired titles that come out in Japan every year also arrived in the West. The problem is that Bandai Namco could import something better than Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS Force. We could have had better but for now we have to settle for Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS Force Fight builders Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS Force is substantially the latest iteration of the VS series, a popular line of arcade titles often converted also for consoles: they are brawlers, especially the latest Extreme VS, in which it is possible to select the many Gundams - but not only - appeared in the sagas that outline the colorful multiverse. In these three-dimensional fighting games, mechs are selected based on a ratio between power and longevity represented by a number. The higher the number, the more powerful the mech but the fewer additional attempts you will have to defeat the enemy. This balance allows the composition of a varied roster, enriched both by the strongest Gundams in history, and by ~cannon fodder~ mechs, but collapses inexorably when it is decided to have a dynamic and tough Gundam like the Unicorn fight against the poorest of the Zaku: There really is no comparison. The combat system is essentially entrusted to four keys: one controls the main firearm, another the melee attack, a third allows you to lock on to targets (then switching from one to another with the right stick) and a fourth allows you to sprint and fly by consuming the Boost gauge which recharges over time. Each attack consumes ammunition which, once depleted, is automatically recharged, and by combining the back buttons with the two normal attacks, the ~special moves~ for which the various mechs have become famous are carried out. It is an apparently simple control system but in reality rather awkward and complicated, above all because the game only summarily explains the various fighting techniques, skimming over combos, cancels and other maneuvers of fundamental importance: some Gundams can change shape but not even the The command list explains how to do this, just as it doesn't mention that some mechs have extra special attacks or the ability to chain them into combos. Practice makes perfect, obviously, but Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs Force doesn't offer a training mode and the chaotic nature of the action, also caused by a schizophrenic camera that not even the settings can tame, makes the clashes more frustrating than fun even in learning stage. Ironically, the combat system of Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs Force has been greatly simplified compared to the main exponent of the series, Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs Full Boost, in which the variety of combos and special techniques made the gameplay resemble that of a traditional fighting game: this new iteration, however, was designed around a new game mode that perhaps would have done better not to see the light. PSVita trophies There are 44 trophies in total and include, in addition to platinum, three gold, ten silver and thirty bronze trophies. Most are achieved by completing EXTREME-FORCE mode and meeting the requirements of all bonus objectives, but also by controlling all mechs in the various game modes. Gunpla that wins does not change At the Japanese release, Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs Force practically only offered the EXTREME-FORCE mode and the Japanese fans complained so much that Bandai Namco was practically forced to update the software with a couple of extra modes that increased its meager longevity. including an arcade mode in which it was possible to choose the Gundams from the roster and give them a thrashing with the CPU: unfortunately the multiplayer mode, only competitive in addition, is relegated to ad hoc connection, ifno possibility to play with friends and acquaintances through the internet. The problem with EXTREME-FORCE mode, however, is pure and simple by design. The superficial plot is a pretext for bringing together characters and mechs that have appeared in completely different series, analyzing the most important battles of the franchise. Gundam newbies will say absolutely nothing, but true fans will appreciate the quotes and the contexts in which the missions take place, often presided over by bosses of enormous dimensions and accompanied by the most memorable music. The battles, however, are not a mere ~button mashing~: the gameplay has been altered precisely to remove the basic concept from the brawler fighting games and make it look rather like a MOBA or in any case a kind of strategy with action nuances. In most of these missions we can choose more than one Gundam, always taking into account the individual value of each mech without exceeding the imposed limit, and control it directly while the artificial intelligence - indeed decidedly incomplete - takes care of our teammates. At any time we can open the map and order our partners to attack specific areas or targets, perhaps using the Force commands that consume the points earned in battle to regenerate our units, boost them briefly, inflict huge area damage and so on . In some missions we will have to protect an objective, in others we will have to conquer it: the variety is not lacking, but once again various technical and localization problems have a hand in it. In the first case, it is always the ungainly camera and the confusing control system; it's hard to micromanage your team while also fighting and looking around for enemies, even if the interface suggests the direction in which to dodge incoming bullets. Localization issues are as annoying as they are funny. The characters converse in Japanese during the missions, but only in a few cases do English subtitles appear that translate the spoken sentences. As long as we are dealing with expletives and quotes from cartoons, everything is fine, but sometimes the objectives change during the mission and it is precisely the voice actors who communicate it to us in the Japanese language: at that point we risk failing because we have not understood what we need to do, forcing us to play and replay the stage in full ~trial and error~ or to search for the solution on Google. It's a shame because the EXTREME-FORCE mode is nice but practically sketchy, yet its existence weighs on the structure of the entire game like a ton, weighing down the intuitive and engaging mechanics that made the previous episodes famous.", "date": "2016-07-18", "grade": "5.8"}
