{"name": "Get Packed: la recensione del party game per Google Stadia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/get-packed-recensione-party-game-google-stadia.html", "text": "What are the odds of seeing two games dedicated to moving soon after each other? Very few, you will rightly say, yet we find ourselves writing the review of Get Packed less than a month after that of Moving Out. Developed by Moonshine Studios, Get Packed looks exactly like the title published by Team17 on paper: a party game which recalls the style of Overcooked, where, however, the players' goal is to clear out houses, offices and everything else the customers ask for, with the aim of maximizing their performance in each level to get the top rating. The occasion offered by Get Packed was therefore propitious to take advantage of the cellar emptying experience that we had previously accumulated with Moving Out: let's go and see what came of it. Modes and gameplay: ideal for the family With the Get Packed campaign mode, the guys from Moonshine Studios take us to Ditchlington, a town located on a salt mine. Blinded by the profits, the mayor decides to sell everything to the Industrial Salt Co., which forces the inhabitants of Ditchlington to abandon their homes. To help them there are of course the protagonists of the game, but before things take a singular turn and from simple removals we move on to carry out other types of activities. The way the story is told to us by the developers is very nice, and we have to say that we are somewhat passionate about it even if obviously this is not the main aspect of Get Packed. The campaign mode is accompanied by two other types of game, a classic versus type and one called instead Destruction, within which the objective is not to take away the objects present in the premises but to destroy them, causing as much damage as possible possible. Returning to the main mode, players must try to load as many objects as possible onto the truck located outside the building, satisfying some special requests to get a bonus on the final evaluation of the level made with the usual star meter. Each level has its own characteristic, often also linked to a particular obstacle destined to throw us a spoke in the wheels as we try to fill the transporter truck. Even if on paper Get Packed looks like Moving Out, the differences in gameplay become noticeable soon enough . The choice of Moonshine Studios has in fact been to bet everything on the occurrence of situations bordering on the absurd, which are created thanks to the design of the characters deliberately created with longer than normal limbs. By associating this with the possibility of being able to take any object with one hand, including the bulkiest ones, the developers have created a game that manages for obvious reasons to give its best when played by all four players possible check. Even if Get Packed offers a matchmaking system, our advice is to play together with your family members on the sofa, or at least with your friends via the Internet thanks to the possibility of inviting contacts on Google Stadia to the game. players in fact does not exist except for the final evaluation, but we are ready to bet that you will burst out laughing when absurd situations arise such as the one that provides for the possibility of locking another player in the departing truck with the objects cleared. In terms of gameplay, in short, Get Packed works and entertains as one would expect, and it is no small aspect. Graphics and sound: Google Stadia promoted For the writer, the game sessions with Get Packed also represented the first steps within the Google Stadia ecosystem. Therefore, having no other parameters for comparison, at this moment we limit ourselves to appreciating the experience with the cloud gaming service, practically without flaws in managing the aspects related to the Moonshine Studios title. Being a party game, the possibility of immediately jumping on board with a not too recent PC connected to the television in the living room to play for four, it is naturally a plus to take into account. The alternative is represented by Chromecast, but in this case it goes a little more expensive given the need to use the Google Stadia controller (price 69 euros) to play. In technical terms Get Packed does not offer particularly high levels of detail, and is appreciated above all for the attention paid to the management of the physics and articulations of its protagonists. In using the cloud service we have not noticed any flaws. Nothing in particularfinally to be reported on the sound, without infamy and without particular praise.", "date": "2020-05-17", "grade": "7.5"}
