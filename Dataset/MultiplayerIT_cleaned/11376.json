{"name": "Heart of Mechanics", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heart-of-mechanics.html", "text": "It is difficult to find other sources of inspiration for this product other than those relating to the famous strategic saga of Squaresoft: beyond the fact of having the mighty mechs as protagonists, Heart of Mechanics is indebted to Front Mission also as regards the imprint militaristic, the gameplay based on turn-based combat, the layout of the menus and even the font used for on-screen messages. For various reasons that we will now analyze in detail, the FunMobile title certainly cannot compete with the completeness and depth of the master, but can still be defined as a diligent disciple. Heart of Mechanics doesn't go very subtle with regards to the plot, which is liquidated with a simple text screen at the beginning of the adventure: the user takes on the role of a brave soldier who, aboard his robot, must stop an army of vicious mechs causing turmoil and chaos in various parts of the world. To do this, the player can also count on a team of four elements that will accompany him in the various battles: hence the strategic nature of the product, which, as mentioned at the beginning, openly refers to what was seen in the various Front Missions. It is therefore necessary to move your units in turn in an attempt to destroy the enemy forces, while trying to limit your losses: each mech has at its disposal specific weapons and abilities which, in pure RPG style, it can exploit provided you have the necessary Action Points, which are consumed with each movement and are recharged in the next turn. Compared to the masterpiece Square, Heart of Mechanics is decidedly more simplistic and suited to the mobile context: for example, the pre-battle organizational aspect is much less profound, while in combat it is not allowed to aim at specific areas (consequently the damage caused or suffered are not divided among the various parts of the body but are simply deducted from a total). Instead, an unprecedented sentimental component peeps out: in essence, it is possible to carry out joint attacks with the girls of the team with which you have the most feeling in order to produce devastating effects. For the rest, Heart of Mechanics proves to be a decidedly complete strategic one: there are many weapons to use (ranging from machine guns to missiles, passing through grenades and lightsabers), power-ups and abilities to be unlocked by spending the points earned in battle, and eight different scenarios bristling with enemies. Even from a technical point of view, the FunMobile product defends itself more than well: graphically you can enjoy very detailed and detailed settings on which well-defined and animated sprites move in an excellent way, while the sound performs its task honestly.
