Brut@l does not exempt itself from this intent, trying to insert everything in an artistic context based on the visual re-proposition of the ASCII coding code. The ideas included in the Storm Cloud title are good, although they certainly don't stand out for their originality, but they contain everything that a game of this genre should offer. We therefore have our dungeons full of enemies, four classes to choose from, the now inevitable upgrades and even a rudimentary form of weapon crafting based on the search for letters around the maps. So what shouldn't make Brut@l an essential title for all fans of the genre and also for others? In fact nothing, if not a detail called the combat system, which in terms of depth, to put it mildly, let's say that it doesn't quite reach the peaks of the genre. Brut@l is the result of a lot of love for the past with a pinch of the present Strolling through the alphabet Brut@l immediately puts aside any narrative field completely, and replaces it with a simple choice between four different character classes and the related basic statistics. Consequently, it is clear that choosing the warrior will mean having to deal with a brute armed to the teeth and extremely resistant; while starting with the mage will give you a man with less resistance and a lower damage value with basic attacks but, at the same time, the possibility of using mana to attack from a distance and greater mobility. The campaigns, different in structure for the various characters, unfold along twenty-six levels, which gradually increase the level of difficulty, the amount of enemies and the possibilities in terms of mechanics. If at the beginning each hero will be able to simply attack with his fists and defend himself with his shield, continuing the possibilities will increase exponentially. The progression is therefore well balanced, although the gameplay is boring at the beginning due to the total lack of real combos, which we will return to later. This is where things like crafting and enchanting come in handy. During your exploration of the various depth levels of the dungeons you will come across letters of the alphabet released on the playing field. Once you find the right recipe and the related letters, it will be possible to forge new basic weapons or even enchant them to make them elementals. It is obvious that the use of certain combinations will prevent you from creating others and, if this may seem secondary at the beginning of the adventure, it will certainly not be so when you are so close to the goal that the thought of dying and starting over will grip you from the head to toe. As for the growth of one's character, upon reaching a certain amount of experience points, each hero will level up. This will give you the opportunity to enter a menu used for strengthening and choosing certain talents, both active and passive. Each class will start with different skills - of course - and it will then be up to the player to choose which ones to unlock during their adventure. So here you will find yourself in the tragic situation of having to decide between increasing your health points, or unlocking an extra slot for the special attack and so on. Collecting experience points is not a little difficult, unless you want to clean up each level of all the objects and monsters that populate it and this makes the choice of skills to unlock much more important than it might seem. So what is it that doesn't work in Brut@l and doesn't allow him to stand out from the crowd? Undoubtedly a combat system that borders on total flatness. The unlocking of talents and the forging of new weapons - even the legendary ones, each with its own unique talent - will not change the tragicomic situation of feeling woody characters under one's hands. The triple pressure of the square button to chain three simple shots and make them a so-called combo, does not add bite to a combat system that tires even before reaching the deepest floors of the dungeons. Special attacks or shield counterattacks don't help either, and the scripting of the dodges, as well as the total lack of falling and upward attacks, reduce the possibilities even more, making the fun something extremely difficult to experience. The developers have tried in every way to make the gameplay varied, also adding the unpredictability of drinking potions whose effect is unknownhe can be positive or negative. The problem is all these gimmicks don't change the lack of variety in the combat system which is undoubtedly a priority in a dungeon crawler. Wasted opportunity in this sense, a pity because the potential of the title is tangible at the first meeting pad in hand. Art Attack with dungeons In the game there is also a dungeon editor that puts you in a position to become real developers, create your dungeon and insert all the enemies and elements you prefer inside (spending an amount of money based on the size of the room being generated). Subsequently it is also possible to share your level and let the community try it, making the title almost infinite. Assuming that a good fan base is formed. A world made of dots Brut@l, from a visual point of view, is so extreme as to meet only detractors or crazy lovers. Resuming clearly the visual representation of the ASCII code, the whole game environment follows these same rules. It simply transforms them into a three-dimensional world in which everything seems to come from a mixture of Tron and any fantasy. The work carried out is painstaking, there are no technical problems of any kind, but it is obvious how the average player, if not attracted by a style like this, can certainly get tired of continuing to see rooms that are always all the same: made of dots, luminous enemies and braziers to be destroyed until the next level. Basically a good job from the point of view of the glance but difficult to reconcile with the general public, compared to titles of the same scope but which use a more affordable and at the same time detailed graphic style.", "date": "2016-08-02", "grade": "7.0"}
