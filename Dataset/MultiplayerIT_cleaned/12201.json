{"name": "24 Agente Disperso", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/24-agente-disperso.html", "text": "Following the line drawn by the television serial, 24 Missing Agent is articulated in the 24 hours of a ~bad~ day for the security of Los Angeles. Through 24 missions we will have to eliminate the terrorist threat that hangs over the metropolis and the CTU, since the terrorists have infiltrated and taken control of it. Unlike the first episode in which it was not possible to participate as agent Bauer, in this sequel we will be able to play with Jack, even if we will be helped from time to time by Curtis or Chloe. The prequel consisted of 24 different mini games that were actually quite unrelated to each other that could not involve the player that much. In this Missing Agent, however, some ~mini games~ have remained, but the nerve center of the Fox Mobile product revolves around a solid plot. The main missions respect a fixed scheme based on infiltrating the building in the hands of terrorists (the same CTU!) in stealth mode, perhaps with the cover of a fellow sniper, evading the enemy's defenses for the release of all the hostages. In its small way, the title published by I-Play recalls the best stealth games that have appeared on consoles, the graphics are very particular and closely resemble the thermal sensors of special teams, in practice we will always see Jack and his rivals highlighted with reddish colors while the rest of the scenario will be green elements on a dark screen. During the infiltration missions we will have different possibilities of action: we will be able to eliminate the terrorists with our gun, direct the shots of our trusty sniper on the unfortunate ones and hide the bodies of the opponents on the ground so as not to be discovered ahead of time. In fact, in the game there is a ~threat~ indicator which makes it clear to the player if he is acting silently and invisible, or if he is committing too much naivety and is one step away from being identified. We have to be very careful or it's game over. An element of disturbance is constituted by the hostages that we will have to save, once freed in fact they will behave like the Lemmings, running wildly in search of an exit without caring about any surviving terrorists; we will therefore have to be attentive and concentrated to eliminate even the remaining enemies ~on the fly~. The proposed mini-games, which allow for variations with respect to the infiltration missions, are quite good even if sometimes a little complex, for example we will find ourselves having to deactivate alarms or choose numbers in a sort of roulette to open the combinations. However, all the mini-games can be tested from the tutorial menu of the title developed by Fox Mobile. In conclusion, the artificial intelligence is quite basic but all in all it does its duty diligently, the missions are sufficiently varied thanks also to the mini-games and the plot as mentioned offers many interesting ideas. We must underline how unfortunately the difficulty of some levels is exaggerated, forcing the player to countless attempts, frustrating don't you think?
