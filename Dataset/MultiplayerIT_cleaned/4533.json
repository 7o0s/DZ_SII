In 1999, when Appeal launched Outcast exclusively on PC, this was not the case. The title then offered, for the first time, a series of dizzying contents: an incredibly vast and varied game world, an inspired narrative, exploratory mechanics mixed with full-blown TPS sessions. While it played a bit of a trailblazer, few remember Outcast. To remedy the unjust oblivion, Bigben Interactive has decided to publish the remaster, offering it a second chance. A Second Contact, in fact. But maybe the first was enough. Planet you go, Ulukai you find A former Marine Special Agent, Cutter Slade is trying to forget his past problems by drowning in a mix of booze and coffee. Until America has a new mission to offer him, the last chance to redeem himself. And it's not a trivial thing: it's about saving the Earth. A group of scientists had the brilliant idea of creating a probe between our world and a parallel universe, only it broke and now our planet is in danger of collapsing in the hole. Cutter is the right man to jump into the small passage and set things right, leading some scientists towards repairing the probe. Logically, nothing goes right: the marine is separated from his companions and deprived of his equipment, and finds himself in the company of a group of local natives, fortunately without hostile intentions. The arrival planet, Adelpha, is in fact inhabited by grotesque anthropomorphic beings, called Talaran. Their people are at war with an overly ambitious separatist, Fae Rhan, who intends to subjugate them all. In addition, the good Talarans see in Cutter the messiah who was long overdue to save them: the warrior sent by the gods, the Ulukai. And since stretching his legs with some extra work is never a problem for the marine, he makes a pact with the inhabitants. He will save Adelpha from the tyrant, while the Talarans will help him find his companions and the probe to be repaired. He still had the rest of the week off anyway. At the time Outcast won more than a hundred different awards, including the best adventure game of the year. A point in favor of the remaster is precisely that of having left the narrative as it was, without making any discounts to the player. The spirit of the title consists in the sense of disorientation, abandonment, amazement for new elements: and Cutter is alone, lost on a planet inhabited by aliens, with completely unknown biomes, although they closely resemble terrestrial ecosystems. Not even the progression is typical of modern titles, in which a thousand indicators also guide towards one's shoes. To continue you have to explore, chat with the inhabitants, think for yourself. The game map has few points of interest, often not even the ones we need at that moment. All of this works perfectly for this kind of experience, just like it did in 1999. A universe of compromises What leaves a lot to be desired, however, is exactly what needed to be perfected with the remaster. We expected a renewed control system, updated TPS mechanics, and at least a decent technical sector. In these respects Outcast Second Contact is far too disappointing. Cutter's movements are slow, woody, awkward, from imprecise jumps to a somersault that is difficult to manage. The framing does not honor the third-person perspective, and indoors it gets so close behind the protagonist's shoulders that it makes moving around frustrating. Fortunately, the right distances are respected in open spaces, even if from time to time the camera takes care of putting its own into it, going on its own or focusing on completely useless points and details. Moving on to the controls, those for the mouse and keyboard have naturally been reprogrammed to support home console controllers, but the management of weapons and menus is not the most intuitive. Holding R2 on PlayStation 4 shows the repertoire of available weapons, when the same button is also needed to fire on enemies. The circle key instead opens the inventory, however it is also the ~back~ command for all other situations, including conversations. The triangle, on the other hand, sheathes the weapon in use, and despite the somewhat awkward position, at least fortunately, it does not seem to carry out other tasks. To these inputs we must add that the shooter sessions are really not very satisfying, with aiming at enemies not so complex as ratherto inaccurate (even with assisted pointing). The stealth phases remain elementary, barely sketched: by hiding behind a solid surface, the enemies will not see us, but it is easier said than done, thanks to Cutter's awkward movements. The graphic update is only partially convincing, but paradoxically compared to everything else it is the most successful aspect of the re-release. Leaving aside sporadic but annoying drops in frame rate, the general glance, after a first satisfied look at original, gaudy and sharp ecosystems, shows the compromise nature of the production. We notice, slowly but surely, the animations of the poorly finished characters, the almost caricatured features, the rougher textures juxtaposed with others, all in all not bad. Everywhere there is the feeling of a job started with the best intentions, on the right foot, but completed in a listless way. And the final quality cannot fail to suffer.", "date": "2017-11-23", "grade": "6.2"}
