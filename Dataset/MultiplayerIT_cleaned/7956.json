A very specific sector, within which the forward-looking guys from Paradox Interactive have rightfully entered, able with the aforementioned game and other titles to offer considerable satisfaction to enthusiasts, who thanks to the Stockholm-based team have had way to find bread for their teeth. The reasons why this genre has never become mainstream are quite clear: among its characteristics, we find in fact the presence of scenarios of rather considerable dimensions, where events take place in quite dilated (and slow) times and often not there is not even an actual victory condition. It is therefore logical to think of the possibility of setting up an entry point within this world, with which to possibly satisfy the newbies of the genre, while offering at the same time a pleasant diversion to those who are already accustomed to this type of video game: March of the Eagles arrives with these intentions, cutting out and at the same time introducing some new features compared to Crusader Kings II. With the result of Paradox's work finally in our hands, let's see what the Swedish programmers have studied for us. When war is everything For those who missed our recent March of the Eagles road test, let's remember first of all the setting of this game: we are in the period from 1805 to 1820, in a short time span (especially for Paradox productions ) during which Europe was experiencing a period of enormous turmoil, due both on the one hand to the military overwhelming power of Napoleon Bonaparte's France, and on the other to the numerous other conflicts on various fronts in the old continent. The introduction of such a narrow game period is not a random choice, because it served the developers to introduce that concept of the end of the game and consequent victory or defeat, which, as we said, is often absent in titles of the genre: once chosen a nation, the player must lead it to achieve the objectives that the game imposes on it, to win the game and thus end hostilities before one of the other powers in the fight does it. No dynastic line to look after or superfluous boundary elements, because March of the Eagles is based on war, and only on it rest all its secondary components. In its mechanics, the game ends up recalling RisiKo! quite closely, obviously with the due boardgame-videogame proportions: once the deployment has been chosen, the player must bet on his army to achieve success, choosing the units to be employed across the land and sea, another important element of the game. We have also already had the opportunity to talk about the ideas system: it is a way studied by the developers to allow the player to obtain various types of bonuses, with which to enhance their armies in view of the next battle. The interesting thing is the possibility of obtaining additional idea points, not with victory as one might think but with defeat, thus also making the sacrifice of a part of one's army a possible strategy to gain an advantage at a later time. Those who hoped for a Total War title will probably be disappointed to know that the battles on the field are simulated by the CPU, which for its part will not fail to put us in difficulty with the artificial intelligence developed by the developers. However, March of the Eagles allows the player to establish a few strategic parameters before going into battle: among these, the possibility of assigning a different general to each of the three flanks of the deployment stands out, thus exploiting their skills. It is undoubtedly a choice to be made in a weighted way, given that in the long run it ends up proving to be decisive in the economy of the battle. Also woe to failing to supply our army with the food they need, especially if you intend to undertake a grueling campaign during a cold winter. It's better in company On the occasion of our test a few weeks ago, we reserved the right to try the multiplayer component in the review phase, however anticipating that given the March of the Eagles mechanics, online play could have been a fundamental part of the experience offered to the player. If at the time this was a simple impression, we would like to fully confirm it now: the ~short~ interval of time (however somenow) in which a game takes place and the possibility of creating matches for up to 32 players, in fact allow you to create fun and lively online games, also thanks to an internal chat system, not an end in itself, but rather more useful to the general economy of the game than one might think. In fact, through it it is possible to communicate with other players, both to establish a common front and to try to deceive them, thus adding a further diplomatic component to the multiplayer that is necessarily absent from the single version of the game. Wanting to nitpick, one might wish for a better balance for multiplayer games, where some powers such as France are inevitably stronger than the others even in proportion to the various objectives: which, all in all, is justifiable given the historical period in which March of the Eagles refers, so it must be the spirit with which you approach the game to be the right one. For those who should be short of friends, which unfortunately is possible for the aforementioned niche genre, Paradox also provides a metaserver for registered users, thanks to which they can meet other people to play with, taking advantage of what is a matchmaking with a slightly retro flavor (there is no support for this feature via Steam), but which still ends up doing its job well. Alternatively, even in this case with somewhat dated mechanics, it is possible to host by giving your friends the IP address to connect to to start the game. On a technical level, while making use of the same engine as Crusader Kings II, March of the Eagles shows that it has made good use of the year between the release dates of the two games. The engine, the usual Clausewitz Engine, appears cleaner both in the (few) animations and in the detail of the maps and various elements on the screen, also benefiting from the optimization of the game options, reduced compared to the multitude present in Crusader Kings II. This is certainly not the decisive aspect for the judgment on the new Paradox effort, but it is still nice to note the intention of the developers to also get their hands on the graphic rendering, to improve the gaming experience also in the eyes of the player.", "date": "2013-03-14", "grade": "7.2"}
