{"name": "Pianta Magica", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pianta-magica.html", "text": "Inspired by the fairy tale ~The Magic Bean~ by R. Walker, Digital Chocolate has created another of the simple and immediate video games that have always distinguished its catalogue. To be honest, it seems that the young Californian house has now raised this type of production to real ~videogame works of art~, combining simplicity and depth like no other developer has so far been able to do on mobile phones. Titles such as Rollercoaster Rush, Kamikaze Robots or Crazy Penguin Catapult, in fact, best interpret the needs of mobile gaming, offering gameplay that is almost always based on pressing a single button but which, despite this, is anything but limited: the player only has to decide when and how to enter, but this practice is enriched by external circumstances that progressively increase the depth of the experience. Pianta Magica (simple Italian adaptation of the original title ~Jungle Twister: Puzzle Expedition~) follows this approach in the best way, both from a playful and a technical point of view, showing us seven locations characterized by an extraordinary use of colors. After the brief animated introduction that shows us the assault on the tree of life, we will find ourselves having to face seven thematic areas: Virgin Forest, Mangrove Valley, Willow Hill, Dark Forest, Enchanted Forest, Rainforest and Magical Ruins. Each of these locations is divided into a variable number of stages, from five to seven, and once completed it allows us to restore one of the tree's flowers. From area to area the colors change, the background changes but above all the enemies to face change as well as the movements that our plant makes during its rapid growth towards the sun. In practice, the plant we control follows predetermined trajectories in its ascent, which in one case can be perfectly circular and in another they draw angular and fragmented lines: by acting on key 5, we can make the plant start a new growth before the previous one is completed, and in this way we have the possibility of making them follow the trajectory we want, even and above all when the path is fraught with obstacles and traps to avoid. The downside lies in the fact that interrupting the movement before it is complete prevents the growth of flowers and collects fewer bonuses: the stages are full of ~seeds~ which are attracted by our plant and which increase the overall score of the game. In each location new enemies are introduced, in this case increasingly hostile and dangerous insects, but at the same time we are given the opportunity to ~assemble~ new and more powerful flowers to defend ourselves: before leaving, we will in fact be able to place flowers of different nature on the stem and with different characteristics, which in some cases even ~shoot~ against insects that are at a certain distance. The action is accompanied by good quality tribal music, even if not very varied, while the graphics are excellent as usual: a mix of bitmap and vector elements that develops within splendid scenarios, especially as regards the use of colors. The developers have also paid great attention to details, so the design of the insects and even the special effects are fluid and very well done. In some stages we will even have to proceed in the dark, with the plant that will light up the surrounding environment until we arrive.
