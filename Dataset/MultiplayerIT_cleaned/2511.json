{"name": "Siege of Avalon - Capitolo I", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/siege-of-avalon-capitolo-i.html", "text": "Play a good book The slogan of this rpg is ~have you ever played a good book?~. The strength of SoA is precisely the quality of the plot, which unfolds through intrigue and mysteries, between heroes, monsters and powerful spells. The plot tells of the assault brought by the Ahoul, a race related to the orcs, to the city of Avalon, capital of the kingdom of Eural and the consequent siege. Led by the cruel Mithras, the orcs have squeezed the human stronghold in a grip of hunger and misery and hopes seem to be diminishing day by day. Naturally, we, or rather our digital alter ego, come into play in this desperate scenario. Sent to join our brother Corvus, heroic commander of the human forces in Avalon, to inform him of our father's premature end, we will miraculously escape an orc ambush and be rescued within the besieged city. From this point on we will find ourselves at the mercy of ourselves, unarmed and strangers in a land destroyed and on the verge of despair. Wandering around the castle for a bit, we will meet some key characters who will better explain to us what is happening, revealing background stories and even gossip about life in the city. As the plot unfolds, we will find ourselves faced with dramatic events that will require our collaboration, until we are called to play a more demanding role: to find Corvus, who has disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Grieving for our brother's fate, we will take on a leading role that will see us challenge the outer village, in the hands of the fearsome Ahouls, in search of the truth, until we push ourselves to the extreme limits of the adventure. In fact, as can be seen, the plot is quite intriguing, albeit lacking in originality, and could be the element capable of keeping the player tied up for hours on end in front of the monitor. In reality, however, things are not quite like that. The whole game is in English and, since there is so much to read, for those who are not familiar with this language, the game could be incomprehensible. The action part As soon as a new game is started, we will find ourselves in the screen for choosing our alter ego, of which we will be able to choose a good number of parameters, from hair color to that of clothes. Of course, much more important is the statistical characterization of our character, rather than the aesthetic one. We will be able to choose the class with which we will play, having three options available: warrior, scout or mage. Depending on which we have chosen, we will be awarded bonus characteristic points. The PC growth system, in this game, deviates from the standard one, like Diablo, in which experience points are earned that allow us to level up. Here you don't earn a fixed number of points every time you level up, because there are no levels here! In a much simpler way, every now and then we will earn points, called 'training points' (which we will briefly refer to as t.p.), which we will be able to distribute at will among our characteristics. Naturally, the more things we do, the more quests we will be able to solve, the more fights we will complete and the more training points we will be awarded from time to time. Attention, because the equation 1 training point = 1 characteristic point does not apply! Each characteristic point is also worth more than a single t.p., for example a stealth point is worth 4 t.p.! That said, we can analyze the rest of the game. The interface is quite classic in both style and layout along the edges of the screen, leaving the largest possible playing area free. There is an inventory (of course), an automatic map, a features screen and some 'logs' (which are basically diaries). There will be three in all, one dedicated to adventure, one dedicated to quests and another dedicated to the evolution of the plot. All three update automatically. The first collects a description of the crucial events in which we will come across, of the most important characters and generally contains a brief account of the plot. The second shows all the active quests and is definitely more immediately useful. Finally, the third describes the unraveling of the story in the first person and is perhaps the closest thing to the famous 'book to play'. So far we have seen that this SoA is very well cared for, now let's see how it behaves on the battlefield. The graphics have a fixed resolution of 800x600 but with only 256 colors, and do not use any hardware acceleration. From a purely static point of view, the graphics are very accurate and full of details, however when you start moving, then you see that in factthe animations consist of a few frames and there are no dynamic lighting effects. On the other hand it is still a product intended for download, so the developers probably preferred to reduce the size of the files, to the detriment of a part of the visual quality. As far as the audio is concerned, however, I can't help but applaud a very beautiful and engaging soundtrack, which knows how to adapt well to different game situations. The audio effects are really well done and know how to put the player in the right atmosphere. How not to feel a thrill hearing a wolf howl suddenly, while we wander at night among the ruins outside the castle? Conclusions It is not difficult to evaluate this product, unfortunately, as it is technically old and offers nothing more than any other good RPG can give. In addition, let's calculate the cost of the whole game: 6 chapters, of which the first is free, therefore 5 chapters at 29,900 lire each, are 149,500 lire, practically 150,000 lire. At this point, I wonder what sense it makes to ask a player to spend such an amount, when at a lower price anyone can bring home a copy of Baldur's Gate 2, for example, or in any case of another role-playing game, better than This. This SoA is a good game: it's intriguing and well done, even if it's penalized by limited graphics and not in step with the times. But it really costs too much. It is unthinkable to offer it at a price even higher than that of its direct - and BEST - competitors. Too bad, because such a product should have been rewarded and not penalized, it would have deserved a great success if it had been distributed in a budget version, rather than at more than full price. But, in the end, nobody forbids us to try the first chapter, which is free! ;-) What is it about? Siege of Avalon is a classic RPG, with a character to build and with many points to distribute among the characteristics. There are quests and many characters to interact with, as well as a good amount of dialogue and things ready to be discovered. What distinguishes it from other games of this genre is the way it is distributed. Siege of Avalon (SoA, from now on) is divided into 6 chapters, the first of which is freely distributed in game magazines, online magazines and downloadable from the official website www.avalon-game.com. The other chapters will be marketed at regular intervals, at a price of 29,900 lire.", "date": "2001-05-10", "grade": null}
