{"name": "Rugby 08 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rugby-08-recensione.html", "text": "The sports division of Electronic Arts has already begun to publish the 2008 versions of its series, with few exceptions, and Rugby 08 arrives right at the turn of the world championships of this particular sport. With all the necessary licenses (even if something is missing, it must be said), the game allows us to control each national team and to try our hand not only with the world championship, but also with numerous minor tournaments. Game mode The Rugby 08 start screen gives you access to different game modes. The first, of course, is the quick game (~Play Now~), in which you choose a team from those available, decide on an opponent and begin to become familiar with rugby matches. Each team is distinguished by numerical values, so there is no need to make your debut in charge of the Italian national team against the New Zealanders. The second mode available is the Rugby World Cup 2007, a videogame reduction of the world championship which is taking place in these days and which for obvious reasons was missing in the 2007 edition of the game. Then there is an interesting Challenge Mode, borrowed from other EA sports titles, in which you can tackle a major sporting event of historical significance and perhaps change the result. The matches that appear in this section cover a century of rugby history, and offer the most diverse situations, certainly a boon for fans of this sport. Finally, the Game Modes item allows us to participate in the most important rugby tournaments (the Six Nations is not missing), while the My Rugby option is used to check our progress in the game. In the field Before throwing ourselves headlong into the action, it's time to spend a few minutes with the Rugby 08 tutorial. Here a voiceover, with a markedly English accent, will explain how to control the players in the various phases of the game and which Dual buttons Shock 2 press to pass, shoot, block and more. Then we take the field, with a default view that shows us almost the entire pitch but which makes us vulnerable to the sorties of the most backward opponents. Having conquered the ball after the initial kick, you have to carry it as far as possible into the opponent's area, until the limit is reached. Once this is done, you can throw the ball on the ground (five points!) and also be entitled to a free throw towards the ~goal~ (another two points!). Obviously all this is not that simple, and indeed you go through numerous ~study~ phases: when you are in possession of the ball, you have to pass it to your teammates (L1 and R1 buttons on the pad) and avoid being caught by your opponents, trying to dose the acceleration (R2 button of the pad) to perform some ~dribbling~. When the ball belongs to the other team, you have to select the player closest to it (L2 button) and then run towards its owner, entering into opposition (even diving, if necessary) to unlock the run. At that point a situation arises that the game renders in a rather confusing and cumbersome way: two groups of players ~push~ each other and you have to win back the ball by repeatedly pressing a button, then make a quick pass and start over. If the ball crosses the lateral boundaries of the field, a throw-in must be made similar to what happens in football, with some obvious differences regarding the interception. Finally, the phase relating to free throws has been managed very well: our player can move a direction indicator for the shot, then charge the power in two moments. The result is quite accurate. Technical realization The graphics of Rugby 08 are quite detailed and well done, with some reservations regarding the similarity of the players to their real counterparts. Even with the most distant views, and despite the presence of numerous characters in the field, the engine does not suffer from slowdowns and manages to maintain a certain fluidity constantly. Throw-ins and set pieces have the merit of making us appreciate the level of detail of the players, quite rich in detail and equipped with excellent animations, especially as regards blocks. A note of merit also goes to the field entrances, personalized and faithful to the real behavior of the teams (yes, the All Blacks do their war dance...). As for the sound, we have a rather varied and ~dense~ commentary, and a series of average effects. Unfortunately the game does not have any localization in Italian except for the printed material, so we will have all the texts on the screen and the voices in English. Finally, there is no online multiplayer. Comment We are faced with a well-made product without any acute detail: Rugby 08 we permette to play with all the teams updated this year, has a large number of modes (including the world championship) and a control system that may not be immediate but effective over the long distance. The problems of this game mostly lie in the almost complete lack of changes compared to the 2007 edition, probably because the developers are already thinking about how to bring everything to the new generation consoles. And obviously this is not a recommended purchase for those who not only don't know rugby but aren't attracted to it in the least: Rugby 08 is clearly a product for fans of this sport only, who will certainly find it engaging and rather long-lived. Pros: All teams and the world championship Technically sound Quite long-lived Cons: Only for rugby fans Almost identical to the previous episode Italian localization is missing", "date": "2007-10-08", "grade": null}
