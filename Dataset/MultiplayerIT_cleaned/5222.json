{"name": "Grosso guaio a Suplex City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/175273-wwe-2k17-grosso-guaio-a-suplex-city.html", "text": "As highlighted in the WWE 2K16 review, the transition from the defunct THQ to 2K Games and the support of the talented Visual Concepts team to the expert developers of Yuke's, who have been dealing with the franchise for sixteen years now, have not led the series to pursue that evolution that was strongly needed. The brand has instead continued to perch on its characterizing elements, giving up more immediate and fun gameplay in favor of simulative ambitions that wink only and exclusively at the most avid fans of the World Wrestling Entertainment branded shows. The numbers for the moment prove the choices made by the publisher are right, but it is also true that compared to the 2015 episode, that of the substantial graphic improvement, there has been a significant drop in sales (source: VGchartz.com) and it will be necessary to understand how WWE 2K17 will be received. The sensation, in fact, is of a project realized without too much conviction, perhaps in the middle of a path that could lead the franchise to abandon the technical limitations of the previous generation platforms in favor of a native design for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. However, the problems do not lie in the graphics, further improved and capable of offering us polygonal models and faithful animations for a greater number of characters than in the past, but in the quick time event-style solutions adopted for the gameplay, which on the one hand add a certain thickness strategic to matches, on the other hand they make them look terribly slow and cumbersome in the eyes of those who would expect a bit of frenetic action from a wrestling game, also mindful of the origins of the series. There are some small changes, a differentiated taunt system and a better approach to running attacks, but in our opinion there would be a need to rethink the philosophy behind the experience rather than pursuing the usual conservative policy. WWE 2K17 is a rich and complete product, but this year without the story mode and relevant news Via the Showcase As reported a few weeks ago, WWE 2K17 does not include the traditional Showcase mode, which has always been the flagship of the single player sector. Last year this option saw us retrace the intense career of ~Stone Cold~ Steve Austin from his origins to his consecration, so it would have been nice for this edition to be able to try something similar, perhaps in the role of Goldberg (who, however, is a character reserved for pre-orders) or Brock Lesnar, the cover athlete. The decision to cut such a large part of the experience is surprising, also because we are talking about a mode that has always been able to characterize the entire package, to offer fans one or more stories to relive and complete before grappling with the rest of the game. offer; always rich, for heaven's sake, but inevitably more generic. The narrow main menu, graphically a clear step backwards compared to last year's, allows you to try your hand at a flood of different matches, in which from two to six contenders can participate: normal matches, Falls Count Anywhere, Backstage Brawl, Extreme Rules, Ladder, Table, TLC, Hell in a Cell, Steel Cage, Iron Man, Last Man Standing, No Holds Barred, Submission, Normal Tag Matches, Elimination Tag, Elimination Tornado Tag, Triple Threat, Fatal 4-Way, 6-Man, Handicap Matches, tournaments and the inevitable Royal Rumble with ten, twenty or thirty wrestlers. The return of the Backstage Brawl opens the door to the possibility of going behind the scenes (after a short loading) in the matches in which the count out disqualification does not apply, and there to fight wildly between crates, barriers, lights and so on. The rest of the offer Stand-alone performances are complemented by My Career mode, the WWE Universe, online multiplayer and the powerful editor that allows you to create superstars, movesets, entrances, belts, celebrations and even videos, shows and arenas from scratch. The developers have done an evident job of optimizing the uploads, much shorter than those of WWE 2K16, and this is reflected in particular on the editor, which therefore becomes immediate and pleasant to use, with its innumerable possibility. We will be able to use it immediately, when we go to create our fighter for the career, which exactly as in WWE 2K16 will see us starting from the Orlando Performance Center, under the indications of coach Albert, to then debut on the NXT roster, improve our skill and slowly gain the popularity necessary to become part of the main roster, perhaps aiming for the title and storyline capable of catalyzing the attention of the spectators. In this sense, a new feature has been introduced, the promos, that isia the interventions on the microphone that superstars and divas make to raise the hype with respect to a certain rivalry or to build one from scratch, as well as to identify their role based on audience reactions. On paper this is an interesting novelty, in which you have to select topics as the character speaks and try to hit the right option to get a good response. However, the fact that the promos are only textual, inevitably, greatly diminishes their potential. For the rest, career progression is similar to that seen in past editions, albeit with some variations on the theme (see the challenges addressed to the Authority, the stable that controls the WWE shows). Structure almost unchanged also for the WWE Universe mode, which is the one where you can really indulge yourself in customizing the roster, changing titles, creating rivalries, organizing weekly shows and pay-per-views, with the possibility of playing in first person all meetings or to instantly simulate the outcome. At the time of Smackdown Vs. Raw it was necessary to manage one's roster and create the most sensational events to obtain ratings higher than those of the competition, but this aspect has been lacking for years now in favor of a more generic approach, certainly complete and with some small changes (see the reactions of the wrestlers, who can take a defeat badly and make an unexpected run-in at the end of the show that changes the cards on the table), but here too we have essentially already seen it. Finally, a few words for online multiplayer, which allows you to challenge a single user, participate in 2K Tonight events or create a team of three wrestlers to face as many. The matchmaking is confirmed to be quite slow, with few people online, and unfortunately excessive latency often occurs, which translates into the impossibility of hitting the quick time events that are fundamental to avoid the opponent's moves or even get out of the pin. The advice, therefore, is to organize yourself with friends and avoid matches with overseas users. Playstation 4 trophies There are fifty-nine Trophies included in WWE 2K17, and many of them must be unlocked by thoroughly playing the single player modes My Career and WWE Universe, but also by carrying out particular actions during standard matches: ending a match in the backstage, hitting the opponent with a belt, perform a number of counterattacks, insult the crowd or the opponent, and so on. There is also no shortage of achievements related to online activity, above all the 2K Tonight mode, which at the time of writing is not yet available. ~Believe that~, i.e. #believe it With over one hundred and fifty superstars and divas, the WWE 2K17 roster is the largest ever, as well as the most curated. We have already mentioned the technical improvement brought to the series since the edition of two years ago, an improvement that has been extended in this edition to a greater number of characters, with especially the female fighters who have benefited so much from the extra work of the developers. Of course, there are still characters that are not exactly faithful to their real counterparts and / or with generic animations, but we are ever closer to completeness from this point of view. The reflections on the skin of the wrestlers, but also the polygonal composition of the models, which finally no longer seem to suffer from old-gen shoulder joints, give a further degree of realism to the experience, although some aspects remain anchored to an ~old~ conception , you see the hair, the fireworks, the scenery in general and the audience, as large as you like but tending to perform the same animations in unison. As far as the sound is concerned, the voice of Lilian Garcia was used for the announcements, clearly improving what was heard last year, but the commentary by Michael Cole and JBL is too essential, listless, devoid of high notes... ah, just like in the reality! Nothing to say then.", "date": "2016-10-18", "grade": "7.0"}
