Today we are here to tell you about the little brother, Pocket Edition, the version for Android and iOS devices; will the developers have managed to create a product that lives up to the original after almost 3 years of continuous development? Find out with us. Minecraft Pocket Edition has reached a remarkable level of maturity and is approaching the original for PC One block after another As anticipated, the game has actually been available on the stores for almost three years now, but the lack of many features on the PC version has in fact made it only a castrated and uninteresting work. Following the latest update, however, things have changed and we are dealing with a product that, although still limited, manages to entertain much more than before and to partially restore that satisfaction and sense of adventure that one feels during map exploration. The basic mechanics are completely the same as the original and expect the player to explore a world populated by monsters and other entities and find a way to survive by building their own home or at least a safe place to take refuge during the night. Alternatively, those who don't want to try their hand at survival mode can always unleash their artistic talent in creative mode. Thanks to the use of hands and other tools, it is possible to dig into the ground to discover caves and precious minerals, which through an elaborate crafting system can be transformed into defense weapons or tools suitable for building real impregnable strongholds or, again, luxury beach villas. The possibilities are truly endless and it's up to the user to find ways to satisfy the little architect in him. In this respect the developers have done an excellent job since Pocket edition, finally in possession of the infinite worlds, bions, caves and many other fundamental elements, manages to provide an almost PC experience; but the devil is in the details and sadly we still can't consider the game a 100% complete product. The first real fundamental disappointment is the impossibility of using the redstone dust for the creation of complex circuits; although it is possible to obtain it, it is still not possible to deposit it on the ground to make electrical connections. Another lack that has made the most avid fans turn up their noses is the Nether, reachable via portals on the computer but not yet present in the mobile version. All these additions can be safely implemented via future updates, and in fact the developers have already expressed the desire to make the Pocket edition as equal as possible to Minecraft for other platforms. Surprisingly the controls aren't bad at all and on some specific occasions even more comfortable than the mouse and keyboard; on the left of the screen there is the classic d-pad while to move the gaze it is sufficient to swipe on the display. To dig, just keep your finger on the block you want to destroy, regardless of where it is; unlike the original, you don't need to center the view on the desired cube, but you can easily interact with any element that is within reach and within the visual range, effectively allowing you to drill an entire mountain without any effort. The graphics are very similar to the PC version, even the same textures are used, but don't be fooled by the simple and cubed style: by setting the maximum visual distance the game proceeds inexorably jerky even on the latest generation hardware and on an iPad Air that on an Xperia Z2 becomes practically unplayable. As for the artificial intelligence of the mobs, we are no longer considered completely satisfied, given that they present symptoms of chronic stupidity on many occasions and behave like an iron attracted to a magnet, proceeding straight towards the player regardless of the environment surrounding. The online component, on the other hand, has not yet been refined enough to be played seriously given the too frequent bugs and freezes.", "date": "2014-09-04", "grade": "7.8"}
