{"name": "Real Football 2008", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/real-football-2008.html", "text": "In the mobile gaming market on mobile phones, as far as football titles are concerned, we have so far basically witnessed a two-way challenge between the disappointing adaptation of Fifa by Electronic Arts and the more convincing Real Football by Gameloft. And if the awareness of the arrival of the dreaded Pro Evolution Soccer didn't give EA Sports enough stimulus to make its franchise make the qualitative leap in the 2008 edition, Gameloft has on the contrary perfected its product by improving in practically every aspect what it it was already THE football to have on your mobile phone. Compared to the competitor Fifa, Real Football 2008 certainly comes out clearly defeated in terms of licenses and available teams; in the face of Fifa's abundance and fidelity, the title of the French house only returns the names of authentic players - and not even all of them -, simply leaving those of the stadiums and clubs associated with the cities they belong to. A sacrifice evidently dictated by the limited budget, but which can still be accepted more than willingly given the quality of everything else. The game is offered in two editions, two-dimensional or 3d for those with a powerful terminal; however, the differences are practically only of an aesthetic nature, since the contents and gameplay remain unchanged. Game modes abound, offering cups, leagues, friendlies, training sessions in addition to Towards 2008 (basically Euro 2008 starting from the qualifying rounds) and Challenge, with which to tackle a series of scenarios of varying difficulty in an attempt to resolve situations already more or less compromised. An example? Take control of France during the last World Cup final following Zidane's dismissal and try to lead them to victory. Certainly not the ideal mission for us Italians, but sufficient to suggest the character of this stimulating modality. The control system is that of last year, therefore decidedly valid considering the scarce ductility of the keyboards: with the numeric keys, with the exception of the 5 delegated to pass (and holding down the through ball), you direct the movements of the players, and the double pressure of the same determines the sprint in speed. The hash sign for crosses and long passes, 0 for shots and an asterisk instead for plays and tricks. The novelties are therefore above all in the surrounding aspects, such as the -written- commentary of the commentator during the salient phases, the superimposed messages with the statistics of the match, the signs of the slides on the ground and a general greater refinement in the modeling of the players and in the making of their animations. Also interesting is the superior diversification of the various teams, which now have well-defined characteristics like some players of a particular class whose ability in free-kicks or dribbling is perhaps reported. Slightly improved compared to last year, even if still far from perfect, is instead the artificial intelligence of both teammates and opponents; In any case, we advise you to choose only the two highest difficulty levels right from the start, in order to enjoy a minimum of challenge that would otherwise be completely absent. Finally, I am very sorry to point out that no multiplayer support has been included in this edition either; we continue to find this lack really absurd in the face of the availability of bluetooth technology now on practically all devices. PRO To date the best football on mobile Curated in every respect Very funny AGAINST Still no multiplayer Very incomplete licenses Too easy almost on all difficulty levels", "date": "2007-10-08", "grade": "S.V."}
