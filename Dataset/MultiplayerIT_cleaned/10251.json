The resource-gathering strategy genre is already as crowded as the sports bar when the Champions Cup is on the air. To understand the situation we have to go even further back and look to 1992, when Dune II launched a formula that shaped the RTS landscape. Raw materials to collect, a tech tree to develop, and diverse units for factions. But Dune II, unlike many subsequent titles, enjoyed a strong cultural foundation, represented a ruthless critique of energy racing and could already offer a particular gameplay, characterized by the huge worms lurking under the sand. Furthermore, the alternative formulas have always given dubious results, never striking despite the fact that they were titles of absolute value such as Z or Fields of Glory. How then to maintain an extremely functional and already developed formula with unique narrative effectiveness without falling back into banality or emulation? The challenge Blizzard took up the challenge by developing Starcraft. A title obviously based on the collection of resources but profoundly different from the competitors and equipped with a remarkable narrative structure. Let's start with the single player who observes the three phases of an intergalactic war from three different points of view. In fact, the three races do not represent only three factions but three macro chapters of a single extremely complex story whose engine is powered by vespene gas and an unidentified agglomeration of minerals. The difficulty is progressive and avoids the risk of being in a tutorial every time you switch to a new race. Furthermore, and this is the key point of Starcraft, each race is radically different from the others in terms of approach, colors, shapes and especially style of play. The first chapter is dedicated to the Terrans, the humans, who represent the easiest faction to use, more similar to factions already seen in other titles. To make up for the lack of innovation, the Terran campaign was packaged with a distinctly cinematic cut. Secondly we find ourselves having to manage the Zerg, aliens in the true sense of the word, literary and morphological. In fact, they are extremely fast monsters, controlled by humid megabrains, which can mutate into structures or transform themselves into more powerful creatures in a short time. Finally we meet the Protoss, sons of a metallic, cold, terrible science fiction. Beings kept alive by energy and not by organs, certainly less ugly than the Zerg, at least from an anthropomorphic point of view, but even more distressing. The Protoss can build buildings only in the area of influence of the power plants, a factor that radically affects the mode of expansion. In a single package we therefore find three ways to play and dozens of radically different units. Stellar competition Starcraft multiplayer is fast paced. Heavily based on action and timing. One of the most common tactics is the rush. It is a sudden attack with all available forces that aims to surprise the opponent to achieve a quick victory. Starcraft is open to an incredible variety of techniques of this type that give the title a rather frenetic pace and massively increase the technical rate. Unwelcome to RTS chess players, however, it is highly appreciated by those who love a high level of competition in multiplayer. Starcraft is played with the clock and the matter does not change in the advanced stages of the game. Passively defending or delaying the arrival of adequate support troops can be fatal in a very short period of time. Furthermore, understanding what the opponent thinks is not easy through a screen, so deciding the attack strategy is a matter of speed and luck, especially in the initial stages when our scouts have not yet revealed the opponent's techniques. Once the attack has been decided, manual skill intervenes. In fact, even if placing your troops and making them retreat or advance is a common matter for RTS, in Starcraft the speed of movement of the troops and the immediacy of the attacks allow you to launch and avoid blows almost as if we were playing a fighting game. It is no coincidence that the limit of selectable units is 12 and that it is strongly recommended to use the keyboard to quickly recall the different groups of 12 units. Having direct control of any type of unit or squad allows you to master advanced tactics even during mass attacks or in the most frenetic phases of the game. Direct control The zerglings can bite, flank, hide suddenly assault and above all they are ready in no time. Marines have to keep their distance, use obstacles and sfburp the territory. Protoss zealots are extremely powerful in hand-to-hand combat but cannot hide and must time every move well despite the protective shield that defends them. In short, each unit has its own peculiarities that must be used to the fullest and this is only possible with direct control of each action. Simply clicking the attack button on an enemy is also ill-advised in situations of clear advantage that can quickly turn into nasty surprises. Furthermore, establishing patrols and waypoints or telling a unit to hold its position are the only tools to manage units indirectly, since in Starcraft there is no trace of specific routines to be assigned to troops. This lack probably depends on a conscious choice by Blizzard who wanted to give a distinctly action cut to their title. A choice that certainly increases the balance and the importance of the player's skill in multiplayer but which becomes an obvious shortcoming in single player. In summary The result is a legendary campaign, the birth of a complex universe and the generation of new heroes experienced firsthand by the players, all seasoned with a series of films full of atmosphere and details, dialogues and briefings that are accurate and full of pathos. Perhaps some models are not exactly beautiful to look at but are overshadowed by explosions, alien landscapes and dialogues full of pathos beyond belief. Sci-fi quotes abound with direct references to Starship Troopers for the Zerg and for various missions and the inspiration to Warhammer 40000 for the creation of some units is equally clear. The Battle.net support is fundamental, which makes access to matches even faster and supports the highly competitive dimension with statistics, rankings and scores. Aesthetically, the Starcraft battlefield stands a step above all the RTS of the period, and not for amazing technological innovations but thanks to the meticulous care with which the animations of characters, vehicles and lights have been designed. To underline everything we find an extraordinary dubbing. Charismatic voices bring marines, aliens and artificial intelligences to life and integrate perfectly with the ambient audio giving us a unique sci-fi atmosphere. Even higher than that of the now legendary Dune 2. Particular applause certainly goes to the Terran campaign. It's really easy to identify with those men armed with flashlights and machine guns who try in vain to illuminate the darkest corners of the universe. The Editor Starcraft has made a huge leap forward in user-generated content, although some key elements of Battlenet will only be introduced with Warcraft 3. The Blizzard Editor gives us the ability to employ characters that gain experience, have stealth abilities, and set a wide variety of goals that go beyond just destroying enemies. But the heart of the editor is the ability to write dialogues and generate complex sequences of events that allow us to create real single player campaigns. Furthermore, although the structure of the editor is strongly linked to that of the game, a little inventiveness is enough to change the cards on the table, perhaps taking advantage of the tight deadlines of Starcraft and the speed of the units. In a few moments we can draw twisted tunnels where the zerglings become aliens and escape is the only option, or, just as simply, we can allow the player himself to become a lethal creature who has penetrated into a marine base.", "date": "2010-01-14", "grade": "9.5"}
