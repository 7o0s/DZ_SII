Signed Fast Travel Games, a software house founded by industry veterans such as ex EA DICE Erik Odeldahl, this new game promises ghostly atmospheres and a strong dose of elegant and well-calibrated fear. No so-called ~jump scares~, Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife does not play dirty, does not betray the user's trust with low-level tricks. The director of the game promised it to us, and so it actually was. This choice puts the experience in an advantageous position: it's a horror that doesn't go overboard, but that constantly makes you uncomfortable, never really makes you feel safe. For this same reason, in Afterlife you will never find yourself faced with real fights, situations in which those who do not have great manual skills could feel as helpless as they are frustrated, up to abandoning the game. Without a doubt we are faced with an extremely balanced product, probably created in this way to embrace the diverse audience of Oculus Quest. This does not mean that the work of Fast Travel Games is not suitable for the most seasoned players, but those looking for action and adrenaline perhaps better go elsewhere, around the beautiful Walking Dead Saints & Sinner for example. Hidden in the dark Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife: no jump scare, but woe to being afraid of the dark... Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife focuses on stealth, the art of hiding, rather than daggers and machine guns to be wielded with perfect precision, as all too often happens. For us it is absolutely good: we have had the best experiences with horror in virtual reality in the moments in which we have been forced to act in silence, without being noticed. In this case, the game recognizes our positioning with sufficient precision to allow us to do it in reality too: to hide behind a desk in the game, we can simply crouch in reality, without having to press a button that is present anyway, for those who will not be able to afford this immersion. Afterlife can also be played sitting down, but there's no question: standing up, using the whole body, is exactly what makes virtual reality truly magical. It goes without saying that with the freedom granted by Quest 2, this approach is even more recommended and fun, in short, the loss of graphic detail compared to the PC version alone is worth it. Then he works very well on the sound, and often you really have the feeling of having someone whispering in your ear, or the apparent certainty of having heard something move in a dark corner of the room where you are. Trapped with a shadow Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife: What secrets does Afterlife's decadent Hollywood mansion hide? We'll spend a good part of the game hiding, walking slowly and without making noises that could attract the attention of the ghostly figures we'll meet. We will also be able to make use of objects such as furnishings, to be thrown around to attract the attention of any possible threat. An old camera will also play an important role on which we will soon get our hands on: the object will allow us to immortalize certain corners of the mansion, in order to unlock memories that will enrich the elements that make up the rich plot of Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife. An old-fashioned flash will soon be added to the camera, to be used to illuminate the surroundings both with its dim perennial light and with real flashes that will allow us to see clearly, even if only for a few moments, the environment that surrounds us. As we get our hands on new powers and equipment, we will be able to access new portions of this decadent Californian villa, in a structure that can only recall that of a simple but well thought out ~metroidvania~. World of Darkness Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife: with the flash it is possible to illuminate the darkest areas of the villa for a few moments, but beware of surprises Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife has this ugly name (they sound like the titles of three different games!) because it is built around a very thick license: Wraith is the demonic part of White Wolf's World of Darkness of which the most famous Vampire The Masquerade. As you would expect, the narrative of the game has dilated rhythms and rather adult themes: suffice it to say that Afterlife practically begins with our death. Once back to life, guided by the shadow that accompanies each person who has lived this shocking experience, we will have to move around the house of this Hollywood director trying tounderstand what happened and what secrets are hidden within these creepy walls. We will therefore not find the classic NPCs with which to interact but only impalpable manifestations of the people who have passed through that house, who with their stories and dialogues will gradually shed light on what happened. Solution already seen in other titles, which puts the player in a role that is perhaps a little too passive for virtual reality. But that's just a small fly in the ointment of a product that's clearly made by people who know what they're doing, and care about getting it right.", "date": "2021-05-02", "grade": "7.8"}
