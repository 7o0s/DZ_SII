{"name": "Fifa 11", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81280-fifa-11-il-calcio-su-iphone.html", "text": "Although Electronic Arts' Fifa has now established itself on consoles as the reference football brand for many players who are passionate about the sport in question, it is equally true that the multiplatform nature of the series has given birth to children and stepchildren with qualities that are anything but comparable. Probably the worst version palm up to now belonged to the 3d one for mobile phones and iPhone; born on N-Gage, the mobile declination immediately demonstrated that it possessed very few qualities, this despite the various annual revisions and the transition to systems such as the much more capable and performing Apple ones. Evidently aware of the paucity of this product, and supported by the ever greater dignity in the playful field of the bitten apple platforms, EA has therefore decided to make a clean slate, giving life to a totally new title with Fifa 11. The weight of progress 858MB. This is the weight of Fifa 11, which thus becomes one of the ~biggest~ games ever present on the App Store; a striking size, which makes even more noise when compared with the 61.3 Mb of its predecessor. It is enough then to take the field to realize where all those megas have been used: the graphics of Fifa 11 are in fact simply excellent, certainly comparable with that of a Psp or Ps2. Animations and level of detail are the most surprising aspects, with a final rendering that arises without problems at the pinnacle of the genre on the iPhone; unfortunately, however, as a counterbalance, a low frame rate should be reported, really barely acceptable, mostly which lends itself to some conspicuous further slowdown during the most agitated situations. Evidently the graphics engine needs to be optimized, and the hope is that further updates to the application will correct the problem at least in part, but that it is particularly expensive in terms of requests can be seen from the fact that Fifa 11 is not compatible with iPhone 3G and with Pre-3rd generation Touches. Obviously, the fundamental point that determines the success or otherwise of a football title on the iPhone, however, remains the control system. Well, let's start from an assumption: the products belonging to this genre are probably among the least suitable for transposition on touch screens, unable to guarantee precision and versatility comparable to that of physical controls. That said, in Fifa 11 the programmers have still done a more than positive job, starting with the choice to offer two systems that are distinguished by some substantial differences. In fact, with the simplified commands, the 3 virtual keys present are distinguished by the action associated with each one at that moment, therefore in possession or not of the ball; the long press of the keys also allows further possibilities, such as crosses and high passes, assisted by the support of the CPU. A valid and rather satisfactory system, which is however accompanied by a second solution capable of offering greater freedom of choice to the player. In fact, with the extended controls the keys remain 3, but this time it is necessary to combine their use to put the entire range of actions into practice; despite the greater ductility, the latter system is probably too complex, frustrating and in any case not very sustainable by the capabilities of the touch screen. Furthermore, in general, a slight lack of reactivity with respect to the commands given makes the action less fluid than expected. Having said that, Fifa 11 on the iPhone can be played in an extremely pleasant way: the gameplay is competent and complete, and there is no feeling of amateurism or ~jump into the past of 10 years~ that characterizes other competing titles. Furthermore, some classy solutions, such as the possibility of calling the insertions of teammates in the offensive phase by dragging your finger on the screen, denote an absolutely high planning work and production quality. Where unfortunately the EA title shows its side to some criticism is in the quantity and variety of modes, really reduced to the bone: with the multiplayer absent but promised to arrive with a future update, all that remains are single games, leagues or cups national. A little sincerely, even with the support of licenses for real names and uniforms and with the discreet resemblance of the players to their real counterparts.
