{"name": "Destroyer Command - WWII Naval Combat Simulation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/destroyer-command-wwii-naval-combat-simulation.html", "text": "The Soldier of the Seas The Second World War established the supremacy of the plane over the ship and consequently the whole way of fighting on the seas changed, moreover, as the more informed of you know, in the First World War there were the great clashes between units in line (the battle of the Jultand is the most striking example, where two entire fleets clashed), while in the second conflict, apart from some rare exceptions such as the sinking of the Bismarck (even if the fate of the German super-battleship was marked by an old English torpedo bomber), the battles were above all air and naval. In this scenario, the ship that took on the greatest importance was undoubtedly the aircraft carrier, but the small escort units played a leading role, on the other hand the roles covered by the destroyers in the II World War were escort, fighter and obviously they were the best units against submarines, in a nutshell they were indispensable, moreover if we take a look at modern units, we realize that they are all ships that have a lot in common with those units from which they inherited the dimensions, speed, and the possibility of multi -use. A little history never hurts The SSI game puts us in command of one of these units, of which we will assume full control but not only, in fact (and the title in this is indicative) we will be able to command one or more squadrons of destroyers. Well, as it is easy to understand there are so many topics and so let's try to proceed in order starting from the manual which is an indispensable component in a simulation. Unfortunately, the small manual in Italian attached to the package, although written in a clear way, is too small and hints a bit at all the features of the game but without going into any detail, furthermore there is no illustration; too bad, also because the ~real~ manual, well-finished and exhaustive, is contained in the classic PDF format on the CD, but it is in English. In any case, let's install the only CD and catapult ourselves into the game, where the main menu appears from which it is possible to navigate easily within the game, but for once we don't merge into the action, but look carefully the ~Information~ item which contains useful and interesting historical information. By selecting it, in fact, we have the opportunity to travel inside a destroyer to learn its secrets, observe, thanks to a special program, the three-dimensional models (of all the ships present) and finally read some interesting historical information. Very beautiful and interesting and represents, to all intents and purposes, a plus value which must be taken into account. On the bridge The SP modes are the usual and include non-dynamic campaigns as well as individual missions, which can be historical, random or simple training, someone may turn up their noses at this situation, especially as regards the dynamic campaign, but it goes remembered that in this game we carry out important but secondary tasks, and therefore not such as to significantly change the fate of the conflict. The random mission generator deserves our attention, which after setting a good number of parameters, gives us a scenario ready to be played. Very good. At this point we are ready to dive into the action, but first I must remind you that in the game we have the opportunity to command 14 American vessels and therefore we are spoiled for choice. The game has an interface similar to that of Silent Hunter II, simple but at the same time effective, the system is the now known one of the ~stations~ where it is possible to carry out our directives precisely. Most of the time will be spent in the CIC (Combat Information Center) where it is possible to give orders to all the other stations, here, moreover, we will have the possibility to give orders also to the rest of the squadron and all this is done with a few shots of click easily and immediately. If we like to complicate our lives we can operate directly in the individual stations, for example by taking care of the manual shooting of the 40mm pieces (which I remember are the big guns in a ship like this), however as the game progresses we will realize that our presence is indispensable above all in the command bridge and therefore we will have to sacrifice these operations (personally the anti-aircraft station is an exception which I love to use to make a good shot at the enemy pigeon). A beautiful 3D sea and an innovative Multiplayer Technically the game stands at a good level, showing off quite credible 3D models (some done better than others) a nice virtual sea andsatisfactory atmospheric conditions, excellent special effects (explosions and cannon shots) and sounds, furthermore the game does not seem to suffer any slowdowns and this denotes a good care in the realization of the 3D engine. What left me disappointed is the AI which has proved not up to par with the rest, during the clashes I have noticed several times that it simply limits itself to returning fire without undertaking sophisticated game tactics, and this becomes particularly burdensome when we fight against a submarine, where the classic cat-mouse game never takes place. This is a real shame, because it takes away a lot from a game that has many strings to its bow and which instead in this way loses part of its atmosphere. Multiplayer deserves a completely different discussion, which for the first time sees two different titles interface to create a new gaming experience, in fact, as I have said several times, Destroyer Command is compatible with Silent Hunter II, the submarine simulator also created by Ultimation. To play just go to the Ubisoft portal, choose the appropriate lobby and dive into a game, in reality there is the possibility of playing together with other players who own Destroyer Command, in this case you can opt for Cooperative or Melee games, but the most interesting thing is to carry out clashes between submarines and fighters. At the beginning of the mission, the objective is chosen together with other game parameters, usually it is a question of defending a convoy (obviously the submarines must sink the merchant ships), the achievement of a point or the simple destruction of the opponent, evidently all participants with fighters will be allies and the same will happen for submarines. I have played more than one game and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and intensity of the matches, the only comment I have to move to the small number of players present at the moment, but I hope that with the greater diffusion of the game this problem will also vanish. Conclusions Destroyer Command is a good title that cannot be missing in the collection of fans of World War II ships, technically well done and with an interesting Mutliplayer mode, it also represents a good document of historical value. We hope for a patch that fixes some problems encountered with the AI which represents the only weak point of this valid simulation. The battles on the seas When one thinks of war games centered on naval battles, one immediately thinks of the beasts of the sea (battleships, cruisers and aircraft carriers) which, with their majesty and their charisma, attract the attention of enthusiasts (in this regard, how can we forget the SSI titles such as that Fighting Steel which a few years ago received good public criticism), or the thought goes to the games that see us at the helm of the hunter of the abyss par excellence: the submarine. Just the SSI has recently published the sequel to one of the most awaited titles by fans of hunting under the sea, that Silent Hunter II already reviewed on these pages and which at the time of its release, stood out for its original compatibility Multiplayer with a forthcoming game called Destroyer Command, a destroyer simulator also set at the time of World War II. Well as you may have already understood, today we will analyze this last title which you can already find at your trusted retailer in the usual DVD-style packaging.", "date": "2002-05-13", "grade": null}
