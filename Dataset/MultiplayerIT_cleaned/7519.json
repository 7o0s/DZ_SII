Therefore, the arrival of this Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games is inevitable, the second episode of the franchise to deal with snow, ice and the like but the first ever to debut on Wii U: if therefore it is reasonable to expect a maintenance of the tradition under the profile of the basic play structure, let's rather see if SEGA has been able to exploit the characteristics of the Nintendo console and its controller to infuse a pinch of novelty to the whole. Sochi in business Considering how the previous title dedicated to the London 2012 Olympics had shown that the series - albeit young - already showed a little shortness of breath, the arrival of new hardware could not have come at a better time: with Mario & Sonic at At the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, SEGA had a great opportunity to freshen up its multi-event sports brand, instilling renewed curiosity in both fans of the previous installments and longtime detractors of the genre. From this point of view, it is sad to note that the opportunity was essentially wasted: despite the undoubtedly stimulating characteristics of Wii U, the developers preferred not to risk it, remaining anchored to a gameplay that can be distinguished by very few details from past experiences. So here you have to arm yourself with the ~old~ Remote (necessarily equipped with Motion Plus) to try your hand at the vast majority of the 25 minigames offered by the package: and if on the one hand it is an understandable decision after all (the GamePad is not the best of handling, not to mention the resistance to possible shocks or too intense stresses), on the other hand it is inevitable to feel a pinch of disappointment in finding yourself faced with what is substantially the same game as four years ago. We therefore return to exploiting the motion sensor of the controller to mimic real disciplines, for example by holding the Remote and tilting it left and right to mimic a slalom or swinging it to replicate the motion of an athlete's arms during skating. Although it is always about things already widely seen in the previous episodes of the series, it certainly cannot be said that Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games is not a title capable of entertaining in multiplayer, even if it would have been nice to see SEGA put the experience accumulated in recent years. Instead, the game carries design flaws and gaps that even appear anachronistic: therefore it is difficult to digest such an ill-conceived tutorial system, as well as the need to make an excessive number of selections before being able to play the desired minigame, even passing through the obligatory calibration of the Remote for each single event. Immediate in substance, Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games is much less immediate in form, a sin that is not exactly venal for a title aimed at a casual audience and which moreover - being the fourth installment of the series - of water under the bridge He's seen a lot go by... Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games is fun, but with a few too many missteps Chronicles of ice and snow From a quantitative point of view, Mario & Sonic's play offer at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games is very respectable: in addition to the section dedicated to single games, where you can choose one of the 16 Olympic disciplines and 9 Dream Events, there is a single player career mode called Clash of Legends, the so-called Delirium Medley that allows you to tackle thematic mixes of mini-games and even create a personalized set, the part called Quiz and Skills in which up to four users can challenge each other in alternative versions of sports specialties trying to get the maximum score and -finally- the long-awaited support for online multiplayer, ideal for those who don't have friends at home with whom to share the experience even if limited to a handful of events. Then there are the classic avalanches of statistics and a large amount of unlockable elements by completing a whole series of objectives set up by the developers. Lots of irons on the fire which, however, are not always particularly tasty, on the contrary. Several minigames have more than a few design or control issues (hockey for example is very confusing, figure skating suffers fromthe movements really approximate and curling has been made incomprehensibly complicated and not very enjoyable), and the Dream Events that often in the past included the most original and fun part of the playful offer here seem to have been set up with listlessness and lack of ideas. On the other hand, the Quiz and Ability mode is an apt addition, very pleasant to play in company and which certainly deserves to be taken into consideration for future episodes as well. In all of this, SEGA seems to have almost forgotten the existence of the Gamepad, most of the time relegated to purely ancillary functions. In fact, if we exclude the few cases in which the Wii U controller can be used to actively play some mini-games (sometimes with convincing results as in the case of the four-man bobsled, which increase the feeling of regret for the lack of commitment from the developers in this sense), the Gamepad only serves to display statistics and scores and to provide mild entertainment to those who are not playing, allowing you to observe the game action seasoned with textual comments from Toad and Chao. Finally, from a technical point of view, even if it cannot be said that Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games took full advantage of the Wii U hardware characteristics, the upgrades compared to the previous episodes are clearly visible: in particular, the better definition of the image is accompanied by well-made textures and light effects, the characters are less angular and the work done on the extension and the level of detail of the backdrops is tangible. Instead, much more could have been done with reference to an outdated interface and a particularly repetitive and at times even annoying sound accompaniment.", "date": "2013-11-04", "grade": "6.9"}
