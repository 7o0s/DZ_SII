Between successful attempts, such as the Chaos Rings series, and slips of the caliber of Drakerider and Guardian Cross, a large part of the lineup is made up of reissues and portings of the old glories of the Japanese company. And also in this case with fluctuating results: the mobile versions of Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger demonstrate how Square Enix has often struggled to use the touch interface sensibly, but above all to treat some of the most loved games with respect and care. own fans. It is obvious, therefore, that the arrival on smartphones and tablets of the excellent Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen has been greeted with a little skepticism, but this time the adaptation work has succeeded much better than could have been hoped for. One of the best installments of the Dragon Quest series is back in an adaptation for smartphones and tablets Chapter adventure Although Dragon Quest IV debuted on the NES at the dawn of the 90s, this new port for iOS and Android is based on the 2007 Nintendo DS re-release, itself built on the remake for the first PlayStation. We therefore find the restyling work already seen in previous versions, starting from a mixture of 2D sprites and three-dimensional settings. A mixture that, it must be said, sometimes appears successful and other times much less, also due to the sharper and wider screen of a tablet compared to that of a Nintendo DS. Characters and scenarios clash more than before, but above all many stuck textures and small tricks now become much more evident. On Retina screens, the low resolution of the sprites is accused a lot, but in this regard, no one expected that Square Enix would have redesigned all the assets for a simple mobile port. What is surprising, however, is the poor definition of the texts and buttons, which at least on the devices we tested appear more blurred than in other portings of the Japanese company. For the rest, Dragon Quest IV absolutely maintains the feeling of the original, between the character design by Akira Toriyama, the endless random encounters and the turn-based battles which, as is the tradition of the Dragon Quest series, take place absolutely in the first person. However, one of the most appreciated aspects of Chapters of the Chosen was the type of narration adopted by the developers. The plot was rather mundane and revolved around the usual bad guy taking over the world, but it was told through small chapters separate from each other, each of which put the player in the shoes of one of several supporting characters. Only after becoming familiar with the mechanics and getting to know the other party members, the player would impersonate the main hero, finally entering the heart of the story. However, given the amount of text and dialogue, there is a problem: for reasons unknown to us, the iOS port of Dragon Quest IV does not allow you to select the excellent Italian translation used for Chronicles of the Chosen on Nintendo DS. Knowledge of English therefore becomes essential, also because, based on their origin, some characters use accents, dialects and cadences with variations ranging from Irish to Scottish, up to aping French or Russian. In closing, let's spend a few words on the interface, given that, despite not having found a solution that satisfied everyone, Square Enix has adopted a decidedly acceptable compromise. The detractors of the virtual stick will have to turn a blind eye, but at least the game gives the possibility to adjust its size and change its position on the screen. Curiously, Dragon Quest IV on mobile can only be played in portrait mode (i.e. with the device vertically), a choice that may leave you confused at first, but which was clearly designed to be able to play using only one hand. Precisely for this reason, the most convenient solution seems to be to play on smartphones, while tablet owners may find it difficult.", "date": "2014-08-29", "grade": "8.0"}
