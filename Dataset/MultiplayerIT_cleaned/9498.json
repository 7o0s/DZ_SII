So this whole world is enclosed in a Nintendo DS title where the plot is essentially built on the basis of our personal activities to be carried out on campus. The title brings back typical moments of a summer camp full of music, entertainment and fun all surrounded by a good dose of challenges among the soundtracks that accompany the whole game and which are part of the musical range of the film Camp Rock 2. You don't have to be a musician or an expert player to compete in the adventures of Camp Rock: The Final Jam, but have a passion for musical instruments or better still for music in general and courage for the most witty challenges. The characters to be created are, as always, to be chosen between men and women and each step reached will give us the opportunity to earn really nice new clothes changes for the performances, payable through tokens to be seized along the way. Play, play, find! The presentation of the game is very accurate and explains in detail before starting to play our goals, illustrating the various amusements within the summer camp. Everything is conveniently displayed in our logbook, which reports every detail performed. The challenges, on the other hand, are manifested thanks to the illustrations on the map shown on the upper screen which signals, through flashing turquoise and white exclamation points, where our next destination will be, which often consists of a job to be done. An example of commissioned work is to find tree trunks for the bonfire: we will struggle a bit to find the position of the logs since it is a real treasure hunt, but our colleagues will be kind enough to help us in mission. The campsite is full of novelties one of these is the stage where one can freely exhibit or exercise: waiting for us is a splendid rocker who invites us to train through the use of three instruments chosen from guitar, bass and drums in in order to improve the technique for the shows inside the campsite. Camp Rock: The Final Jam has not only musical games inside, but also the exciting challenges typical of campsites, such as the use of the canoe. In fact, one of the challenges involves this type of sport that allows you to earn the much coveted tokens, the latter however can be further conquered through a mini-game that involves blowing into the microphone of the console, to move dry leaves from above the tokens, once displayed you have to use the stylus and try to earn them all in the shortest possible time. Camp Rock: The Final Jam, is mainly suitable for an audience of teenagers who are especially passionate about the plots of the Camp Rock saga. Even if the narrative part does not actually play an important role, the game is quite fluid and continuous, in fact it is often necessary to unlock the mini-game indicated to be able to move forward on the map. If we want, Camp Rock also has an educational role, as above all musical games, manage to exercise rhythmic perception by measuring themselves with the instruments available that vaguely and in a much less demanding way recall the exciting instrumental challenges of Guitar Hero. This rhythm game captivates young audiences as they are given the chance to play alongside the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato, the idols of the moment. In addition to music, dance will also have its space thanks to the reproduction of choreographies from the film, giving vent to every form of art and passion that will make the kids feel like real protagonists!", "date": "2011-01-31", "grade": null}
