The result was a sort of spiral from which it was very difficult to get out, also thanks to the decision to avoid freemium models so as to be able to guarantee a balance in the various elements of the gameplay. Considering the time ripe for a sequel, EightyEight Games has therefore published this You Must Build a Boat on the App Store and Google Play, a sequel that shares many of the ideas of the original, however expanding its possibilities. While less incisive than its predecessor, You Must Build a Boat is an absolutely brilliant title Carpenters At first, and perhaps even second glance, You Must Build a Boat might seem entirely indistinguishable from its predecessor. On the other hand, the British team preferred to avoid substantial modifications to a formula that had worked so well in the past, which is why the game works practically the same: it is a question of favoring the run of one's character - which takes place in a fraction of screen on top - placing at least three equal elements side by side among those arranged on a grid. Nothing more trivial would come to mind, and in fact understanding You Must Build a Boat is a matter of a moment: just know that to defeat enemies you need to align your weapons, while you need keys to open chests or doors. Everything must be done as quickly as possible, because taking hits or wasting time brings the protagonist closer to the left edge of the screen: once touched, it will be game over. We were talking about the apparent lack of ~heavy~ novelties in the gameplay, but in reality EightyEight Games has in any case done a job that is anything but idle and superficial: for example, the possibility of moving the boxes even while the combined ones are disappearing imposes a game rhythm much more frenetic, which needs to be quickly assimilated in order to achieve at least decent results. What seems like a small thing is actually a clear departure from 10000000, but there are other more or less incisive new elements overall. However, it is certainly the structure, or the ~outline~ to the actual game phases, which has been most strengthened, starting with the setting: as the title suggests, the task is now to build a boat, starting from a raft until you get to a kind of galleon. Each development of the boat passes through an area, which is equivalent to a level with a series of missions to accomplish: once completed, you will get an expansion of the boat with the addition often of a new crew member. The former are blacksmiths and craftsmen capable of improving sword and stick skills, but others will soon be added, including a beefy figure through which to summon (in exchange for muscles and brains) previously defeated monsters which are nothing more than power-ups that bring with it additional capabilities or greater effectiveness than already existing ones. All aspects that therefore strengthen the original idea of 10000000, with almost always convincing results: it is not a question of forcing, but rather of a coherent and entirely credible expansion of the basic concept. Of course, such a choice inevitably takes away from You Must Build a Boat a good part of the freshness of the predecessor, even more so in the face of a truly ultra-abused basic mechanics in the mobile sector. Obviously, the EightyEight Games product is of a completely different kind than the freemium slots that clog the stores, but the tiredness of the formula also affects the most valid exponents. In the same way, the choice to maintain an identical - albeit very pleasant - graphic style in super minimal pixel art alongside 8-bit chiptune music prevents You Must Build a Boat from offering that minimum of aesthetic variation which would perhaps have contributed to making the slightly cooler experience.", "date": "2015-06-29", "grade": "8.0"}
