In the world created by Gearbox, however, we know that nothing is really normal: therefore, the DLCs that are part of this series are not limited only to adding new missions, scenarios and weapons, but enjoy parodying the holidays coinciding with the their exit period. Therefore, if the previous T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest in October had a setting clearly inspired by Halloween, here The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler pays homage to Thanksgiving by putting the protagonists on the hunt for a terrible giant turkey... Quality television In addition to an almost unpronounceable title, The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler also stands out for the return of one of the most beloved characters of Borderlands 2, namely Mr. Torgue. We find him as the presenter of an unlikely reality show in which the contestants must try to kill the infamous war turkey, a huge beast that has never been subdued by any opponent. Just as the crypt hunter is about to participate as a new challenger, Mr. Torgue reveals to him that the show has been rigged by the producers who have altered the creature to the point of making it almost invincible: it will therefore be the protagonist's task to put an end to this scam, finding a weakness in the turkey and exploiting it to get the better of it, all under the guidance of a Mr. Torgue eager to eat it. If the premises of this DLC are bizarre even by the standards to which Gearbox has accustomed us, the performance of the enterprise is no less so: in fact, we immediately find ourselves in the kitchens destined to prepare the feed for the turkey, committed to fighting against cooks and the like. This is the umpteenth reskin of enemies already encountered millions of other times on Pandora, but the final effect is one of the most successful of all the expansions released so far, thanks to funny opponents both for their look and for the names they bear (one above all: Gouda Ramsey). Between a shooting and a collection of loot, there is even time to see a reference to The Hunger Games, given that at a certain point in the quest, Tributes from different villages of Pandora begin to appear, more formidable opponents than the norm and which can give a fair amount of trouble. While not boasting a particularly large size, therefore, the map that hosts The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler certainly offers a good density of clashes and a couple of weapon crates capable of giving away interesting equipment, two elements that alone would be enough already to justify the modest outlay of money necessary to purchase the expansion. The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler is cheap and short-lived, but it's a lot of fun Long live grandma The war turkey is also a very respectable boss, also considering that he is surrounded by a whole series of Tributes who are firmly intent on complicating the life of the crypt hunters: an attractive challenge for the most savvy players, who certainly won't let them escape the opportunity to face the encounter with three other companions in order to maximize the difficulty and the rewards derived from victory. Completed the main quest, then, The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler closes in style with one of the side missions at the same time the most absurd and ingenious that have ever been conceived by the designers of Gearbox. We must therefore speak to Mrs. Flexington (Mr. Torgue's grandmother, different from him practically only in hair and clothing) and simply be able to get to the end of her story, a very long story without rhyme or reason seasoned with a whole series of digressions and forgetfulness typical of senility. Without wanting to run into spoilers, let's just say that the reward you get at the end of this great test of patience is one of open-stage applause, not to mention the fact that a second sub-quest categorized as raid difficulty is later unlocked which foresees having to listen to an even more lasting and convoluted rant than the previous one. In short, it is the worthy culmination of a DLC that is undoubtedly worth the money it costs, capable of entertaining both for its playful characteristics and for a good number of truly successful humorous situations. Sure, in two hours you can easily see everything the expansion has to offer, but for Borderlands 2 fans who still haven't let go, it's a purchase to be seriously considered.deration.", "date": "2013-12-02", "grade": null}
