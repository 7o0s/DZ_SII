{"name": "Principio d'inerzia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/132935-pixeljunk-shooter-ultimate-principio-dinerzia.html", "text": "The name ~PixelJunk~ can take on various meanings for video game enthusiasts, given that Q-Games has declined its franchise over the years in different ways, exploring all the possibilities that the two-dimensional context still offers. In the case of PixelJunk Shooter and PixelJunk Shooter 2, the form is that of a twin analog shooter in which, however, the firefights are only one piece of a larger puzzle, in which exploration is the master and one enters in often inhospitable scenarios, with interactive walls, diamonds to collect, scientists to save and enemies to eliminate. All from the point of view of an inertial system that renders the physics of the spacecraft we control very well, as well as the fluids and gases with which we will often have to deal. For the creation of PixelJunk Shooter Ultimate, which marks the debut for the series on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, with a product that can also be downloaded for free by PlayStation Plus registered users, Double Eleven has seen fit to act in a different way than traditional canons and then ~merge~ the two episodes into a single, engaging adventure. No chapter selection in the main menu, therefore, but a campaign that includes all the levels of both games in a sequence seasoned with various improvements and optimizations. PixelJunk Shooter Ultimate seamlessly blends the two installments of the series and brings them to Sony consoles The hard life of the scientist In the first part they wait to be recovered from the thousand dangers of increasingly impervious settings, in the second part they even find themselves in the body of a huge monster. We are talking about the scientists that in PixelJunk Shooter Ultimate we have the task of recovering, grabbing them with the ~grappling hook~ that our ship is equipped with and trying not to kill them by mistake, since there is a maximum number of collateral victims that we can make before incurring game over. Saving these tiny characters allows you to access the next stage, but often completing this feat is not very simple, given that enemies lurk nearby who release lethal lava flows, shoot projectiles of various types or directly try to devour the unfortunate. We will therefore have to be quick, identify the scientists and do our best to bring them home safely, while trying to find the precious diamonds which, in a certain quantity, can open the doors to the final phase of each chapter, bosses attached. The mechanisms that regulate the gameplay refer, as already mentioned, to an inertial context that is perfectly in line with the dual analog stick controls, responsible for determining the movement and direction of the vehicle according to various degrees of progression. The activation of fire with a right back button and of the grappling hook with the left exemplify in this sense an idea of great simplicity and immediacy, however absolutely not to be confused with the lack of challenge, especially in the more advanced levels and when you want to complete the missions at 100%. To make the experience more multifaceted, there are also the various power-ups, which now allow you to use jets of water that solidify the lava, now to emit the same magmatic liquid to melt walls of ice, or even to enjoy a barrier that it protects from otherwise lethal levels of heat for the spacecraft, as evidenced by the indicator located at the bottom of the screen, which we can only restore by finding a quick source of cooling. Playstation 4 trophies PixelJunk Shooter Ultimate contains twenty-seven Trophies, not all of which are easy to obtain. In fact, we go from the most trivial achievements, linked to the completion of missions or the totalization of certain numbers in terms of killings, to the ~specialized~ ones, which ask to access all the secret areas and, above all, to compete online in various ways. The definitive version We played PixelJunk Shooter Ultimate on both PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4, as the title is available in cross-buy for the two platforms. You can carry on the same game using the cloud save in an almost automatic way, but the experience appears different in many ways: on the Sony portable console, the presence of short analog sticks unfortunately poses a major limitation for the precision of the fire, and forces you to make dynamic aiming adjustments by directly moving your ship during an attack. We also notice longer loads, especially the initial one, and the graphics clearly boast lower quality, running at 960 x 544 pixels and 30 frames per second instead of 1080p and 60 frames per second.second guaranteed on PlayStation 4. In addition to the purely technical aspect, on the flagship console the DualShock 4 guarantees extraordinary precision and allows approaches that appear practically impossible on PS Vita, even lending itself to speedruns such is the reliability of the sticks and the responsiveness of the controls in general. In both cases, asset optimization work was carried out which led to many scenarios appearing sharper, as well as a general improvement in the yield of liquids and gases. The sound accompaniment remains excellent, with its beats and great care for the sounds, especially appreciable when wearing a pair of headphones or using good earphones. An attempt has even been made to make a multiplayer mode more attractive with cross-platform which, however, remains accessory to the campaign, and which when played online gives some trouble in terms of matchmaking and lag.", "date": "2014-06-09", "grade": "8.2"}
