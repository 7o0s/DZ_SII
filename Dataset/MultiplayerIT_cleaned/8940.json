Simulators? Done. Arcade? Done. Road battles? Done. Acrobatics? Done. Masterpieces? Done. Ciofeche? Done too much. Racing on tracked rosaphants? Not yet, but it will be Game of The Year when it happens. In the midst of this metallic expanse full of rumbles and virtual gasoline, the Need For Speed series has always stood out more or less thanks to its exhilarating gameplay and the ability to reinvent itself. The latest titles of the Electronic Arts brand have had good success, and have proved to be products of excellent quality. EA could have continued on that path, but decided to shuffle the cards a bit and come up with something new, a more cinematic game, with a blockbuster story and, blasphemy, playable moments off the machine. The new born is called Need For Speed: The Run, and has been entrusted to the expert hands of Black Box, a studio with a respectable curriculum that has given us many of the most successful titles in the series (including the unforgettable Underground). Optimism, to tell the truth, was not sky-high for this project, if only because the ~on foot~ sessions almost immediately turned out to be simple quicktime events, where all that is required of the player is to press a button every now and then to advance the action. Placing such an unoriginal novelty as the turning point of the title was certainly not a very smart move, and it initially lowered our expectations. Nothing particularly serious however, since in the end what really matters in games of this type is the gameplay and, given the pedigree of the developers and the history of the series, at least that promised well. Our job today is to tell you if this ride is worth the ticket price, or if you would have been better off taking the bus. Red, Yellow, Green... let's go! Vin Diesel vs Medioman Need For Speed: The Run puts you in the role of Jack Rourke, a master racer in trouble with the underworld, who finds himself tied up in a Porsche about to be scrapped. As expected, ours manages to slip away at the last moment and, since narrowly escaping death just once a day is not enough for him, he thinks it well to contact his old friend Sam Harper to get some ~job~. Sam wants to go big this time, and offers Jack the chance to participate in an event called The Run, an illegal race between 250 riders that crosses the United States and whose winner will be given 25 million dollars. No rules, no scruples, starting from last position, police chasing the whole time and, of course, the two guys who had tried to turn Jack into a pancake at the beginning of the game among the participants. How to refuse? It's clearly not a Nobel literature story, but for a title of this type it works. Too bad that the characters in the game are of an unspeakable flatness, and that the narrative really leaves a lot to be desired. Jack, in particular, is one of the least charismatic men in history. We don't pretend that the main character is an unforgettable hero all the time, but a little more verve here wouldn't have sucked. In general, the plot will give you less than zero, and you will limit yourself to advancing race after race without caring about the motivations of the protagonists. A missed opportunity. The positive side is that this kind of premise gives developers the opportunity to use the USA in its entirety to create the tracks and, given the variety of landscapes and situations that can be devised with so much material, it is good and right. The Run consists of a series of drag races, from point A to point B. Usually it involves overtaking a fixed number of opponents, but time trials and elimination races also appear in the events. However, the differences are rather marginal, and in each stretch you will do nothing but hurtle like bullets to the final destination. Said like this it may seem boring, yet the developers have given their best in this field, and the various phases of the coast to coast are truly spectacular. You will find yourself escaping from very aggressive policemen aboard supercars and helicopters, dodging landslides and avalanches, crossing very busy city areas, and so on and so forth. The choreographic moments are many and well thought out, to the point of making the campaign really fun, despite its shortcomings. Occasionally the aforementioned quicktime events break up the action, but they are very few and don't spoil the experience excessively. Their introduction is objectively quite useless. I'm going foooooooooooo The flagship of the seriesand Need For Speed is its speed. The Run is no less than its predecessors, and offers a series of very powerful racing cars with which to hurtle through the streets of America. The gameplay is simple and effective typical of the saga, with the ever-present nitro for crazy accelerations and an impressive sense of speed aboard the most expensive cars in the world (among which there are also carbon dreams such as the Pagani Huayra and the Lamborghini Sesto Element). By completing races you level up and gain new abilities, including the ability to ramp up your nitro faster with reckless maneuvers and the ability to use your opponent's slipstream to dash alongside. The physics of the accidents is spectacular, perhaps not at the level of the latest Burnouts, but certainly impressive. Minor damages do not worsen the vehicle's performance and the most functional technique remains that of the ~catch~ in the race against the computer, therefore, if you love dirty play, you are at home. However, brutal clashes will force you to reset the last checkpoint with the help of a curious rewind mechanic, which facilitates the completion of the most chaotic levels. The charges of the reset are limited, decrease with increasing difficulty, and allow you to get more experience points if not used. They should therefore not be used in bursts. In addition to the single player campaign, the game features various challenge modes, which are nothing more than additional challenges on the sections of road previously addressed. These challenges are used to earn medals and of course to get big with your friends through the now inevitable Autolog and extreme spam on your wall. The outstanding Electronic Arts statistics comparison platform specifically dedicated to its driving titles and born with Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit returns with force and with some minor additions also in The Run. The entire single player campaign is strongly intertwined with the feature and allows us to see our position at the end of the race compared to those of our friends. But not only given that in the middle of the race the overlays will give us at a glance the times made by the other players in individual parts of the track, so as to stimulate both replayability and the hard decision on whether or not to use a rewind to maybe face better a badly set curve. In terms of classic multiplayer, the title allows sixteen contemporary players to tackle most of the tracks already seen in the single player in simple classic or elimination races. In this sense, we note the lack of game modes that are certainly more engaging and new than what was seen in the single, such as for example team races with cops against thieves given that the differentiation is resolved only in the classes of cars that can be used to participate in the competition. In part, this rather basic offer is compensated by the possibility of playing the challenges mentioned above in multiplayer which in some cases allow less experienced players to achieve certain secondary objectives by collaborating with each other. The whole system is in fact based on rewards and prizes that can be collected not only by reaching the podium but also by earning medals during the race and even through random draws among the participants. In short, everything is in the name of maximum usability and in this sense the use of the rewinds is exemplary, which become in all respects real respawns that can be used in a limited way during the competition. Playstation 3 trophies The game offers 37 trophies of which 2 gold, 24 silver and 10 bronze, in addition to the inevitable platinum. The gold ones concern the completion of the single player campaign and the victory of the trophy itself during the multiplayer random draw while the silver ones are related to the completion of the stages and some challenges. Finally the bronze trophies are unlocked by gaining levels as a driver. Missile! Missile! No, it's a BMW... The graphic engine used for Need For Speed: The Run is the all too praised Frostbyte 2, already used for Battlefield 3. With such a potential behind them, the Black Box guys have indulged themselves, and have created locations of all kinds, some of which (especially the snowy ones) of quality. The cutscenes are also beautiful, very well animated. Excellent display of programmers' skills, but not flawless. Inexperience with the engine has in fact led to some imperfections, including pop-in phenomena, textures that are sometimes poorly defined, some flickering too many, and rare occasional crashes. Nothing that spoils the experience too much either way. The sound is successful, with good voice acting and absolutely epic music. The soundtrack greatly enhances the gaming experience and,even if certain themes are repeated several times, they are so galvanizing that they are always welcome. For lovers of customization we have bad news. In the Run you will not be able to modify the cars at will as in many other titles of the genre. Each car has three or four fixed bodies, with predefined color schemes. Both the bodies and the colors are often beautiful, but those who love to waste hours remodeling their four-wheelers will be disappointed. Another neo is the artificial intelligence, which does not shine for skill and is challenging to beat only for the superior performance of the opposing cars. In certain events, then, the behavior of the computer even seems scripted, because after a reset it happens that the computer reuses the exact same strategies or makes the same mistakes. Cortina the main campaign, which takes between five and six hours. However, the multiplayer, the challenge mode, and the various goodies offered by the Autolog increase it considerably. Provided that the style of play takes you enough.", "date": "2011-11-15", "grade": "7.8"}
