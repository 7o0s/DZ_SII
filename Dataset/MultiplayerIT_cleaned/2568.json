{"name": "Hitman - Pagato per uccidere", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hitman-pagato-per-uccidere.html", "text": "An alter-ego with a heavy hand Let's start the review by declaring what is a sacrosanct truth, Hitman - Paid to kill makes you feel bastard inside; maybe it makes you understand that deep down you were already a little bit. How else to explain the sudden change of personality of three honest gamers for passion? (For the respect of the law on privacy I will limit myself to saying that, in addition to the Orion present here, the other two rhyme with Carducci and Spartak). Peaceful people turned into professional killers exchanging advice on how to kill others... of course we all know that it is a video game, but my dears, I haven't had some satisfactions for a long time! How do we want to define this game? In my opinion ~assassin life simulation~ is just fine. We know little about the plot (and little need to reveal) but that's enough for us. You play the typical laboratory experiment, the perfect killer. But who did this to you and why? We don't know, but a clue could be the barcode nicely stamped on your coppino, who knows... Sure, you realize by yourself that you're quite good at your ~uncomfortable~ job. And so, within a year of your escape from the laboratory, you are in the pay of a powerful organization, as an assassin for hire. And it is precisely on this simple mechanism that Hitman is structured. Missions (commissions) assigned with precise instructions and you are not required to ask yourself questions: there is a dirty job to be done and someone has to do it, and that someone is you. The offender's family jewels After an exhaustive briefing which will explain the objectives to be achieved (the mythical description of the target, accompanied by identification microfilm) we move on to the purchasing phase. In fact, for each mission you are called to choose suitable equipment, or that simply suits you best. But be careful, payments are made in advance and expenses are excluded... so if you want to be like little Schwarzeneggers, pay out of your own pocket! Certain missions involve the use of special weapons, without which it would be very difficult to get out alive, so it is strongly recommended to almost always keep the set of weapons suggested by the picc. There are for all tastes, however, and all real or rather faithful copies of the real counterpart. So you have different types of pistols (Beretta, Magnum, etc), machine guns (UZI and similar), the useful sniper rifle (placed in a briefcase, when you use it you will see the protagonist assembling it and getting ready) and the legendary shotgun. But when discretion is the order of the day be ready to draw the knife or the tremendous and dreaded piano string... when you use it you will feel the bastardy flowing copiously inside you. The bandit's walks Once this is done, you are ready to go into action, 1.90 meters of ~killer baldness~ that roams the streets in search of prey. Already from the first levels we realize another reality: Hitman is damned difficult, and for this fascinating. You'll have to expose yourself as little as possible to danger otherwise it's certain death, mathematician. You are always in the minority first of all and any mistake in your actions will make the enemy suspicious (the classic ~surveillance~) who will call for reinforcements and begin to beat all the alleys inch by inch, making you go from hunter to prey. In this regard, I would like to point out that I literally covered myself in cold sweats the moment in which I resolutely approached the driver of a Chinese mafia boss behind and, after choking him with a piano string, I took care to put on my clothes and dragging the corpse into the sewers to avoid detection and raise the alarm. Sensation, to understand, to the ~Commandos~ remember? Here, lived first hand in the lair of the enemy. There are many ways to accomplish a single mission, it's up to you to decide which is the ideal method to settle your affairs by bringing the hides home. A piece of advice, don't think of passing to the next level the first time around, impatience is a bad adviser. Instead, spend some time observing your surroundings, look for hiding places, follow passers-by and study the surveillance route, sneak unseen into dark corners, dress up (possibly not as Mr. M, it would be a bit out of place ) and pass under the noses of the guards ... and a thousand other strategies. All aimed at your goals and the subsequent escape to the meeting point to safety. Intriguing right?The banging of the hit man Kill, hide, hide the corpses, disguise yourself... what an effort! Don't worry, by pointing at an object you will automatically see the suggested action at the top of the monitor. Let's say you just killed a guard, you bend over and you see ~Take the clothes~, press action and put them on, now bend over you see ~drag~, press action again and you will grab. the body to hide it. One key, all actions. In addition, different objects such as elevators for example have multiple actions. In this case, right click, small Up-Down menu and it's done. Also (I will never get tired of repeating it) equip yourself, if you don't already have it, with a wheel mouse. You'll be able to quickly scroll through your inventory of items, including weapons, and when things get tough, being quick to get your weapons out is key. The look of the killer Graphically we are not at excellent levels, but in this game you will still find something to please you, in the sense that if on the one hand many textures are ugly, on the other hand we can sneak into every corner or closet, see objects around us and interact with them. Connecting to this, I would like to point out that the animations are fine, everyone moves or acts exactly for what they are doing. Even a corpse does not magically turn into a wooden log, but is inert and ~tossed~ if dragged over uneven ground. I don't point out any particular hardware requests, except for a good graphics card, which can compensate for the paucity of textures for a moment. The killer's rest However with Hitman it's safe, and you'll stay busy enough to feel like a graduate assassin, since each mission is a challenge and has a depth of its own. If you have seen the film Lon 200 times, if you have consumed the Nikita film, you will go to sleep with the Hitman CD-ROM. Sweet dreams and... watch your back! The sniper's parlor ~Dad Dad, tell me about when you were young!~ ~Heh heh, really...~ ~And what's that tattoo on the back of your head?~ ~Ah, that...well, it's a long story...~ ~Eddai, I've already done my homework!!!~ ~Mmm..all right, sit here and I'll tell you...~ Ladies and gentlemen, it would also be worth listening to what our hypothetical dad Hitman has to say (always assuming that he could become one... and that the the undersigned continues to believe that he is sane after writing certain things like this). This time we're dealing with a truly spectacular big title, part of one of my favorite ~categories~ of games, or those that amaze you when you least expect it. When you hear little about them around and once you try them you wonder why they didn't get space on the covers of magazines as much as much more trumpeted titles left and right and maybe less deserving.
