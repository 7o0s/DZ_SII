{"name": "Marvel: La Grande Alleanza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/marvel-la-grande-alleanza-4.html", "text": "History! Punctuated by numerous animated sequences, at least half of which of extraordinary workmanship, the story behind The Great Alliance sees most of the super-villains of the Marvel universe come together under the command of Doctor Doom, to give life to a diabolical plan that could put at risk not only the planet Earth, but the whole of reality. While Destiny's troops attack SHIELD's flying headquarters, Nick Fury (the organization's commander) contacts the most powerful superheroes to help him deal with the threat. This is how the Grand Alliance is formed, in fact the only force capable of thwarting Destiny's conquest plans. The game Marvel: The Great Alliance offers a single game mode, which however can be tackled in different ways and which gives access to numerous challenges, in fact self-contained minigames. The game mechanic is identical to that of X-Men Legends (and to that of the recent Justice League Heroes), so you have to form a team of four characters and complete each stage in the best possible way. In the game you are in command of one of the four heroes, but you can use the other three as you like and by simply pressing a directional key, without going through a menu and therefore without taking away even a bit of the rhythm of the action. indeed opening up to situations in which you can instantly abandon a character thrown against a wall and attack the responsible enemy with a partner. It starts from a control point (initially the SHIELD outpost) where it is possible to dialogue with different characters and set off on a mission. Most of the dialogues have a purely accessory value (usually information about the background of the various superheroes), but in some cases talking to someone can lead to the determination of an optional mission objective, to be completed together with the main ones . Once the members of the team have been chosen, it is time to go. Each stage contains a variable number of enemies, and as you progress their danger grows, as well as the differentiation of the ranks: at the beginning you only have to do with sad henchmen (moreover robotic), following the front lines you they will accompany reinforcements of a certain level and, of course, real super-villains. The latter, who play the role of boss in the game, generally face each other in the most classic way, that is, by beating hands and perhaps helping each other with a pinch of petty strategy. In some cases, however, when the enemy is too big or too powerful to be fought normally, you have to try to survive and, at the right time, resort to techniques of dexterity and timing. No pain, no gain Ultimate Alliance is not an action game for its own sake, but it does boast some RPG elements. Apart from the question of the dialogues, already illustrated, each character has numerous characteristics that can be improved by spending the money collected in the stages. In this sense, the section dedicated to super powers (which can be accessed just like in X-Men Legends and Justice League Heroes, or by calling up an interface by holding down a back button) is automatically enhanced by default, but it is possible to act manually to go and improve the powers that we consider most useful or that go best with our way of understanding the game action. Beyond that, there is a section with three characteristics relating to the current ~form~ of the superhero, affecting his ability to deal damage with normal attacks and powers, as well as his resistance to hits and the ability to regenerate lost energy. This is perhaps the most innovative element of The Great Alliance: each character does not simply have alternative costumes (which draw on the classic Marvel universe as well as the Ultimate one), but real different versions, which must be strengthened individually and which is possible unlock by earning experience points but also by completing minigames. In this sense, it is obvious that the most used characters are also the ones that ~grow~ the most, and it is nice that the game recognizes the formation of really existing teams (the X-Men, the Avengers, the New Avengers, the Fantastic Four ), rewarding the choice with bonuses. Multiplayer and minigames Great importance has been given to multiplayer, which in the game is very flexible (it is possible to add or remove a player at any time) and which gives the possibility of engaging in epic raids for four participants. The difference compared to the single game is abysmal: in two or more players it is possible to plan attack strategies and take care of the bosses in an intelligent way, perhaps alternating attacks from afar and up close, lessthree in single you have to count on the not very clear artificial intelligence of your teammates. The multiplayer can be of the cooperative or ~arcade~ type, and in the latter case as many characters are used as there are players, in a sort of competition to see who scores the most points. Finally, the minigames: these are self-contained challenges whose completion is generously rewarded with bonuses and alternative costumes, and which are made available as you progress through the game. They actually represent an added value, much more than the appreciable images, filmed sequences and action figures... Crossroads and crossroads During different phases of the game you will find yourself in the position of deciding what to do, or you will have to give up completing certain objectives for various reasons. These choices will eventually weigh on the goodness of the final result, determining a possible partial completion of the game and opening up various possibilities to play it all over again. Then there are the cameos and touches of class, such as when your characters will have to try their hand at the Pitfall coin-op to continue the adventure... Technical features Marvel: The Great Alliance boasts a large number of states (there should be fifteen, plus the various equally playable control points and minigames) and excellent polygonal constructions for characters and locations. The graphics engine manages to move everything at a fixed 30 fps, apart from rare cases, maintaining a good level of detail and presenting excellent special effects (the fire is very nice). All next-gen console versions boast two more characters (Lunar and Colossus), but on Wii there are also extras regarding the control system, entrusted to the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination. If the basic attack is performed by pressing the A button, in fact, by moving the controller in the various directions it is possible to perform particular moves, which have the ability to stun or throw opponents into the air. On the Nintendo console, even the use of super powers is entrusted to the movements of the Wii-mote, but (fortunately!) the developers have seen fit to leave the player the option of choosing, allowing the activation of the powers even by simply pressing of a button. The music is really well made and gives the action an epic and engaging flavor, sinning only in some cases (when a scene is associated with a very unsuitable musical theme, for example) and in particular in the rare cases where, due to a probable bug, the soundtrack falls silent. The textual localization in Italian is almost perfect, and it is really a pity that Activision did not want to invest in a product of this appeal with a localization of speech as well, which is instead present (albeit of fluctuating quality) in Justice League Heroes. On the other hand, the Italian version of the game has been enriched by a cover signed by Gabriele Dell'otto, as well as some bonus illustrations by the same designer, who has been with Marvel for some years now. Comment Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is truly a great game, certainly the best comic tie-in ever and one of the best products currently available for Wii. It really has a lot of substance and reserves many surprises, which together with its RPG elements and the possibility of ~growth~ of the (many!) characters give it a high degree of replayability, which is really rare nowadays. This Wii version does not disappoint even from a technical point of view and boasts solutions that are both innovative and conservative as regards the control system. Ultimately, we are faced with a very accurate product in its many facets, with a noteworthy plot and an exciting cooperative multiplayer, which knows how to give emotions after emotions especially to those who know the Marvel characters. If the combat system had been a little less ~slippery~, we could easily have spoken of a small masterpiece. Pros: Long, substantial and replayable many times Excellent graphics Exceptional cooperative multiplayer Cons: A bit ~slippery~ combat system Some (obvious?) imbalance between the characters Lack of speech in Italian After the two episodes of X-Men Legends, there was great anticipation for the new title developed by Raven Software, especially since its peculiarities were revealed. Marvel: The Great Alliance, in fact, stands as the most important Marvel tie-in ever, with its twenty-three usable superheroes (twenty-five on Wii, Xbox360 and PS3) in a context that has something like a hundred total characters. Even something more.", "date": "2007-01-18", "grade": null}
