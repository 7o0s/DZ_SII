{"name": "Donkey Kong Jungle Climber - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/donkey-kong-jungle-climber-recensione.html", "text": "In 2005, a small, cute platform with relatively innovative game mechanics made its appearance in the well-stocked Game Boy Advance playroom. Most likely, a game like Donkey Kong King of Swing would have aroused very little fanfare if it hadn't come out with the support of Nintendo and one of its historic characters, and that would have been a pity: the gorilla was controlled almost exclusively with the console's back buttons, which were used both for movement and, pressed together, for jumping, and above all for hanging from one of the grips with which the game worlds were dotted. In practice L controlled Donkey's left hand, and R the right: hanging with one hand, the ape rotated clockwise or counterclockwise and then jumped when the button was released, with both instead he remained stationary. The result was an extremely pleasant and ~fresh~ game, except for a level design that didn't fully exploit the occasion and ultimately made everything a bit repetitive. Donkey monkey Two years later Nintendo and Paon are back ~on the scene of the crime~ with DK Jungle Climber, this time for DS, which in terms of basic mechanics does not differ from its predecessor at all, but it presents an abundance of additions and improvements for a experience that finally becomes complete. The development team's intention to create something much more substantial is clear from the outline aspects: the plot is a demented sequence of absurd events, but provides for the presence of all those characters, from Diddy Kong to Cranky, who have helped the ~rebirth~ of Donkey Kong at the time of DK Country, and moreover introduces new ones, always quite improbable. The cut scenes are simple, but are represented, during the dialogues, in excellent polygonal graphics; moreover the dialogues themselves are extremely silly and funny, Donkey is even more stupid than usual and in general, for the atmosphere itself when not for a real joke, it will not be uncommon to play with a beautiful smile on his face. During the actual game phases, however, the true 3D graphics give way to a ~fake~ 3D, which is not a little reminiscent of the rendered characters and backdrops of the legendary and aforementioned Donkey Kong Country, where King of Swing attempted a completely different approach, much more cartoon-oriented. See how I rock! If there are many innovations in terms of presentation, it is however when it comes to gameplay that Jungle Climber seriously shows itself off: the concept, as we said, is substantially identical, but the control is improved both in terms of sensitivity and readiness of the answer, both for the actions that Donkey can perform. Now Mario's historic pet ~pet~ can attack enemies with the pressure of A (he thus performs a spinning jump), take Diddy on his back and hurl him in the air to reach enemies and otherwise inaccessible objects, take advantage of some gadgets scattered around the levels (for example the hammer with which to smash barrels and parts of the seabed), take advantage of the classic ~spring~ barrels always from DKC and even use a temporary invincibility which also makes him able to fly! Many more things to do theoretically equals a lot more variety, but all this would be nullified by a possibly flat and monotonous level design. of additions and improvements it presents in quantity for an experience that finally becomes complete See how I rock! Well, you'll be happy to know that this is not the case at all: in fact, each world and each level has a ~theme~, or rather a gimmick or a game concept that they introduce and on which they insist. Thus, for example, we have a level full of mobile or self-propelled grips to be managed in a particular way to make them do what we want, a level full of barrels to be tackled like a puzzle game to find the right path, up to the more classic themes in a platform like that of water, here however revitalized by the peculiar control system. Furthermore, there are many more collectible objects, which give lives, unlock bonus mini-games to be played even separately from the main adventure, give access to ~strange~ tricks and nice easter eggs and above all reveal a secret level for each world, of unusual difficulty for to finish which we will really have to prove that we are, this time, the ~King of Swing~. Higher, higher! However, the main novelty on DS can only be the exploitation of the two screens: the tactile properties of the lower screen in DKJC seem frankly useless, as they will only be used to activate the aforementioned invincibility. Completely different speech for the ~upper screen + lower screen~ combo: the gi areain fact, thanks to the simultaneous use of the two screens, oco develops much more vertically, and the level design and game mechanics follow it perfectly, for example with the apt and positive introduction of Diddy. Furthermore, you will occasionally face very particular levels, where one screen will be the perfect mirror reproduction of the other, and Donkey will only be able to advance when his big hands are firmly gripped both on one screen and on the other. The secret levels, on the other hand, are more often than not real diabolical works Higher, higher! These are among the best moments of the game, to be faced even with a puzzle game mentality, but they are also among the most difficult moments: in fact, in the rest of the levels the greatest difficulty is dealing with a control system that is now much more ready , but always particular and with which you will have to get carried away a little especially if you don't know the prequel. The secret levels, on the other hand, are often and willingly real diabolical works aimed at driving you crazy, and sometimes, unfortunately, they end up in the frustrating, just as frustrating is the fact that even if you lose just one object in a level, to recover it you will have to replay it all from the start, which contrasts with the otherwise well-respected ~hit and run~ philosophy of handheld gaming by autosaves. Not satisfied with all this, Paon has also thought of multiplayer aficionados, who can challenge each other even in four with a single cartridge in the six mini-games to be unlocked during the adventure, among which we point out the speed free climbing competition. Finally, there would be the sound to talk about, but the very fact that at the moment we don't remember even one of the numerous music in the game, despite the many and prolonged sessions, is enough to make us understand how anonymous it is and, conversely, not very invasive. Mission accomplished! After a prequel with excellent premises but a little weak in the long run, finally the King of Swing concept is properly valued in a long, rich, complete, fun and well presented game. Those approaching Jungle Climber must bear in mind a minimum of difficulty in getting carried away properly with the peculiar control system and the fact that completing everything 100% will be quite frustrating, but otherwise the adventure flows away which is a pleasure, among tons of things to collect, constellations of handholds to hang on, various secrets and nice cutscenes. Promoted without delay! Pro Concept finally well exploited Great effort in terms of presentation Long and full of things to do Cons Can be frustrating Totally anonymous sound", "date": "2007-11-09", "grade": null}
