{"name": "Scarabeo Digital - A caccia di parole", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scarabeo-digital-a-caccia-di-parole.html", "text": "Players must therefore try to reach the highest possible total through the value of the individual letters, the length of the words and the bonuses deriving from some special boxes strategically positioned on the game board. The bonuses mainly consist of multiplying the value of a letter or even of an entire word, it becomes very interesting when with a single word you can take advantage of several different bonuses. Even for people less accustomed to the game, the characteristics of the perfect Scrabble player, digital or otherwise, will be immediately evident. First of all, a good - if not excellent - command of the Italian language is required, furthermore a certain mental reactivity is required (in fact the time available is certainly not infinite) as well as a pinch of tactical and strategic acumen to plan the moves in order to maximize the use of bonuses and, perhaps, not make it easier for opponents to compose subsequent words. Anyone who has played the boxed version will not be able to forget the evenings spent arguing about the admissibility of a given word or the meaning - real or not - of any of the acronyms or acronyms with a more or less fanciful meaning, complete with the most sometimes used more as a blunt and offensive weapon than as a real reference tool. Fun beetle Among the novelties of this silicon version of Scrabble, there are the so-called ~Scrabble fun~ modes, which are nothing more than the normal Scrabble played however with alternative dictionaries which, if necessary, also change the value of some letters: from the dialectal, to the Chinese one (where all the ~R~s are converted into ~L~) up to the noble one (where this time the ~V~ will obviously take the place of the ~R~). Especially played against other human opponents, these modes can be surprisingly entertaining. For is better than Uan! Played on the computer in stand-alone mode, the game undeniably loses much of its original charm. Thanks to the fact that it can be played against digital opponents, the off-line mode is reduced to a sort of tutorial for game newbies or advanced and scientific training for true game lovers. In the end, in fact, despite the ten different levels of skill that can be selected for each of the different players guided by the CPU, each game turns out to be a clash with a cold search engine based on linguistic data. Definitely uninspiring. As already written, this game mode is mostly interesting thanks to the different levels of help offered by the program which, at any moment of the game, is able to suggest the word that it would compose in our place: a useful and targeted method to discover words that otherwise would have remained unknown or to learn tactics and ~tricks~ in the field that are always useful for making the most of the 8 letters in our possession. It is thanks to the On-Line multiplayer mode that Scarabeo Digital undeniably offers the best of itself: playable even with a normal 56Kb analog modem, it is possible to get in touch with some of the best Italian Scarabeo players (those who only from the computer). As in the case of Risiko! Digital, EG is proving to believe a lot in this experience and, thanks to the official forums and the conception of ever new game modes, contributes to the maintenance and growth of a large community of Italian players. For is better than Uan! Technically, Scarabeo Digital is almost astonishing. Leaving aside the sound department that will soon make us prefer our beautiful Winamp playlist if not the radio itself, graphically the game appears very accurate, carrying out its task very well and in a very elegant way. Although after just a few games less and less attention will be paid to the game graphics, it is undeniable how the entirely three-dimensional game environment represents an immense step forward compared to the seminal, if not merely symbolic, graphic aspect of the colored Risiko tanks! computerized. Although useless for ~gameplay~ purposes, we will now be able to completely modify the view on a game board that appears decidedly real, complete with palpable and very concrete pawns. In short, perhaps the need was not even felt in a game of this kind, yet we were pleased to notice so much care also in this aspect. If we really want to be picky, perfection would have been achieved with a greater possibility of customizing the various graphic elements: starting from the shape of the pawns up to the colors of the boxes ofi play. Furthermore, given the rather meager audio, we would have particularly appreciated the possibility of listening to (and organizing) our personal MP3s directly within the game. Maybe next time. Comment Scarabeo Digital is not a video game in the strict sense of the term, in the same way judging it with the yardstick used for normal video games would be wrong. Even more than the pluricitato Risiko! Digital, which although a digital version of another very famous board game, lends itself much better to a more purely videogame interpretation. Despite the additional game modes and some other nice additions, Scarabeo Digital must be understood as a new channel for enjoying the boxed version and, as such, I recommend the game unreservedly only to all its fans. Also from this point of view, the lack of a multiplayer mode, perhaps in LAN or in any case without the need to be connected to the Internet, is greatly felt: evidently the need to fight piracy has pushed the developers towards the choice of multiplayer only through official servers . For the rest, if we exclude the graphics, Scarabeo Digital is a game without major surprises. Neither positive nor negative. Pros: Tabletop Scarab Spirit reported in the best possible way, especially in multiplayer Graphically successful (albeit without overdoing it) Cons: In single player mode, not very stimulating Playable with human opponents only via the Internet After the excellent success obtained with Risiko! Digital, Editrice Giochi relaunches its adventure in the world of interactive entertainment and tries again with another classic board game: Scrabble. For those few who don't know it, Scrabble is perhaps the most popular of word games. The game consists in forming meaningful words on the game board  a sort of chessboard  by arranging a series of letter-pawns horizontally or vertically. Just like in the classic crossword puzzle, the words must be readable respectively from top to bottom or from left to right, furthermore the words can (indeed, must) obviously intersect each other. Each letter bears a number at the bottom which determines the value of use, easy-to-use letters will be characterized by a low number while more ~difficult~ letters will be rewarded with a higher value; the ~A~ for example is worth only one point, while the ~P~ three.", "date": "2005-03-09", "grade": null}
