The formula of the game produced by Devolver Digital was in fact simple, immediate but at the same time engaging and intriguing: the story of one's own King (and of all his successors) developed through a series of cards, drawn in a partly random way and which they proposed binary choices in the face of various types of events and encounters with different characters of the court. Thanks to the good success achieved over the months both on mobile platforms and on PC, the arrival of a sequel was therefore rather obvious, and in fact its release was not long in coming.

If they don't have bread, let them eat brioches Reigns: Her Majesty introduces several innovations compared to the original, starting from the protagonist: his alter ego is in fact this time a queen, decidedly more pragmatic than her less charismatic consort. In fact, if the latter appears as a secondary figure, committed more to following his own pastimes than to reigning, it is precisely the sovereign who finds himself pulling the strings of power, often overcoming the distrust and skepticism of the many courtiers. Basically, the game structure is largely identical to the past, with a series of cards that are proposed one at a time and accompanied by a short text: the topics covered are numerous and varied, as are the characters destined to cross paths and influence the fate of the protagonist. In fact, every choice has an impact on one or more of the key elements that determine the continuation of the kingdom: the Church, the People, the Army and Finance. Cutting taxes will improve the consent of the subjects, but could have dramatic repercussions on the royal coffers; for example, facing a conflict would give more power to the army, to the detriment of that of the clergy, and so on. The interesting aspect lies in the need to weigh one's choices in order to try to reach a sort of equilibrium point, in a reference to the Aristotelian maxim ~in medio stat virtus~: the end of one's reign is in fact inevitable both in the case whether the indicators are drained or are completely filled. And so we find ourselves playing the role of one queen after another, trying to extend the duration of the reign as much as possible by weighing each decision. Compared to the first episode, a system of objects was then introduced, to be obtained in particular circumstances in order to then be able to use them to one's liking even in subsequent incarnations: each of them can have particular effects such as to guarantee a ~third way~ in the development of the plot of a card in addition to the two ~standard~ answers, but the experimentation must be done with a certain criterion in order not to unleash heavily negative effects. Another novelty is the presence of the zodiac, since each queen is destined to be born under her own sign: some precise events will only be activated by meeting certain people during the period of a specific sign, a factor which adds a pinch of further variety to the All. Where Reigns: Her Majesty offers the best of itself, however, is in the writing, so brilliant as to make every game and every swipe of a card fun: the characterization of the protagonists is effective and very pleasant, as is the use of an irresistible cynical humor which makes even the macabre death scenes of the poor and unfortunate protagonist hilarious. Everything is then made even more accessible by an excellent translation into Italian, a factor that is anything but obvious given the amount of text present: the total cards have in fact increased compared to the past, now widely exceeding 1000 units. At a retail price of 3.49, Reigns: Her Majesty represents one of the best mobile releases in recent months.", "date": "2017-12-19", "grade": "8.4"}
