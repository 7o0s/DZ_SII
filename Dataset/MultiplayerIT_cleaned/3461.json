{"name": "LEGO Brawls", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lego-brawls-la-recensione.html", "text": "In the intentions of Apple Arcade there is the proposal of solutions and gaming experiences as varied as possible, but honestly we would not have expected to be faced with a Smash Bros. in LEGO sauce, which instead turns out to be the new RED Games title, as we see in this LEGO Brawls review. The idea is therefore simple: let's take the LEGO Minifigures, that is the boundless universe of little men each characterized by their own costume and a typical object and use it all for a competitive multiplayer action game based on arenas. There is a certain logic in all this: a game of this type must be based on many characters with different skills and characterizations, possibly as extravagant as possible. The Minifigures represent a perfect starting point on which to build an army of absurd fighters, especially if you take into consideration the possibility of exchanging individual pieces creating absolutely crazy combinations. As a positive reflection of this basic idea there is also the collecting spirit that emerges, pushing us to play to unlock further objects and customization elements, able to provide a good push to continue. LEGO Brawls allows you to create various characters and choose one of them to launch into battle, within various arena maps made up of platforms on different levels, generally with the aim of maintaining control of a central area, with some variations applied to the theme . The inclusion of the dynamics of the control point determines a MOBA-style mechanic in which the players, divided into two teams, converge on a central area that must be conquered and maintained for the greatest amount of time possible under the control of their team . At the end of the game, established by a countdown, the faction that managed to keep the area of interest under its color the longest wins. How do you keep control of it and ward off enemies? Obviously throwing blows left and right. A constructive brawler The arenas in which the action takes place are made up of platforms, which introduces an almost platform-like mechanic in terms of moving around the map, similar to Smash Bros. but with some digressions in terms of exploration, which becomes necessary for conquer the power-ups scattered around. Moving from one place to another therefore has a strategic nature in the search for the most powerful weapons, but the goal is still the fact of centralizing and going to conquer the central area of the map to take control of it. This convergence on a single point obviously forces you to face the members of the opposing team, engaging in fights that require the use of power-ups previously unlocked by each player: these are objects with very different shapes and characteristics, taken from the LEGO world but with somewhat particular reinterpretations for the occasion, in line with the possibility of customizing the various fighters to the maximum. The ability to play with different elements allows you to radically change the appearance of the characters and select from a range of crazy power-ups, with weapons that include electric guitars, clubs, fish, cake shooters, laser guns and more, as well as bizarre vehicles like hot air balloons or armored hot dog cart tents. The gameplay presents clearly repetitive elements, always focusing on converging in the central part of the maps and beating up the opponents, but the possibility of unlocking new customization elements, the different themes of the settings (the pirate world, the medieval castle, the world of Ninjago) and the sense of competition that comes with 8-player multiplayer keeps things interesting, at least for a good amount of matches. The population of online players is evidently still quite scarce, as evidenced by the fact that it is not always possible to set up a game, therefore long-term support for LEGO Brawls must be evaluated, also considering that the presence of only two modes at the moment, or the Brawl and the training, still makes the contents rather scarce, even if it is assumed that they can be expanded later. One last topic to be explored is that which concerns the control system: like all Apple Arcade games, even LEGO Brawls allows the use of a console controller, which is highly recommended. Although the developers have tried to make the touch screen commands as intuitive and responsive as possible, the controller (in our test we used the Xbox One one) is certainly the best choice for making precise jumps and quick changes of direction, also considering that the competitive actionitiva requires you to defeat opponents in lightning duels.", "date": "2019-10-03", "grade": "7.5"}
