Yet, fortunately for the fans, the prestigious results achieved so far do not seem to have affected the convictions of the developers too much, who indeed spare no effort to give the public an even more complete edition every year than the one that preceded it. From this point of view, we can already tell you that things haven't changed this year either. But if you want to know how and why, then read on. The great basketball of the NBA The game modes of NBA 2K18 are as per tradition many. It is difficult to list them all without going too far into the article, so in this review we will focus on those that we think are the most interesting. For this reason we quickly liquidate the ~exhibition~ modes, Season and My League, which can also be played on the network, then the one called Playoffs, for those who want to start directly from the postseason, and My Team, a sort of basketball Ultimate Team in which to take advantage special credits to build a team made up of current players and legends from scratch, with the novelty of Packs & Playoffs, an online mode where you have to choose a starting quintet and a coach, starting from a specific style of play, and the introduction of a salary cap to prevent abuse of the most powerful cards. More interesting is therefore the Blacktop mode which allows you to play fun matches without excessive frills on street pitches, alone or with real friends, in 1vs1, 2vs2 challenges, and so on up to the canonical 5vs5 match by choosing and customizing parameters such as example the victory conditions (get to 21 points rather than 13, and so on). But the beating heart of the production, as always, remain the modes My GM and My Career. In the first, the gamer is called upon to play the role of General Manager in a team chosen from among those available in the large roster, managing it both administratively and technically. In the role of this executive, you can then organize the technical staff by choosing the coach, the athletes and the talent scouts to unleash around the USA in search of budding young champions, or even establish the team's weekly rhythm by planning the stages of workout or rest. In addition to the normal role of supervisor of marketing, sales and operational activities, the gamer can also devise schemes, strategies and then physically guide the team on the pitch by playing normally. This year the mode is enriched by a sort of story involving the user and the character he created in My Player, complete with interlude skits and other moments off the pitch. Playstation 4 trophies NBA 2K18 offers players 51 trophies, divided into 38 Bronze, 10 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum. The prizes are distributed in the various game modes. There are simple ones, such as bronze which is unlocked in the Play online now mode by beating a Tier 1 team, and more difficult ones, such as those involving completing all objectives in MyTEAM, up to platinum, which is achieved unlocking all the others. The King of parquet In My Player/My Career, the gamer is instead called upon again to play a young talent eager to explode and become a star in the NBA. But this year things get decidedly more interesting, given that you can aim to reach a total level of 99 and that the session is no longer a succession of games interspersed with movies, but allows you to immerse yourself in a sort of open world in which it is possible to interact directly with other players, even real ones, on and off the basketball court. In fact, My Park, Pro-Am and My Career become an integral part of a shared world called Neighborhood Life, broad and varied because it includes a real neighborhood with places to visit. To start, you need to create your own virtual alter ego with the appropriate editor, this year actually rather meager in terms of options. The reason is probably due to the fact that the developers have decided to push the gamer to play the new mode thoroughly, thus motivating him to go to the various shops in the neighborhood, and therefore to ~spend~ VC, the game's virtual currency, to buy gadgets and even new haircuts to customize your virtual alter ego. In this sense, someone accused 2K Games of wanting to force utsenti to resort to microtransactions, also to make life easier, transforming NBA 2K18 into a sort of ~pay to win~ game. In reality, the microtransactions were already there last year and the previous one, and in any case the fact that there is the possibility of buying VC packages with real money to improve the athlete does not mean being forced to resort to this system to make him grow . In any case, once the character's identity, roles and characteristics have been assigned, the mode can be started. In the neighbourhood, the player's virtual alter ego can eat, get a new haircut at the barbershop, get a tattoo, listen to music or redo his wardrobe. Just pay. If desired, he can also improve his attributes by training in the gym, challenging other users on the pitch at the corner of the street or buying ~power-ups~ divided by type, levels of effectiveness and price. Making him grow requires a lot of patience and dedication, since getting experience points for the attribute tags in his possession or Virtual Currency to buy new ones is more difficult than usual, but the satisfaction of seeing him get better and better day after day is priceless. Obviously it's not all pink and flowers: objectively the plot does not shine for originality, but above all we found some interludes and certain characters meaningless and devoid of interest in the narrative context of the story. As far as the playful aspect is concerned, we must report some slight lag during the games, and a crash just before a match where we were guests. But since it happened to us once out of four, we think it was random and we report it for the record. Physical question Closed the large parenthesis dedicated to the aspects related to the modalities, let's finally analyze the playability. In this sense, don't expect any real revolution or striking surprise, but as always more or less evident improvements useful for refining a system that has been based on solid foundations for years and therefore, compared to last year for example, needed a few tweaks. As per tradition for the saga, even in NBA 2K18 every gesture made by the basketball players on the parquet is entrusted more than ever to the skill of the user: it takes a little practice and application to learn the new features and mechanics, and therefore to make the really interesting stuff. Be that as it may, a very few games are enough to notice all those sometimes imperceptible tweaks that are there and make the game more beautiful than the one that preceded it. Starting with a better artificial intelligence, which does not make you cry out for a miracle, but which allows teams to move on the field in a logical and natural way, both in the offensive and defensive phases, reflecting the type of game usually developed by their respective real counterparts . At the level of maximum difficulty there is rarely any blunder due to some limitation of the CPU. To determine the result of a match, the choices of the various athletes in relation to their technical parameters and their personalities, as well as the ability of the coaches to ~read~ the matches, therefore become decisive. Of course, nothing is perfect, after all it is a video game, and we have sometimes noticed some uncertainty on the part of the CPU in making changes, for example, or a certain ease in losing possession of the ball in the scrum. But nothing exaggerated or exasperating. Also thanks to the new system for sliding laterally, useful for trying to limit the pace of the marked opponent, and a good physics and collision management system, the game is able to offer a further degree of realism and consequently to give emphasis on a certain tacticism. The feeling you get from this point of view is that of a greater physicality of the basketball players. Quality that is enhanced by the game especially with pick and rolls and in mismatches, or in the defensive phase, through a better effectiveness of the blocks and blocks. Off-balancing your opponent or overcoming more physical opponents now more than ever requires good timing and a careful assessment of the action in progress, without relying too much on improvisation. Studying the movements of teammates and opponents, looking for the right moment to free yourself from shooting or passing the ball, are always key elements to get to the bottom of many situations. Even if obviously we shouldn't underestimate the classic crazy variable that blows everything up and which is constituted by the Phenomenon of the moment. After all, having a LeBron James, Kevin Durant or a Kyrie Irving on the team makes things a little easier. Each of the most famous athletes are in fact characterized by unique abilities corresponding to those of their real-life counterparts, which allow them to stand outfrom each other on the pitch even in the way they affect the match. Equal to them Similarly, digital athletes mirror the real ones thanks to an aesthetic reproduction that borders on photorealism. The polygonal models of the various Isaiah Thomas and associates are absolutely convincing, from the hair cut to the tattoos, from the proportions to the animations, ever more numerous and capable of making their every movement fluid. The attention to detail borders on the obsessive: many of the athletes, as mentioned before, have custom animations, unique strokes and movements. The skits of the GM mode are more disappointing, where the quality of the characters outside the competitive scene is not the best, and the models of some correspondents and coaches during interviews, who seem too similar to ~puppets~. For the rest, the various arenas give greater strength to the visual impact of the game, with an animated audience that conveys the atmosphere well and that changes its attitude during the match by interacting with what is happening on the parquet (there are even guys who selfies are taken!), on-screen information and cameras adhering to NBA telecasts. And again, introductory and interlude scenes, complete with interviews by David Aldridge with coaches on the sidelines, or in the studio, where the legendary Shaquille O'Neal reigns. In short, the atmosphere surrounding the match event is something spectacular, embellished by an excellently made audio sector and which can count on sound effects, music, announcements and slogans from various championships directly from the various American arenas, as well as the motivating commentary in English, enriched this year by many new phrases, and by a soundtrack mainly characterized by Rap and Hip Hop tunes. In short, as if to further underline the realism of the production, Visual Concepts has also worked hard on the technical sector, improving a product that is already almost perfect in this sense.", "date": "2017-09-19", "grade": "9.0"}
