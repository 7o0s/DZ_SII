And it is an extraordinary coincidence that one of the great protagonists, in this new tranche of episodes, is Alucard, the son of Dracula who - coincidentally! - he's also the character you control in Symphony of the Night, a title in the compilation that dates back to 1997 - indeed, to the PSP port a decade ago - and which many consider to be practically one of the best video games of all time. Leaving sarcasm aside, the choice to also include Rondo of Blood in the package is more surprising, a very rare Castlevania, dated 1993, which represents a fundamental step in the evolution of the Konami series and which very few people have played (legitimately) so far . Would you like to know more? Read on. Rondo of Blood Originally released for PC Engine CD in Japan, Rondo of Blood was the first Castlevania to veer the series towards a new sub-genre that then distinguished it for years: abandoning the linearity of the previous episodes, Rondo of Blood offers various stages that branch into different points, leading the player - who wears the role of Richter Belmont - in different areas which then develop into completely different stages. The peculiar level design structure was meant to be a timid, first attempt to integrate some role-playing game elements into a series that, until then, had been practically a platformer. In the second stage, for example, it is possible to collect a key which then opens a cell where Richter finds Maria, a little girl who will join his cause and become a playable character. These small variables, reminiscent of side quests in today's games, make each game unpredictable, placing the difficulty of the adventure in the player's hands. Rondo of Blood is in fact one of the most difficult Castlevania that Konami has developed. Enemies do a lot of damage and it only takes a few hits to be blown away unceremoniously. The best vampire hunter is the one who studies the stages, memorizes the positions of the enemies and then attacks them in advance, perhaps eliminating them before they identify Richter and attack him. The Belmont on duty can equip a secondary weapon such as the usual crucifixes, holy water, throwing daggers and so on, but each use consumes the hearts that perform the function of ammunition and which the game generously bestows in the various stages. A handful of extra skills - such as the back flip and the super move that changes depending on the secondary weapon selected - complete a nostalgic picture which, however, seemed to us to have aged a little badly. Not on the technical front, be careful: Rondo of Blood is still a title from the early 90s - not to be confused, moreover, with the 1995 SNES conversion, Dracula X - which at the time left you speechless for the care in its realization of the sprites and backdrops and which even today, upscaled to 4k or 1080p and without the activation of any filter to blur the image, is a pixelated little gem, accompanied by an amazing and engaging soundtrack. No, the problem we found in the controls, heavy and less responsive than we remembered, and this clearly made some already difficult passages in themselves much more frustrating. In this sense, Rondo of Blood would have perhaps benefited from some improvements here and there, for example to the menus or the bad translation into Italian, while instead Konami limited itself to doing the homework and converting the game without retouching absolutely anything. Playstation 4 trophies Castlevania Requiem implements a whopping forty-four trophies, including platinum, to be unlocked by playing both titles in the compilation. Considering the difficulty of the two games in question, it goes without saying that unlocking all the trophies will be a titanic undertaking: among other things, you have to complete Rondo of Blood at 100% and Symphony of the Night at 200.6%. Symphony of the Night The adventure of Alucard, the albino vampire son of Dracula, is the absolute protagonist of this compilation, even if it doesn't start in the best way: the grainy full motion video cutscenes betray the age of the game, originally released on PlayStation and Saturn . Also in the case of Symphony of the Night it is possible to choose filters that soften the pixels or that give the idea of playing on a cathode TV, but we preferred to keep the original graphics intact, still simply stunning today. The work done by Konami in '97 with the animations of thethe sprites, the details of the backdrops and the effects in general are simply incredible. Symphony of the Night was the real progenitor of the ~metroidvania~ drift: many titles followed it, especially on Nintendo portable consoles, which evolved the formula in various respects, yet Symphony of the Night remains the most balanced, complete and charming of all. The game is a full-fledged sequel to Rondo of Blood, so much so that Richter and Maria also appear in the adventure: Alucard awakens after a centuries-long sleep and decides to face his father once and for all. Being the son of Dracula, Alucard possesses various supernatural abilities that are unlocked by exploring the castle: among other things, our protagonist can transform into a vampire and fog, throw fireballs and use an avalanche of different weapons which include familiars, edged weapons, thrown weapons and so on and so forth. The free exploration of the castle is marked precisely through the discovery of the relics that unlock Alucard's powers, therefore it happens to come across unreachable areas that we can only access later. Fortunately, the level design distributes the save chambers and teleportation chambers generously and intelligently, allowing you to roam the castle easily and effectively even in the final stages of the adventure. Indeed, Dracula's castle reserves countless surprises and the adventure lends itself to multiple endings, one of which actually opens the door to a second overturned castle to be explored all over again in search of the passage to face the real final boss in the heart of the 'darkness. In short, the longevity of Symphony of the Night is stellar, also because the game hides many secrets and supports a growth system typical of role-playing games: Alucard gains experience points and increases in level, plus he can equip weapons, armor and accessories that change his vital parameters. Searching for the best weapons and equipment, hunting down the enemies who carry it, therefore becomes a game within a game, but it is important to underline that Symphony of the Night promotes more skill than brute force. We could continue to rave about the Konami masterpiece, but we might as well close it here. Indeed no, we forgot another detail: the soundtrack by Michiru Yamane is practically iconic.", "date": "2018-10-26", "grade": "9.0"}
