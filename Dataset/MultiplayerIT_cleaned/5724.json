Thanks to the production costs of projects of this magnitude, but also and above all a trend that has promoted more immediate and less demanding experiences, more suitable for use on the move, developers have preferred to concentrate their efforts on the search for simple and captivating ideas, however framed in the framework of short levels, when not in the random progression of an endless runner. We therefore welcomed the release of Bubble Jungle with interest and curiosity, a completely Italian product that offers a single player campaign (but also playable in online cooperative for four participants) made up of nine different scenarios, divided into 58 vast stages and airy, full of mechanisms that recall some of the greatest classics of the platform genre. The incipit is witty: the protagonist of the adventure, a chameleon named Chuck, is desperately looking for a functioning bathroom, but it seems that there are none around. Sure, imagining a little animal that can't go about its business in a bush is hard, after all the highways are full of people who stop in rest areas to pee, apparently unaware of the existence of service stations. In any case, the narrative expedient counts for little compared to the ambitions of the game, which can be downloaded in the free version (with some advertising and without multiplayer, but completely complete) or pro, the latter at the price of only 99 cents. Bubble Jungle is a real 3D platformer, very colorful and with a very long campaign A thousand bubbles Bubble Jungle's graphics are colorful and fluid, indeed in some cases it's surprising to see these huge polygonal settings that move with such agility on the iPhone 6s screen. Often one gets the feeling that the objects present in the locations have a generic look, but the glance changes a lot from area to area and there are some really nice goodies (the rendering of the swivel in the second world, or the location inspired by videogames 8-bit), along with a good characterization of the protagonist and the many enemies that meet along the way. Sorry for some less brilliant aspects, such as the use of ~normal~ fonts for the titles or animations that are not evident enough to underline the destruction of the crates, but these are things that will be possible to fix with the next updates. That said, the touch control system is almost perfect, with a virtual analog stick on the left side of the display that repositions itself immediately every time we touch the touch screen, guaranteeing great precision, even and above all in the presence of chasms and mobile platforms. On the right side there are two buttons that are used to jump and shoot bubbles, Chuck's only weapon against the enemies that rage within the scenarios. To eliminate them you need to cage them in a bubble, the Bubble Bobble, and touch them because they explode; however the aiming system often forces you to move and retreat before the shot is successful: a lower collision tolerance would have helped. In terms of challenge, the first ten stages are basically a tutorial and completing them is a trivial undertaking, but then luckily things improve and numerous variations on the theme are introduced, such as the use of colors, the limitation of certain skills or the increase in the amount of enemies. The same mechanisms present in the levels recall Super Mario Galaxy stages (see in folding panels) and other famous platformers, as already mentioned. Finally, the sound sector moves between ups and downs: the music is nice but not exactly original (they recall the theme of The Little Mermaid in the Caribbean scenario, for example), while the effects need to be definitely revised.", "date": "2016-02-08", "grade": "7.5"}
