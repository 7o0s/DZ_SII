{"name": "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madagascar-escape-2-africa.html", "text": "Made by DreamWorks in 2005, the first ~Madagascar~ took up the trend of talking animals, so dear to this kind of production, and told the story of a group of animals who live in the New York zoo and who one day decide to organize a little escape to see the city up close. Things don't go the right way, and after wreaking havoc on the streets Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe and Gloria the hippopotamus are put in a container and sent back to Africa. Something happens during the journey, however, and so the various characters find themselves in Madagascar, trying to figure out for the first time how to get food and survive in a hostile environment. On the occasion of the sequel, which will be released in Italian cinemas only in December, the bizarre gang will finally have to deal with the African continent: Alex and the others will meet their own kind for the first time, and will have to understand if the charm of that such a large and wild place will make him forget the comforts of the zoo... Developed by Glu, this tie-in for Java-compatible devices follows the classic rules of platformers and puts us in command of Alex and Marty, switching from one character to the other over the eight stages. The control system is conventional, and sees the d-pad used to move and jump, while the 5 key is used to hit enemies in the case of the lion, to operate certain devices in the case of the zebra. The action is rather simple and linear, even if the developers have tried in every way to make it more varied, adding numerous small or large minigames: when we go through a precariously balanced passage, we will have to balance ourselves by referring to an indicator on the screen, while in some moments we will find ourselves dancing following the typical setting of rhythm games, or by pressing a series of keys in the right sequence. In the more advanced stages, we will also be able to resort to ~stealth~ maneuvers to hide ourselves from the sight of humans, focusing on timing and precision. In short, there is no shortage of ideas in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, even if they are often poorly and badly developed: ideas that deserve more attention are liquidated in a few moments, and the too low difficulty certainly does not help, given that it is possible to finish the I also play the first game if you have a minimum of experience. The combat system, barely sketched, unfortunately suffers from an inaccurate and problematic collision detection, which forces us to approach the enemies in a very precise way, without however these being able to represent a real threat so much are they passive in behavior. Although equipped with the usual essential sound, the game stands out for its very nice and well-designed graphics: the characters are very faithful to those of the cartoon, in certain poses they are really funny and have a large number of animations. It is possible to notice a certain attention to detail, which is evident above all in the quality of the scenarios: in the first stages, even, you can enjoy a parallax scrolling on three levels (which is then abandoned, unfortunately). The interactivity with the locations is good, in particular due to the numerous devices that must be activated during the adventure. PRO Well drawn and animated characters Relatively diverse gameplay Great for the younger ones AGAINST Inaccurate collisions Too easy and short Essential sound", "date": "2008-11-13", "grade": "S.V."}
