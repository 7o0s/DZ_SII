{"name": "Transformers - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/transformers-recensione.html", "text": "Autobots, transformation! The story of the Transformers is known to any Italian male who has ever had a childhood: exiles from the destroyed planet Cybertron, the Autobots roam the galaxy -fighting tirelessly against the Decepticons- in search of a form of energy capable of reviving the their native land; this form of energy is obviously discovered on planet earth and this is how the adventure of the most loved robots ever begins. The story admired in the cinema in the splendid film by Michael Bay partially takes up the original story of the animated series of the Transformers, while keeping its solid foundations intact. The version of Transformers for Nintendo Ds is -as previously reported- actually a double version which, unlike what happens in games like Pokemon, as well as having two distinct covers (one dedicated to the Autobots and the other to the Decepticons) even features two different contents. Although the game structure remains essentially the same, Autobots and Decepticons are robots with different aspirations and motivations, and it is from this element that the Vicarious Visions have started the parallel development of the two games. Depending on whether one or the other faction is chosen, the player has at his disposal: a completely original story mode that follows a very distinct narrative line, the use of robots taken from one faction or the other (to make it simple: the only way to use Bumblebee is to buy Transformers Autobots, on the other hand to use Starscream you need Transformers Decepticons) and above all a whole series of missions in line with the principles of Autobots and Decepticons, or -in order- to preserve and destroy mankind. Combined with the story mode, Transformers (in both its versions) can also be played in both local wireless and online multiplayer, confirming the absolute dedication of the Vicarious Visions to what is the connectivity of Nintendo Ds (Tony Hawk was in fact the first true online game for Ds, beating Mario Kart by a few days). Local multiplayer events can be played by up to a maximum of four players, and are basically of two types: deathmatch and capture the flag. Much more interesting, even if infinitely less interactive, is the multiplayer online mode in which Autobots cartridge owners can challenge the Decepticons remotely: players are called to participate -alone- in particular missions based on time and score variables (one of the typical missions can be: destroy everything you can in a certain amount of time), at the end of the mission the score is uploaded online and is added to all the others obtained by players worldwide who are part of the same faction; at the end of the day, the game calculates the global score, assigns victory to one of the two teams (thus allowing the player to unlock some interesting extras in the game) and renews the battle with a new timed mission. While not representing the classic online section, thanks to AllSpark Wars (this is the name of the mode) the Vicarious Visions certainly cannot be accused of little originality, managing with the few technical means available to create something well done, fresh and decidedly long-lived. Can it be had with leather interior? Transformers on Ds is in fact an action game set in an open world, where following the logical thread of the story the player is assigned a series of missions - more or less consistent with the film - to be completed with his own Autobot /Decepticons or one of the ~famous~ ones. The missions range from moving from one part of the city to another in search of particular elements, characters or other robots, passing through the purely driving sections in car / plane form, and ending up with the classic fist fights between gigantic robots. While the first type of missions does not bring great game elements (if not highlighting the open world structure of the map), the second - linked to the driving sections - is undoubtedly one of the most interesting. In fact, Transformers, keeping faith with the basis of the series, gives players the possibility to scan the vehicles within the map, in order to insert them in the database and be able to use them for any transformations; the player is given complete freedom of movement and choice of vehicle on the map: using the stylus, it is possible to select the scan button located on the touch screen, aim the car as if you were playing with an FPS and wait a few seconds for the database updates with the new vehicle. Nothing easier. The third, last and most exploited one is decidedly worsetype of mission, the one dedicated to fights between robots. Unfortunately, the battle phase represents the real big flaw of Transformers: the controls are imprecise, the robots are not given the possibility of defending themselves (if not by fleeing) and above all everything is limited to a mere continuous and rambling pressing of keys, waiting for your opponent falls to the ground. These shortcomings also turn into evident imbalances in what is the diversification of the enemies that stand in front of us: since there is no real attack and defense strategy, it was also complex for the developers to create a well-defined difficulty curve in able to differentiate the classic fight with a common enemy, from the fight with the boss at the end of the level. The obvious upshot is that the only difference between the two battles is limited to the length of the energy bar of the enemy you are up against. Can it be had with leather interior? In terms of graphics, Transformers is technically impeccable and decidedly well cared for, Vicarious Visions can safely be considered as one of the most prolific and capable developers on the 3D front of the DS, confirming once again that it is possible to develop visually satisfying and fluid games even on the portable console from Nintendo. Particular mention also for the dubbing within the game, really well cared for and well done and which, together with the soundtrack, does justice to the multi-million dollar production represented by the film. Comment While representing an excellent attempt on paper, this Tie-in also struggles a lot to be able to reach the sufficiency and, strange as it may be, manages to do so also and above all thanks to the excellent graphics and sound creation, and to a bizarre but decidedly Interesting. However, the possibility of finding two completely different versions of the same game in your hands will only increase the happiness of Transformers fans. Vicarious Visions lives up to the motto of the robots, There's more than meets the eye, and it's really true this game is much more than it seems! Pros: Two versions, two games with different contents Extensive possibilities for customizing the gaming experience Very original and well thought out online multiplayer Cons: Combat system definitely to be reviewed Camera sometimes too inaccurate The world of tie-ins, it is well known, unfortunately cannot boast a long list of videogame masterpieces. On closer inspection, in this list, it often becomes very difficult to find a so-called ~honest~ game: a product without too many frills and mirrors, fun and able to keep us glued to the pad for something more than a scant hour. And it is in this perspective that the average gamer experiences the advent of the next tie-in, in the hope that the developer on duty has put some love and attention into his product. In this perspective of hope, the double version of Transformers (Autobots and Decepticons) for Nintendo Ds fits in, edited by what can currently be considered as one of the best development studios on the Nintendo laptop: Vicarious Visions (~fathers~ of Spiderman 3 and of the Tony Hawk series on Ds), which, departing from their respective home versions, have preferred to aim for something less stunning in terms of graphics but more profitable in terms of gameplay. The opening question however comes from the Transformers themselves, is there more (or less) than meets the eye?", "date": "2007-08-20", "grade": null}
