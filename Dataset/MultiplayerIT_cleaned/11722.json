The game starring the fallen samurai Jin Sakai is back in a revised and corrected version complete with the DLC dedicated to Iki Island. In our first Ghost of Tsushima review, we awarded Sucker Punch's game, struck above all by the artistic direction which also enhances an interesting and versatile combat system. This reissue leaves the experience and the story unchanged, obviously working on the frame rate and resolution but also by tweaking some small aspects here and there: from a cleaner game menu (which may not be of interest but you can see it at a glance 'eye) until the lock on of the camera, not to forget a greater intensity of colors, the game proves to be the definitive edition of an adventure perhaps not particularly innovative but very pleasant to play. Let's find out about Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut in our review of the PS5 version. 4K and 60fps Ghosto of Tsushima, Director's Cut, Iki Island manages to offer memorable panoramas As mentioned, the aspect that most catches the eye when starting the game, after non-existent loading, is the glance given by the combination of resolution plus frame rate. Ghost of Tsushima was already beautiful to look at in the PS4 version, thanks to the aforementioned artistic sector; the same that here is even more valued, although the differences are not so clear precisely because the basis from which to start was already extremely valid. The eye perceives a greater intensity of the tones, where in the original they gave the sensation of being more washed out. There are no real graphic differences between the two versions, but the resolution obviously makes it appear sharper and cleaner, while the jump in framerate (already appreciable with the original played on PlayStation 5) is noticeable and makes our journey for the defense of Tsushima more fluid and intense especially with regard to the fighting. Even on the normal difficulty level, we still had to spend some time getting used to the flow of battles, especially against some specific enemies. From a technical point of view, therefore, Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut brings the experience a couple of steps higher than the original. DualSense and accessibility Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, the control configuration for left-handed people Still remaining in the technological field, we were struck by the care taken in the DualSense haptic feedback: in particular when in the movies the characters use the katana, pulling it out of the sheath or putting itself in position, the very subtle vibration of the metal that we perceive in the headphones is also accompanied by one by touch. It's hard to find the words to describe it, it would be easier to tell you to try it yourself, but the sensation is that of feeling that same metal under our hands. It is a totally different feedback from the classic vibration due to any weapon, especially melee, and above all it is inserted perfectly. In addition we have resistance to triggers when using the grappling hook, feedback from pebbles when riding along rough terrain and more generally reactions to which they have already been accustomed. The most heartfelt implementation is, in fact, the one dedicated to the blade. In terms of accessibility, Sucker Punch went on to introduce that much requested lock on: in all honesty, while understanding the reason why it was decided to insert it, we find it out of tune. Ghost of Tsushima is a game designed with a certain approach to combat and targeting enemies, and as useful as it may be to have an opponent always under control, during those few minutes in which we played it we had the feeling it was just that of find ourselves using something fake. It is neither useless nor essential, but depending above all on the style of play it could facilitate some clashes, putting a patch on a camera that still remains not without defects. For the rest we find among the new options the possibility of not showing the bow and quiver on the Jin's back but, above all, an inverted command scheme to facilitate left-handed people: all the actions are mirrored, in the command map, so if a right-handed person will perform every action (call the horse, ask for a duel, etc. etc.) with the buttons, the left-handed will be able to do it with the d-pad - and so on for the other commands, including movement that is set on the right analog stick. It's not a lot, talking about news, but we reward the developers' commitment and the consideration on their part of the public and its advice: see the lock on, which, although not deeming it necessary, testifies in any caseor listening to the community. PS4 save import Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, importing PS4 saves is simple but requires some precise steps We also dedicate a few lines to this option: it is certainly not the first game that allows you to import the old version's saves in a simple way but, considering other more cumbersome cases, it is worth noting that Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut allows the transfer of the saves from the initial menu provided you have them in the Cloud and from there you have placed them on the console.

Iki Island and Jin's past Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, Iki Island offers very interesting equipment We now come to the most interesting content of Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, Iki Island. As soon as we reach Act II of the main story, going to the pause menu we will see a new entry in the diary, through which we can follow the mission directives to get to the island. What awaits Jin, once landed, is a constant and brutal confrontation with his past: Iki Island is in fact the place where he lost his father, an event that has haunted him ever since and which will be the basis for his torture inflicted by the Eagle - a mysterious character of the Mongol faction, a skilled potionist who will keep Jin in check during the entire DLC. Narratively speaking we are satisfied with the choice to reconnect this content to the main plot, or rather, to a very important part of Jin, and overall the writing is valid: the first part is the most successful, in the second we find that things are a bit ' too accelerated but still manage to keep a sense, despite the smudges. From the gameplay point of view, the DLC adds just enough: in addition to the island to visit (which takes about ten hours and even something more), we find two new exploration elements, archery challenges and animal sanctuaries. The former speaks for itself, the latter embody Jin's moments of reflection during which he tames wild animals with the sound of the flute in a short mini-game. Then there are the areas to be freed from the presence of the Mongols, to increase our fame on the island, legends to follow to find better equipment (one in particular we greatly appreciated for the setting) and in general small challenges here and there which will enrich our stay on the island without making it feel excessive. Going up and down the Iki Island, whether it's for plot reasons or to explore by following the question marks on the map or any side missions, never weighs thanks, again, to the artistic direction for which Ghost of Tsushima already has shone in its time. Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, we can pet the cats! Also from the point of view of the enemies there is a small update: the shamans are introduced, the real thorn in the side in this adventure. These are opponents who, by singing a chant, influence their allies, making them not only more resistant but, above all, much stronger. Probably not story for players who have completed the game and maxed out Jin. We had a very average character, especially in terms of armor and weapons, and when the Mongols went into this sort of berserk, one blow (perhaps given by wildlings or spearmen) was enough to eliminate them. Considering that the shamans tend to keep their distance but, if reached, they are not defenseless and indeed prove capable of handling a spear deftly, they will really be the main annoyance of our outing to Iki Island. From which, we specify, we will not be able to get away before a certain moment; so when you start it, be sure you want to do it. main plot, without falling into a trivial excuse to add more content. The ghosts of the past are torture for Jin and it's time to come to terms with them. Between ten and fifteen hours of gameplay, new enemies, exploration techniques, mythical stories and equipment (one in particular very good), Iki Island is worth a return to Ghost of Tsushima.", "date": "2021-08-19", "grade": "8.4"}
