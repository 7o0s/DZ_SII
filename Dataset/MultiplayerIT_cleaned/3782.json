{"name": "Assassins Creed Odyssey: L'Eredit della Prima Lama", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/assassins-creed-odyssey-eredita-della-prima-lama-recensione-dlc.html", "text": "Creating additional content for an open world where the limits of the engine have already been largely tested is not exactly a trivial matter ... and with Assassin's Creed: Odyssey Ubisoft has already pushed the boundaries of the hybrid formula of Origins, betting everything on excessive fighting, crazy skills, and the more or less careful use of formulas seen in other similar games (mixed in various ways to add variety to the whole). Making huge changes to the core structure to support extra missions is almost unthinkable, so we approached the game's first DLC called Legacy of the Blade with great calm, expecting a quality ~more of the same~. We were right: the first part of the DLC was not able to surprise us, due to not particularly inspired bosses and a narrative unable to capture us properly; only with the second chapter did things improve, starting to demonstrate the potential of the whole package. Now the third part of the Legacy has finally arrived, called ~Stirpe~, and we have tested and completed it in the Italian headquarters of Ubisoft. It's time to figure out if it's worth jumping into this extra chapter, or if you can easily do without it. The crossroads that was needed We've already talked about Odyssey's narrative, and how it brings about some extremely significant upheavals within the Assassin's Creed mythology, so as to open up new interesting avenues for the future of the saga. Here, The Legacy of the First Blade follows the opposite path, and tries to connect the events of Kassandra and Alexios to the origins of the assassins in a more direct way (indeed without particular panache). It's not an extraordinarily inspired or original story, but it does its dirty duty, trying to insert charismatic characters like Dario and unexpected developments into the events. In short, although at times falling into banality, what happens is enthralling enough to keep the player's interest high, and is a good justification for the unstoppable whirlwind of death that follows the protagonist of the title. More precisely, in Bloodline you will experience a brief moment of peace before having to dive back into the action and have to deal with the usual handful of quests, targets and bosses; but the pace is well managed and things progress without too many pauses, thanks to a very scenic initial phase and a large central block consisting of three main missions that can be tackled in no particular order, before the actual conclusion. Structurally, as mentioned, it would have been foolish to think of tasks that were enormously diversified compared to the basic ones, and in fact Stirpe puts the player in front of some distinctly narrative missions, and a series of rescues, naval battles and group clashes varied only by the enemies used and the location. It works mainly because it is content designed for the end game, with fearsome opponents and more than one challenging fight; the rest of the goodies present all come from the free updates (daily and weekly contracts, general improvements and increase in the level cap) and therefore we do not believe it is appropriate to bring them up when talking about the adventures of Dario and Kassandra / Alexios against the Order. However, it is nice to see how Ubisoft has not limited itself to churning out DLCs, but has also used the time available to file everything else, although certain shortcomings of the title remain. However, let's talk about the bosses, also because once again they are the fulcrum of the experience, and in this case we are talking about two reworkings of the typical battles against elite human opponents. No mythological creatures therefore, only warriors trained with the resistance of a titan, whose identity we do not want to reveal to you to avoid spoilers. These are not the best battles in the game, mind you, but if nothing else they are noteworthy, and if taken as a whole of the three chapters they add up to a good group of fights. The other added value is instead linked to the choices made during the previous parts of the DLC, which lead to significant changes during the narrative despite the game redirecting the player more or less always towards the same path. A simpler route was feasible, but there was a minimum of effort. There is no more to say about Stirpe, just as we believe that it is more or less everything about the Legacy as a whole: this DLC is Odyssey taken to the limit, supported by quite charismatic characters and by the desire to reattach well to the original background. It could have been worse, but we recommend it with reserve, just in case the Odyssey formula hasn't tired you yet.", "date": "2019-03-04", "grade": null}
