Stories in an epic key, or presumed to be such, that tell of a humanity fighting for domination of the universe. The desire to tell this type of story has always been strong and often sufficient to give life to clones or titles whose structure is a pretext to tell a story. Well, this premise, at least in part, also characterizes Tryst. A custom army The title branded BlueGiant is a classic strategy with two factions, one alien and one represented by the ubiquitous humans, who fight each other between scientists to save, bases to conquer and resources to conquer and invest in buildings and upgrades. Scenes already seen and experienced a thousand times by those who play science fiction RTS or by those who, at least, have played Starcraft which is the obvious source of inspiration for the title. Fortunately, Tryst has a peculiarity, even if it is not an absolute novelty, and it is the possibility of equipping the units differently thanks to the Augmentation Research Mechanism. In single player this allows you to tackle some missions more effectively and the possibility of choosing objectives, through some crossroads contextual to the individual missions, further enhances the importance of customization. For those familiar with the genre, the learning curve is almost zero, with few differences compared to the pillars of the genre such as the possibility of regenerating units near special buildings, and there are also the three inevitable multiplayer modes that partially take advantage of the limits of the title returning a rather balanced gameplay. It is precisely in the multiplayer mode that the customization of the units plays a fundamental role, making it impossible to identify the potential of a unit simply by looking at it. Among the other noteworthy features we also find unusable terrain and unsafe areas that force us to take into account what we are trampling on. Nothing new, but it is still a pleasant element which, among other things, gives a pinch of spice to the multiplayer which relies on the three inevitable modes one against one, team against team and all against all with a maximum of eight players. All too classic In the medium called video game the aesthetic result counts, if not in the number of polygons at least in the pleasantness of the lines, and unfortunately Tryst is lacking from this point of view. It starts from the introduction, with three sequences that can be consulted immediately after loading the title that explain the global situation to the player. The idea of proposing the introduction as informative material to be consulted in the role of a commander is not bad but unfortunately the designs and construction leave something to be desired. Moving on to the actual game, we must admit that the lighting is not bad, just as the models of the protagonists of the campaign are not to be thrown away, visibly more refined than those of the common units, but the fluctuating quality of the structures, the meager alien models and the fluctuating animations exacerbate the already unfair gap with the great productions of the genre. Cut animations, unconvincing explosions and various other defects are combined with an English dubbing of an amateur nature, characterized by a marked Eastern accent and seasoned with anonymous music tracks. Fortunately, there are several dialogues, the story is not bad and the crossroads in the missions guarantee a certain replayability, allowing the title to recover something in terms of enjoyment. But the overall duration of the campaign is small and the interlude scenes ugly, with unconvincing shots and rigid camera movements that end up highlighting the shortcomings of the aesthetic sector. Obviously already seen combat mechanics and spartan graphics are not points in favor of Tryst who compensates for his modesty with an affordable even if not small price (24.99 euros). But science fiction and classic RTS lovers could still find what they are looking for in the classic essence of the gameplay, enlivened by the possibility of modifying the units, which does not require major learning efforts and allows you to click carefree for a few hours exterminating enemies.", "date": "2012-09-28", "grade": "6.0"}
