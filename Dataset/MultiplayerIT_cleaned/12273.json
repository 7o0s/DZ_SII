{"name": "Pogo Island - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pogo-island-recensione.html", "text": "Few like in Lost We said there are 5 main Pogo Island games (there are another handful where for example you will have to hit the nails that come loose from the axes, and collect the screws and bolts that fall from the sky in the right bag), and we go to describe below. Few like in Lost Poppit You will have to pop as many balloons as possible among those in the playing area. Similar to a puzzle game you will have a stage covered with colored balloons lined up in columns and rows. Touching a balloon with the stylus will make it pop along with all adjacent ones of the same color. The essential thing to start the chain is that the balloon has at least one equal to its sides. Once the explosions are finished, the remaining balloons will be positioned in place of the exploded ones, until not even one is left, or there are no more possible moves. Tri-Peaks solitaire It is a solitaire where there are three pyramids of cards that must be removed from the structures by playing them over the row of available ones. The cards in the pyramids are all placed on their backs except those free from the others, and in the row only the first rank is visible. Example: the first card in the row is a six of spades, if in one of the pyramids there is a five or a seven (of any suit) uncovered, we remove it from the pyramid and place it on top of the six. Let's say we removed a five from the pyramid, now if there is a six or a four we remove it from the pyramids and so on. As we remove cards from the pyramids we turn and discover the value of the higher ones. If it is not possible to eliminate cards from the structures, one is turned over from the row. If the cards in the row run out before having disassembled the ones in the pyramids, the game is lost. Squelchies Another puzzle game where the stage is covered in columns of beings similar to puyo puyo, pressing the stylus on a column takes an element of one color (or two if they are aligned) and drop it into another column, to match it with other pieces of the same colour. Obviously this will cause the pieces to be eliminated and perhaps trigger a reaction. By removing a certain number of pieces you will overcome the challenge. Phlinx A Puzzle Bobble clone, where you don't have to score by eliminating balls of the same color, but you have to increase the counter of the bubbles that fall from the top of the screen. When you eliminate a series of the same color you will have to make sure that other balls are attached to it and they will fall to the ground. When you have dropped enough of them you will reach the boss, where among the various marbles you will find a huge skull that you will have to remove by making it also fall to the ground. Word Whomp A kind of beetle. There are six letters on a screen that you will need to use to spell 3,4,5 and six letter words. To do this you will select them in sequence and then confirm the word. The game ends when the time runs out, and in the meantime you will have to find as many words as possible with the same six letters that will never be changed throughout the game. It should be noted that the game is not localized in Italian and therefore you will have to play with the English dictionary. The game case boasts the elusive Wifi Connection sticker, which in reality only serves to transfer the tokens you will earn in the game, to an account that you can create your own on pogo.com, and then spend it on site features. If you have some friends, we also point out that you can also play the mini-games in turn (up to 4) to determine who is the king of Pogo Island. Pogo Island, does this name mean anything to you? Let's imagine not, and if we asked you to guess what type of game is hidden behind this title, what would you answer? Would you bet on a Yoshi-like platformer, a Broken Sword-like graphic adventure, or something similar to Harvest Moon? It would be ~water~ anyway, Pogo Island is a (mini) collection of minigames. Comment Pogo Island is a gross product. The idea of creating something easy and quick to play is fine, but this does not mean that you can pack a product with 5 minigames, not even particularly original ones, and throw it on the market at full price. The same games can also be found online for free, and on DS they don't offer anything extra, just a stylus instead of a mouse. The technical implementation is limited to being the essential for the functioning of the package, and this is not the problem either, but the package itself is. Pogo Island is also tight for a less attentive public who can find many other products made for them right in the DS. In short, with this game EA shoots into the pile convinced of hitting someone ... we, sparing ourselves further considerations, can only tell you to get out of the way. Pro Philosophy egPerfect for laptops Transfer chips from game to pogo.com account Cons Only 5 minigames, found free elsewhere Essential to the bone Depletes its potential in minutes The island of the little famous The DS is a machine with infinite potential for developers, it has achieved enough market penetration to guarantee each contender a slice of the pie. There is room for everyone because there is not even one cake, in truth, there is one made up of enthusiasts, one made up of new players, one made up of casual players, or one made up of children. With these considerations in mind, EA publishes this game, expressly aimed at players looking for something simple and immediate that does not require too much time or special attention. Something that seems perfect for a laptop in short. And if it is certainly true that Pogo Island works very well from this point of view, the same cannot be said for all the other aspects, which in fact completely nullify the success of the initial idea. Pogo Island consists mainly of 5 stylus-based mini-games, interspersed with a map of an island to be traveled through the spin of a virtual wheel of fortune. Each square on the island corresponds to a minigame or some other interlude that will try to make the game more uncertain. By finishing a certain number of matches, the program will unlock some collectible photo galleries that should serve to keep the player's interest alive, and which instead make it clear that the title has inexorably shut down after just ten minutes. The life of Pogo Island is in fact very short, as is the attention that a player can give it. Children or less demanding players may be able to spend a few more hours on the virtual island, but it is clear that beyond this period the only use that can be made of this game is to fill the wait for the PC to start up. or boiling water. Pogo Island is too short a game, too small to really work, and it's something you understand 5 minutes after turning on the console. And it's not an oversight, it's not something that may apply to some, it's not an accident during development. Pogo Island was developed according to these intentions, in short, there is not only guilt, there is malice.", "date": "2007-05-17", "grade": null}
