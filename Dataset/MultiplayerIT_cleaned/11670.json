{"name": "Fashion Designer: I-Style - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fashion-designer-i-style-recensione.html", "text": "Vocation: apprentice The first thing we notice, starting to play, is the pleasantness of the graphics which, while maintaining a cartoonish tone, maintain a certain claim to elegance and certainly recall, for atmospheres, colors and designs, the environments of a slightly bohemian Paris and a bit trendy. The level of detail is quite accurate, compared to other titles in this range, the colors are bright and pleasant and in general we can say that the realization is really excellent. The game itself will be controlled entirely by the console's stylus, through which we will make every choice from the various menus and we will create the clothes that will be commissioned to us step by step. At the beginning of the game we will be a young apprentice who has been lucky enough to have been employed by a young but talented stylist who already has a good portfolio of clients to her credit. This is the starting point of a game that bases the development of its narrative on a chapter structure, each of them divided into ten missions. Each mission will require us to create and make a dress for a series of customers, among which we will have, as we improve our position and our prominence in the high fashion society, public figures of ever greater caliber. There will be actors, directors, pop stars and journalists. With requests of all kinds, to be satisfied to the best of our abilities. Cut, fold, sew and iron Once we have received our order and chosen the model and fabric to make the clothing required by the mission, we can move on to the heart of the actual game: the packaging. At our disposal we have the fundamental tools for every seamstress: scissors, with which we will have to cut the fabrics following the outline indicated with the nib. The hands themselves, which we will need to fold the scraps of fabric by following the arrows on the screen, and then move on to ironing them to give them the final crease. In this regard, it should be noted that a certain degree of precision is indispensable when we work, whether it is with a needle and thread, scissors or an iron: an error can in fact cause a laceration or a burn and only a certain number is tolerated, under penalty of having to start our work from scratch. The last tools we will use are the stapler and needle and thread, which we will practically only use to fix buttons. Once we have finished our work we will move on to a screen that will evaluate its quality, assigning a vote based on three elements: precision, tempo and style. While we believe there is nothing to explain as regards precision and time, the style will be given by what we have managed to understand and therefore satisfy the wishes expressed by our customers, therefore a certain degree of attention to what they require of us should not be underestimated. Tarmageddon! But the path of a young fashion designer is by no means all downhill and paying attention to seams and irons isn't the only thing that will complicate our lives: an army of moths has in fact discovered our laboratory and will not hesitate to implement all sorts of increasingly aggressive strategies to be able to steal as much fabric from us as possible, leaving our fabrics unacceptably full of holes. It will therefore be necessary to counter them, as quickly and effectively as possible, to prevent our mission from ending in a stalemate, due to time or any inaccuracies committed. The effort necessary to thwart General Grantarma's plans certainly gives more dynamism and sympathy to a game that we can honestly consider really successful, streamlined, fun and full of options. In fact, one of the main problems of this type of video game, undoubtedly intended for an audience that has a more ~casual~ approach to the entertainment product, often runs the risk of being so repetitive and schematic as to be boring and consequently failing in its sense of existence: that of entertaining. Fashion Designer I-Style instead gets along very well, managing to give us a well-finished and well-packaged product, capable of entertaining us in an absolutely relaxed way. A product that is undoubtedly intended for a very young audience, but still able to get noticed in a panorama of similar titles that are rarely as successful. Comment We are faced with yet another ~fashion turn~, in a period in which such titles are teeming with every shelf, in a thousand thousand genres and sauces but, in the end, where everyone is a clone of himself. In this recent invasion of ~casual~ titles, aimed above all at a very young and purely female audience, 505 Games has been able to give us a game that manages tod rise above the average of poor level and content, thanks to the really pleasant and accurate graphics, to the streamlined and fun playability, which manages to engage us without frustrating us and at the same time without being boring and in general to a definitely superior level workmanship compared to many of its ~similar~. Pros Pleasant and very accurate graphics Playability with missions, dynamic and not tedious Interface and game elements easy to manage Nice story, the introduction of ~Tarmageddon~ is fun Cons Linked to a limited target Poor replayability once finished Fashion Designer I-Style is available on Nintendo DS. In the recent invasion, especially on Nintendo DS, of simulation titles of professions and trades, this game winking at the world of fashion could not be missing, which will take young women who decide to try their hand at it in the glittering world of high-level tailoring. The game is offered to us by 505 Games, who had already taken us to the kitchen with Cooking Mama and who this time have decided to test our skills with a needle and thread, rather than with ladles and pans. Let's see if, in addition to teasing the vanity, innate in every young woman, Fashion Designer I-Style will also be able to have fun.", "date": "2008-01-17", "grade": null}
