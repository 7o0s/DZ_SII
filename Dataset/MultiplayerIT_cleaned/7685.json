Obviously intending to take justice into his own hands, our beefy protagonist launches into the rescue with the only language he knows, that of heavy weapons. If the story vaguely reminds you of the film Commando with the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger, don't be too surprised, Narco Terror is a tribute to the action of the eighties and historic arcade cabinets such as Ikari Warriors, Cabal and M.E.R.C.S. The game then develops as a fast-paced top-down scrolling shooter while embracing modern twin stick shooter mechanics. Dynamic camera and a fully polygonal engine allow for perspective changes that affect gameplay. You are evil... I am the cure! Structured on a campaign divided into eight chapters, Narco Terror allows you to be faced alone and in co-op, both locally and through the incipient drop-in, drop-out formula. Another dutiful choice if you loved the previously mentioned titles, but the Deep Silver product references don't stop there, with an always very sustained pace of levels, characterized by an excellent variety and even two sections that see us at the helm of vehicles such as airplanes or motorboats. The gameplay of Narco Terror is as simple as it is instantaneous to assimilate, the aim is to cross the levels by annihilating enemy soldiers and destroying elements of the scenario, with the latter representing a valid aid in the extermination operation; in fact, there are numerous explosive barrels and cases of dynamite that are extremely sensitive to our blows. On the other hand, we must be careful not to get involved in the chain explosions that we can unleash. Rick has infinite ammunition, the only precaution is to collect the healing items and special upgrades released by enemy bodies, in order to keep the energy bar healthy and intensify our offensive power. The weapons have four types of shots that differ in both consumption and effects, ranging from incendiary, shocking and even capable of tracking targets. Continuing in the game you can also acquire three new weapons, which include a shotgun, an assault rifle and a chain gun. By collecting money scattered throughout the levels it is also possible to upgrade the aforementioned weapons reaching devastating effects, the screen is quickly dominated by chaos, between explosions, increasing numbers of enemies and the intervention of heavy vehicles such as crawlers and trucks. The readability of the action is not always clear and it is not uncommon to lose the game without understanding exactly what happened, fortunately the excellent checkpoint system prevents repeating sessions already addressed. Narco Terror evokes all the fun of eighties arcade machines Xbox 360 goals Narco Terror features 20 objectives for a total of 400 player points. Deep Silver proves to be quite generous, as it is possible to conquer half of it simply by completing the campaign, to conquer the rest it is necessary to carry out special operations and finish the game a second time on a hardcore difficulty level. I don't have time to bleed Deep Silver has packaged Narco Terror with a care that is impossible not to recognize, as mentioned the levels are structured in such a way as to mitigate the intrinsic monotony of the genre, with sudden changes of pace and additional objectives, such as the one that sees Quinn engaged in freeing prisoners in a Cuban military camp, or plant deadly explosive charges at specific points to clear your way out. In addition to the aforementioned aerial section, which gives a nod to 1942 by Capcom, the one in which the protagonist operates under the cover of a war helicopter should be noted. The approximately four hours of the campaign therefore flow without the slightest hint of boredom, but the most important value of the game is precisely the rediscovery of the genuine fun of the shooter, that hypnotic and addictive destructive practice that was the very flag of the cornerstones that it likes to celebrate. Between hilarious cutscenes and an almost parody style, Narco Terror manages to make amends for the numerous flaws that afflict it, first of all the controls that don't always respond well, the slowdowns of the graphics engine and an often overwhelming chaos. The final battle is particularly problematic, considerably demanding and represented with a very confusing isometric view. The game presents a rough soul typical of independent productions in the execution, a factor that teshelms a not exactly stellar budget, but in a certain sense scaled down by an affordable price.", "date": "2013-08-07", "grade": "7.0"}
