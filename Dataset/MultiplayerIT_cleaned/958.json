{"name": "Outbreak: Endless Nightmares", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/outbreak-endless-nightmares-recensione.html", "text": "It is the year of Resident Evil Village and the influence of the Capcom series is felt, even on the only vaguely themed independent productions: what we will analyze today, as we will see in the review of Outbreak: Endless Nightmares, is however a striking case. We are in fact referring to an unpublished title, very interesting from the point of view of development (also because it was created by a single person, with all the limitations that this entails) and of the underlying ideas (you will notice that the references to Resident Evil Outbreak and more in general to the franchise are constant). However, not all that glitters is now: and therefore, if the presentation trailers have captured your curiosity, the review you are about to read could quickly knock it down. We try to take stock of the situation, honestly balancing the strengths and weaknesses of what appears, to all intents and purposes, even a commercial operation. Synopsis: Welcome back to the villa Perhaps some of you will remember Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles, a title by the same developer (Dead Drop Studios) released about three years ago: a tribute to old-school survival horror, although then the laudable intentions were translated into a not exactly exciting product . However, the plot of Outbreak: Endless Nightmares (well yes, even the titles seem designed to confuse the audience) picks up from there: the protagonist is still alive and for some strange reason she is interested in continuing her journey of horror. We return once again to the villa, a house clearly inspired by the first Resident Evil and Alone in The Dark 4: The New Nightmare; we won't be the ones to contest a fascinating setting today as it was twenty years ago, provided we know how to render it well and with a minimum of originality. Here, the villa of Outbreak: Endless Nightmares is a bit the main game hub, because it is from here that the protagonist (or the protagonist, it's up to you to choose from a certain number of characters) will access the various ~anomalies~. that is, individual game levels to explore and within which to survive by bringing the skin back home. The world as we knew it, in Outbreak: Endless Nightmares, has long since ended: now zombies and monsters of various kinds are hiding everywhere; even the basic bestiary is inspired by the franchise that we are already tired of remembering. It is not the narration that guarantees a minimum of interest: on the contrary, most of the time it is entrusted to pages and pages of diaries shown on the screen, without, among other things, containing anything really relevant. Somehow, the protagonist must face his nightmares and come out unscathed to join the other survivors. Playstation 4 trophies A rather curious case in recent times, Outbreak: Endless Nightmares on PlayStation 5 offers only a handful of trophies and no Platinum Trophies. However, to get them all, you will have to do little more than complete the main adventure. One less thought, after all. Gameplay That a title has a poor plot can be forgiven, at least as far as survival horrors are concerned: after all, they are also played for other characteristics. But the latter, above all gameplay, must work, otherwise we're really not there. Now, Outbreak: Endless Nightmares has on paper all the key features to offer a fun experience: sense of claustrophobia, the right large inventory, ability to modify and upgrade weapons, character progression through experience points, puzzles, enemies, roguelike mechanics and cooperative. So what's wrong with it? The fact is that almost every single aspect that we have mentioned clearly shows its incompleteness, in such a way that this cauldron does indeed manage to amuse (it did amuse us, for a while) but on condition that we do not have any kind of pretension and come compromised with innumerable flaws. For example, procedurally generated levels should guarantee a minimum of variety and instead two times out of three we found ourselves dealing with the same, identical environment seen just a handful of minutes before; literally identical, enemies, puzzles and traps included. From time to time, only these last aspects change: a trap, or the position of a zombie. And clearly that's not enough. Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles: What's Happening? Hard to tell Gunplay is another aspect that doesn't work, and it's not because it's an homage to old school mechanics: in Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles there is both a modern customization and a more old-fashioned one, and both are awkward. The character aims a little where he wants, almost never on the target; it happened to us twice in a row that it stopped firing altogether, for who knows what reason. The weapons were in good condition, equequipped and with ammunition available: it was certainly a bug, because even with his bare hands the hero just didn't want to know how to face his destiny and take home the skin. Limitations Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles proves that PlayStation 5 can do much better We continue with the limitations, but remembering again that, if you don't expect anything special from life, Outbreak: Endless Nightmares can still entertain you; but don't be fooled by the advertising, because the title isn't even as good as they would like you to pass it off. Surely the progression system is intriguing: with each death you start over, but maintaining the experience of the character; with each new level they get some boosts in stats, although the enemies become more formidable. Local co-op, on the other hand, proves to be fun in the company of a friend, and takes advantage of the horizontal split screen, just like ~in the good old days~. Too bad that the level of confusion on the screen and the smudges increase exponentially in the cooperative. What about the triple focus, much praised by the developer. The basic camera is fixed, showing specific shots for each room of a building (as in the first Resident Evil); but can move behind the protagonist or turn (just press a button) directly into the first person. The fruition is still uncomfortable, indeed perhaps in the first person it gets worse (but for the benefit of immersion). Finally, there is a third customization, the tactical one: the adventure is paused and the player can directly explore all the rooms of the surrounding environment, as if he were the developer himself immersed in his editor, revealing enemies, useful positions, objects and points of arrival.", "date": "2021-05-19", "grade": "5.5"}
