{"name": "The Sinking City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sinking-city-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "If despite all the horrors available on the gaming market these days you are looking for something particular and perhaps more pertaining to a certain literary tradition, this review of The Sinking City for Nintendo Switch could be particularly interesting for you, even if it must be said immediately that the version examined here is not exactly the best available expression of the Frogwares adventure. There has always been a particularly close relationship between Lovecraft's literary universe and video games, due to the typical atmospheres of the writer's works or due to the natural relevance to his works that is traditionally found in the gaming and role-playing community circles (in a word: nerd), but now Cthulhu and company have long since left the niche, becoming a sort of pop phenomenon. However, not many times has the Lovecraftian metaphysical horror aspect found in The Sinking City been translated into a videogame: perhaps also due to a greater adherence to videogame genres we often find reference to the more personal and intimate horror, as in the recent Call of Cthulhu or in the classic Alone in the Dark, while here we are dealing with the more expansive, social and urban aspect of Lovecraft's disturbing visions, which brings it somewhat closer to Bethesda's Dark Corners of the Earth. This is a feature that makes the title very interesting, also because it plays without too much awe on some of the more controversial aspects of the Providence writer's works, staging fears and horrors that lead to complex topics such as xenophobia, the relationship with the different and the moral decadence of modern times, for which the sense of threat and imminent end takes on the aspect of a sort of condemnation inflicted by the ancient divinities on the corrupt society. The premises of this investigative adventure are therefore excellent, which combines the peculiar characteristics of Frogwares games (which became famous with the cult series on Sherlock Holmes) with a subject of great interest and also caught in a not exactly abused meaning. Too bad the good ideas didn't manage to translate perfectly into an equally good game. Charles Reed and the Strange Case of the Sinking City Private investigator Charles Reed is a war veteran and a mysterious shipwreck that left him marked on his psyche but also enriched by a particular power to reconstruct past events. He is a man tormented by nightmares and apocalyptic visions that seem to have to do with sea abysses and gigantic primordial creatures, suggestions extraordinarily similar to the delusions of many inhabitants of the town of Oakmont, struck by what appears to be a wave of collective psychosis linked to a strange condition the area has been in for some time. Recalled by a researcher's letter, Reed finds himself investigating the mystery of the sinking city, gradually discovering that behind the progressive and slow flooding that is engulfing Oakmont lies a horror that is difficult to understand, somehow linked to his forgotten past but in capable of threatening the future of all humanity. For all the basic elements of the gameplay and story, we refer you to the review of The Sinking City written a couple of months ago by Davide Spotti for the PC version, limiting ourselves here to broadly recalling the characteristics of the game and above all analyzing its transposition on Nintendo Switch. We were saying that Frogwares is a team specialized above all in investigative graphic adventures and this is also evident in this production: the writing is rich and pleasant and the game clearly gives its best in the investigation phases, while it drops tremendously in the action phases which they almost seem like foreign bodies forced into the structure of the game to make it more attractive to a wider audience. This is also evident from the gameplay mechanics, heavily unbalanced in favor of the investigative phases: on the one hand we find interesting dialogues with multiple choices, a special power that allows you to reconstruct past events and an ingenious system for organizing clues and evidence with construction of different hypotheses, while on the other hand, in clash situations the title is reduced to a woody sketch of third-person action partially enriched by an experience and skilltree system that is poorly amalgamated with the fabric of the game. A crippled version If graphics and performance have never been the strengths of The Sinking City in its initial versions, the transposition on Nintendo Switch further lowers the technical level going to border on decidedly low levels in some situations. The reduction of the resolution, of the compleGraphics and effects exxities are drastic and are noticeable even without counting the pixels, but it is an inevitable compromise to adapt everything to the needs of the Nintendo Switch hardware. In light of this, however, and considering that the Nintendo console has very well supported other porting operations on titles of similar complexity, a certain performance instability that characterizes this version is less acceptable, whose frame-rate fluctuates in certain more demanding situations , as well as having some issues like delayed texture loads. Another problem, perhaps even more annoying but probably more easily solved, is that of loading times. The waits for starting a game and loading a save have timing in line with the millennial dreams of Cthulhu, just to stay on topic, but the further problem is that strangely long loads are also detected in the midst of exploration, for viewing the various parts of the map and also just for opening the menu, which breaks the rhythm in an annoying way. It must be said that these technical problems could be largely mitigated or even resolved even through subsequent patches and updates, therefore they cannot weigh excessively on the absolute evaluation of The Sinking City on Nintendo Switch, but they are certainly enough to decree this as a version to avoid, in case you have other platforms to try the game on. In partial compensation, a couple of exclusive features of the Nintendo console have been included which, however, play a highly marginal role: the possibility of aiming weapons with the Joy-Con gyroscope (a choice of dubious effectiveness, moreover) and the fact of being able to use the touch screen in the menus.", "date": "2019-09-13", "grade": "6.0"}
