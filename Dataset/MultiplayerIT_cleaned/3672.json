{"name": "Angry Birds AR: Isle of Pigs", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/angry-birds-ar-isle-of-pigs-recensione.html", "text": "Angry Birds AR: Isle of Pigs plays the augmented reality card to refresh an experience that tens of millions of people already know and appreciate, characterized in practice by the same mechanics as always: within about fifty levels, distributed between four zones progressively unlockable, our goal is to eliminate all the pigs by hitting them with a virtual slingshot loaded with... birds. It is possible to make targeted shots to bring down the green pigs, but the fewer shots we use, the better the reward will be at the end of each stage, with the earning of the classic stars which can then be spent to access new locations. To obtain the best results it is therefore necessary to act indirectly, aiming not so much at the enemies as at the structures on which they are located. A concept supported by a physics engine that is once again very functional, which represents the various materials (wood, stone, iron) and their reactions to attacks on the screen in a different way. To destroy the unusual buildings on which the pigs are located, we will be able to weaken their foundations or aim at the inevitable boxes of dynamite, which with their explosion can have important repercussions on everything around them; but also and above all to calibrate the shot and take advantage of the abilities of the angry birds, who return in this game thanks to the well-chosen design of the Angry Birds animated film. There is only one difference compared to the traditional episodes of the franchise: in this case the action takes place in augmented reality, which opens up a whole series of new possibilities. Gameplay and structure The setup of Angry Birds AR: Isle of Pigs is typical of AR games: you need to locate a flat surface nearby and touch the screen for a virtual diorama to appear in a few moments on which the interface elements and of course the structures that from time to time we will have the task of destroying. The view of the slingshot is therefore in first person, and with a swipe down it is possible to calibrate the shot of the bird on duty, activating its capabilities through a second touch while they are in flight: where the good old Red has no powers, the the same cannot be said of the various Chuck, Bomb and little Jay, Jim and Jake, who as we know have the ability to dash at great speed, cause explosive explosions and split in mid-air to inflict damage over a larger area . However, there is more: once the base for the diorama has been established, it is possible to move around it freely and exploit the three dimensions to obtain unprecedented views of each fortress, thus identifying any structural weaknesses to be exploited during the attacks. This is a very interesting and completely new aspect for the franchise, clearly, which adds a lot of tactical depth to the experience and succeeds in the arduous task of refreshing the now decidedly inflated mechanics. In terms of freemium dynamics, then, we remain with a very permissive approach: it is possible to play for free, without spending anything, as long as you watch a couple of short advertising trailers from time to time. At the same time, however, the AR features of the title produced by Rovio pose a series of limits to mobile use: to play it is necessary to stop somewhere and find a stable surface on which to place the graphics, therefore it is not possible to do it while there it moves, as instead happened with the classic chapters. Net of these assumptions, from a technical point of view the developers of the Resolution team have done an excellent job, giving us characters that are convincing in terms of detail and animations, as well as an excellent rendering of the settings, observable from any angle to smile a little in front of the funny expressions of the green pigs that greet us.", "date": "2019-05-14", "grade": "8.0"}
