And the ~too much water~ meme has nothing to do with it, be careful: despite being made up of just four islands, Alola is a region of extraordinary geographical variety that only on rare occasions, and often more optionally than obligatory, forces you to get on the back to a Lapras or a Sharpedo to sail the waves in search of Water-type pokmon or hidden treasures. The rumors and then the official announcements that confirmed the ~Hawaiian~ scenario of Pokmon Sun and Moon had aroused some perplexity, mostly because the Japanese developer anticipated and promised quite a few upheavals aimed at reviving a formula which, despite the transition to three dimensions, has been repeated for many years and has risked becoming stale on several occasions. On this front, we want to warn you but also reassure you: Pokmon is still Pokmon, net of the news that will not convert its detractors and which will certainly make the most experienced fans discuss. Nonetheless, the Sun and Moon versions that usher in this seventh generation are arguably the most sophisticated incarnation of Nintendo's monumental franchise. Pokmon Sun and Moon represent a decisive step towards the future of Nintendo monsters It looks just like a JRPG Pokmon is a franchise that is not exactly easy to classify because it is undoubtedly a role-playing game, but when we talk about JRPGs, i.e. Japanese role-playing games, we immediately think of Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy and, in general, of adventures with complex plots and full of suspense... which certainly cannot be said of the various Pokmon, even if over the years the level of the script has definitely improved. Compared to the first episodes, in which you basically had to become champions of the League and thwart the bizarre plans of Team Rocket, the series began to involve prophecies, environmental disasters and space visitors, but in Sun and Moon the shark jumped further with the introduction of the Aether Foundation, a research center that studies the phenomena of the Ultra Wormholes, rips in the fabric of reality that connect Alola to the parallel dimension in which the so-called Ultra Beasts dwell. Our protagonist, who we will create at the beginning of the adventure by choosing his gender and some particular signs, has just moved to Alola with his mother and is convinced by Professor Kukui and the island's Kahuna to explore the archipelago to pass the tests who will determine if he has all the credentials to become a good Pokmon trainer. To accompany us on the journey there will also be Hau, the young nephew of the Kahuna eager to become as strong as his grandfather, and the mysterious Lillie, a girl who hides a great secret in her bag. The adventure of our protagonists will naturally intertwine with the experiments of the Aether Foundation and with the shady plans of Team Skull, a band of misfit rappers chasing pokmon, but the way in which all these events will connect is decidedly original: the script it surprised us positively for its fast pace and for the very dark themes it deals without sparing itself, narrating some sequences thanks to directorial choices that make it much more ~cinematographic~ than in the past. It is clear that we shouldn't expect a masterpiece of modern storytelling, but we must admit that the story glued us to the Nintendo 3DS as it rarely happened to us with a Pokmon, thanks also to the amusing characterization of the various supporting characters and to the graphics engine enhanced by the decision to represent the characters according to realistic proportions, a choice that has granted a greater level of detail both as regards the polygonal models and for their facial animations. This general improvement of the graphic comparison is also reflected in the various locations, very rich in details and shots from the dynamic camera, and in the fights, in which old and new pokmon finally appear together with their trainers for the duration of the fight. The latter, however, is a novelty that has forced Game Freak to make compromises that we are not sure all players will appreciate. Despite the complete absence of the 3D effect, the uncertain frame rate continues to be an issue during battles between large or heavily animated monsters, especially when facing each other in pairs with their respective trainers in the background; in addition, the decision to show human trainers ledto an imbalance in the proportions every time more or less gigantic creatures such as Wailord or Gyarados take the field, which appear decidedly more contained than what is also reported in the PokDex. Finally, it is not clear what was the cause and what the effect, but the aforementioned problems have certainly contributed to the elimination of the three-on-three battles and pokmon groups, which will probably make fans of those peculiar styles turn up their noses of fighting. While we're on the subject of technicalities, it's worth spending a few lines on the musical accompaniment which, to be honest, is truly superlative even for the very high standards of the franchise: leaving aside for a moment the usual 8-bit screeches of the monsters (except made for the usual Pikachu) the soundtrack of Pokmon Sun and Moon is truly one of the best composed for the series and even sports background tribal chants from time to time. The 3D effect Not received. Try and try again The fact that the journey of our protagonist does not follow the traditional tour of the gyms helps to give a wider scope to the entire canvas, making us tour the islands of Alola according to less strict but always a little too linear criteria. As we have said, the geographical variety is one of the strong points of Pokmon Sun and Moon: the islands do not follow precise themes, there is not only a snowy island or a single volcanic one as initially believed, and each of them offers a balanced set of plains, mountains, beaches, caves and groves in which the specific scenarios of the tests inspired by the types of pokmon fit together. Instead of fighting an endless series of trainers on the way and then again those in the gym on duty, this time we will have to face a series of tests on each island which culminate in the so-called great test: the clash with Kahuna, practically the ~gym head~ of every island. The trials, however, proved rather disappointing. Ideally they should have offered an alternative to the usual fights in the form of environmental puzzles, but in reality they are very simple diversions that still revolve around the battles between pokmon. In one test, for example, we will have to inspect the eddies that ripple the surface of a lake: it is basically an excuse to ride our first Lapras and fight various Water-type pokmon. In another couple of tests, however, we will have to use the camera integrated in the PokDex to photograph the pokmon that will attack us immediately afterwards. In any case, the tests end with a rather demanding battle in which the ~dominant~ pokmon takes the field, a novelty of Sun and Moon that, in reality, the game uses very little. These real bosses are more powerful than normal pokmon capable of bringing an entire team to their knees if you don't prepare properly, especially since they abuse weak points and always call an ally to the rescue, a new ability of all pokmon of Alola that will delight competitive trainers and that can have consequencesunexpected. The clashes with the dominant pokmon and with the Kahuna are in fact the most difficult moments of the adventure, since both the wild pokmon and the trainers on the courses never represent real obstacles, also and above all thanks to the Share Exp. which is delivered to us practically at the beginning of the adventure (the more ~hardcore~ players will probably want to deactivate it) and to the variety of little monsters that we will immediately find in the tall grass, capable of covering almost all types already in the very first hours of the game . In this sense, Pokmon Sun and Moon offers many new features in terms of balancing and combat system. In addition to inventing the Alola forms of some old pokmon such as Rattata or Vulpix, Game Freak has modified various parameters, strengthened or weakened certain moves and therefore introduced the Z moves as a peculiarity of the generation, a bit like he had done in the previous one with the Mega Evolutions . Z moves can only be used once in a fight and they boost a pokmon's moves based on the type of Z crystal we entrusted to it, triggering an overly spectacular cinematic that reminded us not a little of those seen in Level-5 JRPGs like Inazuma Eleven or Yo-kai Watch. Of course, it's too early to find out what the meta-game will have in store for us once players from all over the world have started experimenting with Z-Moves and Mega Evolutions in online and offline battles, but it is certain that the new Training system Pro to modify the so-called IVs will drastically change the competitive scenario, offering truly hardcore fans a new stimulus in the search for the perfect pokmon without changing absolutelynothing for the more casual player who just wants to complete the PokDex and enjoy the new adventure without counting values, natures and stats. Walking with Tauros Like any good self-respecting Pokmon, Sun and Moon also offer a side dish of wacky activities capable of captivating - pardon the pun! - the attention of the trainers beyond a PokDex which at first glance may seem a bit skimpy. The unpublished pokmon are not many, in fact, and the regional PokDex, although renewed graphically in a very captivating way, has a decidedly more moderate impact than in the past. What left us a little dumbfounded were the most striking inconsistencies. The PokDex itself, for example, contains a Rotom that will follow us throughout the adventure, offering us hilarious suggestions and indicating each new goal. Ironically, Rotom does not appear in the PokDex despite being the PokDex itself! Another example? The caller. It is a feature that has a dual purpose: essentially it provides a means of transport in the form of Lapras or Sharpedo on which to sail the waves of the sea, Tauros capable of breaking the rocks that hinder our path or Charizard capable of taking us from a city to another. If you know the historical gameplay of the series, at this point you will have realized that the caller replaces the Hidden Machines in all respects, finally freeing us from the need to teach Strength, Flight or Surf to the various pokmon and transforming the aforementioned moves into simple Machines Techniques. Every pokmon related to the Caller that we will unlock can be summoned instantly by choosing it from a special list, but it is a bit absurd that you can ride a Mudsdale or a Stoutland at any time without first capturing them. Charizard, then, does not even appear in the PokDex. It is important to note, however, that some old pokmon - including the initial ones of the older generations - can temporarily appear in the grass fields of Alola after scanning a certain number of QR codes thanks to the appropriate function of the PokDex. The QR Scanner is just one of the many features offered by the new PokDex, some of which unlock a bit irrationally but allow for a variety of activities with which to pass the time between fights. Pok Relax, for example, is a revised and corrected version of the Pokmon Me & You introduced in Pokmon X and Y and allows you not only to cuddle and look after the little monsters, but also to heal them from anomalous states after a fight. The Pok Resort is a kind of interdimensional island where the pokmon we keep on our PCs will have a blast while we play or simply have the Nintendo 3DS turned off: by cultivating and collecting pokgioli we will be able to expand it in order to unlock more and more services and rewards, maybe attracting the attention of rare pokmon that we haven't caught yet. The Festiplaza, on the other hand, is a real playground for asynchronous multiplayer: by interacting with visitors we will obtain a currency called a token that will allow us to renovate the structures or build new ones, thus accessing mini-games and other competitive or cooperative activities. To all this is obviously added the possibility of exchanging monsters or facing other players online in public or private matches of various kinds. In this sense, in short, Pokmon Sun and Moon have proved to be full of content and secondary activities, perhaps to the detriment of a not exactly very rich ~post-game~ that revolves all around the Ultra Beasts and some legendary Pokmon to capture, even if it is not lacking some surprises that prolong the already remarkable longevity of the main adventure.", "date": "2016-11-15", "grade": "9.4"}
