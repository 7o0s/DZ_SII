Sega Rally Online Arcade lands on digital delivery with the intention of reviving this historic saga. However, the result, albeit not negative, denotes a certain laziness in development and unfortunately it is quite far from the glories we were used to. The work is still in the hands of Sumo Digital, a choice that clearly testifies to a low profile gestation. Oddly enough, the title has worrying similarities with the previous effort of this team, Sega Rally Revo. Not to mention that it is a reduced version and specially adapted for the occasion. Something has also been taken from the latest arcade iteration of the franchise, Sega Rally 3, but considering that this was developed in parallel with the Revo, little wonder. You come back to my mind Basically we are still faced with a championship mode reduced to the bone, with the obligation to reach the podium along three very different routes, to win participation in a head-to-head on a bonus circuit. In addition to the timed and single race modes, Sumo Digital has added the possibility of competing on a re-edition of the legendary Sega Rally African route, a very nice idea that will be particularly appreciated by nostalgics. For the rest we have a dozen cars to choose from, most to unlock, which do not change their driving model that much. The choice therefore becomes a purely aesthetic factor, but it is not a mortal sin, considering the extremely simplistic nature of the title. His frantic search for old flavors is commendable at times, the gameplay compared to the Revo has been significantly filed, the cars respond quickly to commands, and everything hinges on maintaining maximum speed to keep up with a very aggressive CPU. The ground deformation effect, one of the characteristics of the Revo, has been maintained, albeit in a reduced form, and unfortunately the engine still runs at 30 fps, a limitation that slightly affects the sense of speed and dynamism that one would expect from this saga. Xbox 360 goals Sega Rally Online Arcade features the canonical 12 achievements, for a total of 200 player points. If we exclude the top 10, which can be achieved after a simple free race, the rest are to be conquered with sweat and commitment. Up to the coveted 50 final points, achieved after unlocking everything. An operation, we assure you, far from simple. Good luck! Full network! However Sega Rally Online Arcade remains a rather canonical, elementary racing game, full of good intentions but far from the inspiring master. Where in the original the challenge consisted of a perfect balance between drift management and the bloody race against the clock, here the brake is almost never taken into account, as are the checkpoints, but everything revolves around the best trajectory in curve, at maximum speed, and against the classic cars equipped with the notorious ~elastic~ effect, the one that allows the last in the row to be able to catch up with the first anyway, so as to always give the idea of a challenge in every race. The online support proves to be excellent, a feature that certainly lives up to the title. In addition to the ability to race up to six players, each user's ghost cars can be downloaded for use in timed modes. Of course, there are the rankings. During our tests we didn't encounter any major problems, the matches took place without major uncertainties, even if the almost total lack of filters and statistics makes it impossible to understand the level of our opponents. For those who prefer sessions between friends in the flesh, the title offers a long series of local modes via split screen. Here the choice of 30 fps offers truly tangible advantages, the engine performs very well in managing the screen update, without loss of detail. In short, the sector dedicated to multiplayer is undoubtedly one of the most successful of Sega Rally Online Arcade, on its own instead it is a limited and rather short experience, decidedly unattractive.", "date": "2011-06-24", "grade": "7.0"}
