The basic version of the game won the enviable Excellence in Narrative award at the last Independent Games Festival and yes, it does contain a very skillfully written story. A story that is still within us and that we will remember for years to come, as happened for The Cat Lady, Actual Sunlight and other games capable of conveying an emotion with a meaning. Despite this, and despite the Extended Edition completing the narrative experience in a very natural way, as if that was the original form of the game, we gave up the maximum mark. To understand why, we have to start at the beginning. Three Fourths Home tells his story during a long phone call between Kelly Meyers and the rest of his family, mother, father and younger brother. The action develops in the struggle for the affirmation of one's reasons, of repressed emotions. The disputed territory is that of guilt, which bounces from one end of the telephone to the other. At the beginning of the game we see Kelly sitting on the hood of her car in a cornfield. We find out later that she has only recently returned to Nebraska after a course of study in Minnesota that ended in failure. Something went wrong in Kelly's life, but the reasons, as well as within her, are to be found in the relationship with her mother, the family's unstable reference point, around whom a disabled and alcoholic husband and a son afflicted with the syndrome orbit. of Asperger's. None of them are over the top though. The father is neither violent nor devoid of empathy, on the contrary, he is amiable and ironic. But he drinks, and it is understood that the accident has bent his character. The younger brother swings between sensitivity and cynicism, but it's clear he's in pain. Everyone in this family suffers, but the reasons are hidden underground. To reveal them will be a tornado arriving just as Kelly sets off to drive home. In the pouring rain, while relatives alternate on the other end of the line, Kelly tries to get there before the tornado overwhelms them all. The open ending works for the kind of story Three Fourths Home tells and offers a sense of closure. That's all the original edition of the game had to offer. However, since what has now been published is the expanded edition, there is another phone call to make. This time it takes place in the past, when Kelly was still in Minnesota, and it takes place only between her and her mother. Kelly walks waiting to catch the bus, and in the meantime we discover, looking back, the origin of the rust that corrodes the daily life of this common family committed to surviving life. Three Fourths Home chronicles a difficult family reconciliation over the course of two long phone calls Tears and smiles Three Fourths Home unfolds across the screen in two areas. In the upper one we see Kelly driving the car along a straight road that runs between cornfields. Accompanying us are the sound of the rain and, if you like, some music from the car radio. In the lower part of the screen, the textual exchange between Kelly and the members of his family develops. From time to time we can choose which answer to give among several possible ones, but our choice does not change the unfolding of the story. It is a finer work, an intervention on the subtext, i.e. what we really mean while saying something else. What makes it impossible to tear yourself away from the game is the art with which the dialogues have been written and the conflicts developed. After a few minutes we not only seem to hear the voices of the characters but we can even see them. We visualize the house they live in, their way of moving, their facial expressions, and this only by reading what they say. The interaction granted to the player is brilliant: with a key we have to keep the car moving, otherwise it slows down and stops, pausing the game. The same key, however, is the one that allows us to answer during the phone call, so that we have the impression of driving and talking on the phone at the same time, an uncomfortable as well as dangerous operation. This simple game design has a very powerful effect on engaging the player, making him literally feel glued to the keyboard, drawn deep into the story. During the epilogue, when Kelly is in Minnesota, there is no longer the urgency to keep her moving during the walk, but we will be able to make other decisions in return, such as avoiding making the phone call at all. Nothing that would make me want to play Three Fourths Home all over again, but I'm still fmeaningless trifles that anyone who has finished the main call can appreciate. In addition to the second phone call, photos taken by Kelly for photography class and commentary by her teacher were included, as well as short stories written by her brother about her. Extra material that is linked to some themes covered in the story and that enriches what is undoubtedly the most complete edition of the game. The perplexity that we have brought with us concerns the imbalance between narrative and playful experimentation. It's not about the quantity or quality of the interaction, it's about the fact that Three Fourths Home would work just fine even without player interaction. Other games have kept the contact with the player minimal, but still made it meaningful. If Three Fourths Home is a satisfying experience, and it certainly is, we owe it a lot to the quality of the story and little to that of the design.", "date": "2015-03-29", "grade": "7.9"}
