The modes have also remained unchanged: the single player is extremely bland (the only goal is to reach the high score), while for group play there is more choice thanks to the Pass The Mic, Duet and Battle options , whose nature is easily deduced from the name. Considering that this is the fifth episode of the series, on Singstar Rocks! the total lack of any innovative aspect capable of fleshing out a playful structure that is so tested but which at the same time seems to have rested a little too much on its laurels weighs a little. However, showing off your singing performance is always fun (and often downright humbling), especially in the company of friends, and Singstar Rocks! it is no exception to the previous ones in an extremely trivial but at the same time essential aspect: the more the tracklist meets your personal musical tastes, the more you are able to appreciate the work Studio London. Unfortunately, even the selection of this last episode fully falls within the ~hit & miss~ definition, with several tracks of good quality and in theme with the production and others that, quite simply, have nothing to do with rock. Alongside classics such as Paint It Black, Come As You Are and Smoke On The Water there is therefore room for songs such as What Are You Waiting For?, Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Wind of Change, which beyond everyone's judgments they are objectively part of the same genus. Again, it is a pity to note that certain artists have not been rightly valued: this is the case of Snow Patrol, Kings of Leon, Queens of the Stone Age and Stereophonic, which we find represented here certainly not by the ~rockier~ pieces of their repertoire. However, there is no shortage of sufficiently known, convincing and ~singable~ songs, with the inevitable exceptions (Don't Stop Me Now by Queen is for true professionals): in principle, Studio London does not seem to have gone very far, preferring to stay on a terrain predominantly composed of hit-parade tunes that everyone might have heard at least once on radio or television. In short, true rock is perhaps another, but this does not deprive the latter Singstar of its fun factor: we challenge anyone not to get excited by screaming at the top of their lungs songs like Song 2, Apply Some Pressure and Hate to Say I Told You So... Comment Singstar Rocks! is perhaps a bit misleading, given how the tracklist is not exactly representative of the title of the game, but it is still a good quality data disk for Sony karaoke: the presence of numerous energetic and famous songs at the right point therefore makes it ideal as a party game, while in solitary as usual he really leaves the time he finds. Of course, associating the term rock with Gwen Stefani is a real blasphemy... Pros Tested gameplay Overall good tracklist Excellent as a party game Cons Some songs totally out of place No innovations compared to the previous ones Very bland single player New exponent of the Sony singing franchise with the rather eloquent title, Singstar Rocks! it is proposed as a valid alternative to the previous episodes, guilty (or deserving, depending on the point of view) of a musical selection oriented almost exclusively to the pop genre. Now let's see if this stylistic breakthrough has been implemented in a convincing way...", "date": "2006-06-01", "grade": null}
