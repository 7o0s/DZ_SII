{"name": "Mech Arena: Robot Showdown", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mech-arena-robot-showdown-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Mech Arena: Robot Showdown talks about huge robots who challenge each other in different arenas with the aim of conquering control points or simply eliminating each other until one of the two teams in the field reaches the necessary score to obtain the victory. In short, the formula is not the most original, and even in the mobile sector we have seen dozens of similar productions try to bring home the result, build a solid user base and therefore create a platform capable of sustaining itself through the inevitable microtransactions, which in this case serve to accelerate progression and inevitably have pay-to-win implications. Gameplay Mech Arena: Robot Showdown, a direct confrontation during the match It is precisely these drifts of the freemium model that put a spoke in the works of Mech Arena: Robot Showdown, because beyond these aspects, which begin to be felt even slightly after the first few hours, the title developed by Plarium Global is really, really solid. Indeed, to be honest, it is surprising how all the elements fit together perfectly to create an extremely pleasant experience. We start with a single mech, but our roster in the end will be able to count on five different models that we will be able to customize and enhance as we see fit, and which in fact represent our ~energy~ during matches: when all our robots have been destroyed, it will be game over for us. Before arriving at the surrender, however, we will be able to play it by exploiting the equipment and special skills of each of them. The touch control system, almost perfect, has a virtual analog stick that can be repositioned on the left side of the screen and the possibility of rotating the view at will by acting instead on the right side, where there are the buttons to open fire with both weapons mounted on the arms of the mech or with only one of them. In fact, here the concept of independent reloading takes over, which can make the difference between victory and defeat in a direct clash. In short, there is no automatic fire when a target is framed, but given the rather cadenced rhythms of the action this is not a problem. To give you an idea, Mech Arena: Robot Showdown is closer to World of Tanks Blitz than to any competitive hero shooter, so you won't find yourself dodging shots quickly but moving (often slowly!) behind cover to avoid to take too much damage. Structure Mech Arena: Robot Showdown does not have many arenas, but they are all well differentiated There are currently fourteen unlockable robots, but the weapons are decidedly more numerous and make the difference in battle, substantially influencing our approach to combat. In fact, we go from machine guns to missile launchers, from lasers to energy cannons, with different firing timings and yields. The possibility of assembling one instrument rather than another depends on the development of the mech, governed by the credits and objects earned in battle. necessarily spoiled by pay-to-win implications. However, the matchmaking seems to bring order from this point of view, maintaining the balance within the three game modes available to us: Control Points Scuffle, 5V5 Mortal Combat and 2V2 Mortal Combat. Technical realization Mech Arena: Robot Showdown, here is a control point to conquer on the map Beyond the numbers and mechanics that characterize the experience of Mech Arena: Robot Showdown, the game is certainly supported in an important way by an excellently crafted technical sector, which allows you to adjust the graphic quality and the frame rate ( on iPhone 12 Pro we were able to set everything to the maximum without problems) to obtain a remarkable glance and the fluidity necessary to also guarantee the best possible shooting accuracy. It is all very nice to see, the pastel colors that dominate the arenas recall the aforementioned hero shooters and mechs appear well differentiated, although their design draws on an aesthetic that over the years has basically been abused in any way and is therefore quite a bit inflated: don't expect very original robots or solutions particularly fresh.", "date": "2021-08-22", "grade": "8.0"}
