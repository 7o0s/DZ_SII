The game has one of the most enigmatic endings we've ever played in recent times, with the protagonist forced to make a choice that, fortunately, he has to make a few times in his life. A very open ending that gives Remedy the opportunity to deepen its outcome with a series of additional contents that open the dance in these days with this The Signal, which starts exactly where the main game left off and which, who bought Alan Wake in stores, can download for free by entering the code included in the package. Anyone who borrowed the game from a friend or bought it used can enjoy it by paying 560 MP on the Xbox Live market place. Xbox 360 goals The Signal adds 250 points to Alan Wake's 1000. Some are related to the discovery of the alarm clocks and the cartoons mentioned in the review, others to the completion of some game phases, according to certain requirements. All, however, are easily and quickly obtainable with a minimum of effort. A bit of spoilers This review is necessarily aimed at those who have played Alan Wake, since The Signal begins exactly where the game ended with the writer plunged into darkness led by Zane who tries to make him resurface by sending him a signal, hence the name of this seventh episode . The narrative pretext allows Remedy to insert some new locations and to revisit other maps from the point of view of an involved and troubled mind that does not quite know what to do to resolve an incomprehensible situation (even for those who play). Brightfall is devastated by landslides and the roads buckle under Alan's feet as he proceeds towards a path between the dreamlike and the terrifying, following the indications of the voice of his guide who appears on the televisions scattered throughout the locations, which of the gloomy charm already experienced a few weeks ago. Although very short, it doesn't take more than two and a half hours to complete this chapter of the game at a normal level of difficulty, The Signal shows some gameplay solutions that would have helped the action of the previous adventure to vary and propose more interesting situations also for the player. The words of light that had appeared in the game's ending, here serve as a device to bring up objects and elements that affect gameplay, such as the ovens of a basement that explode into flames when illuminated enough by the torch, taking with them the monsters of shadow nearby, leaving the player with an alternative between gun and light which increases the possibilities offered to the player. Just as in life, however, words can hurt more than a punch, given that in some cases they can bring monsters and dangers to the surface, forcing Alan to continue in the dark, wary of the beam of that torch that saved his life for 12 years. hours of play and which here can also be a deadly trap. They are small hints of a world that shows the signs of the many possibilities that the next, hopefully more full-bodied chapters and actual sequels, that Remedy will have the opportunity to develop and which for now constitute a pleasant addition especially for those who have of the code for free download. Those who will have to resort to purchasing separately, keep in mind that there are no other extras, which encourage you to explore the maps, beyond a series of alarm clocks to collect and the cartoons of the protagonists, since there are no new radio broadcasts or mini TV shows to find to delve into the plot as before. Here too, as in the game, the complete dubbing in Italian and the amazing soundtrack are confirmed, with a song at the end of a Swedish singer, little known, but full of talent.", "date": "2010-07-30", "grade": "8.8"}
