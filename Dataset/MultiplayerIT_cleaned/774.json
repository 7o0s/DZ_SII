{"name": "Madden NFL 06 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-nfl-06-recensione.html", "text": "The evergreen Geppo Madden The sports series that can boast the name and the vocal commentary of the legendary coach John Madden is one of the longest-lived in history: I still remember when back in 1989 the well-fed thug made his first appearance on Mega Drive with ~John Madden American Football , and immediately won the sympathy of enthusiasts and got good reviews from the specialized press. For two decades, the fat man with white hair has held a sort of monopoly of football simulations, both thanks to the lack of real competitors and, above all, to the general quality that has been going up year after year. In recent times things have changed: the Sega/Take 2 sports series (which have taken the name of the ESPN network since 2004) have matured slowly but progressively, and have gnawed more and more users from the Electronic Arts franchises, forcing the EA TIburon to look for the bang by inventing novelties from the point of view of playability. The 2004 ~point guard~ system allowed attacking patterns to be quickly modified on the line of scrimmage, and was then extended to the defense in the 2005 edition, which also benefited from the ~hit stick~ function which allowed for better management of tackles and turnover, but these innovations did not give the results they deserved, and for the 2006 edition the Canadian programmers returned to the fray with some innovations, among which two mainly stand out: the first is the Superstar mode, which allows to follow the development of a future NFL star from birth by even choosing his parents (!), while the second is the QB Vision, a feature that allows you to precisely know the quarterback's field of vision and adjust accordingly for passes. Hut hut hut The QB Vision, in practice, does nothing but take into consideration the quarterback's field of vision, representing it with a cone of light (a similar thing has already been seen in Commandos, or in Metal Gear Solid's radar). Of course, the width of the cone is directly proportional to the characteristics of the quarterback being controlled, and its purpose is to direct passes in the best possible way, letting the player know all the team mates who fall within the field of vision (throwing to a team mate outside from the point of view will very often produce catastrophic effects). Unfortunately, the commands to use the QB vision are rather cumbersome and require that certain amount of time that is not always possible to find during games, and it is in any case of little effectiveness if the quarterback in question cannot boast great skills and experience. A good idea in theory but poorly implemented in practice, so much so that many will prefer to disable this feature from the options menu and play with the old and proven passing system. the commands to use the QB vision are rather cumbersome and require that certain amount of time that is not always possible to find during the games Hut hut hut Things improve with the ~Truck Stick~, a system that requires considerable timing on the part of the player but allows the ball carrier to attempt a sort of preemptive tackle against a defender before he tries to hit him in turn. Very useful in actions close to the goal line, almost counterproductive in open-field gallops. To complete the picture of the innovations in attack comes the Precision Passing, another small feature that makes its debut in this edition, which allows you to throw the oval ball to the right, left, up or down with respect to the designated receiver, in order to minimize the risk of unwelcome interceptions by the opposing team. How I make you a star If for Franchise and Owner there have been practically no changes, here comes the new ~NFL Superstar~ mode, where the player finds himself experiencing the entire life of a football promise, starting from birth up to millionaire signings in the field professional. You literally start from the beginning, even choosing the parents, genes and abilities of which will have repercussions on the characteristics of the future player (for example, choosing a father who was a racing champion will guarantee good speed). The game seems to prevent associations between two particularly gifted parents, so forget about tracking down a father who was a chess champion and touchdown record holder in the 80s together with a mother who won the Nobel prize for science and Olympic gold in cross-stitch. Superstar is a fun mode, but one that gives the overall impression of a rickety set of sub-games held together by a miracle How I make you a star In the athlete's youth one must affface auditions, find sponsorships or follow regular training to increase skills, but you can also spend the time in extra-curricular activities, take care of the look by adding tattoos or changing the color of the hair, giving interviews and various other things. Once the player begins to be known, the first requests from important teams arrive, and here the AI is valuable: nothing is left to chance, and contacts will only come from those teams that really need a player. player with the characteristics of the created one. NFL Superstar is a welcome novelty, and in the end it also turns out to be fun, but on the other hand it must be said that the general impression is that of a shaky set of sub-games held together by a miracle, each playing its own part giving little sense of cohesion. The makeup of the energetic From an aesthetic point of view there is very little to say, since the situation is the same as last year, neither more nor less. The polygonal models have not benefited from particular improvements, the unpublished animations can be counted on the fingers of a maimed hand and the similarities of the players with the real alter-egos are not as exciting as they once were. In principle, even in Madden NFL 2006 everything reveals the end of a cycle, or rather of a generation of consoles. Speaking of the audio sector, there is, of course, the usual comment of the matches made by John himself and his sidekick Al Michaels, who have now become inseparable like Costantino and Daniele (brrr), as well as the classic music by famous or pseudo-famous artists. , in pure EA style, to accompany us in the menus. Among these songs, which are 21 in total, we point out pieces by the following artists: Foo Fighters, Godsmack, Disturbed, The All-American Rejects and several others that angry fifteen-year-olds like so much. Final comment After a long tradition of substantial improvements year after year (with very few exceptions) this time the bandwagon of John Madden suffers a setback: except for a few small changes, Madden NFL 2006 is practically the same game as last year with the teams updated and exclusive rights. Nothing has changed drastically, and it's easy to understand why: Tiburon have already been working on the Xbox 360 version for some time, and they certainly didn't want to play the best cards for a title of the now ~old generation~. Madden 2006 is a title that rests on good foundations and boasts the best football AI on the market, but offers almost no substantial novelty, neither from the point of view of playability, nor from a technical point of view. In an absolute sense this latest Madden is still one of the best football simulations in existence, perhaps the best, but those who are not fans and those who already have the 2005 edition could certainly spend their money more wisely.Pros Some game news marginal but interesting Superstar mode good Versus QB Vision a bit cumbersome Very few differences with the 2005 edition Cross-platform Not much to say regarding the multiplatform: as usual, the PS2 version is the one with the graphics a little less clean and defined than the others, while the PC version is the one (naturally) with the best visual rendering thanks also to the higher resolutions . Nothing else particularly relevant to report. Life is a game of inches, and so is football. In both of these games, the margin for error is very small: half a step too early or late, and you can't make it; half a second too fast or too slow, and you miss. But the centimeters we need are everywhere, they are all around us. There are some in every break of the match, every minute, every second. And we know that when we add up all those inches, the result will make the difference between victory and defeat, the difference between living and dying! With these words, coach Tony D'Amato, played by an excellent Al Pacino, gave the charge to his team in ~Any Given Sunday~, words that perhaps inspired the top management of EA Sports, who after the half missteps of the last years have felt the breath of Sega's now mature ESPN series on their necks and have decided to go back to being serious. Where to start, then? From playability? From graphics? From creativity? No, from the grain: EA has in fact secured the exclusive NFL rights for the next five years, which makes the Madden series the only one that in the next five years will be able to show off the names of real players and teams. But besides the tremendous head and neck blow given to the competition thanks to the vile money, is there anything else interesting behind Madden NFL 2006?
