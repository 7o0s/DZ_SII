{"name": "Fallout Shelter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fallout-shelter-recensione-ps4-201025.html", "text": "We were born in the Vault, we will die in the Vault: it was the old motto of the Overseer of Vault 101, in Fallout 3, one of the historical chapters of the series. But we would add: if we really have to die in this Vault, at least let's make it work until the end, as far as possible. And it's also a bit of the philosophy behind Fallout Shelter, the small but full-bodied Bethesda mobile management system launched in the summer of 2015 on iOS and later Android devices. In hindsight, Fallout Shelter was the company's first attempt to carve out its own space in the mobile sector as well, and it naturally had the task of allowing to while away the wait in view of the arrival of Fallout 4, the following autumn, when everyone would have placed the smartphone on the table and grabbed the controller, ready to survive in the post-atomic world we know well. So a couple of days ago Bethesda really surprised everyone by announcing the arrival of Fallout Shelter also on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch: it is the right opportunity not only to rediscover a valid title, but also to analyze how it has aged, what it is changed, and how it performs away from the mobile sector. The hard, tiring life of the overseer Just take orders: in Fallout Shelter we are the superintendent, grappling with the construction, design and then the careful management of our very personal Vault. We will start with just the gigantic entrance door available, but then we will have to think about how to arrange the various areas and rooms of the underground refuge. And there are really a lot of buildings to be built, from the fundamental ones to respect the three basic parameters of the subsistence of the Vault population (water, food and electricity) to more optional possibilities but which never hurt, such as closets to deposit a increasing number of objects. Fallout Shelter is an intelligent management system studied with attention to the smallest details: the error in the management of a single resource, the carelessness for a sick inhabitant or a fire that we have underestimated, the lack of sentinels at the main entrance, any negligence it may prove a fatal mistake for our survival, and for that of the poor wretches whose overseer we are. In the first moments of the game, Fallout Shelter is quite forgiving: it explains how the various rooms are built and what their purpose is, the connection between energy, food and water and the need to keep all three balanced to promote the happiness of the tenants of the our refuge; the first times we'll be in trouble, for example with one of the three parameters wrong because we made a mistake in touching something, the rewards of the first missions or other types of bonuses will take care of getting us back on track. But after the first hours of the game, it will be up to us to think about how the Vault works, and this time for real: mistakes are not allowed, unless you like to start all over again because all the inhabitants are dead or find yourself grappling with the reconstruction after a disastrous situation. Fallout Shelter lends itself to hit and run games of about ten minutes each, the time to collect the production of the various rooms, move and reassign the new inhabitants and evaluate the construction of new buildings. The dead times are marked with the exploration of the Contaminated Area, where we will be able to send some of our best inhabitants on missions, after having duly equipped them with weapons and armor: the logic of real time applies, so if we send an inhabitant on a mission and we stop play for three hours he will still be there until we recall him to the Vault; a prolonged period outside can both lead to the discovery of many useful objects and to the death of the character, if he is not ready for the challenges that await him. Dwellers add to the Vault's population in two ways: by internal reproduction or by arrival from outside. In the first case we will be able to influence ourselves, encouraging our tenants to procreate in the most banal method possible, that is by assigning a boy and a girl to the dormitories; each inhabitant has S.P.E.C.I.A.L. unique, which make it particularly suitable for a certain task (for example electricity management) and less suitable for others (such as food production). Some inhabitants possess characteristics or S.P.E.C.I.A.L. very high, they are usually the reward for Vault lunchboxes (sort of premium crates), but the parameters can also be increased with specific structures to be built in the shelter. Playstation 4 trophies Fallout Shelter arrives on PlayStation 4 also bringing with it a glittering Platinum Trophy: obtaining it will require at least 40 hours of grinding, in which you have towe can build, upgrade, explore the inhabitants, complete secondary missions, increase the population of our Vault, in short, everything that is the basis of the normal administration by the Overseer, and even more! Fortunately, no Trophy is missable. A Vault in the living room Fallout Shelter hasn't undergone major changes over the past three years, apart from some minor balancing and the addition of some elements that were absent at launch: for example Mr. Handy who can collect all the Vault resources for us in a moment , as if turning on the game and doing it manually were the greatest chore of this life, and pets, which guarantee additional bonuses to our underground refuge. There are two ways to get them, open your wallet and give in to microtransactions or more prudently decide to do without them or wait to be lucky enough to unlock some along the way: there is no shortage of short and long-term missions that will reward us for our results , perhaps asking us to carry out simple operations after all, such as obtaining a precise quantity of a certain resource, arming some inhabitants and sending them to explore. The real novelty of Fallout Shelter is therefore its simple arrival on consoles, and the possibility of playing it ~large~ on the TV in the living room: on PlayStation 4, Bethesda's management system behaves very well, has clean graphics and no slowdown whatsoever , which was not even so obvious given that very often the mobile titles that land elsewhere are not properly cared for by the developers. However, Bethesda cares about the Fallout franchise, and the treatment for Fallout Shelter is no exception: we have also tried to make the DualShock controls as comfortable as possible; the experience is traumatic at first, because the touch screen was obviously more intuitive and immediate, but little by little you get used to it and the combination of keys to keep in mind to move between the various rooms, zoom or equipping villagers with weapons is nothing too complex. On Nintendo Switch, with the same performance in TV and tabletop mode, things are much better because the touch screen functionality of the title remains available, which also uses HD Rumble within certain limits. The real problem of Fallout Shelter on the console is the cumbersome access and management of dead times: for those who care about accessing their Vault at short intervals of time, things cannot be as simple as on smartphones, because a console cannot extract it from the pocket, remaining tied to the physical place where we have positioned it; this can become a problem especially if we have sent an inhabitant on a mission and we remember him while we are away from home, risking him dying because we cannot physically start Fallout Shelter and tell him to return to the Vault. In that case the only alternative will be to resurrect it using the title's currency.", "date": "2018-06-14", "grade": "7.5"}
