{"name": "Order & Chaos Online", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/88288-order-chaos-online-ios-in-un-mondo-persistente.html", "text": "An MMORPG allows you to do solo and group missions, thus cementing the multiplayer component, but it is also a double-edged sword for social life, it requires on average many more hours of play to be appreciated than a ~classic~ video game ~. Users who usually play an MMORPG could tell you many anecdotes that have happened to them over time, including the birth of new friendships (even some love ones!), nights spent not sleeping with school/work the next day, up to to real intoxications because all things, even if funny, are bad if repeated too much. Order & Chaos Online, with some forcing, can be defined as the answer to the overwhelming power of World of Warcraft on PC, the first real three-dimensional MMORPG for iOS devices that has all the key features that are part of this genre. Guess who the developer is? Obviously Gameloft, which in the full meaning of ~Nothing is created, everything is transformed~, continues to churn out titles inspired by other successful titles with an impressive cadence which, if on the one hand are rightly criticized for being too similar and lacking in inventiveness on the of the French developer, on the other they have the merit of always being made with all the trappings of the case and of bringing a multitude of different genres to Apple devices. In the lands of Arcadia To play Order & Chaos Online you must therefore be connected to the internet, but inexplicably only with a Wi-Fi connection, which clashes with the idea of a portable device that can work anywhere thanks to the 3G connection. A solution can be found using for example the iPhone 4 with tethering via WiFi, which ~tricks~ any other iOS device connected, but the problem still persists. Returning to the game, the first thing to do is to create your own character according to a series of rather limited aesthetic parameters, and then move on to choosing the race, among the four available: human, elf, orc and undead, which in pairs they belong to one of two factions, order and chaos. A further step includes the choice of one of the four classes among Warrior, Magician, Monk and Ranger, which as per the script allow you to focus your character on close attacks or on ranged ones and so on, according to the classic canons of role-playing games . The same thing goes for the equipment, where, for example, warriors can wear heavy armor with a great defense bonus while archers can enhance their agility and speed of movement characteristics. The choice of the faction has as its main difference that of changing the starting point between Foresta Arcadiana and Terre Sosolate, the interlocutors and the background story change, it being understood that the type of things to do remains almost identical, between missions where you have to recover a certain object, kill a certain number of enemies rather than the more articulated ones composed of concatenated passages. The growth of our character is instead entrusted to the levels and experience points that are obtained by eliminating the opponents and completing the quests, according to a progression scheme that provides for the possibility of obtaining ever more powerful equipment and weapons through special vendors or thanks to ~drop~ of the enemies themselves, which are certainly the best solution to enhance one's alter ego. The beauty of an MMORPG like Order & Chaos Online is on the one hand the ~repetitive~ but fun type of gameplay, on the other hand the possibility of interacting with other users and in fact while playing it is not uncommon to meet other people who are doing the same mission and at this point it is possible to form a party, exchange objects rather than using the chat that the game makes available. Continuing in the game, starting from level 10, there is the possibility of being able to create a guild and therefore deal with the title in a broader sense in an organizational key. Precisely this part, however, represents one of the most obvious limits or, if we want, less developed aspects: there is no way to know if someone has added you to their friends list to reciprocate, there is no user search, guild management it's very cumbersome, which somewhat limits a rather important part of the package. That said, the game world of Order & Chaos Online is really vast, there are many cities and places to explore and several hours of play are needed to reach level 60, the current level cap of Gameloft production. Do not miss the crafting, there is in fact a special quest that allows you to choose your profession among those availablei, such as the blacksmith which can be indicated for the Warrior. The creation does not require any skill but takes place in the character menu thanks to the objects found on the bodies of the enemies and those purchased from the tailor, all through a special ~flow~ which is used to channel them. Not even the auction house is absent to complete what absolutely must not be missing in a self-respecting MMORPG. As for the interface, the movement of the character is entrusted to the classic virtual analog stick (mobile), the attack and skills instead to special icons that can be called up directly for quick access. The interaction with the enemies is obviously entrusted to the touch with the fingers, while on the upper part of the screen there are the statistics of the character (unlike other titles, the use of the spells is entrusted to the ~morale~, a bar which always increases by more following successful normal or chained attacks) and other useful information. However, everything on the iPhone leads to many headaches, with too much information on the screen and reduced space for movement and to ~frame~ enemies quickly; on the iPad the situation is much better, but some questionable choices remain such as the chat bar positioned in the center at the bottom, invasive beyond measure, and the part dedicated to shortcuts for recalling skills/spells, too small and limited for higher levels advanced. We have not forgotten the technical sector, which in Order & Chaos Online does not let you cry out for a miracle but always behaves well, especially considering the visual distance and the number of elements to manage, with a style that closely resembles, we would say excessively, World of Warcraft and therefore with a colorful fantasy setting with each part of the game map representing a different setting. During our tests we also encountered very little lag and only a few service interruptions, but in general the gaming experience has been positive from the start. An important mention should be made for the translation, completely in Italian. It may seem trivial, but Order & Chaos Online is one of the very few MMORPGs to have been translated into our language, and therefore certainly represents a plus point for users less savvy with other languages. Dulcis in fundo, the title is offered with a rather interesting price scheme: the game is universal and at a cost of 5.49 euros it allows you to download the client and play it for 3 months, then the monthly subscription costs 0.79 cents while 3 and 6 month packages are available which further reduce the incidence of the total, for a decidedly affordable cost given the vastness of the production. Some critical element is instead linked to the ~in app~ transactions that allow you to buy runestones, which temporarily increase your skills, and gold at the cost of real money. However, we must say that in the second case the purchase can be useful and ~offset~ the balance a little only during the first dozen levels, after which the amount of money obtained from enemies and quests is much cheaper in proportion. In this way, Gameloft could also curb or at least reduce the phenomenon of 'clandestine' sales that happen right around Blizzard's masterpiece. In the end Order & Chaos Online manages to entertain and that's what counts, it captures the essence of MMORPGs and makes it more usable and less complicated on iPad and iPhone, which are still mobile devices and different in use compared to a console or a pc. However, we note the lack of an extensive beta before the game is released because there are some balancing flaws that the most attentive cannot fail to notice, such as a Monaco class that seems to be the strongest one or the fact that when you die ( after level 10) only money is lost, without the possibility of being able to keep it in the houses that allow you to keep the objects. A stopgap solution could be to create another character to whom the money to be kept can be sent via virtual mail, but so be it.
