Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. In a post-apocalyptic scenario, where society has been wiped out giving way to military-like gatherings, our team must do everything possible to establish a base, grow their forces and at the same time defend the borders of the encampment from raider assault. This is the incipit of Apoc Wars, an interesting mix between a casual Farmville-style management and an RTS, not the first nor the last hybrid product of this genre on the App Store but with a good characterization in terms of design and of an unusually ~agile~ technical sector, which allows us to drag the battlefield, place troops, zoom, etc. with respectable speed and fluidity. Once a game has started, the game takes us by the hand towards completing the first objectives, i.e. establishing a base camp, training a certain number of soldiers and constructing buildings, after which it leaves us the task of continuing, providing us with a simple missions always full of things to do, which alternates construction phases and combat phases to keep up the variety of the action. Each completed mission results in obtaining a hoard of Blood Money, the currency used by Apoc Wars, but clearly it is possible to put your wallet and buy packs of coins through IAP, as in any freemium title. Simple and civil One of the best aspects of the experience is represented by the simplicity of its structure, assisted by a very clear and essential interface. The developers did not want to offer us too many menus, which makes the management phase quite pleasant and allows us to spend the money earned to build new buildings, upgrade existing ones, add active or passive protections to the base and create new types of troops. As per tradition, increasing the experience level unlocks new items, new units and new missions, following a linear path. When our army becomes sufficiently numerous, we can dedicate ourselves to combat missions by selecting our opponent from a list and choosing the units to be used in battle subject to some limitations regarding number and type. At that point Apoc Wars embraces the more classic RTS mechanics, albeit in a simplified way, and allows us to indicate to the troops the point to reach and/or the objective to attack, advancing inside an enemy territory, hidden by a ~ fog~ that we can only thin out by exploring the location or using particular bonuses. In this situation, the touch control system proves to be precise and reliable, correctly selecting the objects we touch, as well as in the management phase. The aforementioned fluidity of the graphics is not supported by particularly rich scenarios from a visual point of view, indeed often and willingly there is a lot of desolation, but an excellent job has been done in terms of interface. Mediocre sound instead, with songs that are so reminiscent of the era of 8-bit home computers, but in a negative sense. Apoc Wars is a simple and fun casual strategy game, full of things to do", "date": "2013-06-08", "grade": "7.5"}
