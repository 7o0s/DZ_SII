{"name": "Naruto: Rise of a Ninja - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-rise-of-a-ninja-recensione.html", "text": "Naruto is one of the most popular brands today and not only in Europe. The deeds of the young aspiring ninja have already been the protagonists of a series of games published on PlayStation 2 by Namco Bandai, leaving Xbox users dry. Ubisoft, no less than entrusting its development to the Montreal studios, finally publishes a version for 360, which over the months had made itself known for its fresh and really well-crafted style, capable of putting together HDR and excellent cel shading, and combining a multitude of different styles of play with each other. This experiment ends up giving shape to one of the best manga tie-ins ever made - probably the best among those based on the Naruto license - even if we are left with the idea that with a little more effort we could have found ourselves among the hands one of the most beautiful games of the end of 2007. Jutsu Mania Under the guise of a title for younger players, in reality, Naruto deals with a series of rather adult themes that deserve to be played by anyone, regardless of age. Rise of Ninja is a story of growth and friendship, interspersed with pure beat'em up style fights, linked by video sequences taken directly from the anime and platform sections that rarely overlook the Microsoft console. The storyline covers the first television series and chronicles Naruto's first steps on his journey to become the next Okage and the greatest of all time. Obviously, the team had to make a selection of the events to include in the game, only instead of having the feeling of playing a summary of the television series, it feels like following a serial that you can't see all episodes. In fact, there are numerous videos or dialogues in which reference is made to episodes or anecdotes of which there is no trace in the game and the unanimity and narrative force that are the basis of the manga's success are somewhat lost. Even if it remains perfectly enjoyable by anyone, even by those who know nothing of the original. As in the manga, Naruto must be accepted by the community of the Leaf Village, must learn the ninja arts and, essentially, must become a warrior. The village, completely explorable from the start, is populated by inhabitants who stroll with a smiley on their heads. Each successful quest causes the angry face to smile, indicating the popularity of our hero in the town. As this grows, more and more inhabitants will be willing to help him, provide directions and assign him further missions to earn money and training points. The first is used to buy food to recover energy during missions, and to obtain weapons and precious scrolls to enhance Naruto's resistance and physical abilities. The points, on the other hand, are used to be able to go to the masters to learn the combos to be used in battles and, above all, to enhance the Jutsu, that is, Naruto's special powers. There are three of them and they are the Superior Technique of the Multiplication of the Body, the Concentration of the Chakra (the magic needed to perform the Jutsu) and the Power of Seduction. In addition to fighting, the Jutsu are used, suitably enhanced, to access previously unreachable areas, walking on water, breaking barriers and climbing along ever higher walls. This is also to collect coins with which to unlock new scrolls to increase stats or to buy extras. The completion of all the sub quests and the collection of all the objects are, after all, the real substance of the single player mode of the Ubisoft game, so much so that it is possible to complete everything even after finishing the story mode and having watched the titles tail. Which for us arrived after about nine hours of playing the main story and with the completion of half of the sub-quests, leaving us with the inexorable idea that a greater number of settings  if not hours of actual gameplay  would have helped make the experience offered by Naruto and his traveling companions better. Beat'em Up! The most developed part of Naruto is undoubtedly the beat'em up part. Each of the characters has three jutsu and a decent set of combos and counter moves that make for a game of decent depth. In addition to the offline mode, there is the possibility of competing online on Xbox Live with the lag that is barely felt without affecting the playability. Interesting and fun is the ranked match system with an online tournament in which to progress against random opponents, earning points that swell the online rankings and which are used to unlock a series of gamer score objectives. Exploration and platforming OnceOnce the quests are activated, the doors of the village open and a world of colorful forests opens up at Naruto's feet, full of details and hidden objects to collect. The places to explore, unfortunately, are not as rich in enemies who, essentially, are limited to ninjas and bandits for a total of six different types of characters, who you soon get to know and look at with a slight disappointment. The platform sections, having overcome some difficulties with the camera, are really well done, helped by the delicious cosmetics, but, as with other game elements, they are not developed to their extreme consequences, leaving the desire to be really put to the test unsatisfied . In essence, Naruto's difficulties are all concentrated in the fights with the main characters of the game, the same ones that can be used in Versus mode or in online matches, like in a real fighting game. Ubisoft Montreal has managed to create a real 1 vs 1 beat'em up, with well balanced characters, each equipped with three Jutsu, combos and counters so as to ensure that there is no fighter clearly stronger than the others and in order to give life to a gameplay that has little to envy to games of the same genre, much more famous. The only flaw, if anything, is linked to the clashes during the story mode. To make the already short life of the title a little longer, the key opponents have been given a little justifiable skill increase, which puts the player in front of matches in which, often and at least until the statistics are adequately ~pumped~, little can be done except to witness wrestlers performing parades and one counter after the other. The only way out is to be able to carve out the few seconds necessary to activate the Jutsu of the Superior Technique of Multiplication of the Body or to shelter in the ~Rage~ mode when you are dying (mode in which you inflict double damage and in which they do not suffer). When you finish KO you can make use of memory clips, an ingenious system of lives that binds to the memories of the most important events in Naruto's life. You can wear up to four at a time and allow, when you go down, a space of a few seconds to recharge energy and chakra with the continuous pressure of a key. Once exhausted, all that remains is to try again to win with a single life, until the game, after a couple of attempts, allows us to face the same fight again, making all the memory clips available. At that point, overcoming the opponent will be child's play. For the rest, the life of our little ninja is an alternation of collection and object recovery missions for the inhabitants, hide and seek competitions, speed through checkpoints on roofs and trees and quests for the delivery of ramen on behalf of the diligent village cook. The atmosphere is nice, the world coherent and captivating, but it lacks a bit of bite or variety that really make a good product soar towards excellence. Blond Naruto And here is the most successful aspect of the Ubisoft title, the cosmetics. Naruto, given the target and the type of game, is definitely an excellent product, and proof of this are the glimpses that you can enjoy when you climb the highest buildings in the village with a beautiful sun that illuminates the scene that is lost in eye view. Rich in details, fluid animations and animated elements - all illuminated by an excellent HDR system - the world created by the Montreal studios is a real little gem. And even more are the fights of the beat'em up phases, in which the frames per second become even 60. Of note, the animated sequences of the Jutsu which are truly spectacular. In such a rich context, the low-resolution cut scenes, which do not even go in 16:9, taken from the anime and which narrate the main events of the story, clash a bit. We would certainly have preferred that they were rendered with the game engine or with CG sequences, even if fans of the series will be willing to watch them in religious silence. The audio commentary and the soundtrack are also good, which follow the evolution of the events narrated well. The game is subtitled in Italian with the dialogues in English, but Ubisoft will soon make available a download with the original voices of the Japanese anime. Comment Naruto is a successful experiment, but not entirely convincing. Among the things that are good are certainly the excellent graphics sector, the attention to detail and the combat system, at least when playing against human opponents. Among those that, in part, disappoint, are the variety of the game and the longevity of the questmain, which quickly gives way to sub-missions which, however, can get boring in the long run. The Ubisoft title is certainly recommended to all fans of the manga and to all those who want a well-finished game, outside the box and which constitutes a good starting point for a series that has the possibility of leaving its mark. Some elements, just developed, let you think a little of a Ferrari pulled out of the garage to go shopping, rather than for a nice race on the racetrack, but the fun and the pleasure of playing are there. Maybe, not as much as the first few hours in Naruto's company would suggest. Pros Naruto Hidden Leaf The Animations Sense of Progression Cons Longevity Gameplay Variety Good Newly Developed Ideas Xbox 360 - Goals Completing Naruto's story mode leads to earning around 400 of the obtainable points. By completing the social quests and making an effort to make all the villagers happy, you can easily reach 500. To reach 1000 you have to devote yourself to the fighting game phase and, above all, to online battles and, therefore, it takes a while of time.", "date": "2007-11-07", "grade": null}
