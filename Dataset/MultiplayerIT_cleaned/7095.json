Terrible centralizing tyrants or lovers of participatory democracy? With Tropico 5, Haemimont Games wants to continue to have its say in the world of city simulations, aided by ever so weak competition, represented above all by a SimCity in a crisis of identity and results. Paradoxically, Maxis' attempt to renew its historic brand, bringing it closer to the modern concept of videogames as a service, has left the fields wide open for those products like Tropico which have instead chosen the path of conservation, yes by introducing online as an extra feature, but aiming , rather than conquering the new public, not displeasing the old one. Thus Tropico 5 appears immediately recognizable (too much) to anyone who has played the third or fourth chapter of the series, of which many mechanics have been strengthened in any case. The basic concept is always the same, already expressed at the beginning of the article, explored with a light and cheerful approach in stark contrast to the often controversial contents, even if faced in an ironic and aseptic way. Thus having an opponent killed who has become a little too annoying or trading raw materials with pirates and Nazis becomes a mere economic choice dictated by a single purpose: to be able to make one's account in Switzerland prosper without sending the population out of business. Don't be surprised, because in the management of certain aspects of politics in its most general sense, the Tropico series has always been less hypocritical than others, which in fact challenge the player to adapt to a standard idea of good governance to allow him to progress. In Tropico 5 (as in the rest of the series) behaving like scum not only allows you to make tons of money, but it is often the only way to keep the state under control and make it prosper, with the complicity of ignorant and often well-informed citizens. glad to have someone to beat them good. The joys of tyranny The single player campaign begins with the colonization of the island. Indeed, by the dictator, who must be created in the image and likeness of many of his real colleagues, using a convenient editor. Do you want to be a modern tyrant? Then you can dress your avatar in designer clothes from the right shops for the repressor who never has to ask. Do you like going classic? How about a nice military uniform full of insignia, which makes it great for aperitifs with the other rulers? Obviously, more substantial choices must also be made, such as determining our skills so as to have bonuses in some sectors, such as food production or building construction. Having created our tailor-made dictator, who with the evolution of the campaign can be replaced by heirs with different characteristics, the time has come to do what we have been called to do in this worn-out world: govern. Established in our little earthly paradise, we soon discover that the duties imposed by the parent company are really tight for us. The first step, therefore, is to accumulate enough money to pay for independence, so as to free oneself from the constant demands for taxes. The background music tells us where we are more than the title of the game itself: we are somewhere in South America, ready to establish our dictatorship. The campaign proceeds by objectives, which at regular intervals, or following certain events, appear on our building in the form of rotating icons. By clicking on it we will be told what to do. The objectives are varied and range from sending an expedition to search the island, so as to discover hidden resources or treasures, to modifying agricultural production to meet the requests of the allies. There is no shortage of political/military objectives, with dissidents to be repressed or pressure groups to satisfy. Sometimes the private life of the boss can also intervene to dictate the order of events. Thus a new Fidel, a little too Mandrillo, could conceive an illegitimate child, displeasing the religious faction of the island. What to do? Eliminate the root problem? Cover it up? Or completely ignore the religious? The methods for resolving problems and internal conflicts are often unorthodox, with the game system actually penalizing virtuous behavior or more humane choices, consistently following the more brutal principles of political realism. Ultimately what interests us is to maintain power. The rest matters very little. There would be many things to say about this aspect of the game, especially about how Haemimont Games has managed to make the flow of events coherent by integrating them with the gameplay through a convincing cathena of causes and effects that reflect on the government. Unfortunately, space is at a premium and we still have to talk about the most important aspect of Tropico 5: the city building and management system. What kind of dictator would you be in a South American state? Find out in Tropico 5! The Bananas Free State What is the sector from which a good politician can derive the greatest personal benefits, both economically and politically? The building industry, of course. In Tropico 5 you have to build an entire city, trying to satisfy the demands of the citizens and, at the same time, accumulating bribes and goods with various tricks that are not exactly very legal. Building is really easy since you just need to open the relevant menu, select a category of buildings and choose the one you want to build by placing it on the map and connecting it to the city via a road (each building has its own entrance). In the single player campaign it is often necessary to build buildings that are required of us to complete missions, buildings that often serve to activate otherwise blocked options. For example, do we want to improve the agricultural production of our fields? Well, we need to research the sickle that activates the option to buy better fertilizer from the farm buildings menu. To research, however, you must first have built a library and put trained workers inside it, so as to unlock the appropriate menu. Is our state still unable to produce personnel educated enough to run a research center? The solution is to import workers from abroad. Doing so is simple, but before seeing them at work you have to wait for them to arrive on a transport ship. Of course, foreign workers cost more than local ones, so it might be worth having some resources aside before calling them. But how to accumulate resources if not by selling goods on international markets? Unless you choose to bargain with pirates, who charge much better prices. As you may have understood, building buildings in Tropico 5 allows you to unlock many other aspects of the game, which gradually enrich the complexity of state management. We soon discover that there are many choices and that we need to give the city a vision, that is to direct it towards some economic activities rather than others, activities that make better or worse depending on the type of government chosen. For example, tourism could be penalized by a dictatorship that is too harsh, or choosing to do business only with pirates could make the rulers of other nations so high, that war would become inevitable, with the obvious consequences. Pros and cons In short, even if not exhaustive, the previous paragraphs should have made you understand that Tropico 5 is a complex and articulated title, with dozens of assessments to be made and choices to be made in order not to let the state collapse and send the economy to the brim. In our opinion, Haemimont Games has done well in this case not to attempt coups by changing the foundations of a well-tested and functioning formula too much, which will certainly give great satisfaction to fans of the genre. However, some problems relating precisely to what is perhaps an excess of conservatism must be underlined. While on the one hand taking Tropico 3 and 4 and improving some aspects made it possible to avoid disasters like the latest SimCity, on the other hand the players of the previous chapters could find certain choices all too obvious. Let's also add that Tropico 3 and, above all, 4 are full of additional content, while Tropico 5 arrives quite smoothly from this point of view (DLC and expansions will certainly be produced, but for now there is only the base game). What does it mean? Simply that for lack of original elements, some may prefer to stay on the previous chapters, very similar in gameplay, before making the leap to the new one. However, it must be said that graphically a big step forward has been made compared to the past, with the city literally teeming with life, thanks to well-modeled buildings and well-animated men who are always in business. In short, there are several graphic gems of no small importance, given the genre (you can see the reflection of the million and more copies sold by Tropico 4 in the production). Could old players be enticed by the purely cosmetic aspects? Difficult to say when it comes to a strategic / management game, but in this case better graphics help you feel more empathy for your creature (and make some repressive choices more difficult), so it is an aspect that should not be underestimated.", "date": "2014-05-27", "grade": "8.0"}
