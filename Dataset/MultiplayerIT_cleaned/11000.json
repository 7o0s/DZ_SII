{"name": "Temple Run: Puzzle Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/temple-run-puzzle-adventure-recensione.html", "text": "Even the mobile sphere now has its pillars and among these we can easily place Temple Run, a reason that prompts us to look with some interest at this review of Temple Run: Puzzle Adventure, which proposes the title in a completely different form from what has been seen in the past. We can see a certain parallelism between the two games: the original took the already well-defined formula of the endless runner and perfected it with an excellent balance, interesting environments and good characterization. All this while inventing practically nothingAgain in this case we are far from an explosion of originality, given that Puzzle Adventure slavishly follows the standard of the match-3 style puzzle game, without trying to add or change anything significant, but putting in scene an excellent execution of the historical canon. The connection with the original is all in the setting, as well as a vague narrative basis that provides a minimal pretext for a succession of levels to be completed by associating gems of the same color. The story, reduced to a minimum, sees us follow the adventures of the archaeologist adventurer Scarlett Fox, who happened with us in a sort of parallel dimension full of treasures, traps and mysterious ruins. Together with two other characters, we must continue within the various scenarios by completing the levels in puzzle form, gradually collecting the number of stars necessary to advance, open doors, activate mechanisms and conquer chests full of gold and gems. There is no adventure structure, despite appearances: the narrative part, with the protagonists exploring the mysterious settings and ruins, is simply a sort of map to be automatically navigated as the puzzles progress, providing only a sort of common thread able to give some characterization to what is otherwise a somewhat impersonal puzzle. Gameplay and gem pairing Temple Run: Puzzle Adventure core mechanics requires the classic color gem pairing The mechanics of the gameplay is the classic one of the match-3 style puzzle game, proposing also in this case the return to the good old colored gems. Represented with simple and clean graphics, the plan of the puzzle phases is a sort of chessboard on which colored gems fall, which we must associate based on their color by creating rows of at least three identical gems or by arranging them in a square, with the possibility of moving them one adjacent square to the one they are initially in. Absolutely nothing new: also in this case the lever is on a mechanism that has now been tested by decades of videogame puzzle games, centered on the natural tendency of the human brain to find satisfaction, in some way, in tidying up and seeing rows of colored objects disappear , possibly by making chain combinations in order to maximize the score. To enhance the effects, it is possible to use various bombs and bonuses, as well as power-ups that can be activated as desired but in limited quantities, capable of freeing large areas of the game plan, in order to facilitate execution. Also in this case, objectives are set at the start of each level, usually linked to the elimination of certain quantities of gems of various colors, or to the conquest of gold and objects scattered within the levels, always through the disappearance of lines of surrounding gems. Temple Run: Puzzle Adventure features a map somewhat reminiscent of the original endless runner Everything must be achieved within a limited number of moves, which determines the real challenge of Temple Run: Puzzle Adventure, which in the more advanced levels can give you a hard time, after a decidedly easy introduction for everyone . In short, it is a game very similar to ZooKeeper World, another title recently introduced on Apple Arcade, but the latter proves to be more original in the continuous introduction of variants and additional challenge elements in each level, unlike Temple Run which instead sticks more faithfully to the classic tradition of match-3. As an undoubtedly positive element we must mention the total lack of microtransactions, forced waits and various traps from compulsive buying, given the distribution through Apple Arcade.", "date": "2021-09-22", "grade": "6.5"}
