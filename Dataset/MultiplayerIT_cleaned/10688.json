Proposed by FX Interactive as an ideal sequel to TIM, Crazy Machines 2 arrives on our monitors, focusing on the competitive price of 9.90 to try to win back old lovers of the aforementioned series but not only, opening the world of puzzle games to any aspiring to the role of mad inventors in a break between playing Call of Duty and another. Mad Scientists 2.0 In fact, in Crazy Machines 2 there is no other purpose than to use the tools that are made available to us to ensure that, through a chain of events, what is asked of us as the final goal happens on the screen: to send a ball to the basket , knock down pins, place other items in a certain area, and so on. It is no coincidence that the adjective ~crazy~ in the title of the game, given that among the 200 objects that we will find during our career as inventors there is a bit of everything: puppets, ropes, springs, ramps, barrels, boilers and dominoes are only a very small part of what we can use, not only to move forward in the single mode but also to create new laboratories to spread online so that other players connected to the network can download our crazy machines and play them on their own pc.

Wanting to find some defect, it can be noted how sometimes the solution thought up by the CPU (and by the developers) is rather messy compared to the one we found using even a few fewer pieces than expected, while also from the point of view of the final actions of the various machinery perhaps a pinch more variety could have been studied, rather than classics such as throwing the ball into the basket and the like. The technical point of view is obviously not a subject by which Crazy Machines 2 should be judged: suffice it to say however that the engine allows a good level of zoom and rotation of the camera on the objects on the screen, while the dubbing is completely in Italian, so like the written part.", "date": "2009-06-16", "grade": "7.0"}
