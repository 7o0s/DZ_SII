{"name": "Worms 2007", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worms-2007.html", "text": "Appropriately titled Worms 2007, this latest mobile incarnation of the historic Team 17 franchise presents itself to the public with the promise of making up for the deficiencies exhibited by its predecessors, in fact far less complete and brilliant specimens of the original. For those unfamiliar with Worms, it is enough to know that it is a mix of action and strategy, in which you have to take command of a team of four worms and destroy the opposing teams, moving the individual invertebrates in turn and making use of a well-stocked arsenal of improbable weapons. The action develops within two-dimensional scenarios, this time with richer graphics (while still remaining functional and unspectacular), especially as regards the tasty 3D backdrops that replace the dramatic voids of the prequel. Another point in favor of Worms 2007 is undoubtedly that of completeness, an aspect in which the mobile series had so far left something to be desired. Finally it is possible to count on a selection of weapons and equipment worthy of the name, including all the gadgets that have made the history of Worms: in addition to bazookas, machine guns, fireballs and explosive sheep, there are also very useful gadgets such as jetpacks or grappling hooks, which prove their usefulness especially in multiplayer sessions. And that's certainly the best part of Worms 2007, thanks to a pass-and-play system that fits perfectly with the pace of the action and allows up to four players to happily blow themselves up. That said, even when enjoyed alone the Rockpool work proves to be a good pastime: although more could certainly have been done to make the single player more exciting, the strong AI of the opponents controlled by the CPU always allows you to give rise to battles exciting. Instead, what really turns up the nose of the THQ Wireless production is the game speed, really too low: the worms move on the screen in slow motion, dilating beyond measure the time necessary to perform any activity and removing a bit of bite from the experience. It should also be said that, essentially offering nothing new, this Worms 2007 could be a little unpopular with those who already know the series, who during its ?? years of life has hardly changed one iota... PRO The best Worms for mobile Renewed graphics with 3D backdrops Great for multiplayer AGAINST Very slow pace of play No trace of innovation Single player a bit thin", "date": "2007-08-27", "grade": "S.V."}
