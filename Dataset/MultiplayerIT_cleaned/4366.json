When the first game arrived on the Nintendo DS, it was hailed as one of the most original experiences in years, and in some ways it still is. The Scribblenauts formula was and has remained intuitive, once all the frills added over time have been removed. We think of a word, type it, and the object materializes in the game world. Much of the fun is there: thinking about what we could conjure up out of nowhere to fix a given situation. The most important additions of the sequels were the introduction of adjectives to enrich the gameplay possibilities, and the ability to connect objects to each other. Scribblenauts Unlimited was the final point of this evolution: more could not be done in a game like this. Not without distorting it, at least. That was fine. Then someone had the brilliant idea of taking Scribblenauts, with its friendly and colorful atmospheres, and turning it into a party game. It seems that the step from puzzle game to party game is shorter than we thought. All right, but where's the Scribblenauts? We're sitting at the table, a challenge to the last course where the winner is whoever manages to eat all the contents of their plate first. By shaking the left analogue we swallow the meal, with the R2 backbone we swallow the bite before the indicator fills up too much, with the risk of vomiting everything. Exhausted, we manage to balance the commands and finish lunch before the opponent, who collapses exhausted on the table. We won the first Scribblenauts minigame: Showdown, one of many offered by the production. All right, but where's the Scribblenauts? Scribblenauts is a container, a huge cauldron from which to easily withdraw objects and nice situations with which to spice up mini-games that otherwise would seem trivial from the beginning. The series has its own recognizable style, animated and inanimate beings who always manage to elicit a smile; maybe even just remembering the good old days when we simply had to solve riddles and situations, thinking about the right word at the right time. The initial menu welcomes us with its good dose of colors, and few icons on the screen. Impossible to go wrong: two of the three game modes proposed consist of hit and run mini-games, the third is a Scribblenauts Unlimited cut and paste together as hastily as possible. We'll talk about this later, let's focus now on the party game essence of the production, on which the greatest number of resources has been invested. The first game mode proposed is called Versus. One name, one program: connect the second controller to the console, select the number of matches needed to win, and start tackling one minigame after another. We can choose whether the challenge should be based on ~words~ or on ~speed~, or on both together. In reality, the difference is very minimal, since all minigames require the right amount of quick reflexes and speed, rather than actual skill. In the ~words~ mode we try to somehow save what is the philosophy of Scribblenauts, or the power of verbal imagination. For example, in the delicacy-based challenge we mentioned above, the game asks you to choose what the two contenders will have to eat. If the theme is ~desert animals~ we can type ~Scorpion~, or ~Crocodile~. Some words bring obvious advantages, because a scorpion is smaller than a crocodile, so it's quicker to eat it. But do not think that the strategy is so important, the cases in which it is really required are few. And in any case, the presence of the Word mode is a mere pretext for trying to combine the philosophy of the series with the party game, without succeeding too much. The challenges of the Versus mode remain pleasant, quick and painless: in an evening with friends they can offer some entertainment. What is not convincing is their limited number (there are about thirty), their basic repetitiveness, the controls that are not always reliable and practical, and in general their being entrusted more to chance than to the skill of the players. With the second game mode proposed it goes a little better, and we can't understand why it wasn't thought of as the basis of the entire title. It is ~Sfissa finale~, a hybrid between the Gioco dell'Oca and a card game. At each turn a card is drawn and one is played from one's hand: our character moves to the squares of a board and we must reach its end before the others. Some cards allow us to advance, others make our opponents retreat. Obviously, here too the goal is to shine the spotlight on the mini-games: so that the carIf the bet has value we must win the proposed party game, otherwise the bonus will be used by our opponent. The idea behind it works and the mode offers its fair share of fun. Of course, if you play alone against the artificial intelligence, the title loses almost all of its raison d'tre. And there is always that little background voice insinuating that Scribblenauts: Showdown is just a pretext to offer a series of mini-games of not always convincing quality. Playstation 4 trophies Scribblenauts: Showdown offers players the chance to take home a nice Platinum Trophy. This is not too much of a challenge, just play and replay all the mini-games and accumulate quite a few Starites. By unlocking all the collectibles of the title one at a time, we will also automatically unlock most of the trophies. There are no achievements to unlock online, and those to be earned in local multiplayer should also be obtainable by simply playing against the AI. At the very least, connect a second controller and you're done. Not just multiplayer If Scribblenauts: Showdown is certainly a title designed to be played in the company of friends, this does not mean that Maxwell and his Starites have been thrown into a corner forever. Therefore, the third (and on balance last) game mode is the Sandbox one. Read: the repurposing of the contents of Scribblenauts Unlimited, shredded, varied, but not so much as to make them unrecognizable. We move between different environments, inhabited by funny creatures, animals and human beings of all kinds. Our task is to guide Maxwell within a small platform level, fulfilling the wishes of those present. Very often the situations are hilarious and improbable, and for this very reason effective: we are in the jungle and a poor native cries in front of the fire because he needs a mushroom? Just type the word ~mushroom~ with the controller in hand, and we can make him happy. The mechanics are that of the puzzle game, each goal achieved corresponds to a reward in Starite, or bright stars; we can then spend them to buy a whole rich series of contents with which to vary the other game modes. And here Scribblenauts: Showdown is back biting its tail. It features a Sandbox mode to remind you that Scribblenauts is more than just a jumble of mini-games. But in turn the Sandbox mode serves to accumulate Starite with which to unlock accessories, characters, ~words~ to be used in the mini-games, and then you start all over again. Up to a certain point, the idea of using the stars to unlock new animals and objects can be good, to materialize by saying the respective word. In fact, these are not common materials, but often exotic: in this way one could even say that one gets to enrich one's vocabulary, to learn new terms or the existence of animal species that we do not know. Especially if played in the company of children, this is a feature that makes sense. It's the whole stage that doesn't convince. Scribblenauts: Showdown can't help but seem like an opportunity to take advantage of a famous series to offer something that remains very far from it. And the minigames present aren't even good enough to justify a spin-off. Even the audio tracks are taken from the previous installments of the franchise.", "date": "2018-03-09", "grade": "6.0"}
