{"name": "Ricercato: vivo o morto!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wanted.html", "text": "~Wanted~, the film with James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman, just released in cinemas, tells the story of Wesley Gibson, an ordinary boy (indeed, more nerd than the average), who one day is in a car with Fox, a professional killer, as beautiful as she is deadly. Fox tells him the truth about his father: he didn't die when Wesley was small, but abandoned him and his mother because his job was incompatible with starting a family. Wesley's father was the world's best killer, and someone just took him out. Now he has the chance to take her place, abandoning the mediocrity of his life to join the Brotherhood, a secret organization that deals with the fate of the world. Anyone who has read the comic miniseries ~Wanted~, from which the film is based, knows how much the story has been changed to be able to transform it into a cinematic product. The exceptional work of Mark Millar (who together with Brian Michael Bendis is one of the authors responsible for the latest Marvel successes), also published in Italy, showed us in fact a fraternity, yes, but of super-villains, to which Wesley joins to change life and that in a few years has eliminated every superhero on the planet... This tie-in, developed by I-play, is an action game that winks at past masterpieces (Flashback, Prince of Persia...) as far as the ~platform~ setting is concerned. In the role of Wesley, we will have to follow the events on which the film is based and eliminate all the enemies present in the stages, thanks to the two pistols that make up our equipment. The character can walk, run, jump, climb, roll, shoot pistols, or slash enemies' throats with a knife if close enough to the target. A truly enviable set of actions, decidedly above the average of mobile video games, which is accompanied for the first time by a ~direction~ up to the situation: each level is introduced by a very well done comic sequence, which explains what we have to do to reach the next area. The standard setting is sometimes replaced by alternative and spectacular sections, in which Wesley runs automatically and we will simply have to press certain buttons so that he doesn't stop and can hit the target. In other cases, the entire numeric keypad can be used to frame enemies, with the character firing his projectiles while jumping, causing them to rotate their trajectory until they reach the target. If the sound sector of the game leaves something to be desired, the same certainly cannot be said of the graphics: the developers have done an excellent job, from every point of view. The aforementioned ~direction~ during the pre-calculated sequences, but also the excellent and numerous animations of Wesley, as well as a level design that does not shine due to the size of the locations but which never falls below a certain quality level. Most of the enemies are maybe a little nondescript, but that's no big deal. The control system always performs very well, with innovative solutions and a punctual and precise response to inputs.
