With Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, the new expansion via DLC for Gearbox's beautiful Borderlands, the company headed by Randy Pitchford once again confirms its desire to extend as much as possible the life cycle of the popular RPG shooter which, one year after its release, evidently it is still enjoying success in the PC, PS3 and 360 communities. With a Borderlands 2 more than probable but never officially announced, the path of downloadable content has therefore been traveled several times through additions that have however demonstrated a decidedly fluctuating quality: discreet in the case of Dr. Ned's Zombie Island, bad with Moxxi's Underdome Riot, great for General Knoxx. So let's find out where this latest Claptrap's New Robot Revolution is destined to be positioned... Long live Robolution! The narrative background for this new DLC features the Claptraps as protagonists, nice and peaceful little robots who had represented one of the most appreciated side elements during the main adventure; evidently tired of being perpetually exploited and mistreated by humans, the Claptraps therefore decided to organize themselves in a real revolution that was anything but peaceful led by the fearsome Ninja Assassin, who had turned against his creators of the Hyperion Corporation. The player's aim is therefore to quell the revolt, eliminating the leader before the situation becomes irrecoverable. A funny and humorous incipit, a fact that transpires continuously playing Claptrap's New Robot Revolution; not only for the improbable interlude skits or for the return of old ~robotic~ enemies for the occasion, but above all for the flood of Claptraps armed to the teeth and redesigned for the occasion with helmets, uniforms and so on, looking to give them that aggressive look that they really can't have. And so the first minutes spent at Tartarus Station, reachable as always via the teleporters scattered throughout the game world, are all in all pleasant and auspicious; pity that instead then continuing in the adventure, it becomes more and more evident how this new DLC constitutes more a filler made quite listlessly than a valid and robust addition to the Take 2 production. The reasons are many and start first of all from the structure of the missions made available: a slice of them is in fact linked to the repetitive and far from exciting collection of an ever-increasing number of ~robot pieces~, obviously to be recovered from the wreckage of the Claptrap destroyed. A structure that recalls that of the brains of Zombies on Dr. Ned's island, a far cry from the more epic and amusing raids experienced on Pandora. Fortunately, there are also more complex and structured challenges to be met in the sadly desolate and semi-deserted area of the station and then faced in the surrounding areas; in none of them, however, is a qualitative level above the sufficiency perceived, with linear objectives and more generally a level design that is never particularly inspired or exciting. A sensation strengthened by the graphic component, which rests on locations devoid of personality, already seen and distinguished by repetitive and monotonous chromatic patterns. But the biggest problem, and what basically determines the unenthusiastic judgment for this Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, is linked to the fact that there are no real incentives to tackle it for anyone who has already reached the level cap of 61; and considering the fact that the potential buyers of this DLC are expert players who have already completed the entire main adventure, it is quite simple to bring back precisely to this target those who will play the expansion in question. Yes, because the spark, the fulcrum that drives playing Borderlands has always been the feeling of progress, the constant growth of one's character, the desire to improve its characteristics step by step; Claptrap's New Robot Revolution adds nothing in this sense, neither a new level cap, nor skill points, nor particularly attractive loot. Finally, the level of difficulty for a team of players at 61 and with good weapons is really too low. Let me be clear, the announced free patch intended to increase the level cap up to level 69 could certainly put a more than partial remedy to the defects of this last DLC and make it immediately more attractive and sensible. But in the current state of things, Claptrap's New Robot Revolution is definitely not a purchase to be made with your eyes closed even by the most hardcore fans of the Gearbox title.", "date": "2010-10-13", "grade": "6.5"}
