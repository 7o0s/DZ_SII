{"name": "Ascesa al trono", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73836-europa-universalis-iii-heir-to-the-throne-ascesa-al-trono.html", "text": "Europa Universalis III is a great strategy game. A very broad game that allows us to act in detail and to lead our nation by paying attention to an incredible variety of aspects. There are no real turns but days, months and years, although obviously specific units of time decide how long it takes for a unit to move. The Paradox-branded title has practically no competitors and can count on a passionate user who literally craves the formula of Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron. Difficult therefore to disappoint but there is always room for improvement. A margin that Heir To The Throne wants to overcome given the abundance of innovations developed by the guys from Paradox. Some additions concern the trade system, others refine the title as had already happened with the two previous expansions and a good part of the changes is intended to improve the diplomatic sphere. The faces of power By increasing the specificity of diplomatic exchanges, the unique historical breadth of the series is further enriched. States add to the religious, political and cultural areas of influence and the importance of political capital increases. The Holy Roman Empire, for example, can spend points of imperial authority instead of money to obtain political advantages or to increase the efficiency of institutions. Even the empire can turn into a state or a monarchy which is now dynastic and must take into account the legitimacy of the heirs. A kingdom without heirs is in fact managed by a council that cannot declare war and a kingdom commanded by a royal bastard could have several internal stability problems. The type of government and the chosen nation thus offer a truly unique dimension of the game, on the one hand peculiar and historically contextualized and on the other even richer in choices and possibilities. The will to replace base money with a much more valuable and specific currency and above all historically contextualized is evident. In fact, papal influence replaces the possibility of bribing the College of Cardinals to ~direct~ the election of a new Pope, while cultural tradition, gained through cultural decisions, allows for the direct acquisition of new advisers. Advisors can now be selected to get the desired bonuses and are no longer random. Other types of human resources, such as ambassadors or magistrates, can also be educated to respond to the needs of the country. Magistrates in particular are quite difficult to assemble and their number depends on the universities of our kingdom. The number of magistrates represents a real currency with which to implement decisions such as the construction of roads or infrastructures, essential for increasing the country's modifiers. Diplomatic weapons Always on the historical side we find the casus belli and a significant increase in specific events and decisions that represent historical events that we can activate in relation to the faction we manage. The casus belli, already introduced by Paradox in the series, have finally increased in number and each different case has a different outcome. These are events that provide a justification for declaring war and are essential to maintain high morale and stability and to lower the score necessary to obtain more advantages from a possible peace treaty. On the mercantile level we find the possibility of creating commercial alliances, new functions for the maritime republics and agreements to obtain supplies of exclusive materials. Furthermore, by designating a province as the national focus of trade, an action possible every 25 years, it is possible to obtain various benefits and build a new Trading Center there. Exchange Centers are essential to increase the network of commerce and to sell monopoly goods but they can also disappear if the monetary devaluation is excessive. Defeated units do not flee eternally but surrender as soon as morale fails and this fortunately also affects pirates who can be defeated without incurring really excessive losses of time. Wars are still fought pawn against pawn and the battlefield can only be imagined by looking at the curves of the map. It is certainly a precise choice of the series but it is inevitable to wonder why Paradox has not invested a few more resources to improve the game map by not having to manage demanding three-dimensional engines. The engine of Europa Universalis III has in fact remained 3 years ago and already at the time it was certainly not a graphics-devouring monster. Luckily at least the terrible whiteness that covered the uncolonizable terrains has disappeared and the interface has been retouchedhere and there to enhance the overall experience. For example, there is now a single window for data relating to your country and a new geopolitical map has been introduced which highlights areas at risk of rioting. Also invaluable is the new tooltip that reminds us of decisions or innovations available, reducing downtime to the bone. The flaws are mainly technical but beyond the few bugs the title runs smoothly on a large variety of systems. Multiplayer Europa Universalis III multiplayer allows 32 players to divide the fate of the globe. Cooperation and competitive spirit make it possible to organize real contexts divided into sessions. It is not a question of simple matches but of shared campaigns where the participants often play a role trying to coherently manage a country or respecting the historical guidelines of the same. Heir To The Throne's diplomatic and evolutionary additions are particularly effective in these types of games.", "date": "2010-01-21", "grade": "8.7"}
