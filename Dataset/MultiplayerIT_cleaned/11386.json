{"name": "Livingstone: Lost Again", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/livingstone-lost-again.html", "text": "The adventure genre has definitely lost its way, both on PC and on consoles, and it is sad to see that classics like Another World or Flashback have not had a sequel in the current gaming scene. While there remains the hope of seeing something like this developed with today's technologies, we cannot ignore the contribution that mobile gaming also makes in this sense, with a series of titles that take up the very concepts introduced by Delphine Software several years ago. In the case of Livingstone: Lost Again we have a different structure compared to the products just mentioned, but we are in all respects faced with a classic-style adventure, with numerous platform elements, in which the protagonist can perform numerous maneuvers to avoid traps and defeat the enemy on duty. The game consists of a series of levels to be tackled in sequence, characterized by increasing difficulty both due to the presence of increasingly numerous traps or chasms, and due to the addition of new enemies. Our Henry Stanley can walk, crawl, jump and climb ledges or plants, attacking his opponents with whips. The whip is also useful in the presence of holds, to anchor to and then swing towards the goal. The internships are quite short, they confront us with a series of problems to solve and set a goal to be achieved (for example the collection of a certain number of objects), after which we move on to the map and the next location. In short, all the classic elements of mobile video games are there, in this case you can complete the game little by little and through short matches, when you have some time available. The control system is excellent, both as regards the response to inputs (always immediate), and as regards the organization of the keys: it is possible to do everything with the joystick, calling into question key 5 only when it is necessary fight. Even in those situations, the game performs very well: collision detection is precise, and enemies follow fairly simple and predictable behavior patterns. The technical realization is excellent. The main character has a good set of animations and moves convincingly, even if we are far from the fluidity achieved by some titles released some time ago. Let's say that quantity, in this case, makes up for quality: Henry walks, crawls, jumps and climbs, thus boasting a respectable sample of movements and decidedly above average. The design is really well done, there are no sprites drawn less well than others: the style is always homogeneous, and the locations are a bit repetitive but beautiful to look at, with an excellent use of colours. The sound is composed of some MIDI music that leaves the tempo they find, accompanied however by very nice sampled effects. Unfortunately, their reproduction causes noticeable slowdowns on some terminals, in which case it is better to give them up and turn off the audio. Finally, the control system is simple, immediate and well organized. PRO Very pretty graphics Effective control system Proven play structure AGAINST Very short internships Sound effects can cause slowdowns Animations anything but smooth", "date": "2008-06-04", "grade": "S.V."}
