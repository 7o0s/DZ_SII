For this reason, ~game makers~ always exert a very special charm, but to fulfill their hybrid function they must be particularly fascinating and easy to use, as well as fun, if we are talking about products that are first and foremost video games. It is clear how WonderWorlds owes a lot to LittleBigPlanet, the particular work of Media Molecule that shook the world upon its release on PlayStation 3 for the characterization and the concept which at the time were something truly innovative, at least on consoles. This Glowmade product, developed in collaboration with Tequila Works, shares several characteristics with the famous title in question, starting from some elements of the graphic characterization to get to the game's mechanics, curiously also bringing with it some historical defects of the series. WonderWorlds is a sort of adventure with platform elements, represented in 3D and with a slightly tilted overhead view, in order to give a good overview of the beautiful worlds that we find ourselves exploring. The purpose of the whole, as regards the more properly playful section, is to reach the conclusion of the levels, in the case by collecting clouds and other scattered objects in order to push users to carefully explore every nook and cranny of the scenarios, advancing from island to island. The game is distributed for free but to unlock all the elements that make it up, including levels and objects for creation, it is necessary to resort to the in-app purchase of 4.49 euros which provides free access to all the contents, so you can speak of a sort of ~Masked Premium~ that still allows a large space to freely try the game for free. Wonderful worlds in the palm of your hand with WonderWorlds LittleBigWorld The worlds of WonderWorlds are splendid: they are simple scenarios composed of platforms, bridges, gears, plains, heights and passages of various types, but all represented with a particular care in the rendering of materials, as if each scenario were composed of cardboard, fabric or other elements for the artisanal construction of settings and miniatures. Also in this the call of LittleBigPlanet is visible, which had proposed a similar solution for the representation of the levels in which to set the action of the Sackboys. Like the latter, the protagonist of the game Glowmade can be completely customized by changing his characteristics and applying clothes and accessories as desired, just as the ~house~ that functions as a connection base between the various game modes can be filled, embellished and modified with many different graphics. The distinctive element of WonderWorlds is in fact all in creativity at its power: it is possible to build worlds starting from nothing, fill them with scenarios and gameplay elements by dedicating ourselves to a real level design work, to then save and share our creations with other players. This obviously ensures a wide variety of choices and possibilities as regards the quantity and quality of the levels to be tackled, however it necessarily carries with it a negative aspect: the creativity of WonderWorlds hardly brings out a truly deep and structured level design, focusing on a limited amount of elements and a rather simple mechanics, problem shared on the other hand also by LittleBigPlanet and other similar titles. Another negative element curiously common to the Media Molecule title is a certain imprecision and woodiness of the controls, in particular as regards the mechanics of the jump, which can make the platform sections somewhat annoying. The aesthetics are still wonderful and can be enough to carry us forward to explore levels just for the sake of it, managing to infuse characters and environments with a charisma that easily involves us.", "date": "2017-11-16", "grade": "8.4"}
