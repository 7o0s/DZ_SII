{"name": "WWE Aftershock", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-aftershock.html", "text": "Shock without After Right from the very first bars, WWE: Aftershock is certainly not striking for stylistic merits: the design of the menus and screens is terribly tacky, and the Italian translation of several words is approximate to say the least. But in the end what matters are the game modes, which in the THQ product amount to four, each with different degrees of customization that can be performed by the user: these are the classic one-on-one Exhibition, a tournament called King of The Ring, the inevitable Survival and finally the famous Tag Team. If this aspect is all in all average, the same cannot be said of the quantity of selectable characters and arenas: just ten (plus two bonuses) in the first case and a pittance of three in the second. A poverty that would be acceptable if WWE: Aftershock was a game characterized by excellent graphics and gameplay that rose to the occasion. Which the THQ product is nowhere near. The most obvious, macroscopic gap concerns the cosmetics department, capable of touching peaks of baseness that know few equals within the N-Gage panorama. Starting with the three-dimensional models of the athletes, characterized by a literally ridiculous polygon count and a total lack of definition of body details: to make a comparison, one could almost say that the characters of the first Alone in The Dark (dated 1992) were more realistic. Even the animations are something unspeakable, they are so woody, unnatural and anachronistic. And the situation certainly does not improve with regard to the surrounding elements: the rings are basic at most, while the public is represented by -attention- a strip of texture with an ignoble definition arranged in a spiral, with a trick as naive as it is horrible to look at. The roundup is closed by a disastrous use of some ~special effects~, of 2D compositions with the marked tendency to disappear from the screen for no apparent reason. Wanting to really look for an aspect of the graphics of WWE: Aftershock that is not seriously insufficient, one could mention the entrances on stage of the various wrestlers, faithful to the originals. The rest is pure and simple technical garbage. The fist to the side If from a visual point of view WWE: Aftershock turns out to be embarrassing in no uncertain terms, the playful sector of the THQ product is no less, which makes its leitmotif of littleness. The control system contemplates the use of almost all the keys of the N-Gage, but in the end there are only four attacks that can be carried out, which moreover it is not possible to fit together in order to create combos. Basically WWE: Aftershock is played like this: you hit your opponent using the only button dedicated to blows (kicks, punches, headbutts and so on), after which you make a couple of holds (always the same), you throw him to the ground and submit. Four buttons for four basic functions which do not show any variation from one meeting to the next. WWE: Aftershock is, precisely for this reason, one of the most boring and silly games available on N-Gage, and which also boasts the display of one of the worst AI ever seen in a video game: the opponents are real puppets , which allow themselves to be filled with punches by the user without almost ever launching a rapid and / or dangerous reaction. It is almost more fun to face the training dummies present in the training mode than any fighting game in matches. In short, WWE: Aftershock is such a poor title in terms of quality that it doesn't even make sense to talk about longevity or fun factor, because they are completely foreign concepts to THQ production. The only element that is saved by the skin of a ruthless rejection is the sound sector, which can count on a decidedly spot on hard-rock musical accompaniment but which at the same time presents effects that are not exactly realistic. Comment WWE: Aftershock is a seriously insufficient title in practically every aspect: starting from an absolutely unthinkable graphic design nowadays on a platform like N-Gage up to an almost unclassifiable gameplay, it is so flat and basic in terms of its mechanics and boring because of an AI really at historic lows. An acceptable sound sector and the presence of the wrestlers' original entrances on stage are the only two  derisory  points in favor of a product that we wouldn't feel like recommending even to the most ardent lover of Chris Benoit and his associates' sport. Pros Original wrestlers revenue Acceptable sound Cons Horrible graphics Poor gameplay Few characters and arenas Wrestling games have become a well-established genre on home consoles, especially thanks to the return of fiambut of the public towards this discipline: as far as handhelds are concerned, however, the affinity with this type of production has never been the best, if one considers the relatively limited number of titles and above all their often questionable quality. And it will certainly not be this WWE: Aftershock for N-Gage to lead the turnaround ...", "date": "2006-02-16", "grade": null}
