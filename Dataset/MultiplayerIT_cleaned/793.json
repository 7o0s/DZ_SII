{"name": "Colin McRae Rally 2005 Plus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/colin-mcrae-rally-2005-plus.html", "text": "Stairway to Colin If good morning starts in the morning, since the first menu screens Colin Mcrae rally 2005 promises well: the programmers have done an excellent job by making choices more oriented towards a modern design, completely eliminating any useless addition in terms of animations; the screenshots are simple, direct, color correct, and well thought out. The methods that accompany this new chapter are -unfortunately- the same as always: in the first, the so-called 'challenge' the player will have the opportunity to put himself to the test and train on the track he prefers, in the weather conditions he has chosen, with the possibility to choose from the best-stocked fleet of cars in the entire world rally of today and yesterday. This first classic mode is joined by the 'championship', a true battleground for one's rallying skills: here things get complicated, elements such as setting up the cars, repairs at the end of the race, adverse road conditions come into play. terrain and weather, the race against an opponent you can't see except in the always too rapid pace of the stopwatch. To close the triptych is the 'career' mode, undoubtedly the most interesting and long-lived: the player will impersonate the figure of the neophyte rally driver who, retracing the footsteps of Colin's success in an escalation of races, will lead him to compete in the highest leagues with Mr McRae himself. This mode is divided into many small rally categories, each one different from the other due to the cars used (the criteria vary from the engine capacity to the traction of the car...) and which will assign points useful for unlocking more and more cars and routes. In the two competitive modes (career and championship) the real key to obtaining victory will be the setting operations reserved for the car, along the course of the championship it will be possible to increase the performance of your vehicle simply by completing special driving missions differentiated between various components: to improve the brakes and therefore acquire a more advanced version, it will be necessary to cover a short stretch of road avoiding the pins and braking in the exact area indicated; to improve the gearbox system it will be enough to demonstrate that you are able to keep a certain number of engine revolutions for a certain amount of time... The challenge is complete, mature and exciting: the slightest mistake, the slightest distraction, the wrong interpretation of an indication from your navigator, everything contributes to creating a palpable state of tension as the infinite curves of the paths unwind. And if that weren't enough, the very plausible physics of the cars take over: the modifications made in preparation for the rally effectively and decisively influence the outcome of the race, a wrong setting will make the car undriveable and perhaps visible and invisible damage. A practical example above all regarding this cause-effect chain: if the height of the bodywork and the hardness of the shock absorbers are set incorrectly, there may be repercussions on the state of the wheels which, if ignored, will lead to them bursting and losing stability and speed , forcing the player to say goodbye too soon to their dreams of glory. Stairway to Colin Graphically speaking, Colin Mcrae has nothing to envy to his home counterparts: the graphics are clean and accurate down to the smallest detail, the ruts caused by a burst wheel are clearly visible on the ground, as are the sparks from the rims on the asphalt, the lights are reflected in the puddles of water and the snow is marked by the passage of the car. The tracks are not limited to the simple road body, they allow the player an interesting freedom of movement, choice and correction of a trajectory (more than once it will happen to slip into the thick of the wood marveling at the lack of the never mourned invisible walls). Colin Mcrae's world is largely perishable: the signs are knocked down by the passage of a wrong interpretation of the curve, trees and stones create a real obstacle to driving the inexperienced player and the fences are easily knocked down; everything contributes to giving the game greater credibility, succeeding perfectly in the intent. Satisfying, well made, realistic and graphically of excellent workmanship, this would be enough to judge a game that, despite risking little in terms of originality, certainly stands as one of the most complete and truthful rally videogame experiences. The only real or presumed flaw can be represented by the high difficulty set in the game, but in a period in which longevity is only the least of the priorities, a game that makes you sweat can only be a touch.ana. If you are passionate about this little big world, I advise you not to miss this Colin McRae, otherwise take a look at it anyway. The psp confirms itself as a stronghold for the racing game world with, just one month after its release, three games of undoubted value: Wipeout, Ridge Racer and this Colin. There is much hope for the future. Pros Stylistically well packaged Realistic Long lasting Undoubtedly very challenging Cons There is nothing new compared to the previous chapters Sometimes it is not very clear where to go Undoubtedly very challenging Every self-respecting sport has an icon on its side, an almost legendary character whose sporting exploits work as a media vehicle for their discipline, opening the doors of knowledge and notoriety to the public. It is not uncommon for these sports personalities to also become holders of videogame franchises: in the past this was the case for the great Wayne Gretzky, best assistman in the NHL league for a decade and undisputed protagonist of video games since the 16bit era; another striking case is that of the very young Tiger Wood who at the age of 18 could boast a bank account worthy of the Guinness Book of Records and a video game linked to him thanks to Electronic Arts. Obviously Colin Mcrae also belongs to this category who, as the undisputed champion of the late 90s, remained the standard-bearer of a game that has now reached its second portable experience, the first on a Sony portable.", "date": "2005-10-22", "grade": null}
