{"name": "Tenchu 4: Shadow Assassins - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tenchu-4-shadow-assassins-recensione.html", "text": "Tenchu 4: Shadow Assassins is a product that immediately aroused the curiosity of many, for two main reasons: firstly, it marked the return to the series of the original developers of the first chapter (far better than the numerous sequels), and secondly it was released exclusively on Wii, which certainly shouldn't be underestimated considering the questionable condition of the Nintendo console in terms of quality software. Casual ninjas Tenchu 4: Shadow Assassins leaves aside the bizarre experiments of some unfortunate chapters of the series, and returns to placing the ninja Rikimaru and Ayame as absolute protagonists, engaged in a ~new~ adventure: the quotation marks are however a must, as the The story of a kidnapped princess to be saved is certainly not original, nor does it contribute to making the plot of the Acquire work particularly interesting. However, it must be said that the cutscenes are of a good standard, and partially compensate for the obvious shortcomings in terms of narrative involvement: sure, listening to ninjas dubbed by actors with a very strong English accent has a certain effect, but nothing scandalous. Returning to the actual game, Tenchu 4: Shadow Assassins offers ten missions in which the user alternately takes on the role of one or the other protagonist, it being understood that the differences between the two stop at mere aesthetics. As it is legitimate to imagine, almost all of the situations proposed in the game require you to go from point A to point B without being discovered by the guards, killing them or simply avoiding them: compared to the previous episodes, however, Shadow Assassins comes with a series of peculiar characteristics , to be honest not always positive. The stealth phase itself has been enriched in some respects and impoverished in others: we therefore have the possibility of moving underwater by breathing through a bamboo cane, but the exploration of the roofs has been almost completely removed; again, a special view called Mind's Eye can be used to guess the position of the enemies and their movements, but the levels offer at most a couple of options to get the better of the opponents, limiting the user's decision-making freedom. The attempt to approach the casual user typical of the Nintendo console is also evident: beyond a marked visual underlining of the gray areas where to hide, Tenchu 4: Shadow Assassins has stages divided into various segments of fairly short duration, but which allow you not to have to go back too far in case you are discovered by an enemy. And yes, because in this case, we witness a short cutscene that shows our hero disappearing in a cloud of smoke, only to reappear unharmed at the beginning of the sub-level in question. The story changes if you are momentarily in possession of a sword: in this case, the game switches to first person and the user must hold the Remote as if it were a sword, deflecting the opponent's blows and slicing his opponent well: a 'interesting idea unfortunately ruined by the fact that frankly excessively short reaction times are required, and which therefore very often are not respected, leading to the loss of the fight. Beautiful at night Another sore point of Tenchu 4: Shadow Assassins is the control system, or rather the on-screen behavior of the hero on duty: the series has never stood out for its merits in this area, but on Wii it would have been reasonable to expect something more. Rikimaru and Ayame move in a slow and woody way, and their ability to jump is so badly implemented as to be almost unusable: not only that, but every single acrobatic action puts the player at risk of being identified by the guards, effectively making them unusable. In general, it can be said that the exploitation of the peculiar Wii control system alternates valid proposals with decidedly unsatisfactory solutions: moving Nunchuck and Remote to kill an opponent is a good thing, but much less having to use the directional cross and not the motion sensor for aiming thrown weapons. And it is a pity that the Acquire title has similar defects, because there is really a lot of meat in the fire: in addition to the ten challenging missions of the Story Mode, the game offers a series of bonus stages to be unlocked as the adventure continues main event, as well as a variety of extras given as a reward for particularly high rankings. Furthermore, it is difficult to criticize Tenchu 4: Shadow Assassins as regards the technical realization, especially since we are talking about hardware such as the Wii: while certainly not among the most capable teams in this area, the Acquire developers have managed to equip their product of a cosmeticsi solida, in which the excellent polygonal models of protagonists and enemies and their animations, both facial and body, stand out. Even the settings - although always rather small in size - make a good impression, and there is even room for some graphic gems, such as the effects that distinguish the Mind's Eye mode. Comment Tenchu 4: Shadow Assassins does not turn out to be a failed product like too many sequels before him, but at the same time it fails to give that decisive breakthrough that would have done so much good for the franchise. Very valid from a technical point of view, the Acquire title is however the victim of various unhappy gameplay choices, daughters above all of the (unrealizable?) desire to satisfy both harcore and casual gamers, with the final result of not fully satisfying either of the two categories. At least the series seems to be back on the right track, in the hope that the foundations laid by Shadow Assassins will be better exploited in the future...
