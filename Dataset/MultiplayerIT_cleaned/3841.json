{"name": "Wargroove: la nostra recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wargroove-recensione.html", "text": "It is now clear that Switch is an out of the ordinary console, and we are certainly not just talking about the stratospheric numbers it has managed to obtain in stores: its hybrid nature automatically makes it a sort of mystical artifact in the eyes of an old Nintendo fan data, a machine where the glories of the Japanese company can coexist in peace, regardless of whether they belong to the history of its fixed consoles or that of portables. This concept, in some ways, has been confirmed by the great N itself, which has already given new life to many of its most famous brands by exploiting the potential of this curious creature, and has announced its intention to make it the new home of titles historically linked to a double thread to the ~classic~ portables, such as Pokmon and Fire Emblem. Among the many names already confirmed, those sadly stumbled upon in the many obstacles of development (Metroid, alas...) and those that still belong to the fantasies of gamers, however, one particularly loved by strategy enthusiasts is missing: Advance Wars. And for those who do not know what we are talking about, know that it is a splendid turn-based strategy born from the same Intelligent Systems of the Fire Emblem mentioned above, and whose success in our parts has in some ways ensured that the wonderful fantasy series was published in West. Now, Advance Wars certainly didn't boast the intricacies of modern Fire Emblems, but the wonderful balance of its mechanics, the intuitiveness of its formula, and the perfect management of its campaign have made it a small cult, whose last ~official~ legacy it was that Battalion Wars that had very little to do with the original titles of the saga (and lacking the Intelligent Systems at the reins). With hardware like Switch available, therefore, the time was ripe for its return, and with the parent company determined to continue on the path of Fire Emblem with ~Three Houses~, the British developers jumped on the project: those Chucklefish to whom we owe the controversial Starbound, as well as various other quality video games in the form of publishers. Wargroove is the name of this spiritual successor to Advance Wars and, despite a very different setting from modern wars, we assure you that it is worth keeping an eye on. Fantasy light, with a dark premise Wargroove opens with the murder of a ruler, and a young princess suddenly forced to save her land from a fearsome threat. An epic fantasy preamble, which can easily give birth to unpredictable and dramatic situations like never before. Yet the purpose of the Chucklefish was the creation of a title as close as possible to the Advance Wars, as explained, and if we exclude only Days of Ruin, the Nintendo series has always painted the war with light and playful tones, rarely hanging the tip the balance towards tragedy. The events that see the courageous Queen Mercia protagonist, therefore, almost immediately take a comic turn, underlined by undead warriors who cannot accept defeat, commanding dogs capable of saving entire inhabited centers from bandits, and by a very simple narrative line, where most of the clashes arise from the total communicative incapacity of the protagonists or from ridiculous mistakes. It is a sensible choice once contextualized to the nature of the production, therefore we cannot fail to appreciate it, even if we would have liked a more original background plot. All that we have described above serves only to propose a six-act campaign, where Mercia meets numerous leaders belonging to various peoples, in a desperate attempt to defend themselves from the undead army led by the necromancer Valder. The missions are not very many, we specify, but their duration is more than sufficient, because they gradually become more and more demanding and complex, they are managed to explain the characteristics of the various units available and introduce the player to their best tactical use, and are varied just enough not to get bored (also thanks to a series of secondary missions well integrated into the whole). Furthermore, you will hardly complete them in a single session, because they are largely brutal even at the normal challenge level. None shall fall while I still stand Yes, you got it right: Wargroove doesn't joke with difficulty at all. The title has sudden peaks already starting from act three, and from that moment on it is a crescendo, in which the enemy artificial intelligence constantly attacks you without mercy, and reacts more cunning than expected to most of your moves. In short, do not be fooled by the simplicity of the mechanics, because this title is basiconly in appearance, and its structure - it is in all respects a turn-based strategy where each unit has two actions available (one of which for movement) and each faction makes use of the exact same troops, diversified only by a point of stylistic view - it requires a considerable study of the positioning of the armies, and a perfect exploitation of the capabilities available to the player to dominate. The system, however, has slightly changed compared to that of the Advance Wars (which are in any case of a certain age, and undoubtedly required a general rejuvenation): each faction is in fact equipped with various commanders on the field, who regenerate some life points every turn, and they can use a very powerful Groove ability (these powers were also present in the Intelligent Systems titles, but the commander was not in battle). The presence of such powerful warriors is an important factor to take into consideration, since their resistance makes them perfect for obtaining a quick benefit in certain battles - especially if you start at a disadvantage in troops and resources - but at the same time if you find them excessively you risk losing the game instantly, and we assure you that the artificial intelligence tends to unload everything it possesses on him as soon as you take one step too many. Of course, not everything is absolutely flawless: with the increase in units, and the entry into the field of air and water troops, the enemy tends to become more naive, and it becomes quite natural to control him with a purely defensive strategy of consolidating the territory ( resources are obtained by conquering houses scattered around the map, and defending them is essential to win). Going through infinite rounds, however, will deprive you of high scores, limiting you to a single star per mission. The real epilogue of the title, to be clear, requires 100 stars, and if you don't do everything perfectly, the campaign closes with barely fifty of these, so don't think you can hesitate too much if you want to see the ending (or be able to adjust the difficulty down, because doing so locks the score to a single star). Hardcore to the core Just to clarify how much the experience is centered around experienced players, keep in mind that there is no rewind in Wargroove. Making a wrong move means in all likelihood losing a unit, so it is necessary to always stay on the piece. Not enough the game saves automatically at each turn, and therefore - even if it is possible to exit the game and re-enter the point where the last battle left off - there are no manual saves and it is not allowed to reload to correct tactical mistakes of the game. last moment. Lose a mission for a mistake after hours of play, and you will have to repeat it completely: no discounts, no mercy. However, if you find yourself getting only one star per mission regardless of your efforts, know that at least you can get additional stars for the epilogue in the game's two extra modes: challenges and puzzles. The former are battles led by the various commanders of increasing difficulty, while the latter are single-turn battles, in which you will have to achieve victory by understanding exactly which moves to make. Watch out, we didn't say that these are health walks: they are designed to put you to the test in turn. Little to say instead from a technical point of view: the Chucklefish are now experts in pixel art, and Wargroove is a real feast for the eyes, with beautifully characterized characters despite the retro look, and intermission skits at every battle or conquest of high quality. In the long run, in all likelihood, you will choose to eliminate these cutscenes from the options, as they greatly lengthen the battles and some encounters of the final stages can go on for a very long time, yet it is nice to see how the team have worked hard even on elements that most most players will simply choose to cut. Ah, one last gem: if you are dissatisfied with the general longevity, keep in mind that Wargroove has an excellent map and campaign editor, whose creations can be put online by the community. If the fanbase grows exponentially, expect a plethora of extra content in the months ahead.", "date": "2019-01-30", "grade": "8.2"}
