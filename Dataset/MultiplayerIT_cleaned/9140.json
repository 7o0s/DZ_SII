{"name": "Swing in tre dimensioni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/91608-lets-golf-3d-swing-in-tre-dimensioni.html", "text": "Gameloft is renowned for two things: firstly, they are very good at ~copying~ the most famous games and making them their own, making good quality clones, especially for the iOS platform; secondly, he loves to take care of the ~quantitative~ aspect of his titles, which never run out within a few hours but rather offer respectable numbers in terms of characters, modes and unlockable elements. The meeting between the French company and the Nintendo 3DS eShop is anything but casual, and is destined to see the birth of conversions of sure interest for the owners of the handheld with 3D graphics, also due to the clear economic results of the operation: a Let's Golf! 3D sold for 6 euros is one bill, Asphalt 3D sold in retail format at full price is another. The first title to take advantage of the renewed collaboration between Gameloft and Nintendo is the conversion of Let's Golf! 2, slightly changed in name to emphasize the implementation of the three-dimensional effect and available for Nintendo 3DS exactly one year after its first publication on the App Store. Having purchased the game and downloaded the data, the first difference that catches the eye is obviously the presence of 3D, which creates a nice ~relief~ effect in the menus but which we did not find so exciting during the in-game action : the impression is that the character is a flat silhouette placed in the background, while no particular effects are noticed on the ball, which instead could have ~pierced~ the screen. The second difference unfortunately lies in the lack of online multiplayer mode, which on the iPhone boasted a very fast matchmaking system and fun one-on-one matches, even with the possibility of communicating via text chat. The Gameloft product did not base its appeal on multiplayer, it must be recognized, but the elimination of this feature can only make us turn up our noses, also because it is time for Nintendo to give a strong signal in this direction. Balls in the hole Finding themselves in front of a console equipped with a dual screen, the developers of Let's Golf! 3D have seen fit to redesign the graphical interface, making it less ~crowded~ than the original version of the game. The box with the player's name and score, the wind direction indicator and the hole map have been transferred to the touch screen, which of course also serves to enter swing mode. The power of the shot depends on the timing with which we tap with the stylus, and it is quite simple to get the right measure. At this juncture, the game appears perhaps more ~assisted~ than the iPhone version, given that it is possible to change the club or the direction of the shot (moving the Circle Pad) but generally the default settings are the most effective . Fortunately, in some more advanced locations, shot control becomes more complex and various parameters must be adjusted for our swing to produce the desired results. The rules applied to the matches are the classic ones of golf, but there are also some nice variations. The career mode unfolds through five very well-crafted and colorful scenarios, which are unlocked as we win competitions and which at the same time see us upgrade our character, unlock new ones and obtain customization items (hairstyles, clothes, clubs and balls). Each of the eight available characters has unique abilities and excels at a certain juncture, so switching from one to the other translates into a difference in gameplay rather than a simple aesthetic variation. The career mode is very long and demanding, but it's not the only one that the game makes available to us: we can also try our hand at the ~challenge~, to get better and better in a series of tests; ~aim for the star~, in which you have to hit the stars in a scenario with the ball; ~difficult birdie~, a mode where we will necessarily have to birdie in increasingly difficult conditions; ~long putt~, based on ground shots from ever greater distances; ~bunker ball~, a series of shots in which you always start from the sand. The 3D effect The use of 3D in Let's Golf! 3D does not, unfortunately, cry out for a miracle. The effect is nice on the menus, as usual, but during the actual game it doesn't create the desired depth and simply makes the character stand out from the background. Furthermore, the result obtained is very ~shape~ and does not enhance the polygonal models. Ups and downs Once on the course, as mentioned, Let's Golf! 3D provides us with general indications on the club to use and on the direction of the shot, but we can decide to do differently and experiment with various solutionstions, especially if the path is full of pitfalls (as happens in advanced scenarios). The gameplay is certainly as immediate as that of the original version, but unfortunately this 3DS conversion suffers from obvious problems in terms of frame rate. If on the iPhone the action took place in a fluid way, without dips or uncertainties, even and above all during the delicate shooting phase, on the Nintendo portable console scrolling is often subject to annoying jerks. A defect that does not ruin the gaming experience, God forbid, but which certainly raises some doubts about the goodness of the work done by Gameloft, which cannot afford to make a bad impression at its debut on the eShop.", "date": "2011-08-04", "grade": "7.7"}
