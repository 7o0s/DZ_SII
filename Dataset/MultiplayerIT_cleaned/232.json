{"name": "Ace Combat X", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ace-combat-x.html", "text": "Show in the skies Analyzing Ace Combat X, however, it is right to start by talking about the aesthetic component, truly remarkable considering that we are still talking about a handheld game. With an undoubtedly remarkable effort and skill, the Japanese programmers have managed to transport a large part of the engine used in the last chapters for Ps2, only accepting in some cases to compromise with undoubtedly inferior hardware. While considering the goodness and small size of the PSP screen as a factor capable of hiding some of the graphic defects, the glance with Ace Combat X makes the Namco product one of the best games for the Sony laptop in this respect. The care in the modeling of the various planes is in fact extremely high, and is expressed through a level of detail that allows you to see even the smallest details of the liveries of the protagonist steel birds. The quality of the settings is also good, even if inevitably as you approach the ground you find yourself faced with rather low quality textures. In general, however, Ace Combat X is a title that is simply beautiful to look at, from practically every point of view. The sound also remains at good levels, offering in addition to credible effects also a well-chosen musical accompaniment and a quality dubbing of their flight companions, who do not fail to chat amiably during the missions. On the contrary, the plot is decidedly banal and poor, using the usual clich of the nation of the good guys (Aurelia) invaded and subdued by that of the bad guys (Leasath). The protagonist, together with a group of expert pilots, will have to try to turn the tide of the conflict thanks to heroic missions and exciting raids in the skies. All this through the usual series of missions, with air or land targets, to be shot down with missiles, bombs or machine guns with infinite shots. Success brings with it not only glory, but also new planes, pieces and weapons to be used to improve one's ~performance~; again, compared to the previous episodes, there is the crossroads structure, which at least tries to give a minimum of freshness and attractiveness to an otherwise hackneyed formula. See you... Despite this timid innovative attempt, Ace Combat X remains an extremely classic chapter of the Namco series, thus totally maintaining the now retro gameplay and certainly not particularly intriguing for players with a little experience on their shoulders. In fact, although the title in question represents on balance the first episode of the series for portable consoles of a quality comparable to those on Ps2, and although all in all it offers a type of hit and run fun that can make you spend a few pleasant hours, it is undeniable that the sense of dj vu dominates from the first moment of the game, bringing with it all the historical defects such as the almost total practical uselessness of the squadron mates. The lack of the second analog stick, a real sore point of the PSP hardware design in terms of the amount of conversions or adaptations from Ps2 that it has received, also makes the maneuvers of the plane more difficult to perform. The main mode is also quite short, taking around 6 hours to complete. Finally, the presence of a multiplayer mode for up to 4 players locally, in addition to not representing a particularly interesting attraction, has to contend, as in most cases, with the need to have 3 other friends available with as many copies of the game. Comment Namco continues its work of more or less brazen transposition of its most famous brands from Ps2 to PSP. However, if with Moto GP the result had been all in all appreciable, also thanks to the good adaptability of this series with the hardware of the Sony laptop, on the contrary with Ace Combat X the PSP limits, above all the lack of the second analog stick, make experience not as good. If we add to this an almost absolute immobility in terms of game mechanics for a series that is in desperate need of an energetic refresh, the result can only be advisable to stoic lovers of the Ace Combat franchise or to those approaching for the first time. this type of playful experience. Pros Technically great Crossroads structure of the missions Still quite fun Cons Compromises in the control system Game mechanics badly aged Main mode too short Ace Combat X is the PSP transposition of the popular Namco series, still the best videogame representation of the arcade-style doghfight. But if from a graphic point of view the franchise, with the passing of the episodes, has gained more and more complexity and realism, on the other hand the developers have preferred not to particularly affect the gameplay, anchored to mechanics that today are starting to feel the weight of the years. Was the transition to the Sony laptop a sufficient stimulus to give the brand a new boost? Let's find out together...", "date": "2006-12-07", "grade": null}
