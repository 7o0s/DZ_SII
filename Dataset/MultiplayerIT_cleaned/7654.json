In fact, when you try your hand at a project of this kind, you have to deal not only with the original work, with its characteristics and peculiarities, but also and above all with the nostalgic feeling that it is capable of awakening in the hearts of enthusiasts. . Sometimes, however, the stars are favourable, you sit down and make courageous choices, and with a little luck what comes out is a remake with counter-flakes. How many knew who the Spanish developers of MercurySteam were before the announcement of Lords of Shadow? Yet their indisputable talent, combined with the important narrative supervision of Hideo Kojima, have given fans of the classic Castlevania something to be proud of. A product that in fact has little to do with the action platforms that we know well and that in the 90s were able to give excellent results, even after the advent of 32-bit consoles, but which in fact succeeds, in an extremely competent and inspired, to project the Belmont family into a new and wonderful polygonal world, which alternates lush and suggestive landscapes with other gloomy, dark ones, full of terrible pitfalls. Considering that PC users will be able to enjoy the release of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 simultaneously with console owners, Konami has seen fit to create an Ultimate Edition of the first chapter for the Windows platform, strong not only in technical upgrades and an attractive price, but also the native inclusion of the two DLCs, Reverie and Resurrection. Let's see how it went. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition proves to be a particularly welcome production on PC The fate of a Knight of the Light The protagonist of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is Gabriel Belmont, shrewd member of the Brotherhood of Light; a soul that can't rest over the death of his wife, brutally murdered in her sleep. In his eyes it seems that God has abandoned men, letting hordes of dark creatures, especially terrible werewolves, emerge from the darkness to slaughter the innocent. Spurred on by his Order, Gabriel sets out in search of answers, determined to reach the legendary Lake of Oblivion to speak with its powerful guardian, who is said to be capable of revealing the truth to those who can find him and seek his advice. However, this is only the first step of an epic adventure for the warrior, who along the way finds himself having to face formidable opponents (even a gigantic titan!) and interact with other characters who play a precise role in the story. The basis of the gameplay is that of a very solid God of War-style action game in the combat system, capable of giving great satisfaction (see also the strategic ~slowdowns~ when the most significant impacts occur) and of offering us a repertoire of moves really extensive, which is enriched with new maneuvers as we eliminate enemies and earn points with which to buy them. As in the famous Santa Monica Studio series, the MercurySteam guys were skilled but not enough to adequately exploit every single attack, which often results in the execution of the same combos for reasons of simplicity and effectiveness. Fortunately at a certain point a further substrate is added to the experience, represented by mystical powers that allow Gabriel to recover vital energy or make his shots more effective, and the continuous balance between these two possibilities has the merit of mixing the cards in table and increase the variety of the game. Definitive Edition Anyone who tried Castlevania: Lords of Shadow at the time of its release on consoles knows how great the work done on the artistic component of the production is. The character of Gabriel, as well as the various supporting actors, is well characterized, with a convincing and fascinating design, but above all he moves in a world of extraordinary beauty, even when the breathtaking landscapes hide great dangers. However, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 there was a rather discordant note, in this case the tendency of the engine to give in to noticeable drops in the frame rate, struggling to hold up to 30 frames per second. It is clear that on PC this does not happen, indeed on the test configuration it was possible to enjoy the experience at an average of 70 frames per second and without ever a slowdown, a factor which in itself constitutes a substantial improvement, clearly together with the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Are we facing the best edition of the game ever released? Of course yes, but it is also true that they have passedthree years after the original publication and it was reasonable to expect something more. The developers have remedied the drops in the frame rate and incredibly enhanced the locations thanks to Full HD, moreover inserting new light effects and shaders, but at the same time there has not been an upgrade of the textures, which therefore remain those at (relatively ) low resolution of 2010. In short, there has been an improvement and it is evident, but more could have been done. See also the cutscenes, unfortunately ripped from the console version and therefore with less detail than the in-game graphics. However, the speech of the Ultimate Edition must be seen as a whole, and the presence of the two DLCs (in addition to the halved price) in the package should absolutely not be underestimated.", "date": "2013-08-27", "grade": "8.5"}
