Unlike the latter, Victoria was characterized by putting both the war aspect relatively in the background - a decidedly in-depth and dissected aspect in the Hearts of Iron series - as well as that relating to exploration and colonization, in order to be able to concentrate on the management of the economy and domestic politics of their country. Victoria II could only follow in the footsteps of the first chapter by setting itself the difficult goal of making the game mechanics more immediate and accessible and, at the same time, profound and refined. A sort of philosopher's stone for all strategy games. Protagonists of History Victoria II will allow you to lead any nation on the globe from 1836 until the start of World War II. In what at first sight - and wrongly - might seem like a too short period of time, the player will be able to relive the years of the industrial revolution and to guide his own people through a period of intense and decisive changes. Whether in command of a super power like Spain or England, or of an apparently less ambitious state like that of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, we should relive the passing of days to better manage the subtle and unstable balance between economy, diplomacy and growth technology and culture of their country. Possessing the baggage of experience necessary to be able to better master a colonialist empire of the nineteenth century is certainly not a trivial matter, even for the most accustomed players to the genre. Yet, the impressive number of nations made available at the beginning of each new game will allow, at least the most willing players, to immerse themselves in the intricate system of balances in a gradual and, above all, targeted way. By taking command of a satellite kingdom of any of the eight world powers, for example, we will be able to be interested relatively less in the defense of our borders, allowing us instead to better dissect the internal production chain, perhaps experimenting with the socialist approach and comparing it to the capitalist one. The complexity of the play system prepared by the Swedish development group is so great that each of the different macro game areas needs careful and accurate planning, leaving very little room for pure improvisation. Following in the footsteps of its predecessors, Victoria II, even before being a video game, is a real historical-political simulator and as such must be approached to be enjoyed to the fullest. Climbing up with dangerous Pindaric comparisons and encroaching on other genres, we could say that the Victoria series is to that of Total War as the Football Manager series is to PES (the one from the golden age, of course). Even just a ~simple~ act, at least in a video game, such as declaring war on a remote kingdom in the middle of Central Asia could lead to the annihilation of our country. In fact, it will not be enough to pay extreme attention only to the diplomatic relations established by the aforementioned state but, for example, after only a few months we could find ourselves having to deal with the revolts of our citizens or, even worse, with the declarations of war launched by our neighboring countries, alerted from our dangerous predisposition to armed conquest, and aimed at containing our expansionist aims. This is just one of the countless examples that can be called upon to show the greatness of this title and which, at the same time, highlight the intrinsic limits of a game system that hardly lends itself to short and carefree game sessions. Precisely to mitigate this problem, the developers have however made an effort to try to offer an experience that is at least more accessible. From this point of view, one of the most evident improvements concerns the management of events and the way in which these are notified to the user. Finally we should no longer unravel ourselves among dozens and dozens of event notifications (most of the time useless) capable of saturating our already limited cognitive abilities in a few minutes. All this recalls the messages in the tray bars which have already been present for some time in the Windows operating systems: each type of event corresponds to a row of small flags which represent an event for the corresponding nation. We have the option to view the details or ignorerli beautifully. This is easier said than done and, above all, manages to make the gaming experience more fluid and less fragmented. art deco Aesthetically, Victoria II grants very little to its players and, indeed, does everything to look like a game from the last century. From this point of view, therefore, the developers' quirk in offering us, once the farthest zoom level has been selected, a view of the game map that recalls the paper maps of the early 1900s and which, from time to time, will be ' returned to the loading screen of the last saved game to show the game situation. Even on the sound side things do not change, quite the contrary. While we weren't expecting a Jeremy Soul production, we would still have appreciated the ability to create custom playlists from our digital libraries. At the time of writing, the latest version of the game is 1.1. Occasionally, we've run into a few bugs. Nothing that prevents you from finishing a game but, certainly, enough to potentially ruin hours of hard-earned (and well-deserved!) fun. Fortunately, the developers already have a new patch in the works and, above all, they are once again attentive to the needs of their users. One of the secrets of this great little software house.", "date": "2010-09-03", "grade": "9.0"}
