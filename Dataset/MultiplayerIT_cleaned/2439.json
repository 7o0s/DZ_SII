{"name": "Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gran-turismo-3-a-spec-4.html", "text": "The Real Driving Simulator A little over a year and a half after its last appearance, Polyphony Digital makes its return to the scene and with it the most acclaimed driving simulation ever. We waited for him for a long time and he enjoyed making us tremble while waiting just like a beautiful woman keeps her man on tenterhooks before finally giving himself up. Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec finally meets the PlayStation 2 and it's immediately love at first sight. The Gran Turismo 2000 shown last year at the main world fairs is only a distant relative of that all-Japanese masterpiece that we now find ourselves in our hands. With the graphics engine upgraded, the graphics redesigned and the polygon count drastically increased, the game is never the same. Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec is the result of at least a couple of years of work by that development team that revolutionized the racing genre in the past with GT and GT2. Expected for last March, GT3 arrives in our homes in the hottest period of the summer when instead they feared having to wait until the end of the holidays. After so much trepidation, after at least a year of successive rumors, confirmations and denials, the time has finally come to formulate the fateful question. Is this the epic game we've all been waiting for? The answer can only be yes! Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec is more than ever The Real Driving Simulator. At the heart of the engine... Our adventure begins in the engine of a Toyota Supra, the protagonist of an evocative opening sequence accompanied by an aggressive soundtrack just enough to charge us before hitting the track. Through the main menu we can access all the main functions (loading and saving data, options) and the two game modes: Arcade and Gran Turismo. Arcade mode initially offers only 6 tracks (4 GT and 2 rallies) and only a part of the fleet included in the game. By gaining victories in each race we will be able to access the next set of circuits and so on. It is also possible to load the additional vehicles that we have possibly conquered in the Gran Turismo mode. The latter proves to be, as always, the soul of the game and the real strength of GT3. With the Gran Turismo mode, you return to the world of motor racing with all those elements and means available that only the great racing teams can have. Now it's our turn to open our new garage, inaugurating it with the few credits available and used wisely in the purchase of a vehicle worthy of our guide. It's not a Viper or Skyline but at most a Toyota Yaris or a New Beetle. With patience, demonstrating our ability behind the wheel, we will be able to obtain the keys for far more prestigious and high-performance cars. Right in the dealership, a real international car show, we can access the pages of all or almost all of the 163 in the game and possibly buy them as long as we have collected the money needed for the transaction. A very important section is that workshop which provides us with all the best technological discoveries thanks to which we can supercharge our racing cars beyond belief. Turbo engines, brakes, shock absorbers, tires and a thousand other options are available to us and our 4-wheeled jewels. But for cars and spare parts we need credits (money) and only by participating in tenders and winning them can we set aside large sums to be paid into the coffers of the dealer and the workshop. Having set up our ~wheelbarrow~ (at first it will be like this) we just have to devote ourselves first to tests and then to the first amateur competitions. All this comes not before having obtained the national, international and rally licenses necessary for entry to the races. Don't underestimate this important phase of the game because it can create difficulties, even for the most experienced pilots, if not tackled with due effort. Bread for your teeth... From amateur races to rally or even endurance races, the challenge offered by Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec is practically infinite and I doubt that it will be possible to complete all the competitions present in the Gran Turismo mode. The races are developed on 36 tracks (18 + mirror + secret) many of which are inherited from previous versions of GT. From the frenetic descents of Deep Forest to the treacherous curves of Trial Mountain, from the imposing Colosseum and the ruins of ancient Rome to the slippery asphalt of Special Route 5, from the slalom between skyscrapers that rise in Seattle to the evocative setting of the Swiss Alps, the slopes to be tackled offer a straordinaria variety as well as a remarkable characterization of the landscape. Worthy of note are the dirt tracks and rally competitions created with much greater care than GT2. Even the fans of Colin McRae and Carlos Sainz will thus find bread for their teeth. Analog control, digital experience Polyphony has repeatedly announced that it has made significant changes to vehicle driving and gameplay and in fact the difference is immediately noticeable even if it is not as drastic as could be expected. Once the potential offered by the Dual Shock 2 analog controller has been exploited to the fullest, the control of the vehicle is more accurate (not for this reason easier) and more faithful to reality. For a complete and satisfying gaming experience, it is advisable to use the left analog stick to steer as well as the right analog stick to accelerate and brake. Traction control system and anti-spin mechanism are available to less expert players, but the decision to deactivate them both cannot fail to be taken into consideration by anyone who wants to demonstrate their skills on the track without the help offered by modern devices. For the lucky owners of the GT Force steering wheel, made by Logitech and specially combined with the game, there is an entire section thanks to which it is possible to change the settings of the steering wheel and decide your own driving style. The purchase of the GT3 + Volante is certainly worth considering, even if the 350,000 Lire price of the entire package constitutes a barrier that cannot be overcome by everyone. The road behavior of the car is the most realistic that can be found in any console driving simulation. PC users may have more properly simulative titles but overall the experience offered by GT3 A-Spec does not allow for comparison. Weight and dimensions have a decisive influence on the road holding of the vehicles and the same can be said for the conditions of the asphalt. The wet effect of the Special Stage Route 5 is not only a pleasure for the eyes but above all a pitfall capable of putting a strain on racing cars equipped with rear-wheel drive and those that are not perfectly balanced. Paranormal powers for Polyphony? What makes GT3 A-Spec ~The Real Driving Simulator~? Certainly the fidelity of the behavior of cars on the road but above all a technical achievement that is nothing short of phenomenal. I'm starting to believe that the programmers have paranormal powers as no one else before them had managed to exploit the PlayStation 2 hardware in such a convincing way. The excellent Onimusha and Tekken Tag Tournament seem to have been born on an older generation console if you compare them to the visual magnificence of this small artistic masterpiece. The 60 frames per second with which the graphics engine moves does not seem to bear the weight of the more than 10 million polygons moved by GT3. Absolutely photorealistic models of cars recreated thanks to the use of several thousand polygons and an absolutely maniacal attention to detail. The slopes are no different, almost all spectacular and full of details. High quality textures make buildings, rocks, mountains and even our beloved Colosseum more than credible. Flags, banners, airships and many other surrounding elements also give life to postcard landscapes made even more evocative by the splendid light effects. Replays have always been a strong point of Polyphony which in GT3 has once again surpassed itself by giving us visuals and a direction worthy of the best formula one grand prix. Some of your friends may be fooled by the photorealism of the replays and come to believe that this is a race on live television! The only negative note is the absence of the 60hz option even if the ~black bands~ are fortunately of limited dimensions. Once the roars of the engines have been resampled, the sound sector is also at very high levels, being able to count on a vast assortment of catchy and never boring songs. Last Lap! Arriving at the last lap of the track, the outcome of the review appears more obvious than ever. Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec is not only the best driving simulation ever on consoles, it is not only a masterpiece without comparison but it is also the best game currently available for PlayStation 2 Pal. Unparalleled graphics, the usual great gameplay of Gran Turismo and the boundless breadth and variety of the game make the third installment of the Polyphony series the most complete yet. However, there are also defects attributable mostly to oblivionances of programmers. The presence of only 2 game views can fall into this category, which will make the most demanding players turn up their noses. Having said that, my job as a reviewer is over and my job as a pilot starts again. My 800 horsepower Dodge Viper is ready to go back to the track. Are you consumed with envy? Buy yourself GT3! Pros: The Real Driving Simulator! Polyphony doesn't miss a beat Incredible graphics Infinite!163 car models... Cons: ...in GT2 there were many more Only two game visuals Related topics: Special: Gran Turismo, the story of a legend Definitive GT3 car list A -Spec Pal In the veins of Italians flows not only blood but also a passion for engines and speed. The roar of an engine taken to the limit of its revs is a pleasure to be fully savored, an emotion that can only be grasped by connoisseurs. The historic successes of Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Lancia are engraved in our minds and have fueled the motoring dreams of millions of young and old over the years, because the love of racing has no age. Being able to drive a four hundred horsepower racing car is a privilege granted to few and the thrill of speed is instead a luxury accessible to even fewer people. If you are not a formula one driver or you don't have at least a couple of hundred million at your disposal, don't be afraid, your dreams can still come true!", "date": "2001-07-20", "grade": null}
