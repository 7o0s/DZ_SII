{"name": "Mario vs Donkey Kong", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-vs-donkey-kong.html", "text": "A Modern Retrogame After having witnessed the nice plot in pure Nintendo style narrated through excellent fixed screens, you find yourself thrown into the mechanics of Mario Vs Donkey Kong. What genre does it represent? Let's say it's a puzzle game with platform themes, or rather a compressed platform with only the puzzle sections and purified of the exploratory component... In short, something new that smacks of the past. From the retrogame it takes the structure with reduced levels - sometimes formed by a single screen - the difficulty and genius of level design, from today it absorbs complex mechanics, fresh and original ideas and... the genius of level design! Let's go in order. In the escape Donkey Kong loses three gift parcels, a key and a Mini Mario, all objects to be recovered: some to score points - the parcels - others necessary just to finish the level - the key and the Mini Mario. The objects are placed in places that are usually inaccessible and reachable only by making a series of millimeter jumps, activating switches to extricate themselves in deadly puzzles, commanding conveyor belts, using gymnast bars, lianas, etc ... Each painting is also divided into two sections: in the first you have to recover the key and take it to the door, in the second, formed by another level with new puzzles and new mechanics, recover the Mini Mario. This is where the time component comes into play. Each section must be completed in a given time. If you finish the first one quickly and have some remaining seconds, these are literally transported to the second part and added to those already available. If you don't die, at the end the sum of the two remains is used to score the points, if you die only the remainder of the second part which obviously will be lower. The points are used to earn useful stars to unlock the very difficult ~expert~ levels. In short, in pure Nintendo style, the game offers another game. A masterpiece of play But it's not over. Each world consists of six levels like those described plus a Mini Mario level and a Donkey Kong level. Mini Mario levels have Mario followed by six Mini Marios who must be guided indirectly along special passages as they cannot perform all of Mario's moves. Without making them die or lose them, you have to make them collect the three letters of the word TOY and put them back in the box they were stolen from. Eventually in the level Donkey Kong, the most famous primate in the world of video games, will have to be defeated, usually with the help of something to throw at his head, with various methods. Finished? No! If the six worlds are decidedly few, things change if we add six new ~more~ worlds. These mix the gameplay of Mini Mario levels with traditional ones. In fact, this time the key is in the hands of a Mini Mario who must be accompanied to the exit... plus the parcels must obviously be recovered! Let's leave out the deadly and ingenious ~expert~ levels, authentic massacres suitable only for the most patient and skilled. The eye wants its part Certainly it is not the technique that catches the eye in such a game, but even in this case the game comes out well. Mario is animated in a very good way with a three-dimensional modeling technique that always leaves you pleasantly surprised. The animations also exude the sympathy and insanity to which Nintendo titles have now accustomed us. Certainly given the reduced nature of the paintings, the parallax levels are not noticeable, but they are there, and everything else is clean and functional stuffed with all those distortion, enlargement and manipulation effects that are not perfectly manageable by the GBA. From the sound side the music is technically well done with an excellent use of the stereo effect, but not very inspired and sometimes even ugly. A praise goes instead to the sound effects: Mario has rarely been so chatty and the number and quality of the sentences sampled even exceed the games in the series made on home consoles. The effects are spot on and clean. Comment Mario Vs Donkey Kong is a title without the pretensions of large productions, but which offers a copious breath of fresh air that is now distributed in small doses. It's a little game, but with so many of those contents that many much more noble players envy. It's a title that can be used as a harp, but with the length and complexity typical of the best Nintendo titles. It is a dive into the past, but with a lot of modernity inside. It's a difficult game that is almost frustrating at times, but it's also difficult to let go before completing it. It is sufficiently long-lived, lending itself to very short or very large game sessions. It is sempre same, but always different. A title therefore highly recommended, and an excellent idea to put under anyone's tree. Pros Lots of new ideas Well thought out level design Sufficiently long-lived Cons Perhaps too difficult Long sections of the game can be boring Nintendo's love of 2D Highlights? Difficulty and Gameplay. The game is difficult, sometimes a lot. The puzzles exploit every sneakiest trick: from reverse logic to execution speed, from seemingly impossible paths to enemies to be exploited. You brush against an enemy and you are dead, you fall from too high a height and death will appear, you slip on a spike and game over appears. It had been years since Mario had been subjected to so many resurrections. And it's been years since we've seen so much genius in packaging a product. Each level is filled with ideas, pitfalls, quotes, new and old mechanics skilfully mixed. A small encyclopedia of gameplay and level design, a bit like Wario Ware but definitely more complex. Sure, it's still a game. In the sense that the structure is that of a harp, of a title to be pulled out every now and then to break one's brains for some time and then to be put away to move on to something that allows longer sections of the game. In reality this should be the essence of the portable game, but the fact remains that by its nature, Mario vs Donkey remains a game with the contents of a masterpiece. How long has it been since Mario had to fight Donkey Kong? In these long years our hero has become a real star in the Mushroom Kingdom. Like any self-respecting famous character, he started producing his gadgets including the most desired objects from the whole world: the Mini Marios! These very cute mechanical puppets with Marian features jump, walk, talk and are sold in an amazing crystal ball Can a big ape like Donkey Kong not be attracted to them? Unfortunately, like all objects that are too much in demand, finding them is not easy. In front of the ~out of stock~ sign hanging on the shutters of the shop, Donkey gets furious and decides to go and get them directly from the factory using force. And here is poor Mario forced to recover the gift packages and the Mini Marios that are gradually lost from the great sack of a greedy Donkey Kong on the run.", "date": "2004-12-17", "grade": null}
