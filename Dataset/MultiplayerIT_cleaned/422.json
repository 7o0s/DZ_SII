{"name": "Key of Heaven", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/key-of-heaven.html", "text": "Key of Heaven is a classic action-RPG along the lines of the various Baldurs Gate (for Ps2 - Ed -) or Untold Legends, just to stay in the PsP sphere, even if of a Japanese nature. The gameplay is therefore focused on the exploration of environments, fights with swords and spells and interaction with other PCs to collect useful clues for the continuation of the adventure that will unfold through the five kingdoms into which the region is divided. To succeed in the enterprise and get to the bottom of the story by resisting the countless attacks that hordes of enemies will bring you, Shinbu and his associates' mastery of the use of weapons and fighting techniques will become fundamental. Techniques that can be developed and learned (each kingdom, we remind you, has developed its own fighting style) right during the journey thanks to the collection of Items called ~Kempu~ and ~Bugei~, artifacts with which the masters of each clan pass on their knowledge in swordsmanship to the disciples. The Kempu are bamboo tablets on which the moves performed with a single blow are depicted, very simple to recover as they can be found after killing an enemy or by opening certain chests, while the Bugei are parchments that allow you to combine the single Kempu getting deadly combos. They are much rarer to find, and are obtained only in particular phases of the game, for example upon reaching a specific objective, as a reward following a side-quest (the Climax title has many of them) or upon defeating a particular boss. The possibility of customizing one's combos thanks to the Bugei makes KoH a particularly attractive game for lovers of more complex RPGs. The presence of different types of scrolls characterized by various types of development levels (some Bugei allow you to create combinations with more than four attacks, exploiting the most sophisticated Kempu to create terrifying moves) or by some rare peculiarities such as those provided by the ~Freestyle~ , which allow the gamer to combine any fighting style and Kempu in his possession, and give ~San'Yuan~, from the homonymous fighting style that gave rise to all the others, able to attribute greater force to the blows inflicted from our Pg, push the most demanding, curious user to their constant search, giving greater strength to the title in terms of longevity. The Level-Up of the characters takes place following the classic pattern of an RPG. By defeating the enemies you get the canonical Experience Points useful for leveling up the elements of the group but also the ~Chi~ used in combat and which we will talk about shortly. More than the money that can be spent to buy amulets, weapons and items that enhance the basic characteristics of our character, or even to enhance the swords in our possession by upgrading them or cure ourselves of some ~monster~ poisoning. All this can be done in one of the many small villages that arise in the five kingdoms and where we can find shops, blacksmith shops, taverns and so on. Returning to the discussion on ~Who~, let's try to understand what it is and what it consists of. It is a magical art capable of unleashing one of the five elements of the earth and channeling them into a powerful attack and is guarded by guardians of the five clans. The methods of execution of these arts are engraved on the five statues of the disciplines that our Shinbu will have to find during his adventure. Subsequently, after some practice, the young man will then be able to use them in combat, gradually increasing their power. Lately there are several games that seem to finally take full advantage of the technical capabilities of the Playstation Portable. Especially when it comes to the aesthetic aspect. This KoH is no less than other recent productions. The settings of the game are very accurate even if in some points a little repetitive, with an evocative aspect, with an attention to detail as rarely seen on this console. Concrete examples of what has just been said can be found in the construction of the Temple of Confession of Byakko, located on top of a mountain on which lightning strikes perennially or in the village made up of a series of boats connected to each other by bridges, in Gembu. The same treatment was reserved by the Climax graphics also for the characters, both main and secondary, made with extreme care and with a captivating character design. And if this is not enough for you, know that the game engine manages to handle all this without the slightest drop in frame-rate even in the most chaotic situations. With strictly themed (oriental) music that is not excellent but which perfectly recreates the aatmosphere, a well-made English dubbing and an ok sound sector as regards the various audio samplings, we can conclude our technical analysis of the product with an overall positive opinion. Conclusions Characterized by a rather long story mode, by a plot full of twists and turns, by somewhat stereotyped but valid characters and by a well-calibrated, even if not very original, gameplay, KoH is a game destined to gather a lot of acclaim among the owners of PsP also in our area. The Rpg elements combine perfectly with the action ones in a union we would dare to say almost perfect. It's just a shame that Pg control isn't the best of life, but you can't have everything. Pros: Plot and gameplay overall well made. Great variety of side-quests. Technically sound. Cons: Sometimes repetitive scenarios. Too difficult opponents in some places. Pg control to be improved. After years of silence in the RPG sector, the Climax development team, recently seen at work again on PsP with the interesting ATV Offroad Fury Blazin' Trails, returns to the general public in that genre which has been the his workhorse, with what, settings aside, can be defined as the heir of those Landstalker for SEGA MegaDrive that was so successful around the year of Grazia 1993 in the world of action role-playing games. Key of Heaven is set in an unspecified region of the world, clearly inspired by feudal Asia, and in particular by China and Japan, a harsh land divided into five states, each of which is governed by a clan, Gembu in the North , Suzaku in the South, Seiryu in the East, Byakko in the West and Kirin, which is right in the middle of the other four. In each of these kingdoms there are thousand-year-old martial arts schools whose disciples are trained hard in the art of swordsmanship and hand-to-hand combat. The techniques taught in these places differ from kingdom to kingdom and characterize the style of the various fighters who train there. One of the best ~products~ of these schools is Shinbu, the protagonist of the adventure, a former disciple of the Seiryu clan who was expelled from the kingdom due to his excessive vehemence. One day, while he is training on a hill, the young man notices a group of warriors intent on chasing a girl who he promptly runs to save. The young woman is called Suirin and she is the only survivor of the Seiryu clan, exterminated, it seems, by the rival clan of Kirin. The two thus decide to join forces to reconstitute their group and try to get to the bottom of the story, discovering if the aforementioned group is really behind the massacre and the reason for what happened.", "date": "2006-07-04", "grade": null}
