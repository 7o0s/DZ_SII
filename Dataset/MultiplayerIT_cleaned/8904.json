Finding it won't be easy: to do so, he will have to face ten different scenarios full of hostile androids, collecting components along the way and trying to upgrade his equipment to cope with increasingly complex and dangerous situations, finally finding himself face to face with a real own war machine. The plot of EPOCH is quite simple and does not shine for originality, but if you are interested there are numerous documents that are unlocked as you play and which reveal details and testimonies on the process that led the machines to rebel and turn against the human race . It was certainly possible to tell these events better, but in the end these are marginal elements compared to the substance on which the debut title of Uppercut Games for iPhone and iPad is based: firefights, evasive maneuvers, planning of upgrades and memorization of certain behavioral routines in order to effectively counter them. When we heard that the game was going to be a shooter on rails, the first reaction was to turn up our noses, given that unfortunately there are many applications of this type on the App Store where you do nothing but tap the screen to shoot an enemy. However, it only takes a few moments to realize that the starting concept has undergone so many refinements as to make it look like something completely different, in which it is not only the action for its own sake that makes the difference between victory and game over, but many other factors come into play. Dead or alive, you will come with me The EPOCH campaign is made up of ten stages, in each of which different enemies are introduced, each equipped with unique weapons and characteristics: we go from the basic robotic soldiers, who try to hit us with their machine guns, to the androids who throw grenades, passing through snipers equipped with a persistent laser, those using a slow-charging energy cannon and more. Before attempting a certain level, we can see which type of weapons the enemies will use (normal, explosive, corrosive or electric) and which ones they will be more vulnerable to, thus realizing the setup of our robot accordingly, i.e. choosing the composition of the armor and the weapons that best suit the situation. It is clear that to have some choice we will first have to buy the necessary equipment: we will be able to do it between one mission and another using the money earned in battle; possibly repeating the same stages several times, if we deem it appropriate in order to get the best items. Our main weapon can be a versatile machine gun, a cannon that shoots corrosive projectiles, an electric shock device, a grenade launcher and so on, with different values related to power and rate of fire, but without the possibility of improving a tool already in our possession: in this case, we will necessarily have to evaluate the purchase of an advanced model. There are two secondary weapons, which work via cooldowns and must therefore be used with the right timing: these are grenades and homing missiles, also divided by type, with the various versions that can be bought or sold if necessary. Finally, our robot is equipped with an extra capacity, which can be an energy recovery device, a booster for the equipped weapon that briefly multiplies the fire rate, a holographic decoy or a device that speeds up the fire for a few moments. our functions, in a sort of highly effective spectacular bullet time. Beyond these important elements, the game is simple: the character we control is stationed behind some shelters (generally three) and can move from one to another using a slide on the touch screen. To lock on to a target, just touch its image on the screen: the robot will start targeting it with its main weapon, until it explodes or until you have to stop to reload. This operation can also be carried out manually, crouching down and sliding downwards, which proves to be a necessary maneuver in the more advanced stages, when it is no longer possible to get away with shooting everything and doing some somersaults, but you have to calculate the times carefully and evaluate the priority of our targets. In this regard, it must be said that the ten stages can be completed within an hour (apart from the last one, which will necessarily require a few more attempts), but that the storyin this way it is not completed and you have to face the whole campaign again, both at the normal difficulty level and at the hard level, to unravel its real contents. Also from a playful point of view, given that the levels will not recur the same, but will be characterized by the presence of more cunning, more powerful and more numerous androids. The stimulus to continue, experimenting at the same time with all the weapons and objects, is therefore great; and the merit also goes to the technical sector, among the best ever seen on the iPhone in terms of level of detail, texture quality, scenario design and frame rate fluidity. Truly an excellent use of the Unreal Engine. The tested version is 1.0.1 Price: 4.99 App Store links", "date": "2011-11-29", "grade": "8.5"}
