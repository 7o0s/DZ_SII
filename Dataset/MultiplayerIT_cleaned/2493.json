Strolling around Altea The first impact with this MMORPG was a bit ~strong~; accustomed to the isometric and detailed graphics of Ultima On Line, I found myself a little disoriented towards this somewhat ~grainy~ and retro version of the game. The detail of the characters, monsters and structures is certainly of a low level, there are no particular plays of light and the palette used for the colors seems really reduced... but apart from this, after a couple of hours of play, the game started to its merits emerge, first of all that of being totally translated into Italian, an element which provides an undisputed plus to ~La Quarta Profezia~ being, in my memory, the first product of this type finally accessible in all its parts even to those video players (and there are many) who do not understand the Anglo-Saxon dialect. Another positive element is given by the large amount of quests and sub-quests that are proposed by the various NPCs, adventures that greatly release the game from the presence of game masters in charge of organizing events for the players (one of the major limitations of Ultima On Line) and that therefore they make the world of Altea truly autonomous. Strolling around Altea In terms of game-play, to give an idea of the style and the game possibilities proposed, we can characterize this product as a hybrid between Ultima On Line, Baldur's Gate and Diablo, taking the idea of managing characters and characteristics from the first title , from the second the party and inventory management and from the third the arcade style of the fights. To grow our virtual alter ego in strength and experience we will have to plunder enemies and solve quests in order to obtain precious px that will allow us to increase our level (in the more classic gdr style) and therefore have points available to use to increase our features. As far as skills are concerned, however, to improve them, we will have to find masters willing, after spending money and skill points (which can always be acquired by leveling up), to teach us the use of weapons, magic and anything else available on the lands of Altea. Unlike other MMORPGs and similarly to what happens on Ultima On Line in ~The Fourth Prophecy~ there will not be a clear distinction between the various classes (Thief, magician, warrior, cleric...) but everyone will be able to build their own character as best he believes by deciding where and how to spend his experience points and specializing or not in some art or weapon. Strolling around Altea In conclusion of my little foray into the lands of ~The Fourth Prophecy~ I can express a fairly positive opinion, certainly the impact with the graphics is really big... but you can't expect too much from a game contained in 80 Mb. The really important thing, in my opinion, is determined by the fact that in the game there is a decidedly fantasy air full of adventure and novelty and the prerequisites for it to be a really interesting game are all there. the last unknown is given by the player community that will gravitate around this game as this will determine the real success of the product; hopefully it will make it a real fantasy world that is fun to role-play in! Interview with GinoFelino For those who don't know you, can you tell us briefly about Gamers Revolt? Gamersrevolt was born in 1998 as the first Italian provider completely dedicated to online gaming with over 600 access points in Italy. It has over 30,000 registered users and organizes the main Italian Championships for the best multiplayer video games. It provides surfers with daily updated news, editorials, reviews and all the necessary services such as e-mail, dedicated forums, newsletters, and online support. A young and dynamic company in continuous growth, which closed the year 2000 with an increase in accesses and utilities close to 100%. What is The Fourth Prophecy (L4P) ? The Fourth Prophecy is a persistent multiplayer online role-playing game with isometric graphics, in which players undertake missions and fight monsters, interacting with each other in a similar way to Ultima Online or Diablo , but with its own original storyline all set in a persistent. Among the many online games available, why did you decide to propose an MMORPG as your first paid game server? L4P is the first in a series of exclusive acquisitions that will take place over the course of the year, contacts with Cryo and Vircom have given us the opportunity to close the deal in brEve time, but it's only the first step. The Fourth Prophecy is a fairly old game, the first version was launched in the now distant September 28, 1998 and the last restyling was performed in March 2000, why did you choose this somewhat dated MMORPG instead of focusing on a newer title? In fact it's true the game isn't recent but only in the latest versions has it been stable, now Vircom has a multimedia division and follows the project closely, which still remains a novelty for Italy. What kind of customization will you be able to apply to the game? Traveling on the net looking for news we have seen that Vircom has put/will put on the market add-ons to allow server managers to create new spells, creatures, etc etc you are in possession of these utilities or however you plan to buy them ? We have all possible support from Vircom, including all tools and add-ons, we are doing a great job of background writing and religion implementations. We can customize the server at will and we are very happy with this possibility. We will always pay close attention to the wishes of the players. Will the staff who will manage the game be entirely made up of Italians? The staff at the moment is made up of Italians with proven experience in the sector (Kilamdil docet) ) (For the record I am part of the GM staff of the UOL shard hosted by GamersRevolt n.d.K). Management compared to Uo is definitely much easier and simpler. Given that ~the fourth Prophecy~ will be translated entirely into Italian, we must assume that only an Italian user will use your servers or do you also expect the presence of foreign players? We already have a fair number of foreign users on our servers. Since l4p is a game based mainly on the creation of quests, we necessarily aimed at Italian, given the enormous problems that many kids could have in translating terms that, in games like this, certainly cannot be defined as commonly used. Can you give us some technical details about the machines and lines that will run the game? Should we fear lag and the like? Will you keep 1 or more servers dedicated to this game? The machines dedicated to L4P are ten dual P3 1ghz servers, I think we will start with 3 or 5 parallel worlds with different characteristics, the PCs will be able to change servers at will without losing any of the acquired characteristics, this is a new implementation that we have introduced in the game. With three 64mb fibers abroad and over 200mb in the mix I hope that the lag is avoided, it is also possible to use our dial up with over 700 access points in Italy at a local rate, fiber transport offers an alternative to all those who have non-performing providers. How many players will be able to connect to the game's servers at the same time? At the moment we can only rely on the experiences of others, in France they have limited to 250 players per server but it was a deliberate choice. Gamersrevolt and CTO net have acquired the exclusive for Italy of ~The 4th Coming~ taking over the management of this game from Paralleli s.r.l which, with the world of Altea they created, previously managed a community of players. What is your relationship with this company? What will happen to the players who connected on Altea? Will they have to start from scratch or will they keep their characters? We are trying to keep the PCs in their current state, although converting the database so they can access other worlds is causing us some problems. We try and will try to do everything possible not to reset. Aren't you afraid that Italian users, accustomed to free game servers based on emulators of the ~Ultima OnLine~ game, are not interested in a paid product? Certainly, but you know better than me the effort we have made and are making to continue the UOL server, we guaranteed that we would never reset and so it was. Honestly, I would have given an ~eye~ to have the Sphere sources and be able to work properly. The problems we encountered on Sphere weren't all our own, we've always done our best and the success we have on Ultima Online is the result of terrible and invaluable work. The membership is really cheap, we paid a lot of attention to that, access is btw free if you use our dial up. The important thing is the 24/7 support from Vircom which unfortunately has a cost, but which allows us to offer a high-performance service. What are, in your opinion, the strengths and weaknesses of ~the Fourth Prophecy~ when compared with the better known (at least in Italy) MMORPG of ~Ultima On Line~? Initially for those coming from Uol there is thegraphic impact, it is perhaps not the best but this does not affect the playability. I'm an ~old~ Quaker and the first day I played Ultima Online I had immediate rejection. But patience has rewarded me by discovering in Ultima a new and addictive game that has nothing to envy to any FPS game. L4P is in itself a game similar to Uo for the isometric view but the growth of the pg is linked to many things. First you don't need to ~macrare~ but you need to solve the quests, so a brain commitment, I guarantee you that they are not easy at all and require attention. The story is well thought out and access to the third continent allowed only to those who have given ~wings~ gives one more reason not to give up. The game always continues and the pg develops continuously with constant ~surprises~. You are the first to offer a paid MMORPG in Italy, what are your business prospects in this regard? At this moment, Gamersrevolt's only goal is to ensure that our community can try a game on an official server. I can assure you that the subscription costs will bring far more benefits in terms of reliability to the players than to the company's pockets. How much will it cost to play The Fourth Prophecy? The costs will be: For those who connect using another Internet Provider, access to the game will be free for the entire month of June. Starting in July, those who register will be entitled to a 15-day free trial, after which they will be able to continue playing for free via ~Fast For You~ or use another ISP by paying a monthly subscription fee to access the game: Play month 10,000 Play for 3 months 7,000 x 3 Play for 6 months 5,000 x 6 Payments can be made by credit card or using Omnitel rechargeable cards (Omnipay Prepaid). to GR and the login obtained (completely free) gives access to our dial up and the game plus other completely free services.Do you already have other projects of this type in the pipeline?Many others, this is the first step, but we'll talk about them later. Ginofelino, what do you think of paid servers in the Italian gaming scene? Do you think that other gaming service providers will follow in your footsteps? A compromise will have to be reached. It is starting to become difficult to independently manage a reality that has been growing at a rate of over 100% in recent years %. An annual or six-monthly subscription would be justified by the satisfaction on the part of users to find, regardless of their number on the servers, lag-free games, competent assistance and updated services. Many are taking this path which I believe, realistically, is the only one possible right now. The ~prophecy~ and its history... On 1 June 2001, the first (official) Italian server dedicated to an MMORPG opened its doors. We tried it for you and we interviewed Barbicanti Gilberto alias GinoFelino, project manager of GamersRevolt, the game provider that hosts the servers of this game. Let's start with some information about the game: ~The fourth prophecy~ (in English ~The 4th Coming~) was born in the now distant 1998 on an idea of Vircom Interactive. Given the possibility of downloading the software needed to play (client) free of charge from the internet and the opportunity given by Vircom to service providers to acquire exclusive licenses on game management in the various European and non-European countries, many large international companies have chosen The Fourth Prophecy for their game portal. France Telecom has acquired the exclusive French version of the game for: France, Belgium, French-speaking Switzerland and Quebec, successfully presenting the game on its GOA gaming site. Through The Fourth Prophecy, GOA has seen its user base increase by 400%. Following such a significant success, another giant in the Electronic Entertainment sector, the Chinese company Waei International Digital Entertainment, has also acquired the exclusivity of the game for some Eastern countries. GamersRevolt, manager of a vertical portal dedicated to electronic entertainment and online gaming, in the face of these positive data has acquired the worldwide exclusive for the Italian version of the game. By downloading the game client (weighing 80Mb) for free from the Internet, players find themselves part of a virtual community in a vast world active 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The world, called Altea, consists of three large islands, Arakas, Raven's Dust, and Stoneheim. Thanks to a sophisticated ~quest engine~, the player will be able to follow the intricate plot of the game, completing over one hundred missions, with the possibility of choosing", "date": "2001-06-07", "grade": null}
