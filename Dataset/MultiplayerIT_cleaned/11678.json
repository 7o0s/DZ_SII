{"name": "Fantasian", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fantasian-recensione-erede-dei-final-fantasy-classici.html", "text": "Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu together on a new JRPG: these few words would be enough to make us understand how this review of Fantasian goes far beyond the narrow space usually reserved for mobile titles, but everything becomes even more interesting when one realizes that behind the pedigree there is also a lot of substance in this new project exclusively for Apple Arcade. We have updated the initial review with the arrival of part 2, which now allows you to evaluate the complete game. It is a JRPG that recovers the most classic stylistic features of the genre, which represents the stylistic code of Mistwalker a bit like we have seen in Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon and The Last Story, but which also manages to be surprisingly fresh and innovative through small but significant changes to the well-established structure: working on the combat system and world building, but above all amalgamating everything below the direction of a Maestro who returns to handling ~his~ material with extreme mastery. Fantasian is now complete, with the arrival of Part 2 The result is truly a pearl in perfect Sakaguchi style: although the hope is to be able to see Fantasian on other platforms as well, because it deserves an even wider stage, it should also be noted that this project is a confirmation of how Apple Arcade can give space to the video game of authorship in the furniture sector even beyond the niches of the public and the production peculiarities, which in this case involve a real work of craftsmanship. A classic story The story fits perfectly into the classic canon of the genre and after the distribution of part 2 as well, the evaluation does not change: also in this respect the recovery of traditional styles is clear, with a story that recovers classic themes such as saving worlds from apocalyptic threats and unequal fights against divine entities with mysteriously evil intentions. There isn't a real subdivision between the two parts of the story, so anyone who were to start it now would be faced with an integral narrative and without particular breaks from beginning to end. It is a large-scale work, also in this respect in line with classic JRPGs, with a total of about 60 hours of gameplay expected. The narrative, as befits a traditional JRPG, is pervasive and drives the experience of the game also making it rather linear, an aspect that is more noticeable in the first half of the story than in the second. You can easily see the most classic structural elements of the genre: the protagonist is a hero predestined for great deeds, who suffers from amnesia and must try to recover elements of his own history and identity, embarking on an epic adventure that leads him to face a evil deity with the help of various companions. Clichs and tropes are quite the order of the day, but they are used with great skill by Mistwalker, so much so as to even glimpse a bit of self-irony in the ability to play with these stereotypes, showing the great mastery of the medium by Sakaguchi and his companions , which occasionally also grant some clear references to past titles such as Final Fantasy and others. The story tells of a world that is progressively corrupted and suffocated by a mysterious entity called ~mechteria~: while humanity ends up crushed between the inscrutable machinations of unscrupulous gods, a small handful of heroes, led by the protagonist Leo, try the desperate feat of defeating actual gods. The narration takes place through some interlude scenes but above all dialogues and also the simple use of illustrations with text on the screen: the latter solution, almost in a visual novel style, perhaps betrays the limited size of the production, but is nonetheless fascinating and under different you also look original compared to the classic cutscenes of the bigger caliber games. Although the subject does not present particularly disruptive elements, the writing always remains on an excellent level and the narration is pleasant, both in the dialogues (which alternate a rather traditional general trend with ironic and brilliant ideas), and in the completely written parts. We also point out that the game is entirely in English. The second part There is no real gap between the first and second part, with the latter starting precisely where the game stopped in a linear way. This suggests the need for Mistwalker to have more time available to complete his vision of Fantasia, and judging by the results it was a perfectly sensible choice: the sThe second part is practically double the size of the first and enriches the game not only in narrative terms but also as game content, expanding it and making it less linear with the addition of further quests and bringing the total gameplay to about 60 hours of play. However, this enrichment is organic, clearly emerging from a unitary project by Hironobu Sakaguchi and his companions, which was able to fully express itself also thanks to this particular distribution possible thanks to the Apple Arcade system. In short, it is not an addition, but the completion of the story and gameplay applied at a later time in order to take advantage of the additional time and in this sense it is proof that the team did not want to save or cut anything from the initial project. Fantasian Part 2 features more tough bosses to face There is perhaps less dynamism, as regards the variety of settings (and therefore dioramas), in the second part than in the first, given that the story continues to insist on some scenarios for longer, hence the sense of wonder of the first 20 hours inevitably fades over time, but still remains a well-paced and engaging story, which also presents significant twists and challenging fighters against various bosses in the more advanced stages. What we notice, above all, is an extension of the game to include a greater quantity of secondary quests, which lead to a more in-depth exploration of the scenarios and, above all, reduce that strong feeling of linearity that distinguishes the first part of Fantasian, although this still remains a characterizing element. Fantasian part 2 allows you to better understand the Growth Map system of the various characters As far as gameplay is concerned, obviously there are no particular variations in the mechanics but the Growth Map for each character is finally fully explored, i.e. the skill tree-style progression system that takes up a bit the standard of traditional RPGs. In this, you find yourself being able to displace experience points on various nodes that correspond to new skills and stat changes, unlocking further avenues and also allowing for considerable customization of the fighters. Traditional gameplay, but not too much Fantasian, Part 2 introduces new locations and dioramas The action takes place between exploration of the settings through third-person shots with ~fixed cameras~ and turn-based combat, recovering practically the same structure of Final Fantasy VII but adding original touches capable of significantly modifying the gaming experience. Wandering through the settings it is possible to talk to numerous NPCs, collect more or less hidden objects and also take part in some secondary quests, perhaps solving simple environmental puzzles, but Fantasian still appears very linear and everything is set on the main story, at least in this first part .Encounters with standard enemies are random, but one of Fantasian's innovative ideas soon intervenes on this aspect to profoundly change their management, or rather the ~Dimengeon~: it is a tool which, if kept on, allows the protagonist to send automatically enemies within an alternate dimension, if you've fought them before. In this way we can freely explore the scenarios at least until the Dimengeon reaches the maximum capacity of 30 enemies, an event that forces us to face them all together in a large pitched battle with progressive waves. Combat system The combat system is turn-based and is based on the management of attacks along trajectories or areas that can be managed directly with finger movements on the touch screen: the clashes are designed in such a way as to emphasize this feature, usually placing a certain amount of different targets on the battlefield, whether it be different enemies or various targets on the body of the same boss. In addition to the classic balance of forces between elemental, magical and physical attacks, the control of trajectories or impact zones introduces an additional strategic layer that makes the clashes much more engaging than normal classic turn-based battles, keeping interest high even during the ~group~ fights with the Dimengeon, where there are also bonuses to be recovered to modify the statistics and the timing of the rounds in real time. The controls are well designed to take advantage of the touch screen, so as to make it preferable even to the use of the controller, however supported. The character management and evolution system, on the other hand, appears very classic, with the expansion of attack techniques.co and defense executable in combat through the typical access to physical attacks, special abilities (magic and various techniques) and objects during the turn. However, there is a particular note to be made: right towards the end of the first part, a new management of the skills and progression of the fighters opens up through the Growth Map, which significantly modifies the evolution of the characters by moving more towards tradition of the standard RPG with skill tree. It is a system of fighter growth through the application of experience points on various ~nodes~ of a large branching graph for each character. This allows you to unlock new skills and stats and also to customize the characteristics of the party members in a rather deep way. A wonderful world of craftsmanship The most striking feature of Fantasian is certainly the construction of the scenarios, carried out through the use of real dioramas, photographed and partially modified, instead of the classic polygonal settings or in pre-rendered 3D. It is a solution of great impact, also because it has been carefully planned and with considerable study from a stylistic point of view, so as to be homogeneous and in line with a particularly solid artistic direction. All this includes a huge manual preparation work that is almost touching, considering how the game world is the result of a great work of real craftsmanship, something that hardly happens to be associated with the development of a video game. It's also a way to rejuvenate a clearly outdated setting, as well as a smart solution to solve the problem of the scarcity of technical means that a small team like Mistwalker could face working on a purely 3D plan.The landscapes are not motionless as one might think, given the solution adopted: NPCs, animals, watercourses, atmospheric and particle effects enliven every shot, restoring the vision of a particularly vivid world, also thanks to the strange and pleasant effect of the real materials used for the constructions and dynamic transitions between shots. In all of this, perhaps it would have been even nicer to be able to deviate further from the pre-set path and explore the world with more freedom, perhaps following more numerous and more developed secondary quests than those currently present, but there is hope that this aspect can be explored with the second part, which should open the setting more to a deeper exploration. Finally, we come to the other pillar on which the entire Fantasian experience is based, namely the splendid music by Nobuo Uematsu, who once again recalled by the great fellow adventurer Sakaguchi, answered this by putting together a memorable soundtrack. There is no shortage of relaxing piano pieces which are somewhat Uematsu's typical signature, but in this game we note a certain interest by the composer for synthesizers and even less common solutions compared to tradition, which here take over the classic orchestral tracks and help build a very distinctive identity for Fantasian.
