It would have been useless to go back to fighting games with the recent Dragon Ball FighterZ which is still enjoying good success, and so the developer CyberConnect2, who had already distinguished himself in the past for his passionate videogame adaptations of Naruto, had the difficult task of transforming the Akira series Toriyama in a modern RPG with open world, action combat and cutting-edge graphics. The Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot code has arrived practically close to the release, so in these days we have talked a lot about it while we were playing it, anticipating what we liked and what not in the first twenty hours of a very long adventure that traces the anime Dragon Ball Z from start to finish, but now the time has come to sum up in our review. The whole Z series First of all, it must be understood that Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot was conceived from the beginning as a counterweight to the two Dragon Ball Xenoverse of a few years ago. While sharing some aspects of the gameplay, the two titles are very different especially in terms of narrative. Instead of fantasizing about alternative timelines and stories that never happened, CyberConnect2 had to retrace the plot of Dragon Ball Z to please the fans and maybe even make it known to those who have never read Akira Toriyama's manga or have never seen the eight thousand reruns of the animated series. It is clear that we are talking about a mythological being that probably does not exist, but otherwise Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot does a great job, following the vicissitudes of Goku and his companions from the arrival of the Saiyans on Earth to the battle with Majin Buu: the story it is told through dialogues and cinematics which, in most cases, faithfully reproduce what was seen and heard on TV. You can choose between the English and Japanese dubbing but, needless to say, the latter is much better, while the soundtrack features the original music and multiple arrangements. Thanks to the virtuosity of Unreal Engine 4 and cel shading, CyberConnect2 has managed to redesign the most iconic scenes of the animated series with a style very faithful to that of Akira Toriyama and effects in step with the times that embellishes what, fundamentally, is a production with thirty years on its shoulders. The cut-scenes with pop-up dialogue are a little less polished, the animations stiffer, and give bad publicity to a much better visual impact for the vast majority of the time. The polygonal models are well-finished, full of details and excellently animated especially during the fights, with small goodies such as the afterimages left by the characters who, enhanced, move at superhuman speeds. In short, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is really nice to see, net of some tiny slowdowns that occur especially during automatic saves or at the beginning of some battles. The price to pay concerns the game world, which makes a story in itself and embraces a broader discourse. Toriyama's game world We have never had the opportunity to freely explore the world of Akira Toriyama before, also because the mangaka himself has shown it to us in bits and pieces during his comic works. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot brings together all the author's ideas in a single open world, identifying on the map of the planet iconic locations such as West City, the archipelago in which the Kame House resides, the woods above which the Korin tower rises - yes, we know it's supposed to be Karin, but for some reason in the game it's called that - and the shrine of God, and so on. Dragon Ball fans will instantly recognize the locations where the most famous moments in history took place, often marked with postcards that commemorate them with a scene from the anime and which are part of a huge list of collectibles to find and collect. CyberConnect2 drew on Toriyama's imagination, under his careful supervision, to finally reproduce a cohesive world full of details, albeit less interactive than we would have liked. It's not an open world in all respects: you can move from one region to another, if they are contiguous, but in most cases you will have to access the various areas from the world map. From the beginning you will therefore find yourself fluttering freely through the world, diving into rivers and lakes, knocking over the rock ledges that will have the misfortune to block your way as you collect the Z orbs scattered everywhere, the mand D medals hidden by the dozen in each area, minerals and fruit. You can fish from the dedicated piers with a simple mini-game, hunt for game and dinosaurs, even participate in hovercraft races once Goku's license is unlocked between the Frieza and Cell saga. There are so many things to do and to see, but the world, however colorful and detailed, always gives the idea of being there and not being there at the same time: it is a gigantic sandbox area which mostly serves to prolong the experience with hidden collectibles and materials to be collected to enhance the characters and unlock new content. And yet it has a certain charm, it is a pleasure to explore and fills the heart with nostalgia at the sight of panoramas which, together with the original soundtrack, remind us of the episodes seen on TV or the volumes leafed through eagerly when we still did not know each single joke in each saga. Wanting to make a comparison between third-person RPGs, the open world of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is conceptually closer to that of Assassin's Creed Odyssey than to that of The Witcher 3. The side stories Toriyama's touch in Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is also felt in the Side Stories that occasionally crop up on the world map. Marked with blue exclamation marks, these optional missions are temporary and disappear if you continue too far with the main campaign. Most of them revolve around old acquaintances that Dragon Ball fans will surely remember, enriching the narrative with the vicissitudes of these characters. We may find ourselves scavenging for materials to repair the cute android Otto or find out who the Yamcha lookalike is who is womanizing around the city while the real one trains in the afterlife with King Kaioh. These Side Stories add little to the campaign, but they're nice entr'actes that reward the player with experience points, Z Spheres, recipes or Emblems. The problem is that the structure of these missions, which are not dubbed and having no kinematics suggest a less well-finished addition than the rest, is really very similar. You will often have to defeat some enemies or collect items from around the world for the NPC on duty, without too much sophistication. However, solving the secondary stories becomes a moral obligation for the player who wants to strip the flesh of the nice Community system. Divided into various categories such as combat, cooking, exploration and so on, the Communities are chessboards on which to arrange the Emblems obtained, in fact, also and above all thanks to the secondary Stories. These medallions depict the various characters of the saga and improve the effectiveness of a Community, especially when placed together with other characters with whom they have established a bond. The player must therefore find the right combination of Emblems for each Community in order to unlock as many bonuses as possible, taking care to enhance the Emblems themselves with the right gifts to improve their effectiveness. Not all Side Stories unlock Emblems, and fortunately the game shows us the rewards in advance, but some of these missions are only received by completing others: they represent a substantial increase in the longevity of the game and although they are quite repetitive, the funny dialogues and some unexpected appearance make them more pleasant than expected. Fight as Kakarot In light of what has been written so far, it should be clear that Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is not a fighting game. It's easy to mistake it for a revised and corrected version of Dragon Ball Xenoverse, when in reality it wants to be something more especially as an RPG. More an action game with RPG elements than the other way around, the CyberConnect2 title seeks and achieves a delicate balance between the two natures that make it particularly accessible to the fan who, quite simply, wants to relive the story of Dragon Ball Z in a video game. It is from this point of view that it should be evaluated and that is why the combat system pleasantly surprised us. Sure, it's not particularly innovative: we've already played several Dragon Ball Zs in which we have direct control of the character in a three-dimensional space, but among all of them Kakarot is the one that responds best to an intuitive control system that guarantees the player everything he needs. need to replicate the spectacular dynamism of the battles seen in the anime. The base is in fact very simple: with one button you attack in melee, with one you shoot bursts of energy, with another you dodge and yet another allows you to parry. Then come the combinations of commands that give access to a whole series of more complex manoeuvres. They comthey take dodges that briefly slow time when executed at the right time, teleported counterattacks, defense-breaking strikes, stun attacks, combos, and special techniques that the player can learn, upgrade, and assign to specific shortcuts. Each maneuver or special technique consumes the aura, which we can recharge at any time by holding down a button like in many other Dragon Ball-inspired video games. Kakarot can be learned to play in a few minutes and initially it may seem too easy, but the minor enemies we will come across as we travel around the world are almost always annoying cannon fodder. The bosses are much more challenging and require a minimum of real RPG preparation. Better to have Chi-Chi cook a delicacy that increases our stats temporarily, and never forget to spend the accumulated Z Spheres to enhance special techniques, learn new ones or unlock passive bonuses that help us inflict or collect more damage. The clashes, especially those against the bosses, are a show of colors and special effects that chase each other on the screen at great speed between explosions, energy waves and very rapid combos. The camera struggles to follow the action and unfortunately it sometimes gets stuck in awkward positions, taking more seconds than it should to find the right shot, but in general the action is clear and legible thanks also to the visual indicators that anticipate certain attacks. offering us the possibility to dodge them and reposition ourselves prematurely. Some fights are graced by short cinematics, small QTEs and perspective changes that make the most important bosses more sophisticated in terms of gameplay, but we don't want to deceive you and therefore we repeat it: Kakarot is not a fighting game. To approach him in this sense means to face a bitter disappointment. The CyberConnect2 title does not have and does not pretend to have the complexity and depth of Dragon Ball FighterZ or any other 3D fighting game: it is an action combat system grafted into a third person RPG and, in this sense, it does its job honestly. This does not mean that it is an overly repetitive title and, on the contrary, there are several mechanics that influence the fights, making them more varied also on a visual level, but not only. The support characters, for example, will keep us company during the clashes, helping us in different ways depending on the category they belong to. We can order them to perform certain attacks, and exploit them with a minimum of strategy, or launch devastating coordinated attacks that take the name of Combo Z. It is a simple but effective dynamic that helps make some clashes even more memorable, although there is a reverse of the important medal: the playable wrestlers are only a handful. We will often find ourselves controlling Goku, Gohan, Vegeta and a few others while the minor Z Warriors such as Tenshinhan, Yamcha or Kuririn will remain simple support characters throughout the game. It's a great pity, above all because some of them, Krillin in the first place, have a role of significant importance in the course of history which here becomes a simple interlude cinematic. Playstation 4 trophies There are a total of 42 trophies: 28 bronze, 9 silver, 4 gold and 1 platinum. Some you will unlock automatically by completing the episodes of the campaign or by carrying out secondary activities, perhaps by cooking or upgrading the various characters. Others are more challenging and will force you to solve Side Stories or search for all collectibles. Obviously you will have to fight a lot. In conclusion... In this sense, in short, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is what we could basically define as a chain of boss fights interspersed with RPG sequences that sometimes go on even a little too long. The so-called Intervals take place between one saga and another, moments of freedom in which the player can compose the group as he wishes, free from the constraints of the story, and travel around the world in search of side stories or other challenges. The Interval is the right time to collect the Dragon Balls which regenerate every twenty minutes and which guarantee a wish: we will be able to ask for Z Balls or money to completely bypass the farm - which becomes important at high levels, when we have to unlock special techniques more powerful and expensive - or we could ask Shenron to bring back to life an old upgraded boss to fight him another time. Once the campaign is completed, these become the main extra content to face, as well as a secret interdimensional boss and the boundless Z Encyclopedia to complete by finding collectibles throughout the world. The Z Encyclopedia is basically the", "date": "2020-01-17", "grade": "7.8"}
