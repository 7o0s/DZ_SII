The latest findings of the previous civilization are dated 2066, following which nature re-appropriated the surrounding world, ~metal~ ceased to exist as we know it, tribes were born with almost primordial beliefs and customs, dominated by superstition. There is obviously no shortage of evidence from the past, starting with the presence of machines, robotic creatures with animal features that act on their own, while a sort of corruption is spreading and bandits willing to do anything want to impose their domination in the form of slavery. Then there is the main protagonist, Aloy, whose path we will follow (you will follow!) in search of answers, those about her own birth and about the machines themselves. This is all we will tell you about the story of Horizon Zero Dawn, the Guerrilla Games title that we have already had the opportunity to try on many occasions, the last one during our visit to the Dutch developer's headquarters. As for the version that will arrive in stores, we had ten days to concretely sift through the characteristics of the title: the more substantial videos will arrive in about a week, upon expiry of a further embargo, in the meantime make yourself comfortable reading what are the strengths, and weaknesses, related to the entry of the creators of Killzone into the world of open worlds. After more than 30 hours of gameplay, here's our review of Horizon Zero Dawn A true seeker Like any self-respecting title of the genre, Horizon Zero Dawn starts slowly, introducing the game dynamics and the shape of the map, thanks to missions that allow you to experience the stealth phases, direct clashes and close encounters with the first machines. Each has a metal casing capable of guaranteeing protection, as well as different behavior and attack methods with specific weak points, represented for example by a circuit that governs shots at a distance, a vampa tank (flammable liquid) and a control unit for activate the radar. After a few handfuls of missions, more complex robots are encountered: to get the better of it, it is therefore necessary to exploit the weaknesses and perhaps deactivate the most dangerous components, in such a way as to face the rest of the battle in the best possible way. Just the dualism between Aloy and the machines represents the most successful part relating to the excellent combat system: in this case it is possible to exploit the tall grass for silent eliminations or to face the most impressive machines thanks to epic, never banal battles; the level of challenge is always quite satisfying during the dozens of hours of gameplay offered by Horizon Zero Dawn. In any case, the robotic creatures represent only an - important - piece of the overall story, because inevitably bandits and other power-hungry humans are protagonists capable of changing the fate of history and exploiting the machines to their liking. In relation to this there are several missions that require you to interact with other people or face them as antagonists, not only during the main missions, but also in those side activities of liberating outposts. In this case the stealth approach is the one that pays the most, since these are highly populated settlements; in the unfortunate event of being discovered, the general entertainment suffers a backlash, since the clashes are less exciting and the artificial intelligence manifests its shortcomings to a greater extent. There are some situations, in fact, in which this type of mission is tackled together with a companion and things get even coarser because his presence is completely ignored by the opponents, at least until Aloy is discovered and the direct confrontation starts. A sort of The Last of Us syndrome, we might say, but fortunately the variety of situations means that moments like this are only a small factor in the general economy of the experience, and where artificial intelligence never excels particularly - not even during clashes with the machines - the pleasure of using Aloy's arsenal, as well as the skill required to get the better of it, amply compensate for these critical issues, giving engaging fights. The faithful companion of the protagonist is the bow, which can be upgraded or exchanged for a better version; there is no shortage of variants in the form of incendiary arrows, as well as gadgets such as the slingshot, a crossbow to create elemental traps and other gizmos that can be purchased from merchants scattered around the map: exploit the elements and weapons iAble to generate a shockwave allows you to make the most of each opponent's weaknesses. With the circle key you dodge, with the X the jump; the triangle allows you to interact with objects and collect resources, L3 to run and the digital cross to use healing and offense items. Finally, with L1, you access the weapon wheel without pausing, but slowing down time to allow for the correct selection or creation of ~ammunition~: the accumulated (or purchased) resources are used precisely to autonomously provide everything you need for the livelihood of the main protagonist. Another very important object is the Focus, which is activated via R3: in this way it is possible to identify enemies through obstacles, mark them with a triangle, highlight their path in order to take them by surprise; in the case of machines, highlight the weak points on which to concentrate one's firepower. The scanner becomes absolutely vital when you arrive in a new outpost populated by corrupted machines or bandits, necessary to avoid jumping headlong into the fight, exponentially increasing the difficulty. The genre to which Horizon Zero Dawn belongs is positioned within the action RPG, with the first component being very strong, as evidenced, flanked by a full-bodied RPG structure but not as complex and profound as the maximum exponents of the genre. The red-haired heroine can level up by improving her energy, she also has three branches of skills - predatory, audacious, harvester - within which to spend points to acquire athletic and functional characteristics. We then have weapons and equipment of different rarities, with modification slots capable of altering resistances or elemental attacks, for example. And again, main and secondary missions, specific commissions and liberation of outposts, Collolungo machines to ~climb~ to unlock the points of interest in the surrounding area, like Far Cry. In short, the RPG foundations are all there, only that they are less deep or reduced from a quantitative point of view, closer to those of Ubisoft titles than to great classics such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim or The Witcher 3. In general economy, in any case, they do their duty because they do not inundate the player with an enormous amount of similar things to do, but are grafted into a constant narrative progression, alternating between exploration and combat, for a result from our point of view balanced view and never too tight. No doubt there are repetitive sessions - the idea of outposts is quite boring - but when playing Horizon Zero Dawn you can feel a sense of discovery and constant novelty, synonymous with a great job done by the developers in trying to mitigate dj vu or sections identical. We particularly liked the moment in which, after a specific mission, the game world ~opens~ completely, allowing the protagonist to explore the whole map. To make you understand our sensations, let's make a bold comparison, with Hokuto no Ken when he arrives at the island of demons: the first impact is brutal; taking a few steps you come across at least four types of extremely difficult new machines, you get the feeling of enormous danger and in the meantime you appreciate new views that are absolutely inspired from a visual point of view. Or still the road that allows you to reach the first big city of the game, while on one side there is a boundless desert setting and on the other you meet the first Thunder Divorce, a huge mechanical beast that is difficult to bring down. Curiosity How long is Horizon? What happens after the main adventure? We played Horizon for 36 hours, completing about 80% of the total tasks. You can continue even after finishing the main story, in order to complete the rest of the missions and collect collectibles. How many difficulty levels are there? Four, from easy to very difficult, available immediately. Leveling up mostly affects the damage done by enemies, not the AI. Are there specific options for HDR and PlayStation 4 Pro? None, not even related to brightness: the game starts in HDR and 4K based on the type of TV connected. Is it possible to ~hook~ enemies using a lock system? No, also because it would make a combat system that focuses entirely on attacking the weak points of the opponents, even located laterally, static and simplified. However there is the possibility to select the aim assist in the options. How many types of missions are there? Main, secondary and commissions, which can also take place in multiple steps. Then we have freedomaction of bandit outposts, that of corrupted machines, hunting challenges, Longneck to trace, cauldrons to explore and tutorial missions. Each allows you to obtain items and experience points. Is there crafting? Yes, Aloy can create everything independently starting from the ammunition up to the insertion of the modifications in weapons and equipment, provided that she also collects resources from the carcasses of the enemies, some of which are also available from the merchants. What a world, gentlemen! The main story of Horizon Zero Dawn is quite fascinating, as it leads the player to delve into Aloy's origins, learn new information about past civilizations - also thanks to glyphs and other objects identified by the Focus - discover the genesis of the machines and at the same time bring ahead several non-trivial side quests, which are developed in several steps. The game map - among other things reproduced very well in the main menu, from above in three dimensions - is large enough to offer not only a visual variety, but also a variety of ~fauna~: we counted 25 different types of machines, together to humans and some animals (very few) to hunt to recover useful material for the merchants. During the exploration it is possible to find observation points, ancient finds, metal flowers; don't expect many cities of significant size, rather several outposts and settlements that support the key places in terms of history. This does not translate into the presence of large empty spaces with few things to do, because more often than not there are mountains, hills, ups and downs, forests, in short, an excellent density of vegetation; especially many areas populated by robotic herds. In addition to the surface elements, there are bunkers to explore and cauldrons, classic multi-level dungeons harbingers of ~alien~ technology, often manned by generously sized machines: their exploration allows you to acquire narrative information and the knowledge to override the behavior of creatures robotics, the so-called ~override~. In fact, when Aloy approaches a car without being discovered, it is possible to press the triangle to gain control of it: the Corsieri and the Ferrariete, for example, can be ridden to move faster, the Scavengers and the Seconds become allies by attacking the other cars, providing a competitive and ~confusing~ advantage over the others. Fighting in Horizon Zero Dawn undoubtedly represents one of the strengths of the production: the quality of the time spent using the bow and the other gadgets gives back an important sense of satisfaction, and even after several hours of play we never got tired of hunt and confront hostile machines head on. As mentioned, all that glitters is not gold, because the clashes in the outposts are less exciting and humans do not denote the same care for the rest; other problems are instead related to the dialogues and the interlude sequences: the polygonal models are excellent, but the lip is mediocre to say the least, with a static acting and little care in the transitions between one shot and another, including important events of history. We don't want to be snobbish or always expect the level reached by Naughty Dog - even if it has become an inevitable yardstick - but where Killzone already sinned not a little from this point of view, in Horizon Guerrilla has failed to make decisive steps forward. Only joy and exaltation, however, for the rest of the technical sector: the developers have repeatedly stated that they have deliberately chosen a lush and colorful world, in perfect antithesis with the post-apocalyptic settings so dear to recent productions. The result is simply exceptional, both from an aesthetic and artistic point of view and in terms of visual variety. The Decima Engine, a direct evolution of the graphics engine used for Killzone, really shines from this point of view, on ~smooth~ PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro: the visual distance is boundless, the textures have an enviable variety. The machines are made with truly astonishing detail; their animations, taken from those of really existing animals, represent the real flagship as regards the ~animated~ elements of the game. Also in this case the human antagonists enjoy the worst realization, less impressive from the polygonal point of view and in the movements: it is clear that the major efforts used by Guerrilla were directed to the game world, to the metal structures and to the robotic creatures , but even humans would have deserved more care as an integral part of the game world.
