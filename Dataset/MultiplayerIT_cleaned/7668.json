{"name": "DuckTales Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/122089-ducktales-remastered-storie-di-paperi.html", "text": "There was a time when video game tie-ins weren't necessarily synonymous with mere commercial operations and poor quality. Back in 1989 an unsuspected Capcom released in the American territory, and the following year in the rest of the world, a horizontal scrolling platformer for the NES (later also converted to the Game Boy laptop) based on the Disney license of the animated series DuckTales. The commercial success was immediate and deserved, thanks to simple but at the same time refined game mechanics, worthy of the best platform school of the time. The game sold more than a million pieces for both formats, very respectable numbers considering how small the gaming market was at the time. Today Capcom has entrusted WayForward Technologies with the task of re-proposing this great classic, which has just landed on the digital delivery platforms of PlayStation 3, Wii U and PC with the Xbox 360 version destined to be released late on September 11th. A packaged retail edition is scheduled for August 20 exclusively for the Sony console. DuckTales boasts a new graphic design, combined with the typical difficulty of the old platformers Indiana Jones with spats Impersonating the iconic Scrooge McDuck we are immediately called to defend our beloved deposit from an assault by the Banda Bassotti, once the danger has been averted, the real adventure will begin in search of various treasures, hidden in the most remote corners of the planet ... and beyond. Amazonia, Transylvania, the Himalayas, African mines and even the lunar surface are the places that we will visit in DuckTales Remastered, places that faithfully recall the splendid level design of the original, characterized by numerous secret areas and reasoned backtracking which proves to be fundamental in order to be able to find all the treasures and objects necessary to complete the five levels. Even the development of events, while never presenting any sensational twist, boasts a small non-linearity of its own, with unexpected events affecting many of the more or less famous Disney characters of the Duckburg universe, so that it is not uncommon to find ourselves going to rescue of some of our clumsy traveling companions. Pad in hand, one immediately realizes that not only the characteristic worlds have been maintained in this remake but also the peculiar level of challenge has remained unchanged. Already at a normal level, a good deal of effort is required to be able to complete the game and it is likely that players accustomed to today's difficulty standards will initially find themselves displaced. Frankly, it remains unacceptable to consider all this as a defect, distorting the gameplay of a classic to meet the current lowering of the challenge standards would have been a counterproductive stance. However, three different difficulty levels are immediately available, including an affordable easy mode, and a prohibitive extreme level that is unlocked once the game is completed. Xbox 360 goals DuckTales offers the canonical 400 points, which can be unlocked by finding all the treasures in the various areas, buying the sketches in the art gallery and finishing the game on any difficulty level (including extreme, which is worth 75 points). Six are the secret objectives. Innovation and tradition A great job has instead been done under the aesthetic aspect, unlike many other re-editions of Capcom classics (in particular the old fighting games of the Osaka house), for DuckTales the path of the complete makeover of the graphics was chosen and it could only be otherwise since it is a product from the late 80s. Where once there were only a handful of pixels to depict the Disney ducks, now the characters come to life with sprites that have nothing to envy to the drawings of the historic cartoon. The animations have been drawn ~by hand~ and perfectly reproduce the dynamic feeling of the episodes of the series, proposing many of the characteristic poses and expressions typical of the various protagonists. In part, the retro charm that characterizes the graphics of games with many years behind them has been lost, but the new cosmetics, so clean and in step with the times, demonstrates how well the work done by the WayForward graphics has been studied and studied. With the new level of detail reached, the characters on the screen manage to give nice sketches that make old fans of the original DuckTales smile, especially during the fun boss fights that represent the pinnacle of the gaming experience. To confirm how much attention has been placed in the realization of this re-edition it should be noted how the original voices (English) of the voice actors of the series have been usedanimated together with the now historic soundtrack. There are also numerous sketches that can be unlocked by spending in-game money.", "date": "2013-08-16", "grade": "8.0"}
