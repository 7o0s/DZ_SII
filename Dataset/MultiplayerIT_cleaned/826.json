However, this does not mean that the feeling of deja-vu is absent, since both technically and in the game structure this chapter is very reminiscent of the first episode released on Playstation 2 a couple of years ago. Having abandoned the structure of access to the races adopted by Underground 2, probably also as a result of the negative feedback from the public, Rivals on the contrary presents a subdivision of the competitions accessible directly from the game menus. Divided into two sectors, called circuit mode and quick play battle, all the game modes that have appeared in the chapters for home consoles are included. And so in quick play battle there are acceleration races, wheel skid races, steet cross on short and treacherous circuits, and nitro races, to be tackled rigorously with the turbo button pressed to reach the checkpoints in time. The circuit mode, on the other hand, offers more traditional challenges on urban circuits, adding the knockout mode (the last one of each lap is eliminated) and the relay which requires you to own at least two cars in your garage. All individual competitions are offered in three different levels of difficulty, marked by bronze, silver and gold medals. Although Rivals overall therefore offers a good variety and a fair number of tracks, the fact that everything takes place within the same setting resizes the experience by depriving it of the freshness it would otherwise need. Yes, because the progression of the races and the structure of the same soon proves to be short of breath, making everything rather repetitive and redundant after just a few hours of play. Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence of the opponents does not help either, which forcibly imposes the proximity of the challengers with often irritating results. Comment Need for Speed Underground Rivals is a decent racing game for the PSP, but it suffers from really high-level competition on the Sony laptop. Faced with excellent titles such as Ridge Racer or the recent Burnout Legends, it is difficult to accept the limits of artificial intelligence, the graphic defects, the very limited variety of settings and the not very intriguing game structure of the EA production. The fun way of tuning the cars may not be enough to put Rivals at the top of the shopping list of PSP owners. Pros: Excellent tuning of the cars Technically appreciable High longevity Cons: Not very intriguing game structure Revisable artificial intelligence The competition on PSP suffers Where do I put the neon? To save an otherwise rather modest racing game, the always welcome car tuning mode intervenes, which allows you to transform even the quiet four-wheelers that we are used to seeing on our streets into authentic monsters of 200 and more Km/h. Although not as accurate and detailed as in the versions for living room consoles, the elaboration of the cars in Rivals is still able to satisfy lovers of this type of ~hobby~; if in fact from a mechanical and performance point of view the upgrades are performed without major frills, on the contrary the development of the aesthetic component is decidedly rich thanks to a truly enviable variety of customizations and modifications. Neon, side skirts, front and rear spoilers, headlights, windows, bonnets, airbrushing and so on are just some of the possible choices to make to make your car a real work of the highest tamarraggine. The game also invites you to experiment, to the delight of the new Vin Diesels, since all the aesthetic elaborations are free (unlike the mechanical ones). Turning instead to the technical system, Need for Speed Underground Rivals clearly demonstrates that it is one of the very first games developed for the PSP: although far from being unpleasant, it does not offer the richness in polygonal models and settings which instead are typical, for example, of Burnout Legends. To this must be added a dancer frame rate, which suffers from the most complex situations despite the fact that the races never involve the presence of more than 3 challengers. Different speech for the sound, which as per EA tradition can count on a wide range of songs (33 in total); in order to satisfy everyone's tastes, it is possible to customize the tracklist, thus choosing only the songs of greatest liking. Looking at the game offering currently available for Sony's amazing handset, it's impossible not to notice the marked bias in favor of driving titles. Electronic Arts wanted to give thehis contribution in this already crowded sector by producing a version of the popular Need for Speed Underground, called Rivals, specifically designed to exploit the characteristics of the Psp.", "date": "2005-10-03", "grade": null}
