{"name": "Fastlane Street Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fastlane-street-racing.html", "text": "From the outset, it is evident how Fastlane Street Racing is in direct competition with Asphalt 4: realistic setting, super-sports cars, arcade game style and polygonal graphics put both products on the same level, with specific weights different from one and on the other side. The work Atod AB above all boasts a technical realization far superior to the work done by Gameloft: Fastlane Street Racing offers well-defined settings from a polygonal point of view, clean, rich in details and embellished with tasty light effects. The polygonal models of the cars are also excellent (although there are only four in the race), as is the frame rate, fluid and stable on practically every occasion. Stylistically, Fastlane Street Racing recalls the last chapters of Ridge Racer, and not only as regards the visual aspect: in races, the use of drifting is fundamental, to be carried out by combining a brake stroke with a decisive swerve, delegated in this case to the accelerometer of the iPhone. Basic driving in Fastlane Street Racing is fairly intuitive (with the brake and accelerator pedals in the right and left corners of the Touch Screen respectively), but drifting requires considerable practice, and furthermore varies significantly depending on the selected car model: two elements that could lead the most hasty to judge the Atod AB product as a difficult and frustrating racing game, while instead behind this initial obstacle lies a truly noteworthy experience. Although Fastlane Street Racing cannot boast the quantity of races and options of the aforementioned Asphalt 4, the strictly racing component is much better: the game has an excellent sensation of speed, the design of the 12 tracks is inspired and the opposing cars driven by the 'AI are capable of giving a genuine hard time even to the most savvy users. Too bad, as mentioned, that there isn't a great level of challenge in terms of play modes: apart from a main section that simply requires you to cross the finish line of the various tracks within the time limit, Fastlane Street Racing offers a rather small Challenge component ( with only six events, however not too stimulating) and a trivial Time Trial, with a few unlockables to stimulate the player's hunger for victories. A limitation that palpably affects the final evaluation of the title, which in any case remains to all intents and purposes one of the best examples of racing game currently available for the iPhone.
