{"name": "Recensione Juiced", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-juiced.html", "text": "Arcade guide The soul of the THQ title is purely arcade, the driving model is in fact very simplified and has been optimized precisely to simplify the pilot's life, allowing him to concentrate exclusively on the search for maximum speed. The game is essentially divided into two: on the one hand the simple arcade races and on the other the real beating heart of the title and that is the ~career~ mode. We put the quotes because this is not a normal career in the light of the sun, our success will in fact be based on setting up a stable, recruiting the drivers, finding the necessary funds for the cars and to participate in the absolutely illegal races, which take place only on city streets. We will start with a not exceptional bank account of 30,000 dollars, but which will allow us to take the first car, work it out and participate in the competitions on the calendar. The struggle with the budget will be constant throughout the game, sometimes even excessively heavy but it certainly provides an incentive to always improve and avoid mistakes. our success will in fact be based on setting up a team, recruiting drivers, finding the necessary funds for the cars and participating in absolutely illegal races Arcade guide There are four different types of races: the classic street races, the acceleration races which take place exclusively on straight lines, the speed races in which the driver must complete a lap of the course without ever dropping below the minimum required speed and finally the aerobatic competitions in which the ability to spin and drift will be rewarded. Obviously for each competition won we will receive money, which is the true soul of the game, we will have to be careful managers of our finances in order not to risk being left without competitions or without the possibility of winning. To make our work easier, we will be able to bet with other riders on our performance. Some indicators will also keep us updated on the reputation we have made in the street racing scene. This will allow us to participate in ~reserved~ and special competitions, but it will not be easy to maintain a high level of our fame, in fact it is enough to damage rival cars or refuse some challenges to see our popularity drop. Last life in pirate racing! Tuning what a passion As true tuning experts, we will be able to make the most of our creativity to make our car not only fast but also very stylish. Spoilers, miniskirts and anything else will allow us to create beautiful cars capable of leaving our opponents in the dust. Moreover, being able to count on prestigious brands such as Brembo, Konig and Alpine, Juiced also allows a high percentage of processing of the mechanical parts of our vehicle, with lots of faithfully reproduced components, but pay attention to the costs if you don't want to literally pulverize the virtual account at the bank. The better the modifications made to our vehicle will be, the more easily we will be able not only to win but also to recruit new drivers to our team, reputation and our fame, in fact, will be a useful weapon, but which, as mentioned before, is also very difficult to be kept sharp at the right point. Technically, the Juice Games product is quite valid, being able to count on a stable frame rate that provides an adequate sensation of speed, moreover accentuated by a good use of blur for the canonical ~blur effect~ given by the use of NOS. The city tracks, on the other hand, are quite sparse and excessively poor in details, in fact the wonders and speed seen in titles such as Burnout 3: Takedown are not comparable to Juiced. Juiced being able to count on prestigious brands such as Brembo, Konig and Alpine, allows a high percentage of processing of the mechanical parts of our vehicle Tuning what a passion The models of the cars, more than a hundred, are in any case well made and, thanks to a ~fun~ driving model, manage to give several hours of fun without too many pretensions. A praise must be given to the localization in Italian which, apart from rare exceptions, is fully convincing while we cannot say the same about the sound effects and music which are certainly a little below average. To complete our analysis we just have to remember the possibilities related to multiplayer: the developers have not forgotten the split-screen nor the system link and last but not least the possibility of challenging each other online, via the Xbox Live service which allows you to compete against six opponents at the same time. Comment In the end Juiced is a decent title, it would certainly have had more luck coming outas in the predictions more than a year ago. Now, despite not having particular flaws, but not even obvious advantages to remember, it remains ~crushed~ by the numerous automotive productions present for the Microsoft console such as Forza Motorsport, Burnout 3: Takedown and Outrun 2 just to name a few. The developers of Juice Game really lacked that extra bit of care and creativity to make their product exceptional, what they did fail to impose itself on the stiff competition. However, we secretly trust in a sequel, to give illegal racing enthusiasts what they really want. Pros Fun driving model Discreet technical realization Go-go tuning Cons A bit frustrating to always pay attention to costs It fails to impose itself on other racing games The genesis of Juiced was considerably troubled, initially in fact it was supposed to come out under the Acclaim brand more than a year and a half ago but after the closure of the historic publisher it fell into oblivion until the ~repechage~ by THQ, which trusted to the developers of Juice Games believing in the goodness of the project very similar to the film that launched Vin Diesel in the Olympus of Hollywood, Fast and Furious.", "date": "2005-08-01", "grade": null}
