{"name": "Let's Rock", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71831-rock-band-lets-rock.html", "text": "With a Guitar Hero still far from the iPhone, and in the face of an Activision not very attracted by the Apple phenomenon, the very active Electronic Arts has well thought of bringing its Rock Band to the App Store with a conversion built around the capabilities of the touch screen . However, a debut certainly not with the road cleared, in the face of that Tap Tap Revenge recently reached its third chapter and capable of gathering great success on the iPhone platform. The device that doesn't exist The most important point when analyzing a product like Rock Band obviously lies in being able to grasp its value in the absence of any peripheral, a fundamental factor instead in its console versions and cornerstone of the musical genre that has experienced its boom in recent years. In the same way, however, the enormous price difference must be considered, which on the Apple device was set at 5.49 euros (just lowered from the 7.99 of the debut), a fraction in relation to the plastic bands that populate our living rooms. Despite this, the points of contact to justify the title and belonging to the series are there, and they start from the presence of four different instruments to choose from: guitar, bass, drums and voice. Beyond the different rhythmic tracks to follow, the gameplay is however in practice absolutely identical in all four cases; in fact, it is simply a question of pressing the relative four virtual keys with the fingers when the colored indicator reaches the lower part of the screen. In the case of the voice there is a minimal difference, linked to the horizontal rather than vertical orientation of the scrolling, but the gist does not change at all; this to the disappointment of those who expected to be able to use their own voice like in a portable karaoke. The tracklist, initially composed of 15 songs plus 4 downloadable for free from the music store, is consequently quite poor in terms of quantity as well as decidedly North American as regards the names of the artists; people like Anarchy Club, Freezepop and Lynyrd Skynyrd aren't exactly among the most famous in our area, even if there are more popular names like Blondie, Blink 182, Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters and 30 Seconds to Mars. To strengthen the tracklist there is a special and aforementioned Music Store integrated into the application, which allows you to purchase packages of 2 tracks at a cost of 0.79; a more than honest figure, even more so when compared with the 0.99 for a single track requested by Tapulous's competitor, even if at the time of writing the EA shop appears decidedly understocked, being able to count on only 7 packages. Playing together The game modes are basically attributable to quick play, in which you choose a single track and an instrument with which to play it, and the evidently more structured and demanding world tour. On the other hand, the local multiplayer is interesting, even if far from easy to implement, with which it is possible to create small bands with a maximum of 4 players, obviously each of whom has an iPhone (or iPod Touch) and their own copy of Rock Bands. Instead, the total absence of the possibility of creating one's own character, a virtual alter ego that represents the user's digital rock star, is surprising; an element that has always distinguished the series and that would have contributed to giving further personality and depth to the product. On the contrary, the absence of money to earn and spend to buy clothes and tools significantly reduces the drive to play. The difficulty level, modifiable on the basis of 3 settings, is able to offer a challenge worthy of the name to every type of player. Finally, little to say about the aesthetic component, which manages to maintain a certain fidelity with the qualities of the series while being absolutely more functional than spectacular. The tested version is 1.0.0", "date": "2009-11-02", "grade": "7.5"}
