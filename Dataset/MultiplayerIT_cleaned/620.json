{"name": "Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-supersonic-warriors-2.html", "text": "The story I know how to do DBZ: SW2 is yet another Dragon Ball-licensed title that faithfully retraces the stages of Toriyama's infinite saga: the story that forms the background to the main mode, which is not by chance called ~Plot Mode~, is therefore the same manga and anime, seen from the eyes of fifteen of the many characters born from the imagination of the creator of Arale. Once the character has been selected  not all of them are present from the beginning  you will find yourself facing practically all the most historic battles of the various series, which when won will make the other characters and/or particular moves and transformations linked to that particular battle available. to be used in subsequent encounters and in other game modes; moreover, the development team has also thought of adding one or two ~alternative~ plots for each character: if you achieve certain objectives during particular battles (these objectives are not explicit and it will be up to you to deduce them from the clues that will be given to you during the cut scenes) some clashes not present in the original story have been unlocked, a sort of videogame ~what if~ that if completed will give access to secret characters (there are fifteen others for a large total of thirty selectable characters) and new, devastating special shots. As in any self-respecting fighting game, once all fifteen plots have been completed, we will be able to continue to amuse ourselves with free battles, arcade modes and a particular Maximum Mode which is practically a mix between the Plot and the Arcade, that is, a succession very precise of clashes, divided into three levels of difficulty, however not linked to any particular story, and always generous with secrets and unlockable material. Of course, wireless multiplayer is not missing, for two people with two DS and two cartridges; the scene closes with the short, not very useful (there is everything in the manual) but always a nice tutorial. Power levels Once the mode to be tackled has been selected, we are immediately faced with the first peculiarity of SW2, which in general differs a lot from a canonical one-on-one beat 'em up. In fact, we will be able to use both a single character and a team made up of two or three fighters in the clashes, and so obviously our opponents will be able to do the same: in Plot Mode the game will establish how many and which fighters we will have available, while in the others we will have a certain number of Dragon Points (increase going forward in Maximum Mode) to be exploited by choosing various fighters: Goku in Super Saiyan version is certainly stronger than any Dr. Gelo, and in fact one has a value of 5 Dragon Points Dragon, the other only by 1, and if your total number of Points to exploit is 10, once Goku SS and Dr. Gelo have been selected, the third character will be able to bring a maximum of 4 Points. However, not all 30 characters will be fully playable, half are supportive and once called via the touch screen in combat they will appear to carry out a certain action, which can be a particularly powerful blow as well as restoring health. energy, and then return ~to the bench~; vice versa, the ~normal~ characters fight one at a time in the arena, and can be replaced at will again via the touch screen. Having therefore made all the necessary choices (who to select, or not to place a support character and so on), the time comes to take the field: the playing areas are very large and extend both in width and in height, not in Case SW2 places particular emphasis on the fighters' flight capabilities and 95% of engagements will take place in the air. The canonical blows are only of two types, strong and weak, all the rest, apart from parries and projections, are special moves and secret blows, entrusted to key combinations that are the same for all the characters: therefore, there are no peculiar combinations as in a classic 2D fighting game, although visually and as a game effect each character will behave differently. Finally, in addition to the energy bar, there is also the block bar to keep an eye on, once filled it will no longer be possible to block opponents' blows, and the Aura value, which ranges from 0 to 200, is filled by pressing of the R key or simply by landing normal hits, and is necessary to perform the aforementioned secret moves, as well as transformations into Super Saiyans and changes from one fighter to another. Feel the power of the dragon! The playable characters, graphics aside, are not all different, but on the contrary we can distinguish a certain number of categories within which all the wrestlers will behave roughly the same way: Super Saiyan Gohan is stronger than his father, but the feeling in their use is practically the same; to the countRarely a massive character like Broly will be slow and powerful, just like Buu. That said, the fights are always fast, fast and furious, but never in such a way as to be confusing. The characters respond well and you always have everything under control, despite the speed: great is the satisfaction at the end of a meeting conducted particularly well, precisely because you managed to tame such a rapid action. In reality, however, coming to the head of a battle despite all the resources available, which in theory would serve to add strategic depth to the action, is not a complicated thing and, even without ever arriving at the thought of having won a battle by pressing keys at random, you just need to know and implement two or three basic concepts and tactics to defeat any opponent, even at the highest difficulty level. However, the feeling, so adherent to the spirit of the cartoon, is never lost and playability remains high, as well as the longevity that overcomes the problems of low difficulty and substantial repetitiveness of the action with its speed and with the many game modes provision, which give access, as mentioned, to various extra material. Unlike the first SW, the game backgrounds are in an excellent and fluid 3D, certainly helped by a scrolling that is instead purely two-dimensional: the characters are also in 2D, well designed and animated even if many things, especially the animations, seem simply recycled from the previous incarnation. The visual effects linked to the special shots are spectacular: also all in 2D, they still manage to impress and remain faithful to the cartoon. The music doesn't get noticed that much during the game (instead the one of the introduction is beautiful, even technically) as well as the effects, a different matter for the voices done very well with the voice actors of the original series: too bad the sampled sentences are very few, practically only to underline some hits Finally the DS factor: the use of the touch screen is simply limited to changing the character during the match and recalling a particular secret move that two members of the team will carry out in cooperation when the Aura is at 200. Frankly not much. Bandai does not enjoy an excellent reputation among the gaming public, but it is undeniable that when it gets down to it, it always manages to churn out noteworthy products: this is one of those cases. Supersonic Warriors 2 has no particular flaws; on the contrary, it puts a lot of meat on the fire and although not all of it is cooked to perfection, what matters is that in the end the game is always fun and enjoyable, frenetic and satisfying, even a must for fans of the series and highly recommended for those who look for a nice Action/Beat 'em up for your DS: the valuable technical realization does nothing but confirm the care placed in the programming, and although, 3D backgrounds aside, for the use made of the DS features SW2 could very well be a game for GBA, its presence in the Nintendo handheld toy library does nothing but confirm the successful handover on the throne of portable entertainment. Pros Excellent technical realization Always frantic and fun fights Lots of characters, modes, secret shots to unlock Cons Little is needed to win DS underused Now a couple of years ago, after some absolutely censored attempts, the triple alliance Bandai / Cavia / Atari succeeded in creating a portable Dragon Ball up to the expectations of the many cartoon and comic fans: Supersonic Warriors was a game full of characters and options, done well technically and above all with a frenetic and satisfying gameplay. Its sequel, Supersonic Warriors 2, does not deviate too much from the formula of its predecessor, but, or perhaps for this very reason, it proves to be a title capable of fully satisfying even quite demanding palates.
