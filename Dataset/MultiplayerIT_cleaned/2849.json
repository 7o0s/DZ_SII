{"name": "Dear My Cat", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dear-my-cat-recensione.html", "text": "Dear My Cat's review takes us to a different place than usual, distant and magical, in its own way: an island suspended in the sky inhabited exclusively by cats. It begins with a single cat, who finds himself in this place to come to terms with sensations that are somehow familiar to him, but the family soon expands. Conceived as a casual, relaxing experience, the Flero Games title boasts several virtual pet-style contaminations, given that our goal is to organize activities on the island and make it grow by building new areas, but also to worry about the quality of life of its inhabitants, the cats in fact. Gameplay In terms of gameplay Dear My Cat immediately reveals itself as a deliberately limited game, in which there is no challenge and no commitment, but only a relaxing atmosphere, supported by a very inspired soundtrack that accompanies the actions and the activities of the absolute protagonists of this experience, the cats. We are therefore only asked to touch the hearts and coins that appear on the screen, cyclically produced by the structures and characters who live on the island, while an achievement system progressively unlocks new rewards to add to our nest egg to be able to enlarge the scenario with new areas and maybe invite someone else to visit it. The experience is therefore very, very simple and immediate: the typical casual simulation game that comes out every now and then to see how far we've gotten, and which in this case always knows how to make us smile thanks to its cute graphics and a style that it is so reminiscent of certain Japanese animated productions. The problem lies in the incidence of freemium mechanisms, which actually make themselves felt quite early and push us to watch 30-second advertising trailers to get this or that prize, or ask us to buy packs of coins or hearts so as to be able to speed up the growth of the island and its inhabitants. Technical realization In short, Dear My Cat does not offer deep or multifaceted entertainment, indeed it does not go even remotely close, but it has a couple of tricks up its sleeve, not to laugh at. The music, which we have already mentioned, which accompanies the action in an engaging but delicate way, contributing in a fundamental way to creating certain atmospheres. And then obviously there is the graphics, very pleasant with their soft colors and the characters who let themselves go often and willingly to typically feline behaviors (try for example to deliver a fish to one of the cats to make his happiness grow), the low poly style so spot on and impeccable fluidity even at the highest quality, which can be activated from the settings.", "date": "2020-10-16", "grade": "6.5"}
