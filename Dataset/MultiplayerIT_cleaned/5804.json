The reason for such a long wait is to be found in a more in-depth cure in the conversion: where the first two were simple copy/paste of the console counterparts, in this case the small team in charge to take care of the PC version, he thought well of exploiting the greater power available to redo the beautiful Lightning's make-up a bit, introducing some high-resolution textures and reworking other special effects. The result, while not tearing the clothes for joy, is certainly the best of the three and is appreciated above all in comparison with the releases for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 which suffered from stuttering and pop-ups as well as being limited to low resolution 720p and at a frame rate of 30 frames per second. On Windows systems, however, everything runs smoothly even in FullHD and without the need for particularly powerful hardware: with a simple GeForce GTX 570 dated 2011 the frames per second stabilized easily on the maximum limit of 60 frames per second. Furthermore, thanks to the patch released on Christmas Eve, resolutions up to 4K have also been added and the reviled permanent connection requirement has been eliminated (in this case, it is understood, cloud saves are disabled). It's the best conversion of the trilogy, but it only impresses when compared to the consoles The last seven days On the other hand, the PC version of Lightning Returns adds nothing to what was expressed at the debut in late 2013: almost all the additional content gradually released by the developer is included (with the exception of the Aerith structure, which will not be made available even in the future ). Once again the player will play the role of the pink-haired heroine, awakened by the god Bhunivelze five hundred years after the events of the second episode, in the desperate task of saving as many souls from the imminent end of the world: the countdown leaves her only thirteen days to accomplish the feat. Having completed the first two episodes is highly recommended: the references to what happened in the past are continuous and not having the slightest idea of Lightning and his sister Serah's experience makes the plot lose a good chunk of depth, although the attempts to summarize in pills the epic of the warrior is appreciable. The narrative canvas is probably not the most convincing and, although in the end the game takes on a good rhythm and manages to catalyze the player's interest, several plots seem to have been inserted somewhat by force, badly concealing the attempts to hide that this trilogy after all was not initially conceived by the programmers. Time is a fundamental aspect in the game structure: initially you have only one week, but by completing some secondary missions (however it is not possible to complete them all, it will be up to the player to choose the most ~rewarding~ ones in terms of minutes) you can practically double. Every day on Nova Chrysalia, the planet where the drama takes place, corresponds approximately to an hour and a quarter of real time: however the hands stop during the cutscenes, the fights and on board the Ark, a sort of hub in which you are systematically sent back on the stroke of 6:00. In this area there is the Yggdrasil tree which, as mentioned above, can move the point a little further thanks to the contribution of Eradia points that are accumulated by completing the secondary missions. In the original release, the developers didn't seem to have done the math properly: at the beginning we ran far and wide for the four macro regions of the game world in a frantic attempt to finish them in the shortest possible time, only to realize later that there was so much more to do. In short, the final phases were lived while waiting for the last act. The integration with the additional content, which also includes ~pieces of plot~, has instead balanced the situation and in this PC version the experience is much more homogeneous. Lightning creates fashion The combat system and that of growth have instead profoundly changed compared to the first episode: in this case the only character to control is the beautiful and unpleasant Lightning, who can increase her vital parameters (which are three: life points, attack and magic) only by completing the secondary missions and no longer accumulating experience with the furious killing of monsters: this causes you to try to evade the combatment whenever possible. On the battlefield, the fights are very fast and decidedly arcadey: on the one hand, in fact, the possibility of parrying and dodging enemy offensives has been introduced, on the other, the tactical menus have been eliminated; in practice with the front keys of the joypad (it is not technically possible to use the keyboard / mouse combination, an option that would have been in any case inadvisable) the actions to be performed are directly selected, if you have sufficient ATB. Depending on the outfit equipped, the heroine can change her attack style, along the lines of what happened with the paradigms of the first episode; there is also an additional energy bar which fills up by winning battles and which unlocks lethal attacks. The initial difficulty consists in studying the weak points of the enemies, in order to be able to face them with the right combination of costumes, one of the most successful aspects of the production. Moreover, wearing the most suitable garment, combining it with classic equipment, is the only way to modify Lightning's parameters, whose basic skills do not undergo changes during construction. The clashes, on the other hand, are a little too affordable in the first game and in order to get a more demanding challenge it is necessary to complete the game thus unlocking a more difficult mode, but at that point not everyone could be eager to press the Start button again.", "date": "2015-12-27", "grade": "7.2"}
