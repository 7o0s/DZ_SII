{"name": "Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castlevania-dawn-of-sorrow.html", "text": "The beauty of two screens As for the peculiar characteristics of the DS, i.e. double screen and touch sensitivity, Dawn of Sorrow offers a rather fluctuating final result. In fact, the idea of entrusting the upper display with the display of statistics and status of the character or, much more important, of the map of the castle obviously updated in real time, is fully promoted. This novelty therefore allows you to cancel one of the most boring passages of the Konami series, or the frequent interruption of the game in order to view the progress and your position inside the manor through the menu. The use of the touch screen was not as exciting; the advertised possibility of destroying blocks of ice to create passages is actually present only in a limited fraction of the game, thus making it completely ancillary. Even the need to draw magic symbols to permanently lock up the bosses seems like a stretch rather than a real enrichment of the gameplay, if not downright boring since it requires a mnemonic effort combined with the extraction of the otherwise unused nib. The wireless connection is instead well exploited, allowing the exchange of souls between various players, as well as the possibility of challenging each other in multiplayer thanks to a not unforgettable but all in all appreciable mode. Excellent longevity, which alongside an adventure with a full-bodied duration with multiple endings combines some extras of sure interest, capable of justifying a second passage inside the castle. A last note to the interlude scenes, with a trivial flavor and far from the personality that had characterized those of Aria of Sorrow. But then you can't have everything... We knew there wouldn't be a long wait. And indeed here it is. After the splendid trilogy of episodes for GBA, Castlevania finally makes its debut on Nintendo DS too, obviously with its beautiful subtitle as per tradition. This time it's Dawn of Sorrow, and the protagonist -after Aria of Sorrow- is still Soma Cruz; the plot that acts as the incipit to the events narrated takes place just shortly after the conclusion of the last chapter for GBA, and sees as the main threat that of a mysterious cult determined to awaken the prince of darkness, Dracula, at any cost. The pattern is therefore quite traditional, as is largely the unfolding of the story and the dialogues. But Castlevania certainly doesn't owe its fame to the complexity of the narrative, but rather to the goodness of the game mechanics. And on this, fortunately, Dawn of Sorrow does not deny itself. Traditional evolution Surely the Konami programmers didn't want to make a revolutionary episode; but this, considering the far from unforgettable attempts in 3 dimensions in which the series has ventured, is to be considered a merit. This mainly means that anyone who has had the pleasure of playing with the episodes for the GBA will absolutely not struggle to immediately enter the mechanisms of this latest chapter for the DS. Nonetheless, Dawn of Sorrow should be considered as a direct descendant of Aria of Sorrow not only for the plot and character ties, but above all for the similarities at the level of the game system. Also in this case one of the fundamental elements is in fact to be found in the souls, which the defeated enemies release randomly and which allow Soma to gain new skills, both offensive and purely ~athletic~, to reach otherwise inaccessible places. Souls can also be merged with weapons, to gain further and very useful offensive potential. To make things easier, the programmers have also decided to make two sets of different equipment available to the player, interchangeable at any time by pressing a button without any interruption in the gameplay. Despite these vaguely rpg elements, Castlevania remains an adventure with broad action / platform traits. In fact, the juice of the game must be sought in the exploration of the castle combined with the killing of the enemies who will get between Soma and the final goal. Just the enemies represent one of the best features of the Konami production, thanks to a really excellent design and variety. Zombies, harpies, witches, imps, animals of all kinds, carnivorous plants are just a fraction of the creatures that the programmers have included in Dawn of Sorrow. If the mechanics have therefore remained almost unchanged compared to the last episode for GBA, the same cannot be said for the technical aspect. While absolutely in line with the artistic direction that has characterized the Konami franchise nn recent releases, the Japanese graphic designers have exploited the greater potential of the DS by improving practically every aspect. Obviously 2D is the master, with large and detailed sprites, enriched animations and backdrops that are always evocative and atmospheric. The sound system is also excellent, which proposes a very close-up musical accompaniment as per tradition, enhanced by the never enough praised stereo speakers of the Nintendo console. Comment Excellent. This is the most appropriate judgment for the DS debut of the Castlevania series, which with this Dawn of Sorrow confirmed the absolute goodness of a game mechanic that continues to amaze for its longevity and freshness at the same time. Far - fortunately - from any revolutionary intent, this last chapter represents an evolution from every point of view of the already excellent Aria of Sorrow for GBA. A weak plot and the non-exciting use of the touch screen are the only notes that can be moved to a product whose purchase is therefore recommended to say the least. Pros: Splendid game mechanics Technically excellent Great longevity The map always in sight! Cons: Weak plot Use of the touch screen not exciting Interlude scenes not up to par", "date": "2005-10-14", "grade": null}
