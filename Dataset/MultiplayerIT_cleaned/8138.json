{"name": "Iron Sky Invasion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/111905-iron-sky-invasion-la-svastica-sulla-luna.html", "text": "Nazis from the Moon ring a bell? If the answer is negative, it means that you missed Iron Sky, a bizarre low-budget trash movie born from a Finnish, German and Australian co-production. Despite the over the top plot (in a nutshell, in 2018 the Nazis return from their secret base on the Moon, and plan to destroy the Earth by launching huge asteroids from space), the film wasn't exactly a global success, getting generally poor ratings critical acclaim and decidedly limited theatrical releases. Although from a cinematic point of view it is very close to the waste of film, the film hides at least a strong and irreverent humor, able to make fun of both the Reich and many other ethnic groups, including Europeans, Americans, Indians, Koreans and many others , with a moral on the war that is not taken for granted after all. So far, so good, until the folks at Topware Interactive thought of making a video game out of it. Lunar Nazis to the rescue The project was born more by chance than by actual planning. On the one hand there was Topware's desire to do something different while waiting to start work on the next chapter of the Two Worlds saga, on the other hand a friendship of some of the developers with the producers of the film. A phone call, a drink, and the tie-in idea soon materialised. The result is a very classic space combat game where, in the role of an unidentified American pilot, you will find yourself fighting your own war against the return of the Third Reich, all around the Earth's orbit. The missions, without a division between main and secondary, will follow one another without interruption, given that, as soon as an assignment is completed, new problems to solve will immediately become available on the map. It will therefore be up to the player to decide when to take a break and dock at one of the allied orbiting stations, where it will be possible to refuel, change spaceships among those available, or enhance various aspects of the one in use, including the efficiency of weapons, radar and engines. Once launched into space, you will find yourself fighting with enemy ships with very different sizes and characteristics. The basic ~flying saucer~ of the Reich is the Valkyr, agile in maneuvers and very similar to the first ship you will find yourself piloting, but you will soon find yourself facing more dangerous and advanced models. The top of the Nazi army is represented by zeppelins, huge space airships. Against the latter, traditional weapons, whether plasma cannons or guided missiles, will be of little use, limiting themselves to deactivating individual cannons and engines. To destroy one of these beasts the only way will be to wait for the hangar doors to open, ready to throw up a handful of support Valkyrs, and put in a generous salvo of missiles. Tactically speaking, this is the high point that Iron Sky Invasion's gameplay has reached. Although the ship's energy management, which can now be diverted to shields, now to engines, now to weapons, may suggest otherwise, pad in hand, the gaming experience is decidedly meager. The semi-automatic aiming and poor enemy artificial intelligence will make the ~dogfighting~ flat and boring, and even the clashes with the zeppelins will end up, after several repetitions, boring without reservation. With a good number of great names of the past from which it would have been enough simply to ~copy~ to put together a minimum number of interesting missions (from Freelancer to Privateer, to X-Wing, to the entire Wing Commander saga), the work of Topware it appears as a lazy attempt to re-propose the atmosphere of the film, without any verve from the point of view of gameplay and game design. Space boredom The above is made even more evident by some ~escort~ missions, among the worst offered by the game. Without going into too much detail, suffice it to say that you'll spend more time looking at the map, (not too) patiently waiting for something to happen, than actively shooting space Nazis. Unfortunately, there aren't many excuses for such a flatness, and the same can be said for the spaceship upgrade sector. Aside from the relative annoyance of having to scavenge debris from enemy ships by literally running your ship over them (ever heard of tractor beams?), once you reach the upgrades screen all you can do is level up the efficiency of engine, radar or weapons, with no possibility to further customize the equipment of the rodsronavi. About seven, eight hours are needed to complete the round of missions proposed by the game, which will leave you with very few positive memories, if not some funny gags from some cast members. The mission briefings will in fact be presented to you via short videos, in a decidedly ironic and amusing way, by various well-known personalities, making this feature the only truly ~different~ and interesting one in the production. From the point of view of the controls, the use of a pad is basically mandatory. Although several productions of the past have successfully succeeded (above all Freelancer), controlling the spaceships of Iron Sky Invasion with the coupled mouse and keyboard is a titanic undertaking, destined only to make the experience much more irritating. Unfortunately, once the short and meager campaign is over, there will be no other reason to keep the game installed. A multiplayer sector, with the possibility of putting yourself at the controls of Nazi ships, would undoubtedly have been an interesting addition to the formula, but Iron Sky Invasion remains on the safer ground of the single player experience. From a technical point of view, the best aspect is represented by the level of detail on individual friendly and enemy ships, well defined even at close range and full of moving parts. For the rest, the realization is decidedly out of time, especially from the point of view of the effects. Old-fashioned lens flare, non-existent particle effects and very low definition explosions don't grant much pleasure to the eyes. If nothing else, the fluidity is guaranteed, and the PC requirements are very low.", "date": "2012-12-05", "grade": "4.5"}
