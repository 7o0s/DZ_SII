{"name": "A volte ritornano!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/126176-killer-instinct-a-volte-ritornano.html", "text": "The sensational announcement of the return of Killer Instinct, a historic franchise linked to the world of fighting games, caused quite a stir and a great ovation at the Golden Center in Los Angeles last E3. Tempers then cooled a bit after learning that the new chapter would be released in the form of free to play, or a free game that links its raison d'etre to microtransactions. Today that we have our hands on the Double Helix Games production we can finally sum up and judge in its entirety this bizarre choice to transform a beat'em up backbone into a great demo with free access. Those who were originally concerned that the entire development team has changed since the original, however, find comfort in knowing that Ken Lobb, creator of the series, oversaw the entire project for Xbox One. Killer Instinct is on the new Xbox One marketplace, and its free download gives access to a single character, Jago, and the three game modes currently present: Training, Dojo and Survival. The queen mode of fighting games, or Arcade, is missing, which according to the developers will be included later and always free of charge. To judge this title in its (current) entirety we decide to unlock the basic package which also includes the other five characters. There is also a ~deluxe~ version, sold for around 40 euros, which includes two characters to be published in the future, included in the next expansion, various objects to customize your digital alter-ego and a port of the original Killer Instinct. Ken the warrior would pale seeing the possible combos in Killer Instinct Contents Who more than Killer Instinct, a technical game full of moves/counter moves, deserves a nice dedicated arcade stick? Mad Catz has an outgoing model for almost 200 euros and the bad news is that all dedicated Xbox 360 controllers (for example we tested the Tekken one) are not compatible, just like the old joypad. All that remains is to use the Xbox One controller, which fortunately has an excellent directional cross that is well suited to this kind of game. The soreness in the joints of the hand, however, is still felt after a few games due to the large amount of combos to make and buttons to press. The six fighters available (Jago, Orchid, Sabrewulf, Thunder, Sadira and Glacius) are well balanced and equipped with equivalent characteristics. Glacius could possibly be the only slightly more difficult to deal with because it has ranged moves that make it less approachable than the others. Killer Instinct is based precisely on combos and the ability to perform increasingly long and complex ones (the popular professional player Ryan Hart managed to chain 105 hits!). Six keys divided into Opener, Linker and Ender are used for kicks and punches. The former serve to start a chain, the latter to extend it, and finally the Ender to inflict the final blow that removes another piece from the energy bar. If, on the other hand, we are suffering a long combo ourselves, it is possible to get out of it by performing a Combo Breaker (when the commentator pronounces the famous C-C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!), or press the punch or kick buttons in rapid sequence of the same intensity as those suffered. In Killer Instinct there are also other moves such as the Juggle, Shadow Counter and Counter Breaker, or all difficult techniques to master that know how to distinguish real players from the occasional ones who appear bewildered on Live. However, all these moves and technicalities can be known through a truly useful and well-crafted modality such as that of the ~Dojo~, in which we can learn everything with 32 articulated lessons that vary on all topics and which represent an excellent way of making tutorials in a fighting game. Killer Instinct is an anomalous free to play, as everything that can be unlocked, with the exception of the characters, is free of charge but must be earned on the field through victories and completion of objectives. By doing so, Killer Points are earned which can then be converted into customization items, music and bonuses. From a technical point of view, the game is truly spectacular and full of food for thought. The polygonal models of the wrestlers are detailed and well modeled, all of which are very distinctive and charming. Even the backgrounds of the various stages are rich in animated and very deep elements. Killer Instinct is loaded with effects of all kinds, particles and polygons, even if there is excessive aliasing right on the fighters. The music, tested with a 7.1 surround system, is decidedly pressing and adaptyou to the type of game, with catchy tunes that immediately come to mind and excellent sound effects, as well as the voices of the characters and the legendary commentator. Xbox One goals Killer Instinct adds 1000 points to your gamerscore, across 92 objectives. These are split evenly between survival and multiplayer modes, and 80% are unlocked naturally by playing and winning. There are decidedly difficult objectives to achieve because they require great perseverance and passion, such as the one that requires 2000 matches for each of the wrestlers. Handbrake on The obvious limitations from which the new Killer Instinct suffers are immediately evident. Six total characters, for around 20 euros, are very few. The lack of a ~classic~ single player mode like the Arcade one is also felt, reducing the game to a forced choice between Survival and multiplayer. The latter, moreover, turns out to be quite boring after a while because most of the matches focus on the clash Jago against Jago, that is the only free character with which each player starts (and which most continue to use, without unlocking the extra). Therefore, even considering Killer Instinct as a normal digital delivery game, and not a free to play one, the cost/offer ratio is totally unbalanced in favor of the former regardless of its true nature. However, it seems clear that the Killer Instinct ~project~ is in constant evolution (a 3 GB update was released in recent days, moreover) and that in the future it could bring to this title the elements that are currently missing or are absolutely insufficient. With more modes and an expanded roster, the rating would go up quite a bit, because it's a really fun and well done title. Ultimately, the new chapter of Killer Instinct is a fighting game that can be enjoyed by everyone despite its ultra-technical nature, within the reach of even non-fans of the genre but difficult to master completely. Despite being ~castrated~ at the moment, a try is obviously a must since the download is completely free.", "date": "2013-12-04", "grade": "7.0"}
