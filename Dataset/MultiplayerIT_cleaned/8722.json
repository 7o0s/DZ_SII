The warm blankets of notoriety and gain certainly help to tolerate the many hardships of the task, of course, but reaching the zenith also brings responsibilities that very few studios are able to respect or even tolerate. it is achieved as creators and / or master craftsmen of a genre. In fact, being seen by a huge fanbase as the founding fathers of a given type of video game means having to deal with constantly growing abnormal expectations, and beyond a certain number of titles, the production of a homework is no longer sufficient to satisfy the rumbling belly of an increasingly squeamish and hungry audience. Over the years, FromSoftware has easily avoided this ~emperor's dilemma~ while maintaining its position on the throne of quality. Despite being faced with a host of imitators, in fact, the Japanese developers have never really been reached by their rivals, thanks to an excellent combination of genius in level and system design, art direction, atmosphere, and very serious psychological issues integrated with great naturalness in the underlying narrative. After four classic souls and a Bloodborne, however, even a well-fed and satisfied fanbase is starting to want more. Start wanting ~more~. The team's response to this hunger for novelty is called Elden Ring and, although at first glance this creature may seem very close to what has been seen in the past, we are actually facing the most ambitious and extensive title ever created by Miyazaki and his FromSoftware's tactic to ensure a real leap into the future was actually very logical: a complete structural transformation with the transition to the open world, and a new approach to exploration linked to the presence of the jump and a mount. The rest? A mass of mechanics and philosophies already seen in the past, integrated here in a sort of summa of knowledge of the genre. Put simply, their latest work does not want to change souls, but wants to take them to the maximum limit, representing the highest point to which the genre can aspire. Whether they made it or not we will try to explain it now, in our review of Elden Ring. Narrative and content: Miyazaki's half-lies Elden Ring: oh? Are you mad at me? Taking a rundown of the past statements of the good Hidetaka Miyazaki and the producer Yasuhiro Kitao, it is difficult for us not to imagine them giggling under their mustache at what they said publicly. Not that there are any outright lies in their statements, but to think they downplayed it all is seriously an understatement. The first, after all, had spoken of a more crystalline and readable narrative, built on the background created by the author of Game of Thrones George R.R. Martin and therefore equipped with much more solid foundations than seen in souls; the second instead spoke of a duration of about thirty hours of the campaign, with secondary contents capable of exponentially increasing the times. They are both only partial truths and we learned it the hard way during a fairly tight time review, where to complete the campaign we almost never left the screen for a week, grinding over 75 hours of gameplay. If on other occasions, however, we would have taken much more time to complete the analysis, tackling the enterprise more relaxedly, this time we didn't want to detach ourselves, because Elden Ring managed to melt us mercilessly into the chair. The new FromSoftware game is, in fact, able to amplify the most attractive features of its predecessors up to levels that we didn't think possible, first of all their satisfying sense of discovery, here capable of turning into a constant flow of adrenaline barrels and facial paresis. Let it be crystal clear, we want to avoid spoilers in this piece as much as possible: revealing anything would be a discrete sacrilege, and we have no intention of ruining the experience for you. However, there are structural elements in the game that must be treated, and inevitably they could dampen certain surprises (these are largely predictable things, but so be it). The first question of this type that we need to talk about is that actually someone very skilled could close the game in about thirty hours (as stated by Kitao, in fact), but we believe it is appropriate to specify how doing so in all probability precludes something as eighty percent of the actual contents of the work. From this point of view Elden Ring is in fact disconcerting: a shapeless mass of bosses, regions and surprises studiesyou in a painstaking way, equipped with an internal variety practically never seen in an open world. And for heaven's sake, there is no shortage of repeated clashes and structurally similar moments: various bosses are reused (in constantly different situations), many maps contain underground dungeons and ruins with comparable morphology and there is no lack of filler content treated in a clearly less detailed way than others, yet the final result remains shocking. Wandering in search of something almost always repays the player's curiosity with some high-level battle or some significant object. Experimentation and meticulous research are the best way to approach the experience, and there are countless times in which we have been amazed by what FromSoftware has put in place in places that at first glance seemed to us to be of little significance. What has been said above, however, should also warn you, because the underlying philosophy of this open world is a pure exaltation of that of classic souls: keep going and you will lose hours, hours and hours of content, dozens of epic battles in the wind , hundreds of objects and even entire regions. We do not believe it is appropriate to elaborate further. Elden Ring: touching a stele of this type will transport you elsewhere, but you will always be in danger The partial truths, and very little surprises us, also concern the management of the plot. While it is indeed in some ways true that the Martin/Miyazaki collaboration has led to transformations in the narrative skeleton of Elden Ring, these have certainly not outlined a clearer and more direct story... on the contrary, things have even more complicated and inscrutable when you consider the sheer mass of events and quests that the game contains. Having a world with already well-defined myths and protagonists available gave the good Hidetaka the opportunity to indulge himself, creating a web of conversations, NPCs and choices that relate directly to a long series of primary events, the latter fundamental for general understanding of what takes place on the screen. The approach to all this is, again, an adapted version of what was seen in the old souls: the events that advance the individual stories are specific conversations, which then lead to the activation of additional phases in other locations and usually reward the player with hints and extra items as you go along. Where, however, already in the previous games it was difficult to carry on some of these subplots, here things have become truly tragic in some cases, and despite multiple attempts we have shamelessly lost some characters during the advancement, unable to find them. True, in the game it is possible to teleport at almost any moment to checkpoints scattered throughout the maps called places of grace, but we assure you that the size of the world, combined with the presence of an infinity of well-hidden places often related to quests, will really make hard life for completionists. If nothing else, some of these stories forcibly advance along with the ~mandatory~ events, at the cost of losing some dialogue. We would have liked to see slightly more precise clues in some cases considering the new situation, we don't deny it, while at the same time understanding the desire to underline the importance of thoughtful exploration with a choice very close to the narrative management of past works (and yes, the descriptions of the objects remain quite important). Overall, we believe that the continuation of this practice is fully justified. The world created by Martin and Miyazaki is elaborate and fascinating, a tragic universe on the verge of destruction, yet still torn apart by strife, the quest for power and mysterious factions. Seeking the deep meaning of all this by riding through the boundless lands of the game is a cornerstone of the experience and is part of the reason why Elden Ring will be talked about for months, or more likely years, after its release. Ah, for the record, the game seems to want to place itself as a cauldron of everything a souls should be also from a narrative point of view: FromSoftware's self-referentiality is even more powerful than usual in this world, and we found it most of the time times well exploited; winks that turn into small glimmers of light within a whole where tragedy always dominates. Gameplay and level of challenge: die as a lord, live as a god Elden Ring: These funny guys are called albinaurs. They are not friendly The ~I say I don't say~ linked to the declarations of FromSoftware's key men obviously also involves a lot of what has been revealed on difficulties and mechanics. There was talk of a game designed not to stress the player and allow him to approachand the action in a myriad of different ways, and in fact all this corresponds to the absolute truth: the gigantic world of Elden Ring is freely navigable without forcing thanks to the aforementioned teleportation (provided you discover and activate them, of course). There is almost always the possibility of retracing one's steps, calmly spending hours perfecting a strategy or exploring a plain to reveal every secret, and there are only thin beams of light to broadly indicate the way forward, in addition to a clear map of the world that you can view once you've found the pieces you need. Defining the game as a perfect entry point for those who have never approached a soulslike is however quite misleading if we are going to discuss the level of challenge put in place ... because on the one hand it is true that FromSoftware's latest work, especially in the initial areas, it offers such a number of options that it seems easier than its predecessors, but things change markedly when you reach the final stages, in which the Japanese studio has seen fit to balance the difficulty by calibrating everything tremendously towards the high. Therefore, arriving unprepared for the second half of the adventure is nothing short of traumatic, so much so that it gave us the impression of being a deliberate design choice, with the clear intention of forcing players to adapt to the new systems. Conceptually, the idea does not differ then a lot from what was done with the original Demon's Souls: leaving the player to himself in order to lead him to test multiple solutions and to master the basics of the systems as soon as possible. In Elden Ring, however, the thing is more gradual and infinitely more complex, precisely because of the many innovations. Spells and enchantments, for example, have never been so flexible and powerful, with a plethora of alternative options that make 'pure' builds absolutely devastating when well managed. At the same time, we are faced with the most shocking inventory of weapons ever included in a game by the Japanese team, with a number of classic and special weapons to scream, whose methods of use are multiplied exponentially by the presence of the ashes of war: skills Freely equipable on each Death Tool at checkpoints, offering powerful additional moves. The ashes just mentioned, then, also allow you to change the type of weapon, modifying the percentage bonuses to the damage linked to the individual statistics (basic element present in every souls, never so adjustable) and the usual enhancement of the blades by the blacksmiths is maintained ( with basic weapons going up to a +25 bonus and equally powerful specials with much lower numbers). Add to all this enormously enhanced ranged weapons with dedicated ashes, the presence of a stealth system useful for overcoming certain phases with an advantage (or simply dodging them altogether), and the possibility of building a myriad of objects through crafting manuals scattered throughout the various maps, and you will immediately realize the range of options offered by the game in combat. It is precisely considered what has just been explained that the desire to raise the difficulty beyond a certain point makes sense: if there weren't some kind of barriers, most players would completely ignore most of the game's systems; placed in front of opponents endowed with brutal malice instead one is pushed to sharpen one's wits, and ourselves (after having taken more trips than it is legal to report) during certain particularly difficult encounters we found ourselves overcoming them with grace once we started exploiting the status system and available items. For the record: the fact that the bosses have specific weaknesses and that the tools are so varied and powerful is not enough to make the game a walk once you master it all. Just like in the most recent FromSoftware titles, these are facilitating shortcuts that only partially bypass the challenge level. To avoid anticipations, we leave out the details, but know that the good Kitao san has absolutely not lied about one thing: the presence of some optional bosses capable of putting anyone in a corner. Balance and runes - your weapon will not save you Elden Ring: Exploring often takes you to magical and deadly places One of the most interesting issues to discuss, in our opinion, is the balance of the game, given that as we anticipated in our last test there have been various changes to the nature of the upgradeable statistics, and various general interventions to skills and weapons. This is because, although what has been done in general is excellent, there are some choices that have convinced us less than others. Let's explain ourselves better: souls are titles where the development of st", "date": "2022-02-23", "grade": "9.4"}
