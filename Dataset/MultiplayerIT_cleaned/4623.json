Crowd not from the movies, of course, but from the amusement arcade or summer bar, gathered around those noisy bins that have experienced moments of glory and moments of darkness, to finish the race into oblivion, at least as mass entertainment, on par of the coin ops In some places, however, those large quadrupeds are still found, suspended in time and linked to a physical dimension that escapes the video game. Because between flaws, aches, inclinations and tricks each pinball machine is a unique story that even includes managers who are willing or not to forgive a few too many pushes. All of this has been part of the history of pinball for thirty years and is diluted in digital transposition, where the tables are the same for everyone and the unexpected, at least for now, is always expected. But since Pinball Dreams we have still played them for thousands of hours, consoled for the loss of physical dimension by the possibility of always having at hand a pinball machine with good physics, several tables, infinite games and, as in the case of Pinball FX, lots of animations and extras that are only possible thanks to the digital dimension. Same foundations, new possibilities Pinball FX3 is the sequel to what has been a point of reference for digital pinball lovers for seven years and further refines its formula by renovating part of the look and speeding up loading. All changes that can be touched for free on the Sorcerer's Lair table thanks to which it is possible to sink your teeth into all the new features: they include special challenges that include matches based on the use of a single ball, games with a pre-established duration of five minutes and a survival challenge. And with these rules as a basis the obvious main goal is to grind as many points as possible in order to unlock a total of forty-five stars for each table. There is also no shortage of local multiplayer, direct online challenges complete with rankings, tournaments and classifications, all magnified by being shared between all platforms and enhanced by new mechanics based on power-ups and skills that level up, significantly influencing the gameplay. Unfortunately, not everyone welcomed this addition, given the net influence of bonuses capable of slowing down time and multiplying the score, but the introduction of an evolutionary component is undoubtedly interesting. Among other things, we must consider that we are not obliged to activate the skills, but at the same time it is necessary to take into account the fact that these permeate the fabric of the game, multiplayer included, with all that follows. And they certainly don't represent content with a transcendental qualitative weight for a rather sparing title in terms of novelty, including the free table that was already present in Pinball FX2. Reproposed in Pinball FX3 it is nothing more than a functional demo to show us the new lighting effects and the various technical refinements that do not distort anything, but give us a better glance and more readable action. An action that rests on solid foundations even if the physics are not perfectly realistic, perhaps due to the need to bend the engine to sensitive variations in the gameplay, but it is coherent, undoubtedly credible and works great. The advantages of digital pinball Lightweight graphics engine and locked framerate allow for smooth play on a wide variety of setups, but in some cases the new tables seem to cause frame drops which in a game of this type can be destructive. On the other hand, the changes made to the interface do not affect the gameplay and it is good that it is so since the new menus are faster but less intuitive. The obstacle, however, is of little importance and once overcome it is a real pleasure to face new Universal tables which, between recognizable characters and dialogues mostly similar to the originals, are extremely enjoyable, even if forcing us to listen to not too faithful versions of the relative columns sound, thanks also to the iconic charge of films such as Jaws, E.T. The Extraterrestrial and Back to the Future. We are talking about three milestones, all protagonists of tables which, between plays of light, mechanics and complex animations, highlight how the digital dimension can give something to the world of pinball machines by placing us in front of small design masterpieces, like the Zen Originals tables and those of Star Wars, which combine the visual spectacle with refined game dynamics and capable of enhancing the skills of the most experienced players. The result is a refined and rich game, a new pa point of reference for the Pinball FX community which offers over 60 tables, almost all characterized by an interesting design work. But Zen Studios' game has a problem and that is that it is little more than an update which can even be cumbersome, given the introduction of skills. All of this, among other things, in front of prices ranging from the more than affordable 2.99 euros for the Portal pinball machine to decidedly less popular ones such as 10.99 for the Bethesda tables. But those who are interested in the news and own the previous chapter can count on a big incentive, such as to make the transition almost painless. In fact, Pinball FX3 allows you to use the Pinball FX2 tables for which Zen Studios has maintained the licenses, provided you have purchased them on the same platform. Furthermore, a few tables are enough to be able to count on dozens of hours of challenge and the spectacular artistic outline of what remains the point of reference for digital pinball machines. But this does not mean that we would have expected something more, if only from the point of view of unpublished contents and technical evolution.", "date": "2017-10-10", "grade": "7.5"}
