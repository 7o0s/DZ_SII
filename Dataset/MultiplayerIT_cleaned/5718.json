The Legend of Arslan, also published in comic book form in Italy, has however received two transpositions: the first, from 1991, we also saw here in VHS format, while the second began a few months ago in Japan but is already receiving wide acclaim; so much so that Koei Tecmo has seen fit to take advantage of it, dedicating a musou-style spin-off to the story of Prince Arslan, precisely Arslan: The Warriors of Legend. Arslan: The Warriors of Legend is a traditional musou, which does not introduce particular innovations I'll break your musou Following the story of the anime, the game tells the adventures of Arslan, a young prince of Pars, who finds himself having to flee after his kingdom has been invaded by Lusitania. His father, King Andragoras, was taken prisoner after the clash with the mysterious Silver Mask, a warrior whose scarred face is concealed by a silver mask, and so the heir to the throne, accompanied by the faithful and very strong Daryun, he will have to look for new allies to reconquer his land. Along the way he will meet many cunning fighters, whose trust he will earn and who will help him in his mission: the busty warrior priestess Farangis, the skilled strategist and artist Narsus, his servant Elam, the charismatic bass player Giv, the ~ savage~ Alfreed and others. Between betrayals, twists and large-scale battles, the Arslan: The Warriors of Legend campaign will follow these events by narrating them through long cutscenes that are perfectly in line with the anime, thanks to the use of cel shading. The problem, of course, is that those unfamiliar with the series may not tolerate the lengths of these sequences (spoken in Japanese and subtitled only in English), which can be skipped on condition, however, that you wait for rather long loading times for the subsequent missions . Back to the classic In form and substance, Arslan: The Warriors of Legend is a classic Musou, equipped with a fairly long single player campaign but without side modes, beyond the free mode, with which it is possible to grapple with the individual missions using any of the many characters available. Depending on how events develop, we will have to play the role of a different warrior and complete objectives which most often involve eliminating enemy commanders or reaching certain areas of the map, possibly breaking through walls or barriers thanks to maneuvers of group that can be activated in certain situations. The use of the horse, which can be recalled at any time by pressing a back button, fortunately allows you to cover the very long distances of the scenarios in a short time, but the combat in the saddle leaves much to be desired; with the only exception of Daryun, who manages to be devastating even in this situation, enclosing hordes of enemies in a sort of vortex and then making him deliver a very powerful kick from his steed. The combat system therefore gives its best when fighting on foot, recalling the classic repertoire of this kind of products, in this case combos that are created by alternating the Square and Triangle keys in various variations, with a view to an intrinsically repetitive and linear. There is some attempt at variation between weapon changes, bonus cards and special moves (each warrior has two), as well as the introduction of the aforementioned ~choral~ maneuvers, which recall the strategic mechanics of Bladestorm, but at the end of the counts there is nothing in this product that has not already been seen dozens and dozens of times in the titles developed by Omega Force. Not only lacks an adequate emphasis on impacts, the same that can be found in the ~opponent~ Sengoku Basara series, but even the duels that should be more demanding are resolved in the usual sequence of blows, first to destroy the ~barrier~ of the opponent and then to deal damage to him until his health bar runs out. It is useless even just to evaluate defense strategies: the artificial intelligence is of a low level, which means that simply moving to the side or raising our guard will make us safe from most enemy maneuvers. In the meantime, however, we will have to deal with poor camera management, often finding ourselves fighting blindly before restoring order using a backbone or the right analog stick. Playstation 4 trophies The forty-one Trophies of Arslan: The Warriors of Legend can be obtained by completing the campaignin single player of the game and the individual scenarios with the various characters, but to unlock the more mangy achievements it is necessary to get busy with the exploration of the levels, finding all the hidden objects in the boxes and eliminating a large number of enemies. Like a cartoon On the technical front, Arslan: The Warriors of Legend effectively uses cel shading to obtain a character design that is extremely faithful to what was seen in the new anime. The characterization of the prince and his many allies is therefore excellent, and also from the point of view of the animations we cannot complain, considering the amount of movements, attacks and specials available for each of the fighters. The limitation of the pop-up, almost imperceptible, is also good: the landing on the new generation platforms has been good for the franchise. The problem is naturally the contour, in the sense that the detail and interactivity of the scenarios are sacrificed on the altar of the quantity of opponents on the screen at the same time, for the record, many and with rare frame rate blunders. Of course we are talking about almost all the same soldiers, including commanders, who however move within locations as large as they are bare and desolate, decidedly ugly to see. The sound sector draws heavily from the anime, with very well interpreted Japanese dialogues, as usual, and a musical accompaniment that rises to the occasion.", "date": "2016-02-09", "grade": "6.0"}
