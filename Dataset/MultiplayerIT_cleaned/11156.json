{"name": "Wipeout HD - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wipeout-hd-recensione.html", "text": "The title of Studio Liverpool has suffered a significant amount of delays during the course of development, it should have been released about a year ago, but technical problems and the programmers' desire to perfect the product, initially envisaged as a simple high definition port, have postponed the release until last September 25th. In hindsight we can say that the result was certainly better than initial expectations, Wipeout HD in fact inherits 8 tracks (plus their ~mirror~ versions) from Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse for PSP but, thanks also to the high definition and perfect fluidity, the spacecraft are driven like never before, the graphics sector has a very close-up impact and there is an online mode with all the trappings of the case, albeit poor in options. The initial menu (too bad the usual high-class intro is missing) reflects, barring some flaws, the excellent style and accessibility that characterizes the saga, with the Campaign and Racebox modes as the background above all to the single player section. The first offers 8 grids made up of a predetermined number of races, which can be unlocked by obtaining the points returned for each victory (blessed by the classic gold medal) or placement in the top three positions. The second instead allows you to create your own customized event among those available (Time Trial, Fast Lap, Race, Tournament and Zone, all already seen in the previous chapters) also acting on various parameters such as the number of laps, the level of difficulty of artificial intelligence up to the use or not of weapons. Once you get on the track, you immediately notice that the driving model is very similar, if not identical, to that of the last chapters on PSP. With the X you accelerate, with the lower back buttons you activate the side brakes, with a double pressure on one of them you use the so-called sideshift (instantaneous lateral movement useful for settling in curves at the last second) while the barrel roll is not missing , the famous spin in the air that can be performed by pressing the left-right-left or right-left-right keys and which allows the landing of the spacecraft to use a further thrust in acceleration. All according to the script then, but with three new benefits, the first which comes thanks to the 60 frames per second, granite and unassailable, which move the game and which return a control system that has never been so immediate, where each spacecraft is linked in symbiosis to the pressure of the pad keys, where everything appears ~soft~ and where you have complete control, certainly not easy to master, of every crazy evolution necessary to face the curves in the best possible way. The second benefit derives from the multiplayer mode, which we will discuss later, and finally from the level of challenge, decidedly high and which could even discourage someone. Wipeout HD is in fact a title where the learning curve is rather long and gradual, where you have to repeat the same track several times, almost ad nauseam, to trim the tenths and hundredths and to be competitive, and the beauty that this practice hardly gets tired , also thanks to the aforementioned driving model and the good design of the tracks, which in fact position this series in a genre of its own and particularly loved by those looking for an excellent level of competition and a driving game that is never taken for granted. The search for gold or victory in some races can sometimes become an object of frustration or almost, but it is one hundred percent sure that with practice your times are destined to go down, more or less quickly. The twelve spacecraft (12 in all, some not immediately available) then adapt perfectly to the different driving styles, personally we preferred the Assegai for the first raids, and then move on to the Icarus once unlocked. Technical and online But Wipeout HD is not only a pleasure to play, but also to watch, thanks to the support for 1080p resolution and the aforementioned granite fluidity, passing through the good graphic effects of the weapons in race mode and ending with the excellent graphic reinterpretation of all the tracks present, in particular Ubermall and Sol 2, which also shine in terms of track design. On the other hand, we didn't like the game hud, i.e. the information displayed on the screen during the race, which is too confusing and difficult to consult while driving; continuing in campaign mode it is possible to unlock a couple from the previous chapters, certainly more readable than the original one. The sound sector remains one of the strengths of the saga, but rather than for the original songs, with a few memorable pieces to remember, above all for the possibility of importing theown music playlist on the PlayStation 3 hard drive, creating the soundtrack that best suits you. A gem in this sense is the presence of echo, reverb and distortion effects that are applied indiscriminately to any musical track on the occasion of jumps, passages in indoor sections and so on, synonymous with the care that Studio Liverpool places in this sense . Therefore, more than the purely technical aspect, what is striking is the overall impact once you are on the track, the design, the choice of colors (especially in the zone mode), the effects and the audio contribute in unison to create a perfect and ~psychedelic~ experience at every juncture. Technical and online After the first experiment with Wipeout Pulse, multiplayer finds its complete consecration in HD, starting with the presence of a split screen mode for two players, both vertically and horizontally, to get to the online one, a real test bench to put show off how hard you sweat in single player competitions. The support is complete, there is voice chat, the ability to create private matches which can only be accessed by people on your friends list, there is a ranking system that embraces single lap times and race times and the possibility to create a game according to the parameters already mentioned for the Racebox, but only in a competition against other opponents or in a tournament. Precisely in this sense, the online modes in our view are a bit few, because the type of game would have lent itself easily to others such as elimination or teams. Partially heartening was the announcement by Studio Liverpool of future updates, which will introduce new features and perhaps runways and spacecraft. Finally, as regards the lag, the work done by the developers seemed excellent to us, during our games we practically never encountered any delays of any kind, if it weren't for the voice chat that is not always equally impeccable in its functioning. Finally, we confirm the game's support for the vibration of the Dual Shock 3 pad and that for Trophies, some easy to obtain, others completely crazy. Comment Wipeout HD is a little jewel, which benefits greatly from high resolution and above all from excellent fluidity, which allows you to concentrate solely on an immediate and tested control system. The graphic impact and the possibility of importing your own soundtrack are also excellent, the contraindications are represented by the fact that the tracks and spacecrafts come from the previous chapters (albeit ~pumped~ graphically) and from an online mode that could have been more substantial. That said, and also in light of the more than competitive price, Wipeout HD represents a must-buy for all PlayStation 3 owners, not recommended only for those who don't digest the saga or a challenge that requires a lot of dedication, which is well rewarded in any case. Pros Perfect control system Great visual impact Highly challenging and rewarding Cons Difficulty may put off newbies Few substantial new features, both online and offline", "date": "2008-10-01", "grade": null}
