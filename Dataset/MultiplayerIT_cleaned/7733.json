{"name": "Bakery Simulator", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bakery-simulator-recensione.html", "text": "That of ~job simulators~ is a video game genre in the eyes of many strange. For a certain segment of the public, video games are above all a way to disconnect from everyday life and the idea of playing a video game that simulates a real job seems the exact opposite of what one is looking for. The truth is that a job simulator allows you to carry out a real activity, which intrigues and excites you, without actually having to work, without physical fatigue and without the heaviness of your wallet depending on it. The same is for Bakery Simulator. Cooking 12 croissants, 20 donuts and about thirty sandwiches seems interesting (and who didn't try during the quarantines?), but actually doing it requires much more effort and many more tools than one might think. We are therefore certain that for many, the idea of digitally kneading and baking seems interesting, as well as cultivating wheat fields in Farming Simulator. What matters, however, is that the simulator is always and in any case a video game and knows how to offer activities and processes that imitate reality, but are always fun. Let's find out if this is the case in our Bakery Simulator review. Before the sun comes up The first bakery in Bakery Simulator Bakery Simulator has a very clear structure. Every day we have to choose one of the recipes available on the order board and, within a time limit, we have to prepare what is requested. With a container, the necessary ingredients are collected, indicated on the right of the screen, using the various measuring cups at our disposal. Do we have to insert 77 grams of butter? Using the mouse wheel to change the size, we first take 50, then 20, then 5 and then 1g of butter twice to arrive at the required figure. Once you have everything, you move on to the mixer, which does the job in a few seconds and automatically. The third step is to shape our loaf or cake, a practice that will vary throughout the game. In the early stages, you will mainly have to complete very trivial mini-games to divide the dough into portions and give them a shape. This involves pressing a key when an indicator is in the green part of the bar, rotating an outer circle to match shapes with the inner circle, or simulating the movement of a rolling pin with the mouse. We are talking about activities that become repetitive within half an hour and above all are a bit imprecise and uncomfortable when you have to use the mouse. In other cases, the process is even simpler, because you just have to pour the dough into the molds (without a minigame, just a click of the mouse) or turn the donuts in the fryer. One of the first Bakery Simulator minigames All these processes are also slowly being eliminated as we unlock machines that automatically portion, shape and turn donuts. The progression of Bakery Simulator is based on making the process as automatic as possible, decreasing the number of player interactions and efforts. In practice, the more you advance, the less you have to do. Even the collection of ingredients becomes partially automatic: we will unlock silos and, once upgraded, they will insert the exact weight of the ingredients we need. Once all this is done, it is cooked in the oven for the indicated time. But that's not all, because you also need to deliver the order to the shop, which is located somewhere in the city. In the dark of night, you have to drive through the streets and get to your destination. The whole process, as mentioned, must be completed without accumulating delays. Even in this case, however, the possibility of completing deliveries automatically is soon unlocked, to avoid the pain of going out into the city and driving: it is an extremely tedious task (it is certainly not a driving game) and the he urban area is visually terrible, with entire areas loading in front of us and a PS2 end-of-generation level of detail. With each delivery there are roadblocks that force us to change direction, looking at a map as a reference, but certainly not enough to make the process varied. There are driving stages in Bakery Simulator Once the work is finished, you are paid and experience points are obtained, depending on the quality of the product, which is a consequence of our precision. Did we put in the wrong amount of ingredients? Have we left the bread in the oven for too long? Are we late? If yes, the final value decreases. In reality, the game is not particularly punishing and even getting a very low score you earn enough to repay the cost of the ingredients and not lose money. Gameplay and problems A bigger bakery than Bakery SimulatorThe goal, of course, is to raise enough money to be able to buy new machinery, upgrade those available and above all buy a larger premises, so as to have access to more effective work tools. Before you can buy, however, you must level up with the aforementioned experience points, so the progression is completely linear. For example, it is also possible to request a loan with loan shark interest, but every job is so lucrative that in the worst case it is enough to play a quarter of an hour more to be able to buy the new work machine that has just been unlocked. In advanced stages, it is also possible to accumulate more orders together to earn more in less time. However, complicating life is not necessary at all: a single order is enough to earn important figures and, above all, there is no hurry. The game doesn't really count the days, and if for some reason we're stuck in the middle of a recipe, we can simply skip the day, with no penalty if we haven't wasted a few ingredients. In the space of seven hours or so, we will have unlocked the largest pastry shop, we will have access to all the shops, almost all fully upgraded (after a certain number of deliveries you get bonuses that simplify the game even more) and we will have all machinery. Let's also assume that by playing a more aggressive world, racking up more orders at once as soon as possible, you can reach the ~end~ even faster. In any case, Bakery Simulation offers little content that gets repetitive very quickly. In the final stages, we will only have to spend tons of money to buy alternative versions of the tables and walls of our pastry shop, to give it the style we like best: however, this is only a way to milk a few additional hours from the experience, without that the core of the game changes. Initially all ingredients are harvested by hand in Bakery Simulator The gameplay loop of Bakery Simulatior lasts a maximum of 7-8 minutes and then it starts again, doing the same task more or less. Even those who are deeply passionate about job simulators and pastry shops will not be able to enjoy themselves for much more than a handful of hours. We report in closing that the game does not lack some problems. In addition to some bugs and crashes, which we hope will be fixed with patches, we have noticed various flaws in the texts. In some cases, the recipes are missing some fundamental terms (for example the shape to be given to the bread) while in others there are objects that are called in one way in the recipe book but in another in the game environment, confusing the player. These problems exist in both English and Italian, so it's not a translation error. Also, some visual and sound effects are limited or wrong. For example, butter makes the same noise as seeds when we add it to the bowl. Nothing limiting in terms of gameplay, but overall it is not a game with attention to the last detail.", "date": "2022-05-02", "grade": "5.5"}
