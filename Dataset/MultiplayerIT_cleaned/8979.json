Many arrows in the arc of the Konami product: an excellent virtual stick, which moreover recalibrates itself every time we place our left thumb on the screen and therefore allows us to control the players precisely, without problems relating to the position of the touch; good ball physics, able to restore the right sense of impact during shots and passes; a good offer in terms of modalities and management of the team during each match. The solutions found to enclose the various actions in just two virtual buttons are also excellent, with the A button for shooting and sliding, and the B button for making low shots, crosses (holding it down) and through balls (pressing it and ~dragging~ it) in the desired direction); solutions supported, moreover, by two alternative configurations (via accelerometer or with a single ~intelligent~ button for all actions) less valid over long distances but still usable without problems. In short, the basic structure has been done well and in such a situation what is asked of the developers is simply a work of optimization and enrichment, which was precisely what was done for Pro Evolution Soccer 2012. Compared to the edition of the last year, in fact, the game not only adopts the freemium format (it can be downloaded for free from the App Store and allows you to play a game using two available teams, but to unlock all the contents you have to pay the canonical 4.99 euros through a in-game purchase) but above all it adds a series of very interesting features: the Super Challenge mode (which is none other than the Master League), the Challenges (~virtual~ comparisons between our SC team and that of a friend), the possibility of playing in the European Super Cup once the Champions League and Europa League have been completed, and finally the commentary in Italian with the voices of Pierluigi Pardo and Luca Marchegiani. All football minute by minute Once the teams are lined up on the field (by the way: several teams, especially foreign ones, do not yet enjoy the official license, unfortunately, and therefore are present with fictitious names), the gameplay immediately appears slower and ~reflexive~ compared to PES 2011, and there is also a lower responsiveness of the players to the inputs. However, a few games are enough to get used to it and appreciate the game system, again this year able to find the right compromise between practicality and challenge. You can put a patch on the limits of the AI by raising the difficulty level to the maximum, for example, while the simplistic approach to tackles remains: just hold down the B button and our player will steal the ball from the carrier in a few seconds, some rare cases, which in fact reduces the thickness of the defensive phase quite a bit. Instead, applause goes to the aggressiveness of certain opponents who, after losing the ball, chase us and often commit fouls; perhaps in the penalty area, allowing us to appreciate the more than valid Flick Kick-style shooting system, or with the trajectory of the shot that must be drawn with a finger, hoping that the penalty taker is skilled enough to execute our instructions effectively. In terms of playability, it can be said that Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 hasn't changed that much and therefore its dynamics will be familiar to anyone who has tried the previous episode. From this point of view, it is a pity that the excellent team management menu does not also allow for the customization of the formation by simply dragging the positions on the screen. From a content point of view, however, there is no doubt about Konami's commitment to making the title more dense and long-lived. In this sense, the Super Challenge represents an addition of great value, in which we can find the dear old Stromer, Iouga, Ordaz and so on, historical protagonists of the Master League who make their debut on the iOS platform with the usual determination and awareness that they will replaced by more skilled players as soon as the budget allows. On the other hand, the repeated lack of online multiplayer is serious, replaced once again by the local one (via bluetooth or Wi-Fi), while the technical sector unfortunately remains below expectations, so much so that the comparison with the animations and details of FIFA 12 appears merciless. The addition of the commentary instead represents a small step towards interesting perspectives, even if at the moment the inserted sentences are few and oftenpoorly matched with the on-screen action.
