{"name": "The Legend of Spyro: L'Alba del Drago - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-spyro-lalba-del-drago-recensione.html", "text": "If something works today, it doesn't necessarily work tomorrow: video game enthusiasts know it well, after having witnessed the disappearance over the years of a large number of characters and franchises that seemed destined to make it big. Situations change, development teams take turns and you have to deal with increasingly competitive scenarios. If a few years ago a valid idea was enough to build a successful product around it, today things are no longer like this: every aspect must be taken care of down to the smallest detail, from the purely technical to the game design, because the competition is fiercer than ever and there is no room for mediocrity. In the specific case of Spyro, we are dealing with a character who was enormously successful on PSone, offering players a truly three-dimensional platform with ample freedom of movement. It wasn't a ~fluke~, however, just think that Insomniac, the team responsible for the first three episodes of the series, currently develops high quality titles for PlayStation 3 (Resistance, Resistance 2, the various Ratchet & Clank... ). To relaunch the purple dragon with The Legend of Spyro trilogy, Krome Studios were first commissioned (for A New Beginning and The Eternal Night), then the French developers of Etranges Libellules (already responsible for the excellent Asterix & Obelix XXL, as well as the discreet Arthur and the Invisibles tie-in). In one way or another, in short, the circle will be closed pending a possible further renewal, which unfortunately at the moment seems extremely necessary... The dynamic duo At the end of The Eternal Night, Spyro and Cinerea had sacrificed themselves to save the kingdom of dragons, ending up trapped in a wall of ice. Three years later they are awakened by a group of evil creatures, who chain them to each other using magical collars in order to exploit their powers. Fortunately, a mysterious warrior suddenly arrives to help them, frees them from captivity and leads them on a new adventure, which once again will see the two dragons face ancient and dark forces. This is the incipit of The Dawn of the Dragon, which welcomes players with a series of novelties compared to the previous two episodes of The Legend of Spyro trilogy: this time we will find ourselves having to manage Spyro and Cinerea at the same time, since the two characters they are bound by a magical bond through collars, and it will be possible to switch from one dragon to another at any time, simply by pressing the ~+~ button on the Wii-Mote. The developers have also made a precise choice regarding the powers, which in the past had to be ~awakened~ and which are now available immediately: by pressing the Z button on the Nunchuck, we will be able to resort to the force of eight different elements to get the better of the opponents. The upgrade system remains identical, which uses the crystal fragments collected as ~money~ to improve special abilities, while the possibility of dressing dragons with various pieces of armor to be collected within the stages has been introduced: this equipment ( visible during the action) will have the aim of improving their defensive capacity. The best and the worst As mentioned, in this episode Spyro and Cinerea must act in sync to be able to move but also to fight. In multiplayer mode for two players, this happens very naturally, despite the lack of a split screen severely limits movement: you always have to stay close, after all, the magic chain is there for that. In the single-player game, however, the second character is controlled by the AI with fluctuating results: during the fights things will go fairly well, while in some movement sequences we will necessarily have to alternate in command of the two dragons. There are some interesting maneuvers that can be carried out using the situation, such as paired combos or ~jumps~ using the momentum of the chain while a character is hanging from a wall. In some cases it will be essential to find the right way to proceed, and in this regard one of the first phases is emblematic, in which we will have to climb a large number of obstacles trying not to get pulled down by the clumsy companion... The fact of having all the peculiar abilities of Spyro and Cinerea from the beginning, unfortunately, does not present itself as a substantial advantage: introducing the powers one at a time has always been part of the gameplay of the series, and it is an element that was used to resolve situations gradually complex. Despite already having the ability to fly, however, the two dragons still have to climb walls or cannot reach certain heights, which is at least illogical and shows the sOlita ~fair of invisible barriers~ so feared by those who trusted in the advent of new generation video games. Finally, the combat system leaks from all sides: the collisions are ~slippery~ and it's all really too confusing. The controls, in this sense, certainly do not help: the most powerful attacks have been entrusted to the shaking of the Wii-mote, but the response to the inputs is far from rapid and precise. Technical realization In terms of ~presentation~, L'Alba del Drago stands as a really well done product: the story is engaging and is told through an excellent dubbing in Italian, but there are some technical problems that end up ruining the good work done in localization phase: the voices are often metallic, while the music is excellent but almost always drowns out the sound effects (fortunately it is possible to adjust the levels from the options screen). As for the graphics, the developers have abused the usual ~glow~ effect to mask the playlists and defects, and the results are not very exciting. The characters are well done, while the level design appears mediocre, with locations that are anything but inspired but above all with an unexciting use of colors. Managing the view, which can be controlled via the Wii-remote's d-pad, is problematic but not impossible, while the controls rely too much on the shaking of the controllers, which in turn do not respond to inputs as quickly and accurately necessary. Comment The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon appropriately closes a trilogy that unfortunately hasn't done much to revive the character of Spyro. In the previous episodes there were big problems concerning the balance of difficulty, but you could count on an effective combat system; while now the clashes are really confusing and ~slippery~, without any feeling of ~impact~, with the situation being further aggravated by controls that are anything but precise. The idea of the two characters linked to each other is interesting, but it has been exploited very badly: overcoming some areas can really turn into a nightmare for an experienced gamer, let alone for the youngest (to whom this product should theoretically be intended). There was also a step backwards from a technical point of view, with uninspired enemies and stages full of hateful invisible obstacles. Given the ancient splendor, Spyro deserved much better: let's hope that this trilogy does not determine the end of the character, but provides those responsible with the cues necessary to understand how and in which direction to move for a near, possible return. Pros Fascinating story, atmospheric music Discreet puzzle solving Excellent dubbing in Italian Against Confusing combat system Mediocre controls Technically far from spectacular", "date": "2008-12-21", "grade": null}
