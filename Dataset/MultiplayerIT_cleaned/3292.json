The same, identical title based on beautiful giant anthropomorphic robots (mecha, in fact) which obtained a very positive reception on Kickstarter in 2016. It's always nice to come back to tell you about independent projects that, once funded by the players themselves, come to a happy ending. Why yes, despite some obvious development delays from the small team at RocketPunch Games, Hardcore Mecha has pulled it off. It will not be a masterpiece of its kind, but as you are about to read it has noteworthy qualities that we would expect to find in every videogame production, as well as all the credentials to make happy those who at the time got excited, among others, with BattleMech, Robot Wars and Metal Slug. The plot: almost like an anime A large part of Hardcore Mecha's offer lies in its single player mode: the game plot, organized into chapters and individual levels, predictably puts giant robots at the center of the scene, but without sparing a few surprises. It is a production which, as stated by the developers themselves since the first presentation of the title, winks at a whole series of Japanese productions of the last century: Grendizer, Mazinga, Mobile Suit Gundam, Voltron, and it doesn't really seem the case to waste half a day listing them all. Don't expect the depth of some of these titles, which have marked the history of the genre in animated drawings: however, it is clear how Hardcore Mecha immediately presents itself as an anime, whose main purpose is to tell an interesting story, accompanied by blows between mecha. The story of the single player mode takes place in a sci-fi future in which the Earth has some colonies in space, and has also largely taken control of Mars: following a whole series of disagreements between one faction and another, However, the war between rebels and Earth's central government is still going on. The player will control the protagonist Tarethur and the team of good guys, whose goal is to recover an infiltrator in possession of invaluable information: knowledge and data that could challenge the balance of power and favor an army of ruthless mercenaries. There are some characters who are better than the others, but in general the characters of all those present are stereotyped and the few female figures present are more often inclined to fanservice. On the good we note at least two aspects, and certainly not secondary ones: the longevity of the plot - for a total of 18 levels divided into about 8 chapters - and the game's ability to make fun of its own stereotypes. Quite often Tarethur, for example, reminds his best friend that he speaks like an anime character. Let's write them down here, because we'd have to do it somewhere else otherwise: the game texts are all in sufficiently understandable English, while the audio can be set to Japanese. Not even the shadow of Italian. The gameplay: a bit platformer, a bit brawler It is not easy to attribute a precise label to Hardcore Mecha, and perhaps in the case of independent titles this is only a good thing: if they are not experimenting, who should? The production (and with it the gameplay) in any case is strongly based on the mechanics of two very specific genres: the platform and the brawler. Hardcore Mecha is therefore placed between two different areas, that of exploration with platforms for its own sake and that of scrolling action that is satisfied with beating all the enemies very hard along the way. His two souls are well balanced, but the brawler one almost always has the upper hand. In Hardcore Mecha it is a pleasure to start from point A of the level and get to B by eliminating everything that moves along the way, using all the wide and varied arsenal of your combat robot. The attention to its details is almost maniacal, even from an aesthetic point of view: thrusters that consume stamina to make shots in mid-air, combinations on combinations, two firearms and two commands for close combat. This explains the detailed menu for the tutorial clearly highlighted among the main game options: we advise you to take a look at it right away, if what the developers explained in the first few minutes of the game is not enough for you. Commanding the mecha is the funniest aspect of the title, and at the same time also the one that would have needed some more refinement: very often the pointing system with light indicator turns out to be inaccurate, and the responsiveness of the various commands is not exactly excellent; nothing that could really compromise the gaming experience, but a little more care in the fluidity of the movements would have helped, especially in situations with many enemies on the screen. The game overs, among other things, are quite frustrating: the level is restarted from the last checkpoint, but the learning curve, even in normal mode, is considerable, and often a carelessness is enough to explode into a thousand pieces. The ability to skip cutscenes before boss fights, from this point of view, needs to be implemented as soon as possible. Playstation 4 trophies Hardcore Mecha has a glittering Platinum Trophy, but taking it home won't be easy at all. Once you've unlocked all the power-ups, completed the narrative and completed the side missions you will have to do it all again... getting the S-rank in every single level. Even complete the game without ever losing a single life. Good luck. Customization and technical sector Hardcore Mecha also shows, as far as possible, a certain propensity for experimentation: in some levels, for example, instead of immediately using the mecha to beat our hands we found ourselves grappling with stealth sessions in enemy bases, impersonating a Tarethur equipped with barely of a knife. The title rewards those who respect its conditions: by completing the chapter without being discovered and killing enemies, more credits are provided as a final reward, alongside a higher overall grade. The credits are used to enhance the personal mecha and to unlock all the possibilities related to the customization of the title. From the main menu, in fact, you will discover that you can buy new weapons for the robot, boosters that are always active in your slot, and, at a certain point, even real unpublished mobile suits. Usually all these objects, as well as the very powerful Ultimate moves, are also linked to the player's level: in short, you can only unlock them at a certain point in the main story, and this serves to make the overall balance of the title acceptable. The technical sector, the graphics and the sound are excellent: the musical accompaniments are almost always spot on and engaging, especially in the boss fights; the models of the various characters present, of the mechas and of the backdrops of the levels are all in excellent quality. The indie nature of Hardcore Mecha is evident in many small details, such as the limited number of elements on the screen and some small snags here and there, but the care for a product that comes mainly from a real respect for the starting theme. We also wanted to try the online multiplayer mode, which allows you to challenge random opponents from all over the world (or your friends) in 1 vs 1 battles with robots... but we couldn't find anyone, and after an hour of waiting for it to load eternal has tired us too.", "date": "2020-01-21", "grade": "7.5"}
