League of Legends is one of the most played video games in the world and behind its champions there are many stories that are worth telling and exploring. Riot Games has achieved this goal first with Arcane, the TV series created in collaboration with Netflix, and then with Ruined King, another ~League of Legends Story~ that delved into the pirate world of Bilgewater. The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story will take fans and non-fans alike to the realm of Demacia where Sylas of Dregbourne (one of the MOBA champions) managed to free himself after a long imprisonment and now wants to take revenge on the city and the oppressors who locked him up for 15 years. In this review of The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, we will tell you how Riot Forge (the Riot Games label that deals with video games set in the League of Legends universe) and Digital Sun managed to pack an adventure fun to play and approachable even by those who have never familiarized themselves with the gameplay or LoL narrative. Break the chains Being set in Demacia, Mageseeker could not miss the omnipresent Garen to put a spoke in Sylas' works Sylas of Dregbourne was destined to become a Mageseeker, a seeker of wizards, a kind of guild whose members in the realm of Demacia are considered dangerous and uncontrollable individuals. When he was just a boy in training, during a mission he too discovered that he possessed magic: he can use it, but only by stealing it from other wizards. A formidable discovery, but one that he made during an accident in which several people died. For 15 years he remained in prison, trapped in chains of petricite, a material capable of suppressing magic, but also of channeling it. The events of Mageseeker begin on the day of Sylas' execution when, on the gallows, he betrays his only friend, Luxanna Crownguard (Lux), stealing her magic to break the chains and turn them into weapons with which to seek vengeance. From here begins an adventure that will see Sylas fight against the Mageseekers, jungle creatures, mysterious entities and failed laboratory experiments trying to unleash his destructive impulse and together create a better society for Demacia. After a few minutes of playing, you will meet Leilani, a sorceress who leads a band of rebels who want to transform the kingdom that once hunted them into a place where everyone is welcome and no one is persecuted. During your adventures you will be able to recruit followers for this cause to try to build an army and overthrow the royal family once and for all. The people believe that it was Sylas who killed the king of Demacia: while you carry on your rebellion and try to prove you are not guilty, you will witness the palace intrigues that revolve around the succession and which will inevitably end up involving you. Intuitive and fluid combat In Mageseeker the enemies are many, different from each other and require unique powers or strategies to be killed The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story is first and foremost a pixel art action RPG whose combat mechanics are inspired by Sylas's ultimate in Riot Games' MOBA. On LoL, in fact, by pressing R, the champion steals an opponent's most powerful move and can use it freely. In Mageseeker, Sylas can steal the elemental magic of all his opponents (whether they be humans or jungle creatures) and use it at will by infusing it into his chains. What once held him prisoner is now his main weapon both in terms of physical attacks, unlimited and essential to recover mana, and for magical ones. These work in two ways: first they must be stolen from an enemy, then they can be unlocked at Leilani's camp and become stable powers. The result of this design is a fast-paced and fluid gameplay that is very easy to learn and very satisfying. There are six types of magic divided into three groups of two elements each. The members of each group are opposites of each other and super effective against each other. Stealing an ice spell and using it against a fire foe, for example, will almost eliminate them in one fell swoop. This system will force you to carefully evaluate which enemies to kill and which to keep alive during a fight, especially if you have not yet unlocked their skills as permanent upgrades. Sylas, then, hasstats, such as physical attack, magic attack or resistance, which can be upgraded at the camp using resources, the in-game currency that you will earn by completing main and side missions. Without allies you cannot win the war The progression of Mageseeker also passes through the management of the allies you will recruit during the adventure Besides combat, the other major pillar of Mageseeker is ally management. During your missions you will meet characters with a name and a personality that you can recruit to join your team. Each of them will give Sylas access to a very strong combo and damage boost of an element such as fire or wind. You will be able to bring two allies with you on each adventure and send those who would have remained on the bench in side missions that auto-complete according to a system of probabilities. Each of these actions will allow you to recruit other characters (nameless and without skills) who will swell the ranks of your army. Furthermore, each main ally has a sort of reward track: the more unnamed allies you recruit together with him in main or automatic missions, the greater the benefits he will give you. You will be able to unlock new attacks, combos or improved spells by playing in the company of mages who embody the element that best suits your style of play. Even the camp changes and evolves based on the number of allies you will be able to recruit: the bigger it becomes, the more you will have access to upgrades and improvements. Everything in Mageseeker is as much about empowering Sylas, his physical attacks and magic, as it is about building an army of wizards to turn Demacia into a nation you no longer persecute that is capable of using magic. The story, combat and minimal exploration of the linear levels of this game are well intertwined and we never felt like we were wasting our time or running into filler. All side missions can be easily jumped and it is not even necessary to have unlocked all the upgrades to not struggle in the final stages. The difficulty level is easily adjusted (with parameters dedicated to Sylas' damage multiplier and stamina) and the boss battles are varied and will test your mastery of the combat and movement system.", "date": "2023-04-27", "grade": "8.0"}
