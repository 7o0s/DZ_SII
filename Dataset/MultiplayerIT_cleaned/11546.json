{"name": "Art of Murder: La Crudele Arte dell'Omicidio - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/art-of-murder-la-crudele-arte-dellomicidio-recensione.html", "text": "Art of Murder is a classic-style graphic adventure that winks at the atmospheres of CSI and which, as far as gameplay is concerned, remains anchored to the stylistic features of the genre, focusing everything on the narrative side rather than on any innovations. The end result is a good product that will convince fans of the genre and that, perhaps, could also convert some ~infidels~ who cannot live without shootings. In the role of Nicole Bonnet, a brilliant FBI agent, we are called to find out who is guilty of a mysterious series of murders that appear to have a ritual nature. A colleague of Nicole, James Scott, was killed while on the trail of the killer, and so now it's up to her to inherit and understand who is behind these mysteries. There will be more victims on his way, but in the end, good will triumph (trumpets, please)! The game starts without cutscenes and preambles, a quick chat with Nicole's boss and you are immediately catapulted into the adventure. Those who grew up on bread and graphic adventures will take the blink of an eye to understand how the interface is structured and how objects are collected and used: in fact, there is the classic dynamic pointer that changes shape when you pass over a hot spot depending on the actions performed. All interactions are entrusted to the left mouse button, while with the right you can examine the different objects. Smart choices Even the PDA, accessible by clicking on an icon at the bottom right, is not a big news. Inside there are a notepad, a telephone book, a mobile phone, a camera and an archive. Not all options are available right away. The inventory is always clearly visible in the lower part of the screen (as you can also verify by taking a look at the screenshots distributed for the article) and, as a genre, in addition to using the objects with the elements of the scenography, it is also possible to combine them each other if necessary. The most interesting option in the interface is the magnifying glass that allows you to view all the hot spots on one screen. This avoids, especially where there are small and difficult to identify objects, the infamous pixel hunting which forces you to sift through the scenarios pixel by pixel (hence the name) in search of interactable points. In a certain sense it is such a simple and effective stratagem that we are amazed at how rarely it has been implemented (the first graphic adventure to have a system similar to this was Simon the Sorcerer 2, as far as we can remember, but we accept corrections). In this way one of the major frustrations of the model adventurer is avoided, i.e. thinking, in moments of stalemate, that he has not discovered everything that can be discovered and, therefore, that he has to start looking in the most remote ravines, going over the scenarios inch by inch. already explored. Exoticisms But what would a functional and well-made interface be without an exciting accompanying game? Nothing. From this point of view Art of Murder is well done, even if some imperfections should be noted, especially at the beginning. The truth is that the first part of the game is quite soporific and, especially the sections in the office, are forgettable. The first puzzles require you to make photocopies, chat with the secretary, talk to the grumpy head of the department, make phone calls, and perform other such actions. Even the first visit to the museum, one of the key locations in the plot, does not resolve the situation and one soon begins to fear that the rest of the game is all on the same level. Fortunately this is not the case and, when you go deeper into the investigations and start using the FBI tools, the situation is resolved and the game becomes quite interesting, offering a series of good level puzzles and twists. Especially the final part of the game is a crescendo of surprises and inspired moments. Nothing transcendental, but the terror due to the sections in the office disappears and, especially after arriving in a very different city from New York (we don't tell you the name so as not to spoil the plot), the good intuitions follow one another. The secondary characters are not very many and are not even very characterized. The screenwriters have abused the narrative stereotypes of the genre a little too much, creating types that are recognizable as telephoned: the beautiful, intelligent and brilliant protagonist, the surly boss, the kind and workaholic secretary and so on. In summary, you never meet characters of depth like, I don't know, a Hans Voralberg or a Zo Castillo. Who killed fluency? Comment Art of Murder is a good graphic adventure with some production limitations and with delland unexpressed potential that place it in the average of the genre without allowing it to stand out from the competition. No innovations but some excellent intuitions make it a valid choice for those who love the genre and for those who want to try something different.
