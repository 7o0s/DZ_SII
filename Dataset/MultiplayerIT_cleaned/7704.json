A crazy hype has been generated around the title developed by Millennium Kitchen, mainly for two reasons: first, the development was led by Kaz Ayabe, best known for directing Boku no Natsuyasumi, a sort of life simulator for PlayStation that is very popular in Japan; second, there are kaiju, and Japanese monsters are going strong these days thanks to Guillermo Del Toro's blockbuster film Pacific Rim. Then there's also the nerdy joker motif: Attack of the Friday Monsters! is presented as a life simulator set in the Japanese 70s. But is it really? The Goonies according to Kaz Ayabe No, it's not at all, and who knew that the fifteen hundred blocks of Attack of the Friday Monsters! hide a miniature Shenmue will be deeply disappointed. The ~game~ is instead a kind of visual novel, even more than a jRPG, in which the player takes on the role of little Sohta, who has recently moved to the village of Fuji no Hana. Sohta's difficulties in making friends and adapting to her new life can be seen between the lines of the many conversations that it is possible to have with the locals, interacting with them on every screen where it is possible. It is the dialogues, above all, that characterize the characters and lead the story, which unfolds through a series of non-linear missions that are activated, carried out and concluded almost by chance, interacting with the inhabitants, talking to them and winning games to cards on which we will dwell shortly. Sohta's very normal life revolves around two main themes that seem to intertwine, and not even too cryptic: one is the relationship between her parents, an unsatisfied mother and a perhaps too modest father; the other are the first television serials with monsters and superheroes that belong to the ~tokosatsu~ genre (remember the Power Rangers and Kamen Raider?) and that passionately follow both Sohta and his friends and schoolmates. In addition, there is the mystery of a stranger, an alleged alien invasion and these ~kaiju~ who only attack the city on Fridays. A bizarre plot, in short, which may even appear a bit childish and simpleton, but which in reality hides a not too sibylline allegory which will tug at the heartstrings of all those players - like the writer - who have experienced at least part of the Sohta experiences. A bit autobiographical, probably, and a bit fairy tale ~ la Studio Ghibli~, the story of Attack of the Friday Monsters! it is actually the heart of the game, where the card game almost seems like a simple sop. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect of Attack of the Friday Monsters! is not very convincing, which was probably designed and developed to take into account the main feature of Nintendo 3DS: the perceived depth is marginal and does not affect the gameplay in the slightest. We're all a bit Yu-gi-oh The progression doesn't flow without obstacles, because sometimes it's not enough to explore every area and talk to every character to complete a mission or advance the story. Sometimes - often - it is necessary to win a challenge to the trendiest card game of the moment, based on the TV series for which everyone goes crazy in Fuji no Hana. The player, in the role of Sohta, can assemble his deck by collecting the luminous crystals scattered everywhere: seven of the same type generate a card, and there is also a minimum of strategy in assembling your deck which is however betrayed by the ease of matches. The mechanics of the card game are very simple, evidently designed for the little ones, and are all based on a system of scissors, paper and stone and on the juxtaposition of numerical values which identify the ~power~ of the cards deployed in battle. It takes a very few minutes to get used to the ~combat~ system, which after a while also manages to become quite repetitive, depending on how much the player has become engrossed in the story: one gets the clear feeling that, in those three about hours needed to complete the game, the cards could also be done without. From a purely technical point of view, the work done by Millennium Kitchen is more than appreciable, given the cost of the software: the scenarios are completely two-dimensional, very colorful and rich in details, while the polygonal models in cel shading,while cared for, they could have been animated a little better. The 3D effect left us a little chilly, given that it limits itself to adding a fair depth to the scenes without particular virtuosity. As usual for this type of production, the dubbing is completely in Japanese and the subtitles and texts completely in English which - although absolutely scholastic - could make those who do not master the language turn up their noses quite a bit. The soundtrack is pleasant: inspired and spot on, it does its duty even if it is not very memorable. Attack of the Friday Monsters! it is a particular story that will touch the hearts of some players", "date": "2013-07-26", "grade": "8.0"}
