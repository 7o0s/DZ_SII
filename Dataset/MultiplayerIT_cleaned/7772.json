As told in the trailer that you can see below, the development team is made up of only two people and had to face countless difficulties to create this action game, which visually cites the Medievil series in a rather evident way and puts us in the role of a knight made of tin, summoned by the ruler of a kingdom that has suddenly been attacked by a horde of hellish creatures. Armed with sword and shield, our task will be to face eleven stages based solely on the combat between our character and a handful of opponents: from skeletons to gigantic trolls armed with flamethrowers, from rhinoceros-like beasts to ghosts, capable of disappearing and of summoning huge quills that stick out of the ground, eventually passing through some bosses. To succeed in the enterprise, which proves to be quite challenging right from the start, we will have to learn to make the most of all the golem's abilities, ringing the most effective combos, skewering enemies whenever we have the opportunity and often resorting to shots quickly to avoid damage. With the sacred sword he puts everyone to flight At the beginning of the game we are asked to choose our sword and shield from a shortlist of ten possible variants that are unlocked by completing the boss fights. The initial equipment is clearly the most balanced, but continuing in the story it is possible to use faster or heavier swords, even equipped in some cases with a built-in drill, and shields whose function is not only to defend us from attacks but also to deal damage in turn. The first stage is intended as a tutorial and shows us the key combinations essential to avoid defeat, defeat to which, however, we will have to get used to quickly given the high level of challenge of this production, which could easily be defined as ~hardcore~ but which at the same time must necessarily resort to these expedients to somehow mask the brevity of the single player campaign, once which is exhausted, all that remains is to try a challenge mode in the arena. It will take two or three hours and the citation of a good number of saints and deities, but you will eventually be able to complete the story mode of Strength of the Sword 3, realizing precisely that the Ivent Games title does not offer much else and that it arises therefore as a fascinating, engaging and demanding experience, but at the same time short and limited. Also because focusing on difficulty often and willingly does not pay if this strategy is not put in the perspective of a global balance. In fact, making the opponents increasingly tough and bastards (see in particular the damned ghosts) only leads the player to always use the same combos, or those that allow him to sink the blow more effectively and with fewer risks. Playstation 3 trophies There are eleven Trophies obtainable by playing Strength of the Sword 3 and all are based on the completion of particular activities, based on our combat skills. In fact, there are three Trophies that are unlocked by obtaining the maximum rating in terms of attack, defense and speed in any stage, while others revolve around the execution of finishers, special moves and scores. In the game of thrones you either win or you die When you are part of an independent team, composed in this case of only two elements, characterization is fundamental. In the case of Strength of the Sword 3, an excellent job has been done from this point of view: the cinematic introduction of the game mimics the theme song of ~Game of Thrones~ and does it with style, while the general design of settings and characters appears successful and effective, recalling the atmospheres of Medievil as already mentioned. Of course, it must also be said that the graphics are decidedly retro and could run on PlayStation 2 in terms of polygon counts and textures, but the rapid framing changes make them pleasantly dynamic and the frame rate remains mostly anchored to sixty frames per second . To make everything more spectacular, it was decided to fill the fights with bullet time, but we really don't understand the desire to put slow motion during the shots of the enemies, which only increases the frustration for not having avoided them and at the same time makes it collapse the pace of the action. The camera is fixed and generally behaves well, except when maybe we end up cornered and move quickly, which sends it into a bit of a crisis. Not much to say on the other handsound: the effects seemed sufficient and the musical accompaniment discrete. Strength of the Sword 3 is a fun and challenging action game, a bit short but well characterized", "date": "2013-06-26", "grade": "7.0"}
