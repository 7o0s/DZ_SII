Nova is a Terran Ghost who was conceived to be the protagonist of the third-person action StarCraft: Ghost, a title announced at the beginning of the last decade and then canceled without appeal by the Irvine software house. However, we know that in Mike Morhaime's house the concepts are hardly forgotten forever and if the project stalled from a production point of view, the character of Nova was still developed independently. Paradoxically, despite the fleeting appearances in Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm, the blonde sniper has never been used again in the video game field until her debut in Heroes of the Storm, but has become the subject of a large comic book literature to tell other stories related to the rich universe of StarCraft. The first Covert Ops package therefore allowed us to control Nova for the first time in three missions which in all took us no more than an hour and a half to complete. A fleeting encounter therefore, but that was enough to trigger the spark. Nova: Covert Ops is a little less StarCraft than usual, but the first three missions convinced us A new threat to the Dominoes It is necessary to begin by specifying that it is in all respects an additional campaign to the three that have shaped the second chapter of StarCraft in recent years, but the connections with the events narrated up to Legacy of the Void are rather tenuous and completely negligible. In fact, the narrative setting chosen by Blizzard makes Nova: Secret Operations fully accessible to novices, so much so that in these first three missions the trio formed by Raynor, Kerrigan and Artanis have never been called into question. As usual, the work in the creation of the cutscenes that introduce the missions and in the dubbing completely in Italian was excellent. The reference timeline unfolds years after the end of the battle against Amon, when the empire now led by Valerian Mengsk is facing an extremist fringe of Terran called the Defenders of Humanity, who are sowing panic with their subversive actions in the Koprulu Sector: In addition to several Dominion Ghosts kidnapped while on a Mengsk mission, the Defenders plan to use the psionic emitters to lure out the Zerg and use them to attack the Empire's most important outposts. Precisely in an attempt to foil this conspiracy, Nova was sent on a mission with the task of infiltrating the enemy ranks but something goes wrong and she is kidnapped together with her companions. The first episode begins with the awakening of the protagonist who, warned of impending danger, activates the suit's invisibility and kills her jailer. We therefore find ourselves in the middle of an extraction mission, with the aim of rescuing the other kidnapped soldiers and then fleeing as soon as possible. In terms of gameplay, there is nothing really innovative given that the same type of missions has already appeared several times in different variations in the StarCraft II trilogy, but the presence of Nova with her skills has given the right characterization to the new countryside. The always active invisibility constantly repairs us except when we end up for a few moments inside the visual cone of the sentries equip with the appropriate viewer: in that case we will be discovered and we will become easy targets for enemies. In this sense, the sniper rifle comes to our rescue to eliminate them silently from a distance, accompanied by grenades in case the situation becomes more crowded. The final part of the first mission is very interesting, a frenetic escape aboard a Vulture chased by Banshee and Hellion who unload all their arsenal on us. Packs or bundles? The three packages that make up Nova Covert Ops cost 7.49 each while the bundle with all the episodes is sold for 14.99. In order to play it, in addition to the ubiquitous internet connection and Battle.net account, you must have purchased at least one of the three StarCraft II campaigns or alternatively the introductory edition. Alone or with (little) company Vehicles, rifle and grenades, so has Blizzard finally revived Nova and completed the StarCraft Ghost project? Absolutely not. Covert Ops remains StarCraft in all respects, with the only difference being thatnter more gameplay on the management and skills of the blonde soldier by partially sacrificing the macro-management of troops and structures typical of the series. Moving with circumspection without being discovered and attacking taking care not to run out of skill points remains the mechanics at the center of the solo sections, but in the second and third missions we also had a small base and a handful of troops available to use to repel the waves of Zerg gradually more and more powerful. A few SCVs, a Barracks and Bunkers are all we are granted at the start of the mission, with the possibility of producing Marines, Devastators and Reapers using nearby resources. Not having many options available to approach the situation, once the production of troops has begun, the focus shifts to micromanagement, especially in the second mission where we will be attacked from several fronts simultaneously. However, making our way through the strong enemies of our equipment and the trusty sniper rifle remains the leitmotif of all three missions, so much so that Blizzard has introduced a system of equipment for Nova and its troops to be unlocked as the campaign continues. An addition that is certainly very interesting in terms of customization, but with these first three episodes we could not help but glimpse its potential while waiting to dissect it with the next packages. Frankly the choice between sniper or assault rifle, between the camouflage suit or the one equipped with thrusters is actually completely irrelevant since in both cases it is a forced choice dictated by the needs of the specific missions, while using explosive grenades or stuns has limited impact on gameplay. The second and third pack of missions will arrive within the year, but if you are a StarCraft fan, our advice is to rush directly to the complete bundle, ensuring you the entire Nova Covert Ops experience at a good discount. If, on the other hand, you already know that real-time strategy games aren't to your liking, this additional campaign won't change your mind: as mentioned, despite the focus on using Nova's skills and a marginal management of troops and structures, the experience of game remains the solid and multifaceted one of the Blizzard real-time strategy games.", "date": "2016-04-01", "grade": null}
