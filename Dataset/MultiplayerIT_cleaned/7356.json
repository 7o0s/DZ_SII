{"name": "Roller Champions", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/roller-champions-recensione.html", "text": "With Roller Champions Ubisoft Montreal is trying to replicate the magic with which it has made its games as a service sensational commercial and public successes, despite a slow start. Just think of The Crew and For Honor, how it revitalized the first The Division, but above all what Rainbow Six: Siege has become over the years. After the very long postponement, most likely caused by problems related to Covid-19, the PvP game freely inspired by the movie Rollerball has finally arrived in free-to-play format on PC, Xbox One, PS4 and thanks to the backwards compatibility of Series X|S and PlayStation 5. As we will see in the Roller Champions review, despite the postponement, Ubisoft Montreal's latest effort arrived in stores a bit short of breath and needed a few days to break in its infrastructure and will need months to express its full potential. Rollerballs A scene from Rollerball Anyone who has seen Rollerball, the 1975 film directed by Norman Jewison (or its 2002 remake), will get a feeling of deja-vu while playing Roller Champions. The sport conceived by Ubisoft, in fact, shares a lot with the one seen in the film with James Caan. You play in circular arenas that you go around on roller skates, you play with a ball and there are no rules, which makes the defensive phase quite physical. The atmosphere of Rollerball was decidedly dirtier and dystopian, there was also a pinch of criticism of society behind it, but the ~sports~ discipline seems exactly the same. Roller Champions is played between two teams made up of 3 players each who fight for possession of a ball that is thrown into a sort of basket positioned on the sides of the track. Before scoring, however, a team must complete a full circle with the ball in hand. Based on the laps completed, the goal can be worth more points, something that could allow the result of the match to be completely reversed even at the last moment. In fact, a basket made after 3 complete laps is worth 5 points and, consequently, the direct victory of the match. For its part, Ubisoft has put its all into trying to differentiate its game from the old films: the package offered is young and colorful, so as to intercept the most modern tastes and be suitable for the free-to-play structure that supports the project . Through the sale of the colorful skins and emotes, the Montreal studio hopes to recoup development costs and support the community in the long run. Mode A stadium of Roller Champions Long term is the key to understanding Roller Champions today. Ubisoft, in fact, does not seem to be in a hurry with its creature. After taking a week to finally fix the matchmaking and allow everyone to pretty solidly play most of the matches you've been matched in (something to be reckoned with given the fully online nature of the game) in many respects the title still seems not to be fully mature. Let's start with the modalities: to stretch your bones and understand how to play, only the Quick Games or the Skatepark are available, a free area in which to meet other players. To play ~seriously~, however, there are only Ranked Matches which differ from Rapids only in that you climb a ranking designed to put you in front of opponents of your own level. Roller Champions And then? Enough, because for the moment the Surprise Event is closed and we don't know when the next one will arrive. A little bit to think of gluing the user for a long time, also considering the good plan of unlockables available with the season pass, both free and paid, or the daily objectives. There is no way to create your own team, to play competitively with friends, to consortium or to compare statistics and skills. In other words, the whole side dish is missing as well as a good main course. Gameplay A game phase of Roller Champions The lack of completeness can also be perceived in terms of gameplay. The game system created by Ubisoft, in fact, is able to entertain and also allows you to experience a certain degree of depth. In fact, already after a few games, you will be able to move more effectively along the ring, to perform very high jumps or take advantage of your teammates to reach dizzying speeds and, perhaps, block a shot a few centimeters from the basket. In many respects Roller Champions could remember Rocket League, except that Psyonix's game seems to be more solid in terms of physics, contact precision and match reading. Everything is bigger, clearer and this allows us to understandwhere is the ball and why it was hit (or not). In Roller Champions the ball carrier is signaled by a simple indicator, to steal it you have to tackle him and the contacts are not always precise and it is not clear why the action was successful or not. Roller Champions customizations This could make matches frustrating, as the result could depend more on a technical problem than on the skill of a player/team. Like the rest, these aspects can also be improved over time, it will be necessary to see if the team will have the possibility to do so. From a technical point of view, we appreciated the lightness of the game engine, capable of running on PCs even if not designed for gaming, the soundtrack and the design of objects and characters. There is still work to be done in terms of code stability and matchmaking, but the situation seems to have improved in just a few days.", "date": "2022-05-30", "grade": "7.0"}
