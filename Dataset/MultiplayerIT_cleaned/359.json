The title developed by Tuque Games and Wizards of the Coast, which we remind you will debut on June 22nd for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Series X / S and also on the Game Pass from day one, has certainly captured the attention of many for the setting in the Forgotten Realms, but also for its action nature which suits the current market dynamics. Let's find out our final judgment on the title in our review of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance. Journey to the Forgotten Realms Let's start from the narrative premise: Dark Alliance is set after The Crystal Shard, or the first novel of the Lost Lands Trilogy, by R. A. Slavatore and before the new campaign for the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons called Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden. The objective of Drizzt Do' Urden's company is to stop the advance of numerous creatures in the region of Faerun, attracted by the power of a fragment of the crystal. Without going into too much detail to avoid spoilers, we can tell you that between well-known characters and new extras, the narrative basis on which the game's playful ecosystem rests is really solid. Passionate and not of a certain type of classic fantasy, they will each have bread for their own teeth. Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance is in fact the right mix of classic and caciaroni content suitable for both fans of the adventures of Drizzt's company and just fans of the genre. Here, together with the narrative premise, we would also like to connect the artistic question. In fact, the two aspects run parallel. The representation of the settings is in fact very suggestive. One of the aspects that struck us from the very first approaches was precisely the care in recreating those imaginaries that emerged strongly from the ink of Salvatore's books. Dwarf constructions, frozen tundras, the play of crystal light, mysterious caves, but also the very design of the enemies (iconic and not) contain a love for the works that is truly commendable. Several times we stopped to look at our surroundings and also to observe the cure in the design of the enemies. From verbeegs to goblins, passing through a bestiary that is extremely varied and detailed. A functional concept Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance: Cattie-Brie's agility However, the game is not only the artistic and narrative side, but it is also and above all gameplay and here unfortunately the title trips over numerous banana peels. But let's start in order and summarize the nature of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance. As we told you in the first and last test before release, the title is a third-person cooperative action game with numerous role-playing game elements. At the base of the gameplay there are two fundamental elements: the combos and skills on the one hand and the loot on the other. As for the first pillar, the player will be able to count on a system of light and heavy blows, two main skills and an ultimate. Each character (Drizzt, Cattie-Brie, Bruenor and Wulfgar) will have a set of moves and skills related to their particular characteristics and will influence the way they approach battle. However, each of them is conceptually designed to make up for the shortcomings of the others, so as to push you to form a complete party. The synergies can be seen, they are tangible and they work. However, there are a number of problems that affect its operation and which we will explain later. The second pillar, the loot, however works differently. The classic RPG stats (resistance, luck, strength, intellect, etc.) exist and each character starts from a different base linked to his nature. The way you can affect these stats is through loot. Not only the rarity and level, but also the possibility of belonging to certain unique sets, conditions the effects of the equipment on your parameters and allows you to go and create specific builds. From the ability to inflict afflicted status, to increasing the crit rate and so on. Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance: Wulfgar and his hammer Two other elements then revolve around these two pillars: talents and upgrades. The former work like a real skill tree and will increase your base moves and combos by consuming the talent points that can be obtained by leveling up. The latter, on the other hand, replace crafting and work through the materials obtainable by playing, but also from the merchant in the game hub. These upgrades will level up your equipment by boosting the appo's parameter changesrtate from that specific loot. From a conceptual point of view, all this ecosystem of skills, combos and loot that intersect with each other, form a valid basis with ample potential. The player, in fact, in theory can choose a customization of the gameplay that goes in the direction most desired by him. Whether it's a tank of immense strength, or a support capable of managing enemies from a distance, the game ideally allows you to direct the strategies and gamepaly sessions following the tracks of your choice. Critical issues Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance: The Fellowship clashes with the Beholder The problems in Dark Alliance, however, arise in the implementation of what is conceptually well designed. The main problems are with the animations and AI. As for the first, there are two major distinctions: the general animations of the character and what happens when the shots impact the enemies. The animations of the heroes, as anticipated in the last preview, are a bit awkward in the movements and wooden as regards the attacks, especially those that require the character to move and twist at a high rate. As regards the blows on the enemies, however, there are animations specific in case of small size opponents while almost null on large size enemies. In fact, only certain blows will have a tangible effect on bosses and enemies with immense moles, exacerbating that punchingball effect which unfortunately does not give the best possible feeling to the fights. Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance: Some of the most iconic enemies The other negative point (perhaps the most serious) of the Dark Alliance gaming experience is artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the enemies are unresponsive to what happens around them, they don't have patrols in the manned areas and they use very little functional attack patterns. Starting from the first statement, the opponents are either pre-positioned in a place on the map or they spawn the moment the area is entered, in both cases their behavior is static until the player enters the action area of the enemy in question or until it invades its cone of vision. This leads to easy exploits in fights with absurd reductions in aggro based on distance and the possibility through Cattie-Brie to hit enemies without them noticing what is happening. At present, in fact, it is possible with a party of at least two players (one of which is Cattie-Brie) to almost completely ignore the recommended difficulty level and play at least one / two levels above due to the faulty AI. Different speech in the boss fights: to date, in fact, the clashes in the pre-established closed arena, with enemies other than the minions, seem to be the ones that suffer less from this problem. We're not even talking about surprising AI in these cases, but at least the challenge effect at higher levels is more perceptible.", "date": "2021-06-21", "grade": "6.6"}
