It is our way of inaugurating, with an excellent spring PC title, a new season of Multiplayer.it editorial production which will integrate and enrich (not replace) the classic one, dedicated to Premium Gold subscribers, made up of text and images static. The video articles on Multiplayer.it have already begun to appear in a primordial form as early as the end of 2002, to reach maximum experimentation during the last Tokyo Game Show, during which Mauro Fanelli produced some ~almost live~ video diaries, during which he illustrated with the tone of an experienced conductor, the best of the Japanese fair. Now the family of video articles has reached its recognized status and the new milestone is this video review: live video from the game and the editor's voice (and face) commenting on the moving images. From today on we will try to increasingly guarantee this new form of communication that we believe is more modern, suitable for the medium in which we move and now within everyone's reach thanks to the enormous diffusion that ADSL has had in the last twelve months. And now wide open to the voice of Andrea Rubbini and the action of Far Cry! The video below requires Windows Media Player 9.", "date": "2004-05-07", "grade": null}
