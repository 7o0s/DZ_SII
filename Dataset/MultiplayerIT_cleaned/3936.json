{"name": "Golf Peaks", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/golf-peaks-recensione.html", "text": "It must be said that golf seems to be a sport that unleashes the imagination, although it may seem, in the eyes of a layman, a great bore. A bit like baseball for certain American authors, it is one of those elements that from the popular mass overflow into the artistic vision and become culture of some kind to all intents and purposes. Similarly, golf in the videogame field has been treated in various ways, from the real simulation to the arcade, up to strange hybridizations with narrative systems such as the one seen in Golf Story on Nintendo Switch, for example, giving an idea of how much this fact of hitting a ball can open up unexpected worlds in the minds of developers. Here we go again with Golf Peaks, given that also in this case it is a question of reinterpreting golf in an absolutely unexpected way, merging it with a kind of card game. The aim is the same, that is to make the ball go into the hole, but the way in which this is implemented is completely different, or rather its shape is because conceptually it is still a matter of moving the ball in consecutive rounds until it reaches the predetermined purpose. It's a sort of indirect golf, where what matters is not the ability to hit the ball, the ability to dose strength and spin in the right way as happens in most cases, but you find yourself planning the course strategically, placing the cards in the right sequence in order to obtain the result which is the basis of golf: making the hole in the least number of moves possible. This translates into an exclusively tactical system, which excludes direct control of the ball, requiring above all a careful study of the terrain and the moves already available. Despite the bizarre premise, the idea works very well. Eagle Golf Peaks is to all intents and purposes a puzzle game based on the idea of golf, with no direct connection to the actual sporting action. We therefore do not find ourselves using a club to hit the ball, but using a series of cards with different effects, each of which allows us to make predetermined movements, to reach the hole while staying inside strange paths composed of boxes suspended over the void , so any minimum can cause the ball to fall off the edge. Numbers representing specific effects are printed on each card, which indicate the movement that the use of this card imparts to the ball, while the direction we impart directly to each shot. Considering that the deck of cards provided is visible from the beginning, it is a question of strategically planning the path to follow by deciding the right sequence of cards to use in order to reach the hole in the least number of moves possible and obviously without dropping the ball out of bounds. After the first stages of training, however, we begin to discover the effects that the various types of terrain apply to the ball, when it passes over particular squares, also in this case by taking up some classic principles of golf and mini golf: there there are differences in height to be calculated, there is the possibility of exploiting the rebounds against elements of the raised scenery by calculating their trajectory and inertia, we find obstacles to avoid such as the classic sand and water, all characteristics which combine to complicate the analysis of the path to take to get to the hole using the cards available and possibly by advancing some of them. All of this is represented by an isometric shot that is somewhat reminiscent of the classic Marble Madness, but with a graphic style with a clean and simple design, particularly pleasant and relaxing.", "date": "2018-11-24", "grade": "8.0"}
