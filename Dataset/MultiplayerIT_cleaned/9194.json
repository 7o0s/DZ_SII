Little Indies Grow. Anyone who follows our Xbox Live Weekly column knows very well how much we care about small independent projects, and the talented studios that take care of them. Lots of ideas, a pinch of madness and that often anarchic spirit, facilitated by freedom from the commitments of older brothers. However, someone occasionally crosses the line that divides the nursery from the professional league, one of these is the Smudget Cat team, which with its The Adventures Of Shuggy lands on Xbox Live Arcade. It is a two-dimensional platform, with strong puzzle game elements, which sees a very nice creature with features vaguely similar to a bat, Shuggy, as the protagonist. Our little friend can't fly, but with his prince of the night cape, and pointed canines, he's capable of so many other things. He is above all greedy for green diamonds, the little shiny jewels that we have to collect along the many levels that await us. Just like a new Pac-Man, Shuggy finds himself jumping around to retrieve the precious jewels, while avoiding various threats, which come in the form of deadly traps or willful enemy creatures. Prince of monsters The whole adventure takes place in a gloomy castle, which has many different sections. There are main areas that offer entry to the various rooms, but Shuggy has to find a certain number of keys to open them each time. This happens simply by completing the rooms, once we have collected the last green diamond, we are rewarded with a precious key, and so on. An apparently very simple formula, but which is constantly revived by an almost endless series of gimmicks, which put a strain on both the player's analytical sense and the reflexes in jumping platforms with precision, and we assure you that it takes a lot. The approach to the level is regularly distorted once the conditions to overcome it are dictated, we pass from the need to rotate the screen with the analog triggers to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, to totally overturned sections, still others that see our protagonist split into several clones that we can command individually, and whose coordination is crucial to solve the scheme. One of the sections that struck us the most is the one subordinated to the time gaps. The game keeps track of our actions, and then takes us back in time. In this way we see the old Shuggy pattern, which faithfully repeats the path. However, touching him is equivalent to instant death, which means that it is our own protagonist who becomes a potential enemy. In this way we must remember the trajectories precisely, in order to avoid the fatal contact. It's a much harder idea to put into words than to play with. But we assure you that it is extremely intuitive and original, bringing a new and exciting degree of challenge. Xbox 360 goals The Adventures Of Shaggy offers the usual 12 objectives of the Live Arcade games, for a total of 200 player points. To conquer the simplest ones, a few game schemes are enough, but collecting them all is equivalent to a considerable challenge. Good luck! A diamond is forever The more advanced levels offer a larger scale, with the presence of scrolling, and are sometimes populated by supporting characters to be freed to finish the stage. The level design is really elaborate and satisfying, but not everything is perfect. The total absence of checkpoints makes some parts rather frustrating, especially the longer ones. The death of the protagonist forces you to repeat the whole level, and it's not the best when this happens one step away from its completion. The considerable variety is a double-edged sword, not knowing initially what to do, the player is at the mercy of the typical trial and error syndrome, fortunately never suffocating, but there is no doubt that victory is almost always achieved after a considerable series of dead, functional to the contextual understanding of playful mechanics. Technically The Adventures Of Shuggy looks like a rather elementary product, which does its job and little more. The sprites are well drawn, and the parodic humor refers to the great classics such as Super Mario Bros, Castlevania and many others. In the same way, the light-hearted music seems to revive the flavors of the old folk festivals, arousing pleasant joy. It's hard not to smile in front of this tiny and colorful universe, which betrays its origins as an independent product, but is always functional and pleasant. Local or co-op multiplayer play is supported, through sspecific modes, to double the fun.", "date": "2011-07-05", "grade": "8.0"}
