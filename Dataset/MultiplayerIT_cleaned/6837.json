Dust: An Elysian Tail is Dean Dodrill's title that landed on Xbox 360 after his triumph at the Dream. builds. play. Made on the XNA platform, this action/platformer indistinguishable from a cartoon left everyone speechless due to the excellent care and the fact that it was made entirely by one person. Dodrill, also known as Noggy, was born as an animator and took advantage of all the experience accumulated in the short films he made himself for the creation of the various characters that animate the title. After two years, Dust: An Elysian Tail also arrives on PlayStation 4, and we really couldn't miss the opportunity to try this new incarnation too. The result? The magic of the original is still intact in this conversion, which finally offers Sony users the opportunity to experience a great title. The Vault of the Fox The story tells a classic plot of sin and redemption, putting us in the shoes of the fox Dust, an amnesiac warrior in search of his past through the lands of Falana, aided by the trusty talking sword Ahrah, a mysterious entity who seems to know him very well. Soon the duo is joined by the funny Fidget, a being halfway between a bat and a squirrel, who becomes our faithful companion throughout the adventure, coloring its lighter moments, with a clear reference to the role of the Disney mascots, to whom the author is clearly inspired. However, its role in the gameplay is far from marginal, as Fidget is able to launch elemental projectiles that are not very incisive by themselves, but lethal when combined with a special Dust move that can be activated by holding down the triangle button. In this way we kick off a deadly tornado created by the sword, capable of exponentially amplifying the number of bullets, with devastating results on the screen. Continuing the adventure, Fidget is capable of acquiring different types of attack, selectable at will and fundamental not only in an offensive perspective, but also for solving environmental puzzles. Dust: An Elysian Tail is therefore basically a not particularly technical hack 'n' slash, but very spectacular, enjoyable and equipped with a progression system capable of not disfiguring in the face of the cornerstone of the genre, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Dust: An Elysian Tail is the closest thing to a cartoon we've ever seen Full screen Like other PlayStation 4 titles (such as Velocity 2X and DRIVECLUB), Dust: An Elysian Tail is not presented in full screen by default, but with a very flashy black frame that can distract from the game. The menus do not have options for adjusting the screen, but you can remedy this by intervening directly in the PlayStation 4 dashboard. To do this, go to settings, then select ~audio and screen~, then select the item ~Display area settings~ . At this point, adjust the boundaries of the screen to your liking with the directional stick and confirm. Almost an indie manifesto From the Konami masterpiece, Dust: An Elysian Tail also draws on other ideas such as backtracking, functional for the discovery of secrets and treasures and the acquisition of new abilities, such as double jump and sliding, capable of taking the character to previously inaccessible places . The game features a dozen freely explorable maps (once unlocked) through a series of interconnected portals, which allow both saving the game and free movement between areas, at the price, however, of an initially rather expensive gem, a intelligent that forces you to move with a certain caution and guarantees the fluidity of the adventure for most of its duration. The amount of extra content included in the product is particularly surprising, a ten-hour campaign is joined by various additional missions that can be unlocked only after talking to the villagers (often through interactive dialogues), special scoring tests and a breathtaking amount of secrets capable of doubling the duration of the game. The presence of RPG elements is appreciable, from the leveling of the character to the buying and selling of the various items, up to the possibility of building armor yourself. Exhilarating the possibility of releasing different icons of the indie landscape, including The Maw, Super Meat Boy, Fez, Bastion, The Dishwasher and many others, often with tasty visual references to the titles they belong to. The story manages to excite thanks to the details on Dust's past that are gradually revealed, animated sequences and a final climax that will certainly delight fans of Japanese RPGs. Fidget especiallyte is able to steal the show thanks to his peppery temper, once the adventure is over you will miss him. Playstation 4 trophies Dust: An Elysian Tail features 30 trophies to earn. By finishing the basic adventure, only half are obtained, for the others it is necessary to complete all the numerous additional quests, discover secrets and perform certain actions. The legendary ~The Baker's Dozen~ trophy could not be missing, which requires you to find the twelve indie mascots hidden in the game world. It will take you some time. Cartoons live forever One of the most impressive aspects of Dust: An Elysian Tail is its excellent graphic design: the result is one of the closest things to a cartoon ever seen. The title has a two-dimensional look, with gigantic sprites drawn entirely by hand and beautifully animated. Dust moves through scenarios equipped with various levels of parallax, zoom and effects of all kinds. The settings range from lush forests, caverns and ghostly mansions, culminating in a simply memorable snowy landscape. Everything flows smoothly in sixty frames per second glory. The orchestral music is functional but well done, while the numerous dialogues recorded for the characters are to be commended, unfortunately in English but subtitled in Italian. Numerous quotations and pungent irony, from Samurai Warrior Usagi Yojimbo to Turrican, Astal, Strider and Metroid, Dean Dodrill's anthropomorphic animals represent a feast for all nostalgics, almost a summa of the genre, outlining the nature of a product created with unusual passion, even if not perfect. The boss fights feel strangely bland, certain passages like the final area are forced and chaotic, and the combat system leans too much on Dust's special move and parrying, even if they are never flaws that can tarnish the beauty blinding of this title. Online support is limited to player rankings, which are also present in special events scattered across the game map. The PlayStation 4 edition uses native 1080p resolution to deliver an even sharper picture. Unfortunately, however, a flashy black frame is present by default, which you can however remove by following the instructions in the ~Full screen~ box.", "date": "2014-10-15", "grade": "9.0"}
