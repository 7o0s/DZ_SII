{"name": "The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-fast-and-the-furious-tokyo-drift-recensione.html", "text": "The genre of racing games is divided ~horizontally~ between simulations and arcades, but there is also a ~vertical~ division: on the one hand, the products in which you always remain within the context of the races, passing from one event to another; on the other, those in which you are free to roam around a city, moving towards events, buying new cars and upgrading them to the limit of the ridiculous. With Ridge Racer, Namco specialized in the arcade genre where ~you just run~, and only now decided to try something similar to Need for Speed, taking advantage of the popularity of a title like The Fast and the Furious. All mine the city... The setting of the game is very similar to that seen in Need for Speed: Carbon: we are in a Japanese city, with the possibility of exploring the suburban roads in search of territories to conquer. Each area is controlled by a gang, and we'll have to face all its members (including the boss, in the end) to vanquish them and impose our name. We'll start with a small nest egg, so we'll have to buy a cheap car and try to bring home some results. Each opponent is giving away a certain amount of money, and when we have enough money we can decide to go to a dealer or to a shop that sells modifications. In most cases it is advisable to upgrade your car rather than take a new one, also because the upgrades allow us to multiply the horses with a relatively low cost. This aspect of the game is definitely taken care of: the available parts all have a clear description, as well as a visual indication of the increase in power they imply. In addition to improving performance, you can also access many aesthetic changes, ranging from the color of the paint to the application of vinyl, from the assembly of spoilers to the replacement of rims and tyres. As in the three films from which the game is inspired, there is great attention paid to the nitro, capable of actually solving each race in a few moments: activating it allows us to immediately reach the final speed of the car, and in races ~at destination ~there's really nothing else to worry about. Load! As mentioned, you can go around the locations and challenge the various gangs, but you can also open the map and immediately transport yourself to the desired place. However, he soon runs into what is The Fast and the Furious's biggest problem: the uploads. There is not the slightest optimization in this regard, unfortunately: to start a race you have to wait a long time, you also have to wait when the race ends, or when you enter a dealership, or when you buy upgrades. This means that we will spend almost more time looking at the loading screen than playing, with all the frustration that goes with it. Each zone puts us in front of different types of races, but in most cases we just have to get to the end of an almost completely straight path, just making sure we have good speed and using the nitro to reach it quickly, opponent's detriment. This lack of variety is also a significant tile, and among other things you must necessarily defeat all members of a gang to complete the area and move on to the next. The cars available in the game are all real and are divided into front, rear or all-wheel drive. The behavior on the road is very different and appears quite realistic, with the only problem of having indestructible vehicles, which can be carried to the finish line even by bouncing from one wall to another, with a few exceptions. Technical realization In its PSP version, Ridge Racer still represents a point of reference in terms of speed and fluidity. It is therefore with great surprise that this new Namco product does not boast the same technical quality, rather it produces frequent and drastic drops in the frame rate, which sometimes even end up making the race confusing. Nothing can be said about the construction of the cars, always faithful to the real counterparts, while the setting is not so crowded or detailed as to justify the problems just mentioned. If we add the tremendous loading times to this, then it is clear that we are dealing with a product that is not at all optimized, which needed more work. The sound sector carries out its work in an honest but transparent way, in the sense that it cannot boast the songs of any Need for Speed and the effects are average, without acute details. The car responds promptly to the controls, which are flawless, and there is a multiplayer mode available to take on an opponent holding aPSP and a copy of the game. Unfortunately, there is no online mode... Comment When you intend to compete directly with Need for Speed, it is clear that you need a product with all the credentials. In this sense, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift proves not to be up to the situation: the basic system is valid, with good control of the car, a clear differentiation between the various types of traction and a really complete and well done upgrade. What is lacking, guilty, is the technical aspect: the uploads are really too frequent and long, breaking the pace of the game, and the frequent drops in the frame rate lead to serious doubts about the optimization work carried out by the developers. To this we must add a certain linearity of the action: very often the races are completely devoid of bite, proposing a mere speed comparison which in fact wastes the excellent work done to make the car control better. In short, an unsuccessful attempt: we can only hope that Namco realizes the mistakes made and works in the best way to change things in the event of a possible sequel. Pros: Very well done power up system A large number of cars and races Nice graphics... Cons: ...but with drastic drops in frame rate Loads too long and frequent Often repetitive", "date": "2008-03-31", "grade": null}
