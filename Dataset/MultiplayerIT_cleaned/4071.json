{"name": "V-Rally 4: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/v-rally-4-recensione.html", "text": "Sometimes they come back, indeed perhaps what was officially the console generation of returns is about to end: titles often linked to our childhood that redo their look, update themselves for online multiplayer, add a small number next to the title, et voil. Very often the public welcomes them with fervor, even if only for the nostalgia effect, ready to postpone a realization that may prove to be inadequate; just as often the judgment of the people turns out to be implacable, in the face of minimal defects. With V-Rally 4 things perhaps get even more complicated: the developers of Kylotonn Games need no introduction at all, they are the guys from the WRC series and the good TT Isle of Man, released a handful of months ago. But going back to publishing a new title in a series that stopped in 2002 also inevitably means colliding with the demands of today's market, and with a sector (that of racing games) already widely covered by some well-known names. Gameplay: A complex but accessible simulator V-Rally 4 is a complex driving simulator that most of the time also manages to be adequately deep. Despite belonging to a genre little inclined to compromise for non-experts, the title of Kylotonn Games in the first moments of the game still tries to meet the newcomers, taking them by the hand and showing them their offer little by little. The best way to do this, of course, is to get on the track: and so here we are already in the Grand Canyon for a timed race, a smart choice because the track is also one of the best and allows you to immediately appreciate a decidedly solid and inviting. Our guide is the handyman Nancy, who for the occasion seems to have memorized every single section of the game menu and the possibilities offered by the title; it will also be expressed in an excellent dubbing in Italian, so much so that it is not a bad idea to immediately deactivate the subtitles from the settings, because in fact they will practically never be needed. However, it only takes a few minutes on the track to understand that Nancy will take care of supervising our first steps and learning the basic mechanics, and then leave us alone: V-Rally 4 is a title that offers content and expects feedback specific to the player, that of knowing how to adapt to various situations and develop their driving skills very quickly. Difficult to see a real game over, difficult to completely ~lose~ a contract, at least in the initial stages, but the lack of skill will still have its consequences in the form of meager rewards that will lengthen the evolution times of our driver and his cars. A practical example will be enough to understand each other better: like other similar titles, at the end of each track and competition we will get a certain amount of money, which will be reinvested in the purchase of new cars, in upgrading those already in our possession and also in the salaries of the employees. But a disappointing positioning or many collisions on the track will lead to reduced prize pools or their entire expense in repairs, consequently we will not be able to buy and unlock anything new and the little money we have will soon be lost in weekly salaries (particularly large, among other). V-Rally 4, therefore, rewards the best and those who manage to adapt to a discrete level of difficulty compared to the average of the genre, without however penalizing all the others too much. To be complex is not only the management of some tracks with an overall balance that is not particularly convincing, but the same simulation proposed by the guys from Kylotonn: not that in TT Isle of Man it was easy to keep the two-wheeled vehicles on the road, but with four seems to make things even more complicated, albeit with fewer metrics to keep an eye on. Things improve a little (but not that much) with the simplified driving controls that Nancy will propose to activate in the event of a disastrous outcome of the tutorial circuit: all other things being equal, the suggestion is to adapt to a deep simulation to get the most out of it from production without any discounts, also because V-Rally 4 is certainly not (and it shouldn't be) a racing game purchased to admire the panorama. Playstation 4 trophies V-Rally 4 offers players not only the chance to become the best drivers in the world, but also to unlock a valuable Platinum Trophy. The challenge will be all the more demanding the less you are familiar with driving simulators, but for insiders, unlocking all the trophies will simply be a matter of time and dedication. It will be necessary to unlock all the cars present, perfect the career mode, arrive firstmi on every track breaking records; there are also some online trophies, including one that requires you to play at least 200 games: these could present some more problems. A substantial offer, but often dispersive In 2002 a driving game didn't need mammoth content to entertain and guarantee a sufficient number of copies sold: sixteen years later the market has obviously changed, the player informs himself (or at least should) much more before buying , and less and less forgives the lack of specific content that it expects to find. Beyond the number of tracks proposed (22), V-Rally 4 also knows it needs a career mode worthy of the name and online multiplayer: there are both, but not everything works as it should. The path of the career mode, for example, seems to have to remain anchored to a series of contracts proposed by the sponsors, a mere excuse to get on track in different locations with always identical objectives. The more you play, the more tracks you unlock, the more tracks you unlock, the more you get access to diversified and better cars than the previous ones, or if you want, you can customize and enhance those you're already fond of, all in a crescendo that's more dispersive than satisfying. The problem, in fact, is that there is no real common thread to all these actions, and Nancy's ~vocal guide~ certainly isn't enough to make everything more interesting. The offer of V-Rally 4 definitely improves considering the online multiplayer sector for up to 8 players and above all the proposed tracks: extremely varied, they have been created with a certain accuracy that cannot fail to be noticed by the attentive player's eye. True, at the edge of the track there are often few game objects, and the level of destructibility and collision with those present is not at all convincing: running over civilians simply makes them ~disappear~, colliding with a rock leaves the landscape unharmed anyway, all problems already noted in the recent TT Island of Man. However, the overall glance is always extremely pleasant, and by setting the camera in first person the level of immersion is truly remarkable. There is no shortage of important official licenses, such as Lancia Delta, Porsche, Ford, Volkswagen, even if often the creation of off-road models remains questionable both for the design choice and for various secondary details that are not particularly convincing; everything is counterbalanced by the presence of several cars and a very deep customization editor: unlocking all the accessories will require a lot of time available, and above all money.
