{"name": "Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/klonoa-phantasy-reverie-series-recensione.html", "text": "Once upon a time there was Klonoa. More precisely, the year was 1997, the era of the first PlayStation continued to offer players pearls that are now well rooted in collective memory. Do the math: exactly 25 years have passed. And given that the same players have been clamoring for a remaster, a remake, or in any case an updated revival of the adventures of that strange black cat with very long ears, Bandai Namco has finally decided to satisfy them. In short, these are months of very welcome returns: recently we welcomed Pac-Man Museum+ on practically all consoles. But let's go back to Klonoa and to be exact to Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series. It is a package including the two well-known chapters of the series, namely Klonoa: Door to Phantomile (the aforementioned 1997 title, for PlayStation 1) and Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil (from 2001, released on the later PlayStation 2) . Not in the same guise as then, as a decent refurbishment has been done. Incapable of fully restoring the same magic of that unmistakable style that accompanied the appearance of the protagonist for the first time, but necessary and sufficient so that both today's and yesterday's players can enjoy the product with an at least decent graphic and technical sector There's no shortage of real novelties either. But to know everything you will have to read our review of Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series. A new graphic look Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series: If you remember these moments, you had a happy childhood As mentioned, Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a remaster containing the two well-known chapters of the series, faithfully reproduced by Bandi Namco on the gameplay and content side, but revised and corrected from a graphic point of view. The title is currently available on any console, as well as on PC via Steam, and can even reach the goal marked by the magic words ~4K and 60 fps~. Now, we're pretty sure that's actually the case on PlayStation 5; however, the writer has completed the main adventure of both chapters on Nintendo Switch, because the attraction of portability was too tempting. And here, mind you, 4K is not even remotely conceivable, the graphics are around 900p. Frame rate side, however, Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series has always behaved very well, even without remaining anchored to 60 fps. In truth, it was precisely the choices related to the adaptation, to the new graphic design that convinced us. Because obviously that magical mix of pixel art and 2.5 worlds of the first PlayStation was impossible to reproduce as it was on next-generation consoles. The artistic direction therefore decided to follow the path of cartoonish rendering, of the saturation of the colors, of the filling of each backdrop (whereas in the first Klonoa they remained instead, in many situations, on a black background). You may or may not like the choice, but it actually works, and allows anyone who has never known the saga to approach it without turning up their faces for purely graphic-technical reasons. Even the cutscenes have all been redone from scratch, as have the game menus (always in high definition). These are not always obvious aspects, so it is good to underline them. The contents of the remaster The new difficulty levels of Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series (the game is all in Italian anyway) The contents of the remaster, however, are not limited to this. Now, the two games, from the point of view of the respective proposals, remain identical; the methods of use change. For example, various difficulty levels have been introduced, which are initially ~easy~ and ~normal.~ In easy mode the maximum hearts of the protagonist are five, the damage is reduced by a third and the lives are practically infinite, so reaching the game over is impossible. In normal mode the challenge becomes what it used to be: Klonoa has only three hearts available, the damage received from enemies is the standard one and you start a game with three lives available. By completing the main adventure, the difficult mode is then unlocked, where the bonuses are replaced by the malus: those who at the time will thoroughly explore both episodes will presumably find their satisfaction here. The green eggs of Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series can hide anywhere, and sometimes they can't even be seen Furthermore, it is now possible to play both Klonoa: Door to Phantomile and Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil with a friend, who takes on the role of Huepow and Popka respectively. Here the inspiration for the co-op mode must be right from famous examples such as Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Odyssey, because effectively the second player holds a controller, but not to guide a character in turn within the levels, but to enhance Klonoa's jumps within them. The ~support jump~ (this is the name of the feature) needs to be recharged after each use, however it is clear that it can be very useful, if used strategically, within a platform like Klonoa, simplifying the achievement of certain platforms that would otherwise require longer loops or careful consideration of the resources available in the surrounding environment. A timeless classic Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series: the protagonist must exploit environmental elements or enemies to reach the most distant platforms The ~timeless classic~ formula conjures silly, sometimes even false, images. But really, how else could Klonoa be defined? The older ones will certainly have pleasant memories of these two single returns from the period of youth; the newcomers instead, who have never known the black cat, perhaps precisely because of the label, will be intrigued and will try to recover it. We can still agree on one thing, or at least this is our idea: both Klonoa: Door to Phantomile and Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil still make sense to exist and are as entertaining as they were in the past. The weight of the years is felt only in individual aspects: the size of the levels and the overall duration of the individual adventures which stands at two, maximum three hours. Some platforming sequences of Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series have aged worse than others, but overall both titles are worth completing once again However, try to compare the level design, the ideas, the use of enemies in the surrounding environment, and you will understand once again why Klonoa had bewitched you when you were younger. Every single level was and remains very rich in content, including gems to collect, secrets, eggs whose presence can be guessed even only on the basis of a shadow on the ground, bosses who need a certain approach, sometimes intuitive, to be defeated. others less. The use of the protagonist's ring, his only weapon available, is as simple as it is effective: Klonoa cannot just ~eliminate~ the enemies, but frame them in his ring. Basically, after hitting them, he uses them at will: to knock down a wall, jump higher, reach an object that is too far away. Not to mention the carefree and sunny aftertaste of the plot, so simple that today it would not even be taken into consideration. Isn't that simplicity also missing? A simplicity belonging to a period of our life that has sadly passed, and therefore been lost?", "date": "2022-07-12", "grade": "7.2"}
