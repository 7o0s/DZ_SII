{"name": "L'innominabile Pong doppio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/180752-mulmashtabbagalgal-linnominabile-pong-doppio.html", "text": "Jacob and Paul were looking for an idea for their new game, and after having giant pizzas fight against skeleton armies or elegant managers against anthropomorphic animals, everything that came out of the brainstorming based on valerian wrapped in small cylinders (or at least this was what they said they were consuming) was a bouncing ball between two bar lines on either side of the screen. ~I don't know, it tastes a bit of something already seen~, said the producer, strangely relieved by the apparently trivial proposal of the two, given the previous ones. ~Yes, but in this case the bars are both moved by the same player, they can have different characteristics and shapes and they also launch three balls at the same time~, explained the Riverman Media brothers, with a strange ecstatic inflection in their voice. ~Not bad, and then what?~ Asked the producer, who in the meantime was beginning to sniff out the continuation, with growing anxiety. ~Then we put in some creatures that fill the screen and move upwards, which must be hit with the balls to get money and in this way buy the power-ups for the temples, which are actually esoteric figures abstract~, continued the brothers, increasingly invigorated by the valerian, ~and then let's make these creatures look like strange luminous fish, which escape as we move between surreal seabeds~. ~Ah, well... Sure, it's a bit strange~, replied the producer, more and more intimidated by the look of the two creatives in front of him. ~But we need a name that is easy to remember, something catchy, like Bong ... Tong?~ ventured the producer, very sweaty. ~No, better something more original, short and that reflects precisely the concept of the game~, explained the brothers, evidently in the grip of a creative trance based on catnip, or whatever it was. Jacob turned to Paul, who mysteriously in his eyes seemed to be covered by the classic vestments of Babylonian kings, and holding up a kind of tablet with cuneiform incisions (actually the packet of chips that he had devoured in the throes of an atavistic hunger) ruled: ~let's call it MUL.MASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL~. ~Perfect! How true that my name is Hammurabi!~ Paul answered with a steady gaze and without blinking, as the producer picked up the phone to call for help. MUL.MASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL is not only an absurd name, but also an original and well-constructed puzzle game The evolution of Pong It may not seem like it, but having direct control of two asymmetrical bar lines, each with different characteristics, is enough to revolutionize the idea of Pong, a concept as old as the video game itself. MUL.MASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL is entirely built on this variable, which triggers several others, which looks like the evolution of the famous game of skill with a bouncing ball from 1972. More than keeping the ball in play , in this case you have to try to hit the elements on the screen before they disappear, and for this it becomes essential not to lose the ball and learn to exploit the various power-ups even in a combined way between the two bars, which can use a different one at the same time to each. Everything therefore becomes a challenge in which timing and reflexes are fundamental, but also a certain strategic approach has its importance, with the correct choice of the bars to be used with the relative special powers (energy recharge, harpoon, precision shooting and many others) and the ability to buy bonuses with the money earned by knocking down creatures, including speed changes for the ball and additional energy. If the marine beings leave the screen without being knocked down, they consume the player's health, therefore everything is played on the elimination of these, an aim which includes the need to keep the ball in play in order not to waste time and possibly the ability to keep up to three active balls on the screen in order to maximize damage. With each game over, the game starts from scratch, even if the random conformation of the levels makes the experience always different. With a rather questionable choice, even with each new restart of the game you will still have to start everything over, even simply for temporarily exiting the application. This continuous return to the beginning, despite being very classic, resets the sense of progression, and the fact of losing everything at Game Over basically forces you to always start from scratch, which in the long run damages longevity. Luckily, the aesthetics of MUL.MASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL, with atmospheric audio and entirely hand-drawn and animated graphics, always make the gaming experience feel like some kind of strange dream journey, and this fascination helps fuel the flightThere's a desire to return to the game regardless of the lack of progress made, but certainly the developers have done little to ward off frustration from taking over.", "date": "2017-03-09", "grade": "8.0"}
