{"name": "Super Hind - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-hind-recensione.html", "text": "The theme of the ~super combat vehicle~ is not new to the world of videogames, on balance it is a simple variation from the classic ~alone against all~ which for years has monopolized the shoot'em-up scene (and not only). In Super Hind, the vehicle in question is a helicopter created by the Consortium, an economic and military superpower born from the alliance of several industrialized nations, and is used in the war against some rebel factions. The pilot is officer Dante Griffin, a loyal soldier but with moral principles... who at a certain point in history will be faced with an important choice, capable of changing the tide of the conflict. In flight! Super Hind has a single game mode, which sees us face a good number of stages full of enemies to kill. The plot unfolds during some purely textual interlude sequences, translated into Italian, without any decision being able to be taken that could influence its development: we will simply have to do what is indicated to us at the beginning of each level, paying attention to the updating of the goals. In this sense, the structure of the title developed by Mountain Sheep is very reminiscent of the various Ace Combats: you start, identify the targets and eliminate them. The similarities with the Namco series end here, however, given that the action in Super Hind is extremely limited: our helicopter moves through the use of the analog stick, with the back buttons used to move sideways, and to fight it has at your disposal a machine gun (X button), rockets (Square button) and homing missiles (Triangle button to lock on the target, Circle to fire). The point is that the offensive possibilities remain the same for the duration of the game, without any possibility of enhancement and without any variation. The management of the vehicle itself suffers from serious shortcomings, given that it is not possible to control the altitude: the vehicle moves automatically in the event of obstacles, eliminating the possibility of collisions with the setting, and does not have thrusters to increase speed. Ammunition is infinite, as is fuel, so the strategic element is also missing. Past glories Although there have been numerous helicopters featured in games previously, it is with Desert Strike that the theme of military vehicles begins to enjoy an important consideration in the videogame field. Made by Electronic Arts in 1992, this particular strategic shoot'em-up conquered the owners of Amiga, MegaDrive and Super Nintendo before being converted for PC too. The series produced two sequels with the same setting but with different settings (Jungle Strike and Urban Strike), only to get lost a bit with the transition to 32-bit systems. The last title of the saga, Nuclear Strike, dates back to 1997. Game structure The only level of difficulty takes care of holding up the barrack, which turns out to be too high if we decide to throw ourselves headlong into the fray: the energy bar regenerates if we are not hit, but avoid enemy fire in the middle of the action it's practically impossible, so you run into ~game over~ rather quickly. To remedy the problem, the only solution lies in the classic ~hit and run~, or in the simple division of objectives: you approach the agglomeration of hostile vehicles and stop when only one of them moves to face us. In practice, firefights depend a lot on our ability to avoid shots, using the back buttons to go around the target while we fill it with rockets and missiles (the machine gun can also be ignored that it exists, since its effectiveness is practically nothing), and in some cases we will be able to recover from a disadvantageous situation by making a ~zigzag~ escape, long enough to recover the lost energy. Our helicopter makes no distinction between ground vehicles, helicopters, planes and ships: it locks onto any target within range, allowing us to focus on the most dangerous enemies by pressing the Triangle button, assigned to lock. The structure of the stages is always very similar, but their length increases considerably as the story progresses, with a dense and continuous use of reinforcements by the opposing troops. At the end of each mission, we will be awarded a score that takes into account the number of units destroyed. In the event of a momentary ~game over~, we will always have the possibility to resume the action from the last checkpoint... Technical realization The graphics of Super Hind, unfortunately, leave something to be desired both in terms of quantity and quality. You have to play using a visuale really bizarre, which sees our helicopter off-center with respect to the screen, on the right, while an indicator shows us the viewfinder in the center (useless, on balance) ... and it is not possible to change it. Our vehicle boasts a decent build, and both allied and enemy vehicles are more or less on the same level. Furthermore, the outcome of the most important fights is captured in slow motion, in a sort of spectacular ~bullet time~. The locations have a long series of defects: first of all they are desolate, devoid of detail (it is no coincidence that we often fight on the sea or on desert plains), with enemies on the ground who can only be distinguished thanks to the coupling of our viewfinder and a large number of glitches in polygon rendering, with too many ~penetrations~. The action is accompanied by a series of well-made music, with an ~epic~ atmosphere, which however does not match up to sound effects, indeed it almost seems that our clashes do not produce noise. Comment The conditions for making a good action game were all there, yet Super Hind turns out to be a mediocre, severely limited product. Beyond a barely sufficient technical achievement, very far from the good things we've seen so far on PSP, the game involves only the degree of challenge of the various missions, but does nothing to make the action more varied: the weapons they are always the same (moreover made lousy in practice), they cannot be enhanced or modified in any way, and the control of the helicopter is really too simplistic. You could make the flight phase more spectacular just by adding a speed regulator, you could create rescue missions including landing in the possible maneuvers, and you could act on collisions to avoid making the scenario so damn ~fake~. . In short, much more could have been done to make Super Hind a rich and fun title: unless you are a helicopter fanatic, there is much better out there. Pros Good number of stages Interesting background story A challenging challenge... Cons ...but too flat and repetitive Technically mediocre Very limited gameplay", "date": "2008-09-08", "grade": null}
