The twin brothers Marc and Xavi, members of that group, then left it by founding the software house Alike Studio; their first title is this Love You to Bits, which clearly recalls the Tiny Thief formula, however choosing a totally different setting. Love You to Bits is an overall successful product, which manages to convince from every point of view Everyone says... In fact, Love You to Bits has as its protagonist a space explorer, Kosmo, who is busy visiting a whole series of planets to find the pieces of his robot girlfriend Nova, destroyed by an explosion, and thus be able to put her back together. Each planet represents a level, completely different from the previous one in terms of appearance and often also for the mechanics of the puzzles offered, and within which a Nova component is hidden to be recovered. The functioning of the game is very simple and immediate: the passage of Kosmo over an object with which it can interact is highlighted by the appearance of an icon, which, if touched, activates the relative action. In all cases, the progression within the levels is linked to the execution of an event which then allows you to carry out the next one and so on, with a formula that is therefore very linear and limited but not cloying for this: Love You to Bits is a light title, almost naive, but it is a precise choice that is expressed both in the gameplay and in the graphic component. In such a situation, one inevitably finds oneself stimulated to continue, both to face the various and amusing skits that Kosmo finds himself experiencing, and for the simple immediate pleasure of solving the puzzles. The latter, while never shining for a particular inventiveness, almost always manage to be balanced and calibrated to fulfill exactly the purpose of committing for a few minutes, the time necessary to reach the conclusion of a level. Certainly there are some missteps, to be translated into less understandable puzzles or in which the logic is too much manipulated, but in principle the work of 5 Ants can be considered more than satisfactory. On the other hand, the artistic direction is excellent, which manages to convince above all for the variety in the representation of the individual areas, each truly different from the other. A large part of the incentive to continue the adventure lies in fact in the curiosity to find out how the next planet will be made, and above all which quotation will distinguish it. In fact, there are explicit references to Monument Valley, Badland, Framed but also Star Wars and The Legend of Zelda, reworked in an often amusing and intelligent way. In addition to this, Love You to Bits also demonstrates particular care in the development of the characters, characterized in a fully successful way not only for the simple aesthetic aspect but also for the attempt to give them depth, so as to create a certain affection on the part of the player . The most direct example in this sense refers to the memories linked to the recovered objects: in fact, each of them can be examined, thus activating short films in which the happy moments experienced by the couple in relation to that precise object are represented. It is a completely accessory addition, but which helps to give a more concrete meaning to the sweet and at times exciting story told. In this sense, the soundtrack is also excellent, effective and fully spot on. Last note on the price of  3.99, a figure in our opinion justified and which guarantees the total absence of in-app purchases.", "date": "2016-03-22", "grade": "8.0"}
