{"name": "Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-or-alive-xtreme-beach-volleyball-3.html", "text": "That's all? At all. Volleyball is just a pretext, DoAX is actually a perfect virtual vacation simulator, which draws liberally as a concept from the classic dating games so loved by Japanese gamers as they are snubbed and ignored here. You choose a character, all girls already seen in DoA3 plus the new entry Lisa, and you leave for a fifteen-day vacation on the exotic Zack Island. The aim of the game is mainly to have fun, earning money, shopping wildly, visiting various locations, interacting with the other tenants of the island and, why not, playing a volleyball game from time to time. The days are divided into four periods (morning, afternoon, evening, night), during which we can choose to perform a single action or to go to a single place on the island, selecting it from a special map: you go to the swimming pool, we sunbathe, jump on the mattresses, chat and try to convince the other kind ladies, with expensive gifts, to partner with us and accompany us. Depending on the time of day and the place where we are, our character will participate in various skits, revealing details of his private life and performing various actions: in this case, an excellent virtual camera management system will allow us to manage the 'framing of the scene and to zoom in on the, ahem, most interesting 'details'... At night everyone at the virtual casino, where you can increase your financial resources by playing Black Jack, Poker, at the Roulette table or at various Slot Machines. With the sole purpose of amassing enough money to be able to buy and collect the multitude of objects with which to dress up our virtual dolls: hats, costumes, shoes, hair clips, accessories of all kinds and even nail polish and sun lotion for get a tan. Fun? Well, this is very, very subjective and directly depends on your love for the DoA series Perfect curves... From a technical point of view, the Tecmo title once again showcases the mighty muscles of the Xbox. The graphics engine is prodigious, with highly detailed characters and environments and a frame rate that is always firmly anchored at 60fps. The expenditure of polygons is great to best reproduce the digital curves, almost perfect, of the protagonists of the game, the animations are excellent and very fluid. The only defects, just wanting to be maniacally picky, are to be found in a couple of textures that are not up to detail and in the lack of transition animations during volleyball matches, with the result that the transition from one position to another some female players are a little too abrupt. The rich, predominantly pop soundtrack ranges from Christina Aguilera to Bob Marley via the Spice Girls and will not fail to satisfy fans of the genre. The selection is spot on and fits perfectly with the spirit of the game but, should you not be to your liking, the ability to rip and use your favorite music tracks has obviously been included. Comment DoA Xtreme Beach Volleyball must be seen, and judged, for what it is and for what it offers. It is a divertissment aimed mainly at the fanatical adorers of the Dead or Alive series and its buxom female protagonists. It is a classic 'dating game', the kind that drive Japanese players crazy so much, seasoned with a good number of more or less entertaining minigames and with a volleyball section that is too limited to be offered as a game in itself. Certainly the fans will love it, galvanized by the possibility of collecting a large number of objects and interacting, influencing, spying on the life of their favorites. The others will soon get tired of collecting costumes and nail polish. Forewarned Pros: Excellent graphic impact Original game structure Good soundtrack Cons: The volleyball part is excessively lacking Extremely repetitive and limited Aimed above all at fans of the series The presentation is enough to fully understand the spirit of Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball: a succession of scenes that portray the protagonists of the game, the beautiful female wrestlers made famous by the DoA series, intent on having fun in the most disparate ways, very scantily dressed and with constantly winking look at the camera. They dance, have fun in the sea and in the pool, go skating. And they don't even play volleyball for a moment. Oh yeah, don't let the title fool you: DoA X is not a volleyball simulation. It's not even a volleyball game, nor does it want to be. The volleyball part in the Tecmo title is littlemore than a minigame, simplistic and with questionable design choices. It is funny? Certain. But it's also very, very limited. The fast and spectacular action is controlled not only by the analog stick with which to move our digital alter ego, but also by the use of only two keys: one to pass/lift the ball to our teammate, the other to send it to the opponent's camp. A choice that can be shared in itself, if only that the games are reduced to a random keystroke in an attempt to combine something. The perspective adopted makes it extremely difficult to establish the exact position of the ball in relation to the ground and the camera, whose position cannot be manually set by the player, often gives us unhappy shots that tend to make the gameplay even more confusing. Also our computer-controlled teammate tends to be a bit too independent: you want her to pick you up and she dunks, even from mid-court and from impossible distances, she's in the best position to receive and just stands there staring at the ball fall inexorably one meter from his feet. With the result that it is almost impossible to be able to set up any effective offensive / defensive strategy. To conclude, despite the fact that an Exhibition game mode has been included, Team Ninja has not bothered, and we really don't understand why, to introduce a four-player mode.", "date": "2003-02-01", "grade": null}
