Just take any episode of Inspector Rex, replace that harmless German shepherd with a rabid and unfriendly wolfdog, add a vulgar and murderous master and add a lot of blood and profanity. While we're at it, everything can be set at night, never mind that the game may seem too cheerful. In short, very little has changed since 2002: agent Slate has remained the same violent and incorrect detective of the past, with some new scars and a much more colorful vocabulary, while his trusty police dog Shadow has learned to earn his bowl of kibble using fangs and claws. Like Arthas and the dark Frostmourne, or like War and his steed Ruin, the empathy between the anti-hero and his companion is the starting point of the entire adventure. The game was born with the clear objective of relaunching the Namco Bandai action series: same characters from the first chapter and same dark colors. The plot has been reworked, although there are several references and points in common with the past: Jack Slate is an aggressive police officer, who prefers a shootout or a healthy fist fight to a more diplomatic approach. What at first seems like an elaborate terrorist attack soon turns out to be something bigger and more mysterious, as the death of a loved one sends the protagonist on a desperate hunt for his assassins. Unmistakable inspirations Already from the premise it is therefore evident how this chapter inherits the declared inspiration from Max Payne from the first Dead to Rights, without however being able to get close to that thickness that characterized the plot and the characters of the Remedy game. Much of the story is told in flashback form, and about two-thirds of the time the player will be experiencing Slate's most recent memories. Too bad that the incipit is so confused and cryptic that it doesn't allow you to immediately identify with the protagonist: why is he there? Why is it in that condition? Who is it that is chasing him? These are all questions that are asked in the first minutes of the game, but which will only be answered in a somewhat awkward way towards the end of the adventure. As in the previous chapters, a lot of emphasis is given to hand-to-hand combat: Jack can alternate between dodging, quick punches and more powerful blows, while it is possible to create devastating combinations through sudden keystrokes. However, despite a huge list of moves available, the player will tend to memorize a few, and then repeat them incessantly throughout the game. Jack can also grab opponents, disarm them and take them hostage, while a QTE system allows for spectacular and ruthless final blows. Once again it is possible to face enemies in close firefights, but the developers have decided to abandon the now obsolete aiming system of the first episodes in favor of a solution that gives a nod to Gears of War and its much-imitated cover mechanism. However, the guys at Volatile Games have been careful to preserve that bullet time which, once again taking inspiration from Max Payne, has always been a distinctive element of the series. Despite everything, although it is possible to disarm opponents and use their own weapons, the game often encourages an approach made of stealth tactics and hand-to-hand combat. Xbox 360 goals As to be expected, Retribution is quite generous to the player, allowing him to quickly unlock a good amount of achievements. There are 60 in all, and most of them will simply require you to continue the adventure, kill a certain number of enemies or do it using particular techniques. Man's best friend Dead to Rights: Retribution, it must be said, would be an anonymous and banal action shooter if it weren't for the possibility of interacting with Shadow. Using the directional cross it is in fact possible to give various orders to the furry companion, in a very similar way to what is already seen in tactical team shooters: he can follow us, remain stationary in one position or attack a distant enemy, while in case they seriously injure him can revive by going near him. Sporadically, the game gives the possibility to impersonate Shadow, perhaps to protect Jack or to secretly infiltrate inaccessible areas. His attacks are devastating, but his particular abilities push the player to deal with enemies in a stealthy way, as the dog can sneak around, bark to attract attention and attack by surprise. Furthermore, by pressing the left trigger of the pad, Shadow is able to sniffre the smell of people and perceive their heartbeat, in such a way that you can easily locate them even through walls or from long distances. Unfortunately, although these moments add a little variety to an unoriginal formula, they are not enough to remedy what is the most evident defect of Retribution: a fixed pattern, made up of narrow corridors and rooms full of enemies to be killed, makes the extremely linear and repetitive game. Over the ten hours required to finish the adventure, it will often happen that you have to fight some mini-bosses, which however are nothing special, since they are mostly common enemies with slightly tougher skin. Technically we are faced with an inglorious and infamous product with sometimes interesting and well-made environments alongside fluctuating and very unnatural character models. The player will be able to freely tackle the game by selecting one of the three difficulty levels, but this does not seem to have a tangible effect on the AI of the enemies who, in the middle of a shootout, can stop to tie their shoes. However, we must admit that it is hilarious to see opponents flee when chased by Shadow, or target the four-legged friend using even rocket launchers and hand grenades. The absence of any multiplayer component is felt a lot, and certainly does not help to relieve Retribution from the flatness that afflicts it. It's really a shame that, having everything already available, the development team hasn't committed to making a cooperative mode between Jack and Shadow.", "date": "2010-05-17", "grade": "6.0"}
