The truth is that we had underestimated him, welcomed with that mocking smile that many of you will do, in front of the usual unconventional simulator. Instead, in recent years House Flipper has transformed from a weird handyman simulator into a well-structured and rather satisfying experience. The proof is in the number of additional content released in the last two years: there's the one dedicated to luxurious homes, pets, gardening and farms, and probably the offer won't end there. House Flipper is a success, more than two million copies on PC alone, with the best expansions even selling over 500,000 copies. Not bad for a team of ten people... Seeing is believing House Flipper: rethinking an apartment from scratch isn't as easy as it seems, but it's very satisfying The success of House Flipper is unexpected for a similar project, but it can be understood if you finally put aside your prejudices and start the game. House Flipper has its own structure that is as simple as it is well thought out, which infuses the game with a characteristic that is only found in the best simulators: it makes you believe it. When you finish tinkering with the bathroom fixtures in a house, the sun sets and you decide to go back to the office, you are now totally immersed in a new lifestyle. And maybe, while the game loads the change of setting, you even start thinking about things like ~for that villa, is it better to have an American-style kitchen in cherry wood, or an open space with a kitchenette?~. It also happens that after about ten hours with House Flipper you start to feel a little disgusting by yourself, thinking that you could really have done all these jobs; but we're talking about a good game and a good game can also give you hope that sooner or later you'll really be able to transform your closet into a three-room apartment with a swimming pool. Then you try again, and you play it again one, two, five more hours. Because House Flipper is relaxing like all similar games, plus it requires a consistent dose of creativity and this is always nice, especially in these times when with one click you can show your very personal work to an entire community. But House Flipper's career doesn't start off like a rocket: at the beginning your office is a shack flayed by time and you can only take on small jobs. You're not even that good, both you as a player and your character, limited by skills yet to be defined with experience. You therefore have to be content with cleaning houses and doing some minor work, but after the necessary running-in we will be offered increasingly complex objectives until all the mechanics of House Flipper have been revealed. This typically happens when we finally have enough money to start taking a look at the real estate market. Buy, renovate and resell House Flipper: we will be able to buy ever larger houses, renovate them and resell them by choosing the best buyer Work on behalf of third parties is useful and profitable, but there's nothing better than buying a shack, completely refurbishing it, and then reselling it with a 100% increase in price. And this is the real fulcrum of the game which will still remain linked to its basic mechanics made up of many different building activities, simulated yes but in the name of simplicity: in House Flipper we can clean the dirt with the big broom, suck up cockroaches with the vacuum cleaner, make beds, clean windows, brush new plaster, put tiles or parquet, wallpaper or panels, decide where to insert doors and windows, knock down and put up walls, furnish and light, install bathroom fixtures and heaters and power outlets. In short, inside the house you can really indulge yourself as probably hasn't happened since the last The Sims, even if here the view is entirely in first person, the jobs must actually be carried out and you don't interact with any other character except the possible buyers of a house, or families with different needs to satisfy. Craving for DLC House Flipper: Once everything is in place, it's time to decorate The first jobs will be more tedious than the later ones because our skills will be at zero. By carrying out the various jobs, however, we will accumulate experience points which we can then spend on various skills designed above all, but not only, to speed up the work. For example: at the beginning we will only be able to paint one row of bricks at a time, by spending experience points instead we will be able to triple the rows of bricks and decrease the amount of wasted paint. The more we play, the more House Flipper will shift the focus from real work, repetitive and lacking skill tests, towards a truly astonishing creative freedom. It's an exponential growth that, if you like what House Flipper offers, will keep you hooked for some time; certainly enough to repay the investment made to buy it. Indeed, it will be really hard to resist the temptation not to buy at least the expansion dedicated to gardening, the perfect complement to the base game. Many houses, few furniture House Flipper: Turning a shack into such a house is one of the big goals of this game Several new missions have been added in recent years, and there are now more than enough houses to buy and sell (some linked to extraordinary easter eggs). In its basic version, however, House Flipper is rather stingy with furniture, many more would be needed but above all in different styles. From this point of view, a certain closure to mods which naturally serves to ensure that the DLCs make sense does not help; on the contrary, it is the quality of the DLC that should stand out compared to what the community offers. It would also be nice to see licensed furniture, a partnership with IKEA would make perfect sense and make House Flipper much more realistic, but they're really off the charts for a small software house like this. From the point of view of the instrumentation, the same could be said: Teccpo, Black&Decker, Bosch! Better tools for better results, but perhaps for this we should wait for a sequel... and we can't wait.", "date": "2022-07-14", "grade": "7.6"}
