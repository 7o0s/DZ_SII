The aim of the four available campaigns is always the same: to dominate the trade routes with India by annihilating competitors or conquering all the cities of Gandhi's nation; what changes are the difficulty, the initial conditions and the missions that are assigned from time to time. Never as in this case is it possible to say that between saying and doing there is the sea (a lot of sea) and that the cat continues to go to lard even if she has lost four paws (it's hot, try to figure it out). So all that remains is to embark and leave, preparing to circumnavigate Africa and say hello to the pirates of Madagascar, to finally get to buy the precious oriental spices that are so popular in the old continent. Before starting to play seriously, it is advisable to follow the tutorial which explains the various functions of the interface in detail. East India Company is divided into three main sections: the interior view of port cities, where you can buy and sell goods and, in the case of a player-controlled city, where you can build more ships for your fleet and infrastructure to improve your defenses and productivity; the three-dimensional map of the world, which goes from Europe to India, on which it is possible to set the route of the fleets, see the peculiar goods sold in the different cities and observe the ships in motion; finally there is naval combat, with the possibility of managing the fleet as in a real-time strategy game, or of directly taking control of one of the ships. The importance of the Suez Canal The first thing you learn playing East India Company is the turning point that occurred with the excavation of the Suez Canal, given the time it takes for the boats to reach India having to go around Africa. But no more geopolitical nonsense and let's get to the game. The beginnings are really very slow, so slow that in the first few hours you feel like giving up everything. With few ships and little cash on hand, it takes time to start getting some monetary satisfaction. The first missions that are assigned to us act as a supplement to the tutorial and allow you to familiarize yourself with the fundamental actions to be taken to get rich: trade and conquer. Thus, after having brought goods to India, we will be lent a fleet to conquer the first non-European city (unfortunately the battles against the settlements are automatic). The main quests are all very similar and usually involve importing exotic goods such as silk, spices, tea, and so on. As the company grows and the fleet grows, so will the amount of goods to be imported. Alongside the main missions, some secondary ones will be assigned, which can be accepted or rejected. Also in this case there are mission models that repeat themselves randomly and, for example, we will be asked to sink a pirate fleet or to bring a message to a given city. Reload the cannons! Each fleet can consist of one to five ships, for a maximum of twenty fleets. Each of them has its own commander, who gains experience points by fighting. Each level allows you to assign one or more skills that give different advantages, such as bonuses in battle or bonuses in trade. Skills can be active or passive: passive ones are always in effect, while active ones are used during battles. To enter into conflict with an enemy fleet you have to attack or be attacked (proud of the obvious, you help us) and select direct combat (it is also possible to let the CPU determine the outcome of the clash). The clashes are rather slow and require a certain amount of practice, but once learned it is better to dedicate oneself personally to the art of war because the automatic system has the tendency to favor the adversaries, even in case of a clear advantage (we happened to see a fleet of five galleons annihilated by a single galleon). East India Company is a radical title that makes no compromises. This means that the game mechanics are all aimed at perfectly simulating the trading system of the 1600s, but also that, apart from trading and fighting, no element has been included that can give it a minimum of variety. The missions are all very similar and require in most cases to go from point A to point B, while having to carry thousands of tons of goods from one end of the world to the other soon becomes routine and risks shutting down quicklythe interest. The fights themselves, pleasant in the early stages, can be boring, above all due to a deficient artificial intelligence, which behaves in a rather absurd way. That said, we can say we are dealing with a profound product that will not fail to thrill the most thoughtful players and lovers of complexity. East India Company is not for everyone and for this very reason it is necessary to carefully evaluate the purchase, taking into account the general slowness and the underlying hostile nature of the main brand.", "date": "2009-08-25", "grade": "7.4"}
