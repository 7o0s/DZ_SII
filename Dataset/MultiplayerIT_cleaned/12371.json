{"name": "flOw - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flow-recensione.html", "text": "streams Flow of liquids, flow of time and evolutionary flow, everything seems to perfectly describe what flOw represents: an ocean represented on vertical levels in which six species of single-celled beings evolve until they transform into their final, perfect form. The transformation will take place simply by letting yourself be carried away by the sea current, on notes with a new age flavor, moving your marine animal with large and fluid movements of the sixaxis; in addition to using the motion sensor, the player will be allowed to use any of the keys on the pad to harness the special power of the animal at his command. The levels are represented by how the word indicates, by real deep sea levels in which one can dive using a particular sphere of light equipped with a red arrow; given the intention with which the project behind flOw was born, namely that of leaving total freedom of exploration and growth within the proposed setting, the player will also be given the opportunity to go back to the levels already visited to discover a new, further, prey from which to draw nourishment for growth. The actual levels will be nothing but large, totally empty spaces (it is assumed that the sea looks like this) in which there will be a series of other creatures in possession of important bonuses useful for the growth of the creature. As the sea level drops, the animal will evolve so as to be able to face increasingly imposing and aggressive opponents. The single-celled beings will not all be selectable from the start, and it will be absolutely necessary to ~explore~ all the levels of each one to be able to hatch the egg of the next one. The first being on the evolution list will be represented by a kind of snake with the ability to significantly increase its speed to be able to reach the most elusive enemies. After the snake it will be the turn of the jellyfish, able to whirl around and attract the most incautious and small preys to itself. The manta is the biggest and fastest being in the game, the Rogue will allow players to become invisible and attack from behind their opponents, the Hunter will have the ability to attack with quick shots directly to the vital points of his enemies and finally the snake of the end credits, much less ~complex~ than the first but decidedly more developed in terms of length (as well as the only one that will not find itself within levels inhabited by enemy creatures). In addition to being able to boast four more creatures than the free downloadable version from thatgamecompany's website, the PS3 version takes full advantage of 1080p, offers a series of bonuses capable of making the creature temporarily faster and more lethal, and above all gives the possibility four players to experience flOw together. The game itself has no other pretensions and probably doesn't even deserve to be labeled as a ~game~, but rather as digital entertainment with a strong visual and sound component. For those who expected to find a solid video game for only 4.99 euros, perhaps it is better to look elsewhere. For all those who want to experience a different way - almost parallel - to the classic video game, then they will probably find flOw a decidedly short but extremely intense product. Pros: Visually stunning Definitely original Low price Cons: It's not a game, it's more of an experience Too short When Jenova Chen, a student at the University of Southern California and specializing in Interactive Media, created flOw for her degree thesis, everything she could have imagined except the very vast success that her application (based on the flash language) would have had within a few months . And even when thatgamecompany's website was launched (monicker behind which Chen was hiding together with some of his classmates) and when the game reached 600,000 downloads, still nothing could foreshadow Sony's interest in using flOw as a of the flagship titles of its Playstation Store for PS3. The project, which passed through the hands of SCEA Santa Monica, was adapted to the reference platform, increasing the resolution and scope of the project, in order to make its purchase more plausible. On 30 March flOw finally landed on the old continent: for just 4.99 euros you have the opportunity to hold in your hands the evolution of a series of small marine creatures.", "date": "2007-04-10", "grade": null}
