{"name": "Un blob per amico", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/91355-blobster-un-blob-per-amico.html", "text": "A lot of time has passed since 1958, the year in which Steve McQueen opposed the monstrous gelatinous mass called precisely ~The Blob~, capable of dissolving everything or person who was in its unstoppable path. As with all classic movie monsters, even those with a decent literary background, the ~blob~ has been reinterpreted over the years and on more than one occasion a nice and positive image has been painted; just think of the recent feature film ~Monsters vs. Aliens~ or, in videogame terms, the remake of A Boy and his Blob and the two episodes of the colorful de Blob. Well, the Divine Robot team and the publisher Chillingo have decided to bring the ~blob~ to the iOS platform as well, with a nice and well-crafted action platform. In Blobster we will therefore find ourselves controlling a sentient gelatinous mass, capable of increasing its size by incorporating certain elements, as well as making jumps by exploiting its elastic capabilities. The game offers us a main mode consisting of forty levels (plus bonus ones), divided into four different areas, plus a survival mode that is unlocked when we have completed 75% of the stages. There is no shortage of extras, represented by a series of achievements that are obtained by accessing the social component, provided by the integration with Crystal. The ball bounces Blobster's control system can work via touch screen or through a combination with the accelerometer. In the first case, the character moves left or right by touching the edges of the screen, therefore without the use of icons, while to jump you have to touch the blob, drag it as if it were a slingshot and then release: a solution very similar to that seen in Angry Birds, a title that the Divine Robot production pays homage to on more than one occasion, as we will tell later. The accelerometer controls simply replace the left/right commands with the tilt of the device, but it takes a few minutes to understand that this is a less precise option than touch. In fact, with the default controls it is possible to move the character quickly, with immediate reactions, and the icing on the cake could be represented by an ~absolute~ drag on the touch screen to jump instead of having to touch the blob to be able to do it: let's hope for an update that adds this possibility, because the experience would gain a lot. As mentioned above, the goal of the game is to lead the character to the exit in each of the available levels trying, along the way, to collect all the objects present in the stage (which will affect the completion percentage of the same). . Some of the objects allow our blob to increase in size and, consequently, to take larger leaps. There are also power-ups, such as the one that allows us to jump much higher than normal or the barrier that can eliminate enemies with a single touch. However, the level design provides for the non-use of these upgrades, thus protecting us from the impossibility of proceeding if we have not taken advantage of a special power in time. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of obstacles to be broken down clearly recalls the dynamics of the aforementioned Angry Birds. The variations on the theme, in general, are numerous and keep the action engaging as you progress through the various levels. Finally, the colorful graphics, characterized by a very nice design, also make Blobster pleasant to look at.
