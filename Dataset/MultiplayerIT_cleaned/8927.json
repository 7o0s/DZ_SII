{"name": "Giardinieri cosmici", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/95371-eufloria-giardinieri-cosmici.html", "text": "RTS (Real Time Strategy) is a very particular genre that by now we could almost define as ~niche~, widespread above all in the PC market with sporadic appearances also on consoles. It is a videogame genre that requires calm, reflection and patience; we could almost say that it hardly succeeds in making converts in a period like the current one, so hectic and changing, in which the more modern user seems to embrace above all the more fleeting and intense experiences, a preference probably born of these unstable and confused times. Like it or not, it is still impossible not to be fascinated by a genre that entrusts the player with real ecosystems in a reduced format, in which a wrong decision or a moment of hesitation is enough to screw up the efforts of a 'Now. We said, RTS are not for everyone and perhaps this is why Eufloria is such a particular game, as it tries to please everyone. But sometimes, you know, compromises can be more harmful than beneficial... The Tree of Discord Have you ever heard of Freeman Dyson? This British physicist and mathematician, a few decades ago, formulated a theory according to which a hypothetical artificial plant capable of growing on a comet could produce a breathable atmosphere by exploiting solar energy and the elements of the comet itself, providing humans a potential ideal habitat. We are talking about real science fiction, of course, and Dyson's idea is so imaginative and incredible that it is really curious that the developers Alex May, Rudolf Kremers and Brian Grainge have chosen it as the basic concept for Eufloria. You see, in this very special RTS the player doesn't have to produce various types of units to send into battle, since there is only one and that's enough, and this is the first substantial difference between Eufloria and the competition, or rather a starting point of disarming simplicity. The player's goal is simple: starting from a single asteroid, on which our Dyson tree is planted, it is necessary to conquer all the others by expanding your own control through the seeds that will silently float from one asteroid to another. Once the seeds take root, they will produce other trees, which will form the defense of the asteroid and will in turn produce more seeds. Each asteroid is characterized by some parameters such as speed and resistance that will influence the effectiveness of the seeds generated on it, in this way the player can counter the opponent, or an expanding ecosystem formed in turn by trees and seeds. Of course the mechanics get a little more complicated as you progress in the game but the essence of Eufloria is basically this: you have to conquer the most powerful asteroid, in terms of statistics, and from there extend your influence over the other asteroids, crushing the enemy forces. However, this apparently simple mission is mainly hindered by the game-design itself, as the arrangement of the asteroids in each stage is randomly generated: this means that on certain occasions our task will be greatly facilitated, on others instead we could find ourselves in a situation without which will force us to restart the game in hopes of loading an easier or more convenient layout. Playstation 3 trophies Eufloria offers nineteen Bronze Trophies and one Silver Trophy, many of which are actually quite simple to obtain because they involve actions that are almost mandatory to progress in the game such as, for example, defeating a certain amount of enemies or simply completing countryside. Others instead require the execution of more reasoned and complex strategies. Space for ideas It is clear that this ingenious gimmick of the developers also has a downside, no laughing matter: if it is true that the randomness of the layouts of each stage definitely increases the variety and unpredictability of the experience, on the other hand there is no shortage of stalemate situations that make the matches really frustrating, especially during the more advanced stages, when the difficulty level increases significantly and sometimes this curve undergoes an excessive surge due to the unfortunate arrangement of asteroids and enemy units. Eufloria, as we said, is an ambiguous game, which tries in every way to reconcile the depth of a real RTS with accessible and intuitive gameplay, unfortunately failing completely in its intent. The game system will certainly be satisfying for those who don't know much about the genre and represent an, we could say, ~entry level~ product in its context; on the other hand, seasoned RTS players will perhaps find it eOverly simplified and based on chance rather than skill. From this point of view the control system certainly does not help which, via joypad, is sometimes uncomfortable and imprecise, above all due to an interface that could certainly have been designed in a more appropriate way. After all, Eufloria was born on PC, and fortunately the developers must have remembered the difference in users because a very important feature has been added compared to the original version, namely the possibility of ~accelerating~ the progress of the game by pressing a key . Not infrequently, in fact, and above all precisely because of the random layouts we have already talked about, it happens that we literally sit on our hands waiting for our seeds to be produced and for them to reach their destination. This expectation soon becomes a bit hypnotic precisely because of the absolutely minimalist graphic and sound components: despite the science fiction premises, Eufloria is a game with an almost ethereal, evanescent appearance, based on long-limbed sprites, soft colors and extremely fluid animations. The delicate and convincing visual rendering is combined with an equally simple and alien soundtrack, spot on but discreetly repetitive. Even from a technical point of view, in short, Eufloria reconfirms itself as a product that is not exactly suitable for everyone.", "date": "2011-11-18", "grade": "6.5"}
