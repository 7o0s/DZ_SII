For this reason, NHL 2K9 takes many elements from the basketball series, starting from the spectacularization of the team, to arrive at the presentations and all that side dish that does not serve the purposes of the game itself but creates an engaging television atmosphere. Many secondary aspects have been definitely improved such as entering the playing field, now accompanied by videos and lights in full pomp, replays and highlights at the end of the game. The camera seems to be moved by a TV operator, with rash movements and related tremors, guaranteeing an even greater action effect than in previous years. For this reason, NHL 2K9 takes many elements from the basketball series, starting with making the team spectacular When the NHL meets the spectacularization of the NBA The controls have been made simpler and more immediate, a factor which in any case has not lost the usual depth of play that characterizes the 2K series. The double-button controls have been eliminated, effectively reducing the actions possible with the four front buttons and the backbones, eliminating superfluous actions. The ~Pro Stick Evolution~ mode is added to the simple mode, which moves the club controls to the right analog stick, and finally a hybrid that combines the simplicity of the first with the use of the analog of the second. Control is done using both sticks. The selected player moves with the left, while the right simulates the stick: press forward to shoot, backward to charge, right and left to move the puck on the ice, feint and dribble the opponents, all in a very natural and simple. All together is more beautiful In a perfectly consistent way with what has been said so far, the developers have further increased the game speed, which in the 2K9 edition is extremely frenetic and breathless. If you are looking for a real simulation, you are on the wrong track: real ice hockey is decidedly slower, while maintaining its frenetic rhythms. An acceleration does not necessarily mean that the game has gotten worse: the intention is to make it even more fun, while moving away from the canons of sporting verisimilitude. The result is convincing and Visual Concepts has managed to maintain a good feeling on the frozen field even with an extremely fast game action, all thanks to superlative and well related animations. This year the new motion capture sessions were performed, the technique that allows you to animate the movement of virtual athletes starting from the real ones, refreshing the NHL 2K library which has been recycling them for a few years now with almost 1400 new animations. The opposing CPU has been tweaked, and shows some aggressiveness even on the lowest difficulty setting. the developers have further increased the game speed, which in the 2K9 edition is extremely frenetic and breathless I want to drive a Zamboni NHL 2k9 offers hours and hours of entertainment, thanks to its very deep franchise mode and online possibilities, but those who want to find other diversions will be able to find bread for their teeth. A three-on-three player mini-game has been inserted in a small frozen hockey field, a sort of simplified five-a-side football that is even faster and more frenetic. It is also possible to drive the famous Zamboni, an ice-making machine usually used in the major fields of the NHL, through a pleasant and amusing game. The technical sector, as 2K Games has always accustomed us, is of the highest level. The game runs without slowdowns or hitches with an almost miraculous fluidity, given the polygonal mass that the engine has to manage to display the field, athletes, stadium and the entire animated audience. Helmets, uniforms and objects are reproduced with great detail, great use of reflections, lights and well-designed and defined textures. seeing the initial menu appear for the first time on the notes of Linoleum gives an unexpected thrill I want to drive a Zamboni The only negative note are the faces of the players, which could be made with a greater number of triangles, more natural colors and at least human expressions. The zombie effect is around the corner. The soundtrack is purely punk-rock in style, featuring the likes of NOFX, Bad Religion, Offspring, Ramones, Mastodon, Operation Ivy and more. Seeing the initial menu appear for the first time on the notes of Linoleum gives certomThere is an unexpected thrill, but these are still songs from many years ago. Effects and sounds are good, and show a remarkable variety: depending on the pitch we are on we hear the personalized choruses that the audience uses to cheer on their team, and the effect of ~playing at home~ is felt with more powerful choirs and voices than the opponents. Comment NHL 2K9 returns entirely in the hands of the talented Visual Concepts, who decide this year to start from scratch by rewriting a large part of the game code, animations, AI and online. The results are visible, for better or for worse. The controls have been completely revised, simplified and improved. The CPU shows some unrealistic behavior due to its strong aggression, a factor that can be solved thanks to the superb Team-Up mode which allows a completely human challenge. Technical and audio compartment are ok, except for the faces of the players and a masterful soundtrack. For anyone looking for a close-knit Ice Hockey simulation, this year's 2K NHL may be too fast and frantic, which still allows it to keep its gameplay fresh and fun. As always. NHL 2K9 is a complete game, with a deep franchise mode, many online options, team-up and fun mini-games that will keep fans glued to their televisions for a long, long time. Pros Team-Up mode More immediate controls thanks to their simplification The game runs smoothly and fast Cons Some problems with the opponent's AI Faces of the players It will not appeal to lovers of pure simulations Xbox 360 goals As usual, NHL 2K9 also makes the canonical 1000 points available to the player to unlock. Most are obtained by progressing in certain parameters such as: goals, assists, penalties and victories. Others are unlocked by performing specific actions such as scoring a goal from beyond the blue line, beating a 2K staff member (almost impossible), or winning the stanley cup and championship. Other achievements, on the other hand, are immediately conquerable, such as the one literally given for personalizing your online avatar, or judging a game action shared via Xbox Live, or even voting for one of our teammates in the Team-Up mode. The tendency to double the scoring often leads to leaving some of our defenders unmarked on the second line, facilitating long shots and counter-attacks, which are now easier, always having a partner unmarked. At times, some rather strange behaviors of the opponents are noticed, such as standing in front of their own goal or next to the goalkeeper in scrums. The single player mode is well represented by the sports season, which culminates in the playoffs and league final. In addition to the presentations of the players, the possibility of celebrating winning the Stanley Cup in your own way has been included, via analog, take group photos with the team and many other goodies, which make the 2K NHL even more alive and exciting than usual . The heart of NHL 2K9, however, is certainly the multiplayer challenge, which finds its maximum competitive expression with the clash between human opponents, assisted by excellent network support with Xbox Live, where there are no symptoms of lag or slowdown , albeit with matches played overseas. There are ranked and custom matches, as well as a season mode. After creating your own personalized avatar, you can join one of the many tournaments available, each of which can host up to thirty players. The other novelty of this year is the Team-Up mode, in which it is possible to play matches in 6 against 6, each with their own position and role on the pitch. The 2K servers assign positive or negative scores depending on the outcome of the matches, placing us in a dynamic and competitive online ranking. It is also possible to share, download and vote on the highlights of your own and other users' actions.", "date": "2008-09-17", "grade": null}
