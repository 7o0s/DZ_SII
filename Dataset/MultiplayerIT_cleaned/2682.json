Get ready for blood, werewolves and lots of action in a game that unfortunately has nothing original to say. Here is our review of the PS5 version of Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood. Wolves defending Gaia Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood is based on the board game ~Werewolf: The Apocalypse~ by White Wolf and is part of the larger World of Darkness series (including Vampire: The Masquerade, Mage: The Ashension, Wraith: The Oblivion and Changeling: The Dreaming). The basics are therefore the same as in the original work. The Garou - werewolves - are defenders of Gaia, or the whole of creation. The universe is guided by three great forces/gods: the Wyld, creator and chaos, Weaver, order, and the Wyrm, a destructive force that must make room for the new. But humanity has grown and corrupted the Wyrm. We are Cahal, a Garou of the Fianna tribe, who with the help of his pack and some loyal humans tries to stop Endron, one of the largest multinationals that are corrupting and poisoning the world. It all begins when Cahal and a group of allies infiltrate one of the enemy bases: however, the mission goes wrong and our protagonist's wife is captured and killed. Cahal then gives in to the Fury and, after eliminating the one responsible for his wife's death, also kills an ally and wounds the leader of his own tribe. Upset by his actions and mourning, he decides to abandon the pack and his teenage daughter. Five years go by and Cahal discovers that his old pack is in danger: he decides to end his exile to help them. This is where the real plot of Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood starts. The whole plot, we don't want to get around it, is extremely obvious and repetitive. Cahal, for one reason or another, will have to infiltrate an Endron base every time to steal data or go after the classic ~super villain and unscrupulous CEO~. The missions always have the same structure, in a continuous radio question and answer between Cahal and his Q which is always a variant of ~go to the next room and connect to the terminal~. In the plot, theoretically striking events follow one another, including the deaths of Cahal's friends, betrayals of allies and kidnappings of family members. However, every highlight is poorly constructed, sudden and, above all, Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood always fails to create a bond between us and the characters. They will mostly be empty avatars, without a past or a personality. Old-gen to next-gen It certainly doesn't help the graphics. Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood is a mid-budget project that looks bad on PS4, let alone PS5. The lowest point is marked by the animations of the characters, both in terms of movements, comparable to those of mannequins, and in terms of facial expressions, which are simply absent. With the sole exception of the protagonist, who sometimes looks like a person, for the rest expect NPCs who move their mouths randomly and occasionally move their eyebrows, in an attempt to give expression to the face. Don't think that dubbing solves everything. Sadly, most of the dialogue is a pain to listen to - pretty soon you'll be hitting circle to fast forward, if not directly to skip the storyline. There is also a generous amount of written documents, including letters and emails, which add details here and there. Some of these are actually important and give access to information that influences some dialogues: not finding them, however, has no real impact on the understanding of the plot and does not cause the loss of content, it is just a different way to get to the end of a discussion. Despite being the protagonist of an action game, Gahal will in fact sometimes have to talk to enemies to try to resolve the situation in a peaceful and less chaotic way. However, these are drops in a sea of fisticuffs: don't expect Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood to suddenly become an RPG. The wolf loses its fur but continues to tear the bad guys to pieces Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood is a classic action game with a skill tree, unlockable through experience points. By completing missions, Cahal levels up and can upgrade his forms, learning new attacks and passive abilities, mostly related to combat. Precisely, the protagonist has three forms: the human one, used to speak in the few situations in which we are not attacked on sight, the lupine one, designed to move more quickly and be stealthy, and the Crinos one, or the dedicated werewolfto fights. With the sole exception of the tutorial and some advanced stages, the game gives us the possibility to choose our approach: we can in fact continue stealthily, eliminating enemies behind us without being seen, or we can transform ourselves and destroy everything and everyone. However, Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood is not a stealth game, mind you. It is a possibility, but in some cases it is practically impossible due to the huge number of enemies present in the areas that leave no blind spots. The truth is that, when you manage to pass a room without being seen, it is often because we have exploited the very limited artificial intelligence of the enemies. The arenas always have cameras, turrets and locked doors to be deactivated via a terminal and we have a few crossbow shots to shoot down enemies from a distance in secret: there is therefore an attempt to make the progression more varied, but playing stealthily does not bring any advantage . Whether you pass an area unseen or take down every opponent, there are no rewards. Experience points are awarded as you progress through the story, through a small group of forgettable side-quests, and through a series of collectibles scattered all over the place. But let's talk about the real core of Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood: the combat system. The werewolf has two combat formats: agile and strong. The agile one is weaker, but faster and above all accumulates Rage more quickly. Rage is used to activate skills, such as powerful attacks and healing. Apart from the latter, which is available in every format, the skills are different for the agile wolf and the strong wolf. Finally, there is Frenzy, a classic berserker mode where you are fast and powerful, but cannot use skills. There are also various combos, which can be activated with a mix of light and heavy attacks. A jump/slam attack and a classic dodge close the circle. Although on paper it is a layered system (albeit not very original), in practice we will not need to do anything but attack head on. Enemies vary from ~soldier with gun~ to ~soldier with gun but bigger~. In the second phase of the game, new opponents add up, but the situation gets worse because they attack hand-to-hand and each encounter becomes a bunch of identical enemies who hurl themselves at Cahal, ready to be mauled. Mostly you'll spend your time tapping square as fast as your fingers are able to, without paying too much attention to what's happening on the screen. Finally, we point out that the game does not take advantage of the DualSense functions in any way. Fortunately the frame rate is stable.", "date": "2021-02-04", "grade": "5.5"}
