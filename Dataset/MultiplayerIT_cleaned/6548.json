A project carried out by listening to the community of players, happy to participate with their advice in the creation of the final version, to which Ubisoft will continue to work, as promised, to add more details. The new effort of the Montreal-based team can be downloaded from Steam, without the obligation to shell out a penny: we too took advantage of it, to finally return to Opulencia, in order to find out what happened to what we had gotten to see now some time ago. Before proceeding with our analysis, let's remember, for the benefit of those who may have connected only now, the basic concept of The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot: the protagonists are a handful of heroes who, tired of being on Earth, literally emigrated to heaven to found the kingdom of Opulencia. Around here everyone is filthy rich, but despite this, greed pushes everyone to attack their neighbors, to continue accumulating glory and wealth to spend to have the most beautiful and fortified castle among those around. More hack and slash for everyone, with the arrival of The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot! But what a beautiful castle The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot is essentially divided into two parts, identified by the names of Attack and Defense: both are linked to the asynchronous multiplayer mode, which is the heart of this game. In the offensive phase, the player must attack the various castles present in Opulencia in the role of his hero, created for the most part by other human beings and only in small part by Ubisoft game designers. The goal of the defensive phase is to build your hero's castle in turn, populating it with the creatures that will have to defend the riches therein. The attack mode is in all respects similar to what can be expected from an unpretentious hack and slash, within which the character can rely on a set of skills related to class and level, to defeat the monsters that stand in his way. Each defeated castle allows us to earn riches, glory points and experience points, thanks to which we can make our character stronger and his home a more difficult place to conquer. Having just mentioned the classes, we recall the presence of the three already seen on the occasion of our test some time ago. Taken from the classics of this genre, they certainly do not need any particular introduction: they are in fact Magician, Warrior and Archer, which over the months have been joined by the Runaway class, a sort of punk-rock bard who prefers hand-to-hand combat close range. Like other content, the Runaway class can be purchased separately. Returning to the defensive phase, in this case the player is not directly involved in the battle, where his castle and the way in which he built it to make it unbeatable enter the scene; a particularly important aspect, given that this is how you can prevent the opponent on duty from making part of the loot that we have conquered with difficulty his own. Castle management can be performed by displaying a map of the same, representing a level editor, within which to place monsters and traps. There is no shortage of various objects and structures, to obtain bonuses and new creatures to complement those already present. Once the arrangement is complete, it is necessary to ~test~ the dungeon before publishing it online, by raiding it with your character: a somewhat boring obligation, which makes it impossible to change something on the fly. In the event of a defeat, it is instead possible to watch the replay of the performance of those who managed to conquer us, thus identifying any holes in the security of the castle. Pay and win? The fear of every player of free-to-play titles is that, sooner or later, it will be necessary to pay to be able to obtain satisfaction within the game: although Ubisoft has done something to avoid this type of situation within The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot, we cannot say that this threat is completely averted since it has been decided to grant enough to those willing to invest money in the game to obtain bonuses of various types. In fact, the various packages available to players allow access to boosts regarding experience pointsza or the resources collected during the raids, as well as you can decide to buy more space in your inventory by paying some real coins. Even the creation of any characters after the first must be unlocked through payment. In general, there is no progress that cannot be obtained with a little more patience within the game, but the advantage in terms of time obtained by those who pay compared to those who do not is undeniable, including rather comfortable bonuses such as the one which increases the chances of obtaining important drops in the attack phase, or give way to earlier access to some bosses to be placed in your castle. Beyond this, the real problem of the project is precisely what should be its strong point: the content created by the players. Initially, in fact, we find ourselves mainly attacking the castles designed by the Ubisoft team, and then moving on to those created by third parties: in this case, unfortunately, we soon end up noticing what is the common tactic, i.e. filling a room with all the monsters at your disposal, or voluntarily create bottlenecks full of creatures and traps. Seen one, practically, seen all: there is only one cap of defense points to be reached with the placement of monsters in the castle, but unlike some time ago, Ubisoft has removed the same type of cap that regulated the positioning of the henchmen inside of a single room. The impression is that the developers should have allowed a little less freedom in level design, studying different ways to defend the castle effectively. The possibility of associating only four skills to the quick keys on the screen also leaves a little perplexing, compared to what is a larger number of skills available to one's character, whose growth takes place in a too linear way. The style of The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot is unmistakably playful, as shown since the first trailer released by Ubisoft. From a graphic point of view, the game entrusts its visual impact to a cartoon style, with good care and variety of the characters and monsters present, making it possible to remain satisfied even for those who decide to pay a little to customize the look of your castle. The visual result does not make you cry out for a miracle but it fully performs its duty, even with animations and effects. Technically the problem is constituted by the control system, which is sometimes imprecise and approximate in managing the movements of one's character.", "date": "2015-02-23", "grade": "5.5"}
