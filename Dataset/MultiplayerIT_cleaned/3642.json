As you will imagine by reading this review, it is no coincidence: the famous publisher has entrusted the developers of Neople and Studio 42 with the creation of a mobile game that celebrates the long cinematic history of the Japanese monster, bringing almost thirty Kaiju to smartphones and tablets taken from the various adaptations that have followed over the years, starting with the original Godzilla of 1954. In the game we don't play the role of the huge reptile with heavy breath, but the Earth defense forces who are faced with a monster invasion again and are tasked with defending five large areas under attack: Tokyo, London, Sydney, New York and the state of Arizona. The maps are unlocked as we level up, but they all offer the same formula: by repeatedly touching the screen we can produce infantry, armored, vehicles and turrets units that automatically attack the threat in turn, within a progression marked by stages which first present low-level enemies, in this case giant insects, and every ten waves a boss from the history of the saga, with the possibility at a certain point of challenging even Godzilla himself. So let's talk about Kaiju like Gigan, Megalon, Biollante, Rodan, Mechagodzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah and their many variants, all described with lots of photos and details within a codex that is updated every time we get new cards. The latter, placed in the lower part of the screen, allow you to resort to special moves that amplify or speed up the maneuvers of our units, or give rise to real attacks by our roster of creatures. Gameplay and microtransactions The gameplay of Godzilla Defense Force is extraordinarily simple and immediate, given that in theory it is enough to touch the screen as quickly as possible for our units to multiply and thus be able to inflict ever more consistent damage to the enemies, trying in the case of the bosses to complete the fight within a short time limit. Otherwise, game over is incurred with the possibility, however, of immediately resuming the challenge without having to wait for a particular indicator or other to be recharged. In short, the freemium model chosen by Nexon for this title is very permissive, in the sense that it does not limit in any way the amount of time we want to spend with the game nor the number of retries for each defeat. However, the emphasis on monetization becomes clear as soon as you move on to the second map, when the money needed for unit upgrades multiplies dramatically and the progression therefore becomes slower, urging us to buy a few packs of coins or to view trailers advertisers to get a small prize. The setting is not deceptive and it doesn't take much to understand its mechanisms, so you can freely decide whether to continue playing for free or invest a little money, perhaps to obtain precious cards that can make a difference during the most complicated battles. The will of the authors of Godzilla Defense Force was to create a simple ~clicker~, a title that was played almost automatically and that required little effort, pure impromptu entertainment. However, it is a pity that the path of a strategy with a minimum thickness was not chosen, given the great value of the license, the aforementioned concomitant release of Godzilla II: King of the Monsters and the presence of so many monsters, very well translated on the screen thanks to really well done graphics, which represent the most suggestive glimpses of the various cities involved and season it all with an engaging audio sector, embellished by the roars of the Kaiju.", "date": "2019-05-31", "grade": "7.0"}
