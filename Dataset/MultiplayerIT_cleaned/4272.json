The introductory movie, placed before the creation of the character, shows us the destruction of the stronghold of Caed Nua (the one that we had laboriously restored to its former glory during our raids for the Eastern Reach), torn to pieces as if it were tissue paper of the revived god Eothas, the colossus that lay in the mega dungeon ~Endless Paths of Od Nua~ (formed by fifteen layers of increasing difficulty and placed right under Caed Nua). The fights are much more spectacular than those of the first episode His goals are mysterious, but his vehemence almost ends up killing the Watcher landlord, that is us. After the movie, the character creation sequence begins, in which we have to answer questions regarding some events that occurred in Pillars of Eternity to define our story, or load the final save of the latter to follow up on our old actions. Then we must define our characteristics, choosing one of six races, each with its sub-races; one (or more) of eleven classes, which also have a variable number of subclasses; the place where we were born; our work (among the eight available); our weapon specializations and our trait values. Once the various choices have been made, we will be given the opportunity to review the entire card, including the many attack and defense values and active and passive skills, the latter linked to the other items. The new graphics engine allows for a better rendering of surfaces After the creation of the character we will wake up on board a ship, which we will discover is ours. Here we will be given some background on what happened and where Eothas went. We will also be able to take our first real steps. Those who have played Pillars of Eternity will find Deadfire's interface extremely familiar. Indeed, let's say better: it is practically identical to the old one, apart from some adjustments such as the ability to customize the position of the various windows or a few more icons. The most noticeable improvements will however manifest themselves in the fights, which we will discuss later. But let's proceed calmly that there really is a lot to say. Even if we are on a ship, it is not yet time to sail: the first hours of the game are basically a long tutorial that introduces us to the various gameplay functions. Shipwrecked on a large island following an event that we will not reveal to you, we must immediately start looking for a way to free the ship. From here on Pillars of Eternity II gradually introduces us to its vast and multifaceted world, which we will have to travel far and wide while learning a multitude of new game systems to get the better of it. The new map The main novelty of Deadfire, compared to the first Pillars of Eternity, is represented by the game map that can be freely explored by land and by sea, with exchanges between the two environments taking place via ports. In reality it is not a real experiment for Obsidian, who had already done something similar with Storm of Zehir, the second expansion of Neverwinter Nights 2, with which Deadfire also has some names in the design team in common, in particular Josh Sawyer and Bobby Null. Obviously many of the limitations of the time have disappeared and now the system has a much wider scope, as well as offering many more things to do, but it is undeniable that the starting point is identical, with the player having to explore the map looking for hotspots to interact with, whether they are ruins of ancient manors, wrecked ships or dark caves, to activate the related events that can lead to different situations. The new map allows for freer exploration of the game world For example, there are many sequences that are experienced as if you were in a paper role-playing game, with the user choosing the action to be performed through a multiple choice system, also deciding when necessary which character should perform it. In other cases we are simply asked to invest some time to look for resources, while in still others we have to face encounters with characters who can be friendly or hostile depending on a multitude of factors that we are not going to list all so as not to run out of space available. Just to give an example, some encounters are different depending on how you behaved in the first Pillars of Eternity (provided you have saved your saves), while others can be influenced by attitudes held during some missions, primary or secondary .Granted that in the terrestrial areas there are also normal areas that can be explored with the party, which usually reserve unique adventures, sometimes even unrelated to quests or other secondary plots. The more adventurous, that is those who will devote themselves to exploration rather than following the recommended routes, could solve some quests even before obtaining them. Which greatly increases the satisfaction of the discovery. Naval battles The marine events must be added to the purely terrestrial events, in particular the fights between boats, another of the innovations introduced in Deadfire. To start a naval battle it is necessary to attack or be attacked by another sailing ship: these are not events that take place in real time, but mini-games in which the captains take turns deciding the moves to be made, such as tacking to position the enemy ship within range of the cannons or try to ram it, and then maybe board it and have the two crews face off in combat (in the normal modes of the rest of the adventure, in this case). There is no unique strategy to win a naval battle, because much depends on how you have chosen to develop the vessel. Naval combat is an unobtrusive addition that tires you in the long run If you have a very strong party, but little firepower, it is advisable to try the boarding in any case to resolve the situation sword in hand. The system itself works very well at first when it's new, but gets very repetitive as the hours go by. The basic problem is that it is really limited and ends up turning into a kind of work to be done, necessary for supplies in case you don't want to spend too much money in the ports for supplies, more than in an activity capable of giving away something more from the playful point of view. Paradoxically, the best fights are the practically obligatory ones, because they are narratively characterized and therefore manage to arouse more attention. It must also be said that the management of the ship is in general really simple and essentially requires finding the crew, buying more and more powerful cannons and never missing food and alcohol, otherwise the loss of morale which determines a lower effectiveness in combat. Honestly, in about seventy hours of play, apart from the early stages, we never had any major problems keeping the crew in shape. In fact, even from this point of view, the system implemented is really simplistic... perhaps too much, given how much time you spend at sea. General considerations on exploration If we like, the entire exploratory part shares the same problem as naval combat: basically it is pleasant to go around to find out what is hidden in the various hot spots, but in the long run some of them completely lose meaning and almost become physiological necessities to be carried out as fast as possible, without getting any satisfaction out of it. As you explore, you can make some interesting discoveries We are not only talking about the collection of materials, which merely asks us to click on some writings, but also about the role-playing game-like events which, although well written, are in most cases completely unrelated to the rest of the adventure and do not lead to much in terms of loot or storytelling. With the explorable areas it goes much better, because that's where the game manages to give its best, particularly in some exceptional and unexpected fights (sometimes exceptional precisely because they are unexpected), but at that point it becomes inevitable to wonder if adding everything the outline described above was not necessary only to broaden the game in some way, given that the best part of the gameplay still remains the one most rooted in the original Pillars of Eternity, and consequently in the tradition of the genre. Don't misunderstand, because exploring gives its satisfactions, but there is no doubt that as the hours go by, the contribution to the game of some activities becomes weak, almost insignificant. To say, trying to replay the first part of the game for the second time with a different character, we found ourselves scrolling through the narrated events very quickly, a sign that, regardless of the different choices we could make, they no longer had much to offer. if not of different loot (and not always). Storytelling Like the exploration, the narrative side is also in a certain sense ambivalent: if on the one hand the main story is not bad at all, on the other it is clear that it does not reach the heights of the first episode. Overall it is much more linear, although some twists are present, but above all it goes less deeply, although it takes up many of the themes already covered previously. Perhaps the main problemipale is precisely the comparison with Pillars of Eternity, whose story had an exceptional level of writing, with the player who found himself entangled in problems that mixed politics, sociology and religion, reaching very high qualitative peaks and creating a fascinating and engaging texture, with important metaphysical implications that did not leave anyone indifferent. Deadfire tries to follow the same path, but only partially succeeds. The problem is not so much in the quality or quantity of the texts, in line with his ambitions, as in the overall less incisiveness of the given direction, which is much more fragmented. The same can be said of the stories of the characters that make up the party, with those of the new recruits who are more interesting than the others by virtue of their being more organic to the scenario. Probably the general fragmentation that is perceived throughout the adventure derives for the most part from the exploration system, which naturally tends to atomize the events, diluting them in a very different way in the game structure compared to what happened in Pillars of Eternity. After all, the campaign is managed in a less pleasant way than the canons of the latest Obsidian, which suddenly returned to that of Fallout: New Vegas. To say, in Pillars of Eternity the main story was the backbone around which everything else was based, secondary missions and accessory explorations included. Here, however, it is an activity among others, to be carried out perhaps after having explored the rest of the game world in complete autonomy. It must also be said that it is quite short, to the point that it is better to ignore it at the beginning if you do not want to rush towards the end. To say: we spent the first fifteen hours of the game, excluding the introduction, wandering around Deadfire on our own, going in the exact opposite direction to what was being asked of us. To be altered by this new setting is also the scenario itself: while in the first episode the different places of the Eastern Reach were read by the player as the different facets of a single continent, and they went to collaborate in their own way to form the overall picture , with the mythology that was the background to the story that was compact, however fluid, in Deadfire the island structure of the game world is reflected in a determined way on the description and perception of the same, with the different places that are more autonomous , but at the same time poorer in their background, because they are less tied to others. The variety is certainly what gains and if we want it was really difficult to imagine a different solution, given that in any case the map is a large archipelago. There are probably also those who will prefer this approach to the old one, which as already specified makes exploration much more adventurous. The translation into Italian As promised, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire is also playable localized in our language (texts only). In general, the translation work is to be considered acceptable, also because it makes the game usable by those who don't know English. However, it should be specified that many texts have been translated literally and sometimes do not follow the thread of the dialogues well. In particular, the menus have obvious blunders. For this reason we preferred to play by selecting the English language. Combat, loot and crafting Instead, the combat system is completely successful, which takes up much of what was seen in the first episode, refining it further. The news is few, but interesting. Nothing revolutionary, mind you, but it's now possible to change an attacker's targets in the middle of an action (for example by performing a spell) and you can disengage the entire group in melee to reposition it. Both options are really useful and add something extra in terms of tactics to use on the battlefield, allowing for sudden changes and drastic changes in case things go wrong. The new graphic techniques used have done the game really good, not only for the overall impact, however higher than that of Pillars of Eternity thanks above all to the new lighting system and greater vitality of the maps, but also for the superior precision of the pathfinding , who is now evidently able to better read the morphology of the scenario. Even the fights have been enriched with visual effects that are far more refined than those of the old system. We are thinking in particular of spells and abilities, but also of the rendering of weapons and armor. The battles themselves always work the same way and allow you to control the entire party or individual characters, entrusting the others to artificial intelligence, mod", "date": "2018-05-08", "grade": "8.3"}
