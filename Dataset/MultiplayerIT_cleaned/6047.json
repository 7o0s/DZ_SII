The debut took place in 2012, when the first chapter first arrived on Android and iOS devices and later also on the Nintendo eShop, with a port intended for the Nintendo 3DS. After having also staged a second episode - which expanded some features of the predecessor - work began on a remastered HD Collection, which has recently landed in the digital catalog of Wii U. For many years Hrberg has cherished the dream of making a video game of his own, with the idea of paying homage to the many old school titles that had populated his youth. After learning the basics of QBasic programming at the age of 12, Bertil diligently participated in the homebrew community engaged on the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, later continuing the journey with a degree in game development. After some brief training experiences in small studios, he joined the ranks of Grin and took part in the development of Bionic Commando Rearmed, an appreciated reboot of one of the most popular Capcom series by longtime players. Then in 2011 the opportunity finally arrived to start his own business and satisfy the desire for autonomy that had been dormant in the drawer. The natural landing place to start the business was the mobile market, which guaranteed a huge audience and the attraction of a very low price. Then it was the turn of the console market and the choice fell on Nintendo, mainly due to the fewer restrictions that the eShop guaranteed compared to competing digital platforms. Hrberg himself has stated several times in the past that the development of Gunman Clive was inspired above all by the platform titles present in the NES and SNES catalog, not only from the level design point of view, but also for the game contents and the system control. In fact, it is not difficult to see, in both chapters proposed by this collection, evident contaminations of milestones of the past, from Mega Man to Donkey Kong, passing through the inevitable Super Mario Bros. Gunman Clive draws liberally from many past classics Gunman Clive A group of dangerous bandits has kidnapped the daughter of Mayor Johnson and is spreading the frenzy in all the surrounding territories. Gunslinger Gunman Clive is thus tasked with retrieving the girl and restoring order to the Wild West. Reminds you of something, doesn't it? Well yes, the improbable plot is not the only point of contact with the much more famous plumber, all mustache and dungarees. Leaving aside the quotes, they are above all the good mastery of level design and the high difficulty in winking at the old works signed by Shigeru Miyamoto. But this first chapter of the series is characterized above all by a very characteristic cel-shaded graphic sector, which draws liberally from Western iconography. As you jump from one platform to another it's like finding yourself in front of a Sergio Leone film poster, with delicate pastel strokes and red/ochre hues dominating the scene. Dealing with a gunslinger, the tools of the trade cannot be missing, therefore the weapon available by default is a simple pistol, with which you shoot only horizontally. To reach sensitive objectives and dodge bullets you have to jump in time, possibly without ending up braised by a bomb thrown from above or falling like fools into the first cliff a little more extensive than the others. There are also power ups, which are often left by downed opponents, with which it is possible to expand one's traditional rate of fire, access the missile launcher pistol or the laser rifle. If you are wondering what these tools have to do with the Wild West, it is easy to say: the universe of Gunman Clive is alternative and not at all faithful to reality - as will be understood even better in the sequel - therefore there is no lack of poetic licenses. The fact remains that the alternatives in the arsenal at one's disposal are not many. The main defect attributable to this game is in fact inherent in the variety of the playful part, which takes on very limited outlines. By selecting the intermediate level of difficulty from the three available, the twenty stages that make up the adventure can be completed in less than two hours. As a result, replayability is almost non-existent, as there are no extra modes that vary the main dish in some way. No succulent contours in the desolate plains of Gunman Clive, yet the title deserves attention for the very well orchestrated level designor, capable of doing justice to both normal game sections and fierce bosses. The good impressions in this sense were crucial to give liveliness to a title that otherwise would have expired in predictability and to obtain this result importance was given to the use of physics. There are also obvious references to titles from the past, such as the section on board a mine cart, evidently inspired by Donkey Kong Country. Gunman Clive 2 The second chapter of Gunman evolves its predecessor from some points of view and does so first of all by adding five more levels, for a total of twenty-five. Which means a slightly more accentuated longevity, even if only slightly, combined with a level of challenge calibrated even more upwards. Changes of course also concern the graphic side, in fact the shades that outlined the entire previous experience have been replaced by many chromatic variations, ranging from red to green, up to blue and purple. As already mentioned, the universe of reference takes on garments here that are even more distant from those of the Wild West that one usually sees. The gunslinger is once again grappling with disreputable people but in this case, in addition to the outlaws, he will also be forced to face much less predictable enemies such as samurai and even ravenous dinosaurs. Moreover, the level design continues to remain the flagship of the production, as well as the large use of physics, which has been increased considerably. The quotes also continue, not only from Donkey Kong but also from other titles including Tetris. The famous puzzle game is in fact paid homage in a short section, in which large bricks fall and are used as support platforms, possibly being careful not to be crushed under their weight. The real novelty, however, is reserved by the inclusion of shooter segments with a view over the shoulder, a clear reference to a great classic like Space Harrier. Furthermore, in order to offer a minimum of more longevity than in the past, Hrberg has opted for the introduction of other playable characters to complement the stainless Clive. It is therefore possible to select Mrs. Johnson, the girl already saved from the clutches of the criminals, and transform her into the heroine of the situation. There are even slight variations on the theme, since with her you can glide during jumps, a bit like Princess Peach from Super Mario Bros. 2. Furthermore, by completing the game, additional characters with of peculiar characteristics. All this is positive, God forbid, but we would not have disdained even some tweaks on the weapons front, which on the contrary are not supported by any new idea and return in the same form already seen previously.", "date": "2015-09-11", "grade": "8.0"}
