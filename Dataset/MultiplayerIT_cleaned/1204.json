{"name": "Fable: La Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fable-la-recensione.html", "text": "Once upon a time... Tell a story. Right from the first bars of the game, introduced by screens made up of brightly colored and medieval-style drawings, it is clear how much this intention on the part of the developers is a fundamental concern in drafting the narrative plot. A high-sounding voice will echo in order to present the player with the hero's clothes, which with meter, needle and thread will soon fit him like the most comfortable pajamas. Initially, however, we will find ourselves in the battered trousers of a haggard child still unaware of his destiny. A destiny that will have undergone a violent and painful swerve. After taking the first steps in a tutorial built specifically to initiate the player into interacting with NPCs, our infant hero will, in fact, be a spectator of events as bloody as they are shocking. A sequence of atrocities will bring the little boy in the presence of Maze, a powerful wizard at the head of the Guild of Heroes. This singular character will take us within the walls of the Guild, where we will be looked after and properly trained in the art of war. Here will begin the second phase of an almost faultless tutorial, in which the hero, who has become a teenager in the meantime, will become familiar with all the possibilities offered in the field of war. We will therefore be initiated into the art of the white weapon, in which to practice hand-to-hand combat, the use of the bow and magic, with which to juggle distances prohibitive for the blade of a sword. At the same time, we will be able to continue to cultivate our relationships, this time with the unique characters of the Guild, and take part in small quests and challenges that are certainly nice as well as useful. The time will come when you cut the umbilical cord and become men, open the doors of the warm Guild to pursue your destiny. The destiny, still to be built, of a hero with a past scourged by a thousand adverse vicissitudes and a future full of deeds, whose writing, however, will be at the player's discretion. Initially, however, we will find ourselves in the battered trousers of a haggard child still unaware of his destiny. Demon Doors and the like In our wanderings, we will find in Albion more than one possibility to indulge our brain cells. Among the many, there are some talking doors, called Demon Doors, custodians of authentic treasures and, obviously, reluctant to open the way for us. Each door will have a request which, if granted, will lead it to resign and let us pass. The 'demon requests' will range, and in some senses will put a spoke in the works, from the moral to the physical conduction. It will happen, for example, having to kill an innocent in front of the eyes of the door to make it open, or, again, having to gain weight to such an extent as to become obese. There will also be boxes with numbers engraved on them, which will range from 5 to 20 and will represent the number of silver keys needed to open the precious trunks. The keys will be accumulable as well as usable for each casket, and will keep real treasures inside them. I am looking for work, possibly half a day and a pharaonic salary Open the gates of the Guild of Heroes, we will find a world, called Albion, enveloping in its fairy-tale atmosphere, but above all full of ideas and characters to interact with. The flexible structure designed by Big Blue Box will take the player to villages where he can refresh himself and rest from the warmongering efforts, also useful for being able to come across new adventures. Divided into quests, Fable will lead the player to have to choose quests and sub-quests mostly from the Guild, which will provide cards specially marked with a variable value offering, symbolizing the type of mission in which one will enter. We will have the gold-marked quests, which will be closely linked to the main game, or the silver ones, optional but at the same time necessary to discover secrets and gain experience. The latter could disappear over time, if not taken, or if started but not completed. Finally there will be long-lasting quests, specially marked by the bronze symbol, which will always be present and whose resolution will lead to very in-depth research at times. Basically, the variety of missions to be completed will be closely tied to the above typology, where the gold ones will have the development of the narrative on their side to make them unique and varied, just as the bronze ones will lead the player to time-wasting searches, useful for detach attention from primary goals. The most anonymous are the silver ones, precisely because of their optionality and the repetitionitiveness of the situations in which he will run into. The substantial linearity of the level design, characterized by paths and crossroads, will certainly be filled with enemies and NPCs with which to interact, but also with some goodies aimed at making up for the scarcity of real puzzles, if we exclude those of the Demon Doors. The same possibility of being able to search for treasures, thanks to the use of a shovel with which to dig and a fishing rod, is given precisely for this purpose, in part by succeeding. Finally, the teleportation points are comfortable, which will mostly act as unassailable ferries and which, above all, will prevent the player from traveling kilometers to visit all of Albion. The world of Albion will reserve, as mentioned, many surprises, which will go hand in hand with the enemies to face. Unscrupulous bandits, zombies, werewolves, gnomes, trolls, witches and bastard little fairies who have very little candid and innocent will rage on our way. The combat system will make use of the precious, even if already seen, lock on to hook an enemy. This reinterpretation of such a useful and spectacular feature is certainly a welcome as well as well thought-out thing, unfortunately scratched by some too many worries in the changes from enemy to enemy. The rest is runny fat. The unequivocal will of the coders - that is to manage every choice in real time - takes shape in practice with a remarkable symbiosis between frenzy and practicality, mostly given by comfortable menu interfaces with which to choose items and spells. Especially for the latter the speech becomes tempting, with three of the four front keys from the pad which will each assume a magical ability, thanks to the pressure of the right backbone. With the remaining front (Y) you will call up a menu above which allows you to choose one of the many possible spell combinations that can be set by the player. Of fundamental importance will be the approach to each armed clash which, we recall, will totally follow the player's will to fight with sword, bow or magic. It will therefore be necessary to choose based on the enemy attack patterns, but also according to the character you want to create, as the use of each of the three offensive possibilities will be registered and rewarded with experience points to spend, together with the general ones, in the category appropriate for the attachment used. This will lead to increasing one's physical power rather than agility, or to learning new spells and adding power to them. In the context, the physical characterization of our alter ego will not be outdone either, which will change according to the bellicose nature that will be formed. A powerful wizard will be diminutive and tend to gray prematurely in years, while a full-fledged warrior will quickly become handsome and muscular. Furthermore, during the adventure we will be able to bring back permanent scars on every part of the body, to remind us that armor does not work miracles. Using the various skills available, it will also be necessary to take into account an experience point multiplier, which will be activated every time the player manages to hit the enemy consecutively without being touched. Another peculiarity is given by the parry-proof blow, characterized by the flaming sword and useful for unhinging the enemy defenses. This will become more and more complex as the above multiplier coefficient increases. A powerful wizard will be diminutive and tend to gray prematurely in years, while a full-fledged warrior will quickly become handsome and muscular. Symbology Even the symbols in Fable play a very important part, making everything easy to understand. We will have halos around the characters, differentiated by color according to the role they will play in the game. Then, other symbols above the head of the NPCs, which will range from the heart, which will represent the state of affection towards us according to size, to the ring, the symbol par excellence of our better half. Following our actions hand in hand, then, an angel or a devil will appear on the screen, signaling whether our move was bad or good and indicating the number of points that will be used for alignment. A sphere divided in two, half symbolizing night and half day, will signal the time slot in real time. A sort of clock without numbers and hands, but terribly comfortable to always know the precise moment of the day. Objective: Harem To the reader unaware of the true nature of this game, Fable might seem like a traditional adventure after all, albeit with some RPG additions. Instead, this Big Blue Box creation is much more, despite the fact that several words were needed to cap off the most succulent and innovative part. The concept of Fable is freedom. Freedom not of movement or anything else, but morale. The possibility, indeed, of being the hero we most want to be, good or bad, obviously, reaping the fruits of what we will sow. Every action and choice made by the player will affect his appearance and his fame, which will consequently change the relationships with the NPCs. Especially in the villages we will have something to indulge ourselves, with characters sensitive to our appearance and our attitudes. Therefore the possibility of influencing the crowd, which will welcome us with applause, if we are seen willingly, or will be frightened by locking themselves in the house, if we are on the other side of the barricade. The villagers will lead a life of their own, going to work during the day and then returning home or going to the tavern in the evening. Unfortunately, some small ingenuity has been committed in terms of AI, which, however good and functional, is sometimes lost in a glass of water. An example above all: greeting a worker with a crate in his hand, he will reciprocate the greeting, clumsily letting it fall and shatter. Details, of course, which, however, could be corrected with a few small tricks. But let's continue. A symbol, depicting an eye with a number attached, will always be visible at the top of the screen together with the game map, and will depict how many people are watching us at that particular moment. This is a feature of undoubted interest, which will be of vital importance for deciding whether or not to perform a particular action. Stealing an object from the chest of drawers of a house, if seen by someone, will inevitably lead the guy to call the guards, who will try to catch us to make us pay some sort of fine. We will be able to pay for our sins or decide to face them, which will only increase our debt to the local law and stiffen the various villagers towards us until they are terrified at just seeing us. Apart from Bowerstone, the first village we will come across where it is not possible to wear weapons of any kind, all the others will keep in mind our criminal conduct, leading us to become real outlaws. The meanest ones may also prefer to exterminate every poor soul who will get in their way, while the good ones may become local darlings, perhaps by opening a business and establishing love relationships with women... and men. In this regard, expressive shortcuts of various kinds are placed on the directional cross, necessary for communication with the characters we will meet. Some will also have a strong demented inclination as a sign of that irony that pervades the whole game. Specifically, we will be able to mess with all the women we want, but it will not always be possible to conquer them. It will depend a lot on our charm, also given by the haircut and tattoos with which we will cover the body, the moral inclination and how we will play our cards. We will therefore have expressive shortcuts aimed at courtship, to which gifts of various kinds will not fail to be added. Cooked to perfection, our ladies (but also our boys, depending on the case), will ask for the wedding ring. Once this is also given away, we will have to buy our love nest, then get married. Once this is done we will be ready to consume, then the lights will go out and... We will logically leave any surprises hidden. Relationships with one's wives, and we speak in the plural precisely because of the faculty of having more than one, will also bring many gifts from them, but also conjugal burdens. The relationship could inevitably cool down if we miss too long in the presence of our wife, who in response will give us a two of spades as big as the Colosseum to our sexual claims. Very likely, don't you think? Fable for the eyes A hint of the atmosphere escaped us, we are guilty. We wanted to keep this detail for the grand finale, but we actually let it slip along the way. Well gentlemen, Fable lives up to its own title by bringing an almost unique atmosphere to the Xbox, made up of pastel shades and colors, arpeggio sounds and breathtaking visuals. Watching the sunrise over Oakvale beach is one of the most beautiful sights ever seen on consoles, or if you're lucky, bumping into an earth troll on a hill in the middle of a fiery sunset. Heart-pounding stuff. To the above are added the splendid animations of one's alter ego, which will take into account the same heaviness of the weapon in hand, and remarkably well-crafted dynamic shadows. It's just a pity that a not always reliable frame rate manages, even if minimally, to affect such graphic beauty. The soundtrack itself succeeds in the arduous task of always being themed and further helping the player to identify himself. The voiceovers are also good", "date": "2004-10-01", "grade": null}
