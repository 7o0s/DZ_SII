{"name": "Darksiders Genesis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/darksiders-genesis-recensione.html", "text": "Born from the ashes of Vigil Games, Airship Syndacate is the small developer who took over the reins of Darksiders after the odyssey of THQ, a publisher that went bankrupt a few years ago and was then acquired by Nordic Games, now THQ Nordic. A tortuous and complicated journey, which we told you about some time ago in one of our Monographs: closed the controversial parenthesis of Darksiders III, developed by Gunfire Games after a long wait, the franchise is back in the hands of the original team who came out with Darksiders Genesis, of which you are about to read the review: a low-budget prequel that renounces the classic approach of the previous titles and introduces a series of interesting innovations that could easily become the new status quo of a series as loved as it is ill-fated . Another prequel Might as well immediately shake off the first problem: the narrative component is probably the weakest point of this package. If you too have been waiting almost ten years to find out what happened after War's fateful ~Not alone~ in the Darksiders finale, well, prepare to be disappointed again this time. Darksiders Genesis is in fact a prequel that takes place long before what is narrated in the initial chapter and which tells the vicissitudes of War and Conflict: forced into an uncomfortable temporary alliance with the demon Samael, the two horsemen of the Apocalypse must follow a trail of misdeeds diabolical and exterminate armies of monsters in an attempt to locate Lucifer and foil his plans. The story is told mainly through sparkling dialogues, written and excellently dubbed in Italian, occasionally with the help of partially animated illustrations in which the stylistic imprint of the artistic director, as well as general director, Joe Madureira, cartoonist known above all for Battle Chasers - which became a video game recently signed by Airship Syndicate - and for several collaborations with Marvel Comics. The campaign, which we completed in about fifteen hours, let's say it right away, is nothing special. At times it even seems like a simple pretext to lead the two protagonists from one assignment to another, often taking advantage of a trick already seen and reviewed in previous episodes of the series: to find and defeat the demon on duty, you must first recover this or that artifact, obviously massacring the hordes of demons and bosses who will try to hinder us. In the end, Darksiders Genesis only adds another piece to the mythological mosaic of the series in a decidedly hasty ending that reveals little more than what we already know: considering that not even Darksiders II and Darksiders III have continued the story, we begin to think that not even Mad! and members still know how to continue it. Fortunately we have at least one moral winner, namely Conflict, the last horseman of the Apocalypse to enter the scene, a light-hearted, ironic and much funnier character than his gloomy brothers, who often entertained us with hilarious jokes and outbursts of anger . More Zelda than Diablo We have made many conjectures about the nature of Darksiders Genesis, but when the game is over we can say with certainty that the isometric view will not deceive you: we are faced with a Darksiders in miniature, but still a Darksiders in all respects, and therefore a title more similar to The Legend of Zelda than to Diablo, with all due respect to the RPG elements previously introduced in Darksiders II and completely disappeared here. Even the fact that Airship Syndicate developed the game on a tight budget betrays the care put into the creation of scenarios, animations and polygonal models. Darksiders Genesis is one of those cases in which the artistic direction triumphs over the graphic complexity, thanks to the variety of settings and the atmosphere that Madureira's team managed to create by carefully choosing the colors, the details and also the excellent musical accompaniment. especially in some missions and during certain particularly engaging battles. The real disadvantage of the isometric view is mostly felt in some platforming sequences where the angle doesn't help the player to fine-tune the jumps, but it's nothing that can't be overcome after a few tries. The structure of the game follows a rather linear process: after completing the mission on duty, you return to the Void, a sort of partially explorable hub where you can buy the upgrades sold by Vulgrim and Dis before embarking on a new adventure after the usual dialogues who continue the story. The exploration in the various chapters, sixteen in total, however, is a different matter. In each mission we will have to achieve an obiprecise main objective, even if sometimes it will be necessary to complete some mandatory secondary tasks first: the level design is brilliant and although the open spaces are so large that we can even get around on horseback, we will end up following an invisible drawn line that will lead us to discover the new tools needed to solve the many environmental puzzles. Therefore, gadgets such as the Vorpal Blade are back, which allows us to interact with remote switches, or the Seismic Glove with which it is possible to destroy particular crystalline formations, and to these are added accessories such as the Vacuum Bomb which gives certain puzzles a decidedly from Portal. As the adventure continues, the puzzles become more and more complex and force us to use the various tools, often repeatedly switching from one character to another: Darksiders Genesis in fact employs a sort of ~tag~ function with which it is possible to exchange on the fly the controlled knight, switching between War and Conflict unless, of course, you're playing co-op with a friend. Unlocking the different gadgets obviously opens up new ways even in previously completed missions, which then becomes a pleasure to replay to collect the objects left over, whether they are chests full of souls, fragments of the Health and Wrath stones that increase the respective indicators and so on. The collectibles are in fact many but the currencies to spend are mainly two: the coins of the Ferryman and the aforementioned souls, necessary to buy combos, special attacks, upgrades, improvements and other bonuses. Fortunately, the map that we will find in the various areas comes to meet us, showing us the location of the collectibles, but not our precise position: knowing where the very rare Deception key is which is used to open the relative door full of loots is one thing but finding out how to reach it, in short, is a whole other story. Fighting styles The combat system is unsuspectingly deep, considering War and Strife fight almost completely differently. Both knights can attack in melee with at least one basic combo, but in War's case it is possible to chain attacks for longer, drawing on his offensive skills and the upgrades of his Divoracaos sword which reach different levels of power, changing in terms of utility and effectiveness. Guerra can then spin on himself in a whirlwind of fire, strike multiple enemies simultaneously by emitting electric shocks from the tip of his greatsword, brand opponents so that they explode on death, and so on. In addition, Guerra can also chain into his combos the Wrath skills that consume the notches under the health indicator, parry blows and counterattacks and use his accessories to damage enemies near and far: his predisposition for close combat makes it makes it particularly tough, but also much slower and vulnerable when enemies can attack from afar. Conflict is another matter in this sense. The new knight is much more agile and faster than Guerra and can dash up to three times in a row to dodge enemies once the appropriate upgrades are purchased. However, this means that he is less resistant to close shots, also because the value of his health is much lower than that of his brother. For this reason, Conflitto, which is played a bit like a twin stick shooter, can count on its two guns and a wide range of different projectiles that can be equipped in pairs: from the typical constant beams to loading in true Mega Man style, from explosive projectiles to acid ones that generate regenerative orbs and so on. The trump card of Conflict is, however, the so-called winning streak, an indicator that fills up when the knight hits enemies and which, once loaded, gives a temporary boost to the equipped projectiles that will become much more effective without consuming ammunition. Learning to understand when to switch characters to take advantage of its peculiarities against the enemies we are facing is, of course, an important part of the game. The two knights also have access to a series of capabilities in common, such as the ability to slay sufficiently weakened enemies with a sort of Fatality, that of taking the field with a so-called Synergy attack that hits all enemies on the screen or transform into their monstrous ultimate forms making them temporarily invincible and deadly. Each possibility discussed in the lines above is poisubject to the modifiers of a curious enhancement system that is not a little reminiscent of Final Fantasy X's Sphereography. Defeated enemies sometimes drop their cores which we can then allocate in a special grid, considering their category - attack, health or anger - and the level reached: by collecting the same core several times, in fact, it increases in level up to three, improving the bonuses conferred. Not all slots in the grid can fuel a core to its maximum level; also, cores must be adjacent to feed each other and boost both War and Strife. Initially you end up arranging the cores a bit at random, but continuing in the adventure you get many more and some of them, especially the rarer ones obtained by defeating the bosses, give very special bonuses that must be carefully evaluated. The problem, of course, is to enhance them by accumulating the number of cores required by type: fortunately, the game comes to meet us with the Arena which is unlocked after a few missions and which serves precisely to avoid having to repeatedly complete the various chapters, given that the defeated monsters do not respawn. Each stage of the Arena pits you against waves of well-defined monsters, so just play this mode several times and cross your fingers that the cores we need come out while we improve the score to unlock the best rewards. It's not the most elegant of solutions, but it's an incentive to explore the combat system and discover every content of the game. In this sense, Darksiders Genesis easily succeeds in its intent: to entertain for about twenty hours, and something more if you want to complete it 100%, at an affordable price.", "date": "2019-12-04", "grade": "8.0"}
