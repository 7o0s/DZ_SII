Not that they ever really went out of fashion, but in those years the genre was a world of its own, made up of titles with licensed songs and weird peripherals. It goes without saying that the protagonist of this trend has been Guitar Hero, a franchise that has dominated for more than a dozen years together with Rock Band and Sing Star. Then, suddenly, it all came to an end, bursting into a soap bubble, perhaps because the market was saturated or perhaps because the public was tired of filling the closet with plastic guitars and drum kits. However, in recent years we have been witnessing a sort of rebirth of the genre through virtual reality, with rhythm games that are more immersive and original than ever. An example is Ragnarock, a musical game that inherits the Guitar Hero interface but instead of making us impersonate a rock star, it puts us in the shoes of a group of Vikings. We tell you what it's like on PlayStation VR2, and why you absolutely should play it, in our review. Legacy of the past Ragnarock's interface resembles that of Guitar Hero, but the musical instrument is very different Ragnarock is a musical game where you take on the role of a Viking break (or Viking, the avatar is customizable), or the one who marked the rhythm on ships with drum beats for the rowers. The aim of the game is in fact to hit a series of runes with hammers at the exact moment in which they line up on one of the four drums available. The mechanics are the same as in Guitar Hero, where the key of the correct color had to be pressed and pick at the exact moment in which it lined up on the keystroke on the screen. From Harmonix's music game, Ragnarock also borrows the combo multiplier system: by hitting a certain number of correct hits in a row, we will load an upgrade that will increase the score, which can be activated by hitting one of the two gongs positioned on the side of the station. However, there is a variation on the theme regarding the representation of the score. If in Guitar Hero (but also other VR music games such as Beat Saber) the score is shown as a simple numerical data from the game interface, in Ragnarock this is converted into length. Let's not forget that the stage where the drums are played is really a boat, and from our position we will see both our group of rowers and any opposing ships. The more our performance will be clean and free of errors, the more road our ship pushed by the rowers will travel, thus converting our score into meters covered. This mechanic becomes even more exciting if you play Ragnarock in online multiplayer, challenging another player to a real speed race. During a multiplayer battle we will always see our opponent's boat, instantly knowing how the challenge is evolving based on the position of the ships. This mechanic also applies to tracks played offline, where we will see the ghost of our best performance instead of a real player. Tracks and customizations Avatars, ship, rowers and hammers are customizable with cosmetic elements Before setting sail with our ship, Ragnarock presents us with a wide choice of songs, ranging from Viking metal to electro folk, including punk arrangements of seafaring songs. The Sidh, Alestorm, and Celkilt are just a few of the many bands included in the base game playlist. Currently DLC and custom songs created by the community are the prerogative of the Meta Quest 2 and Steam VR version of Ragnarock, while on PS VR2 it is possible to try before buying up to three songs thanks to the free demo. In addition to the large tracklist, the game offers a long series of cosmetic elements to customize our avatar, hammers, ship and crew, many of which are paid for through micro-transactions. Without cosmetic items and library expansions, the game remains absolutely enjoyable, and guarantees hours of fun and many calories burned. Don't make the mistake of thinking of Ragnarock as a harmless party game: playing the drums is as fun as it is tiring and, even if the title can be played both standing and seated, shoulders and arms will have their work cut out! Feedback and scenarios Some sceneries of Ragnarock are really beautiful to see From a technical point of view we are talking about a very solid game, which arrives on PlayStation VR2 after a good run-in on other viewers. Like many ports on the market, Ragnarock played on PS VR2 takes a clear step forward and the unique features of the Sony headset add that extra touch to the gaming experience. The vibration of the visor during the activation of the boost ethe vibration of the PlayStation VR2 Sense help to involve the player and amplify every hit, while the hardware of the console allows for much more detailed settings. In fact, each song is immersed in its own pre-established scenario, even if it is still possible to choose which one to go through by selecting it from the main menu. Some are simple natural glimpses, others are much more suggestive, leading us to cross underground lava lakes or clouds, up to the gates of Valhalla. The customization options will allow you to find your ideal setup Controls and feedback from the drums are exceptional, an aspect that the PS VR2 version also shares with the others already on the market. Obviously there is a latency test plus a detailed customization of the drums. On first launch, the game will show us how to adjust the height of the drums and the position of the gongs, and then offer a detailed list of advanced adjustments that can be applied to the hammers. Resting grip angle, distance between the wrists and height between the wrists and the drums, and so on. This allows a gaming experience tailored to the player and, once you have found your setup, it is a good idea to save it on your profile, perhaps leaving one free for guests should you happen to let your friends try Ragnarock.", "date": "2023-04-09", "grade": "8.5"}
