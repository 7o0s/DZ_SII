In short, the outline is valid, especially in relation to the production value of the title, even if what matters in these cases is, obviously, the gameplay. In this field Alien Rage, developed by City Interactive using the Unreal Engine, goes back to the old school for lovers of fast-paced shooters full of explosions. A title whose gameplay revolves around ten weapons that we could define as classic, each equipped with a double fire mode, and which offers us a high degree of challenge, as the lowest level of difficulty that falls under the heading immediately makes clear ~demanding~. Not that this translates into an impossible experience to deal with, also thanks to the numerous checkpoints from which it is possible to restart even after closing and restarting the title, but the risk of dying is concrete, especially if you want to get a good score which is determined by the accuracy of the shots, the variety of kills and the ability to exploit environmental advantages. Alien Rage places us on a cold asteroid populated by ruthless creatures determined to eliminate us Shoot anything that moves While referring directly to vintage shooters, Alien Rage sports some features typical of our times, the most modern of which is undoubtedly represented by the evolution of the character. By accumulating points it is in fact possible to unlock various perks that increase the effectiveness of our character in single player mode and by this they mean the need to replay the missions once all the special abilities have been unlocked in order to obtain the best possible scores. However, this is not the only different element compared to the classic shooter formula, with multiplayer which, although not including the aforementioned perks, allows players to select the race and the starting weapons equipped. Furthermore, health regenerates automatically, long bursts reduce the accuracy of the weapon, covers are damaged exposing those who use them to protect themselves and headshots, especially in single player, are a decisive element of combat. In fact, enemies can take a large amount of body shots while headshots cause massive damage. However, these must be worn with precision, taking into account the position of the head and any protections. As for everything else, the experience is that of the classic shooter with big machine guns equipped with grenade launchers and lots of shots, explosive barrels, enemies that suddenly appear from teleportation devices and end-of-level bosses. The secondary fire modes are all based on the same type of ammunition and this means that a maximum of five can be accumulated in total. It is then up to the player to decide which of the three equipped weapons to use the special projectile that can take the form of a grenade, a very powerful burst, a globe of energy and so on. Nothing particularly new, mind you, but this setting has allowed the developers to enrich the offensive potential of the weapons while keeping everything extremely accessible and intuitive. On the other hand, the obvious goal of Alien Rage is to project the player into a whirlwind of blows, explosions, high-sounding declarations and exploding heads pouring viscous fluids onto the floor. No exploration, no stealth component and little room for bypasses. Escape is the only option in case of a mistake; aim triumphs over movement and the most relevant tactical choice concerns the selection of weapons with the more precise human ones and oriented towards distance combat and the less precise but more powerful alien ones. And often it's even better to stick to the pistol which, thanks to the extreme effectiveness of headshots, is all too effective. Fortunately, the challenge level suffers relatively from this imbalance since the weapon is not always easy to use as some opponents move quickly, charge up, fly around the screen using jetpacks and become invisible. Lights and shadows The 14 campaign missions slip by in about six hours on minimum difficulty and it takes a couple more to complete the title by selecting the intermediate one. Certainly not a record longevity although it is undeniably commensurate with the low price, but an extra pinch of variety in the gameplay, with only two missions that have variations on each otherAccording to the shoot-and-run formula, it certainly wouldn't have hurt, especially considering that the plot is a mere pretext and doesn't offer great surprises. Fortunately, the aesthetic sector takes care of breaking the monotony, not particularly inspired by the artistic point but still capable of having its say. With Alien Rage, City Interactive has passed from CryEngine 3 to the Unreal Engine but has not given up on using practically all the graphic effects available of the adopted graphic engine. The polygon count is certainly not that of a next-gen title, but the maps are rich in detail and are characterized by very wide views, made suggestive by a multitude of sci-fi lights and enriched by enormous moving mechanisms. All seasoned, as we anticipated, by graphic effects in quantities that include shock waves, explosions, lasers, moving spaceships, particles, puffs of credible steam and an unbridled but spot on use of the ~depth of field~. The lighting system is valid, the animations are not bad and the impact of the shots is precise and returns excellent sensory feedback. And all this also applies to multiplayer although in this case the rooms full of explosives that distinguish the single player campaign from that of other shooters of the same type are inevitably missing. But while being less spectacular than the single player, and equally lacking in inventiveness, the multiplayer is solid thanks to a more than good netcode, integrated chat and audio feedback that clearly indicates the hits that have been successful. The gameplay, by the way, is not bad. The spawns are well distributed and the combat offers various satisfactions thanks to the mix between a tactical approach, due to the lack of super weapons and the limited jumping distance, and intuitive gameplay, devoted to frenzy and direct confrontation. Unfortunately, despite the potential and a large number of maps, the competitive component of Alien Rage is lost in cosmic nothingness due to the only two modes available, both of the deathmatch type, and due to the almost total lack of customization. A real record in terms of poverty and a waste of resources that could have allowed the team to enrich the single player component.", "date": "2013-09-26", "grade": "7.0"}
