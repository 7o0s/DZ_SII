Basically it is a celebration of vertical shooters in which, at the controls of Kang the Crazy's Dragonfly, we will have to rout the enemy squadrons by shooting at them like crazy. We will then be able to enhance our vehicle with various powers, which can be selected before tackling the different levels: for example, we will be able to invoke a firestorm on the screen or we will be able to erect a barrier in our defense. In the Imperial city we will be able to face a real series of quests dedicated to the Dragonfly. These levels aren't particularly well done... but they aren't too bad either. Let's say that it's a welcome extra for all those nostalgics who love the genre and for those who don't mind going ~off topic~ while playing. Shooter what a passion One last note: in the main menu it is possible to access the Dragonfly levels without necessarily having to enter the actual game. Some of them, however, will be blocked. The way to unlock them? Complete the main campaign. Character management Speaking of fighting styles, these are divided into various categories: martial styles, with which you fight hand to hand against opponents and are effective against all enemies except golems; support styles, which provide additional effects, against only human enemies, such as slowing or being able to drain Ki; weapon styles, which, as the name implies, allow you to use one or two weapons to fight and are effective against all enemy types except ghosts; magical styles, instead allow you to exploit the elements to your advantage, are effective against all enemies except demons; finally, the transformations allow you to turn into a demon or a golem taking all the characteristics, including disadvantages (for example, the aforementioned jade golem is very powerful but very slow). The real fulcrum of the gameplay consists in creating your own way of fighting, enhancing some styles rather than others, favoring those that exploit your own characteristics (it is useless to enhance styles with weapons if you have only increased the Ki) but trying, at the same time, to have a set of skills suitable for dealing with any situation. Jade Empire revolves around many character micromanagement choices, such as those just described which, put together, still create something complex and satisfying enough to make it a cut above many other titles of the same genre. Another example suitable to demonstrate what has just been said is the choice of the companion to take with us on our peregrinations. During the course of the game we will meet many more or less friendly characters. Some will attack us, others will plot against us, others will entrust us with quests and still others will follow us for more or less noble reasons: Dawn Star, Black Whirlwind, Wild Flower, Sky, Silk Fox and others each have unique characteristics which make them useful in combat depending on our style. All can be used to attack enemies or to support the character, except Black Whirlwind who can only fight. Support can take place in various ways: there are those who restore the Ki, those who concentrate, those who allow you to use a unique and very powerful fighting style, those who, on the other hand, will increase the damage of martial styles and so on. Support characters are interchangeable while exploring the map, but not while fighting, which makes it essential to choose how you want to be helped in combat by figuring out what dangers will come your way. Then there are special companions such as Kang the Crazy and Zin Bu The Magic Abacus who have unique functions within the group: the first is the builder of the Dragonfly and, by speaking to him, you can access the flight bonus sections; the second is an envoy of the gods who carries out the paperwork behind your actions (basically writes them down) and who will sell you some more or less powerful objects depending on your progress in the adventure. [C] A fight in the arena of the Imperial City The Necropolis is one of the most successful locations This boss is a bad guy. been more weaker than expected [/C] A creepy character The emperor is a patent arrogant Lots of enemies... but they're not a problem tell me a story The best feature of Jade Empire is definitely its storytellingAnd. We are not talking about the story itself, which in any case is on levels above the gaming average, but about the way of narrating it. As happens in other BioWare games, at the beginning of the adventure the character knows little or nothing about his past. Victim of opposing forces, he will be able to fulfill his destiny only by tearing the veil that covers his life and that of the people around him (it is difficult to talk about narration without being able to mention the various junctions). Transform yourself in this way who can; scare us? Oops... we're dead. It happens. But what a beautiful animal! The plot unfolds along the seven levels that make up the adventure, often forcing us to make ethical choices that place us on one of the two antipodes that will lead to one of the three possible endings and keeping us in suspense and full of doubts until the end. Choosing one's orientation will not be indifferent in terms of gameplay, but it will involve the ideal adherence to one of the two ways: the Open Palm and the Closed Fist; which are basically a representation of good and evil. These two ways of understanding your role in the world will allow you to obtain peculiar powers and quests, as well as allowing you to resolve different situations in a different way; for example, in the second chapter, we will have to choose whether to eliminate some enemies quickly and easily but involving an innocent, or choose the harder path which however will save the latter's life. Similar situations will be repeated continuously throughout the game, both in the dialogues and in the actions to be performed, up to the beautiful ending in which all the knots will come home to roost and, if desired, one can completely overturn one's ~game philosophy~, which is useful especially to see the various endings without necessarily having to replay everything from the first chapter. choosing one's orientation will not be indifferent in terms of gameplay, but will involve the ideal adherence to one of the two ways tell me a story Technically Jade Empire is a remarkable product, especially by virtue of being a port of a title a couple of years old. There aren't real miracles on a visual level, but some settings are very beautiful, for example the Necropolis of the Imperial City or the Emperor's palace, and the new textures don't make you cry scandal as often happens in conversions from console to computer (Capcom, are you listening?). The control system has also been optimally adapted, taking advantage of the greater presence of keys on any keyboard compared to a joypad. In short, we see that the developers, while not revolutionizing the original formula, understood that a crude conversion of an even excellent game would have produced a lot of disappointment in the community of players and they adjusted accordingly, trying as much as possible to make their product enjoyable even on PC. How about a good fight in dreams? A fight to defend this small bridge This is where it gets bad... Special Edition and various defects But let's get to the sore points. Let's say right away that the thing that most disappointed us is that there are very few ~specials~: apart from the graphic improvements there are a couple of new martial styles, one for each path, a new enemy and... that's it. The first two are interesting but essentially useless, the second is well done but it doesn't add much, also because it is rarely encountered. In short, a few more extras would have been appreciated, just to justify the wording Special Edition, rather than being made fun of with these two additions that are not even noticed. Couldn't you do what Lionhead did with Fable: The Lost Chapters? Or add a few more hours of play, perhaps by enlarging areas or adding new chapters? But let's get to the defects inherited from the Xbox version. Jade Empire: Special Edition is a little too easy. Most of the fights are resolved without too many worries and it is often the bosses who disappoint by failing to bear the weight of their fame, including the final boss who went down after a couple of attempts. Things improve when, once the game is finished, you can access the master mode which is decidedly more demanding but which also presupposes the player's desire to play everything over again. Even at this juncture, one wonders where the much-vaunted renewed artificial intelligence is, given that the enemies have never proposed original and particularly demanding tactics that differentiated them from the console version.

Despite having a few years behind it, it remains an excellent product that deserves to be tried even by PC users. A must for lovers of articulated and well-told stories. Pros Engaging storytelling Varied combat system Excellent character micromanagement Cons Very few changes compared to the Xbox version Easy Not terribly long The ways of the dragon are endless Why can't the spirits rest in peace anymore in the Jade Empire? What torments them to the point of making them dangerous to the living? You, in the role of a pupil (or pupil) of Master Li of Two Rivers, will have to face your destiny, overcoming countless ordeals, fighting against ghosts and Lotus Assassins and coming to confront the emperor himself. Your destiny is written in the history of the Empire and the time has come to fulfill it. But remember to turn off the gas before leaving the house... otherwise you risk setting fire to the village. Jade Empire is an action RPG with many veins that winks at oriental culture as seen by an American with a hamburger in one hand and a remote control in the other. In short, oriental culture would never produce such a game and, above all, it would never divide the world into good and evil in a clear way as is done here. Not that this is a criticism of the game itself, mind you, orientalization is a legitimate operation and it's not the first time in history that the West has attempted to read the East. More simply, it is a must to clear away certain clichs and easy-to-consume formulas in order to try to be as objective as possible. At the beginning of the game you must select the character from a list of six predetermined (it is still possible to customize them). Each of them has different characteristics from the others, but since these are only three (energy, mind, concentration) it is possible, by accumulating experience points and choosing to use some gems rather than others, to revolutionize it completely, developing it in an opposite direction to that of departure. The City Imperial Some secondary characters are well characterized Beating this dude will make you lose. get your hands on an exceptional weapon This just to reiterate that the RPG component is secondary to the actual action, and to the ability to use the various combat techniques, which are the real fulcrum of the game. But let's go calmly and keep a cool head, as there are many things to say and with haste we risk becoming bald like one of the protagonists, or like a certain guy from Multiplayer.it whose name I can't remember. The three characteristics we were talking about above are represented in the upper left part of the screen by three measurement bars. Energy (red bar) represents the classic life points on which we won't dwell for obvious reasons, just know that when this is empty you will be trying to reincarnate into a Slavic otter. More interesting is certainly the blue bar, which represents your character's Ki and is used to perform magical techniques: throwing fireballs, petrifying, freezing, to increase the damage of the various combat techniques, to keep the transformation techniques active ( how can you live without turning into big jade golems to give blows to helpless ghosts?) and, above all, to heal yourself. Finally, the yellow bar represents the mind of the character, or his ability to concentrate which translates into the unique ability to be able to accelerate exponentially, which translates, at the gameplay level, into slowing down enemies with a blur effect and desaturation of the game world. A kind of oriental bullet time, in short. In addition to this concentration allows you to use fighting styles with weapons.", "date": "2007-03-08", "grade": null}
