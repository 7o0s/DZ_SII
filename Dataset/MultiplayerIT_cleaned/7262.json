{"name": "Licenza di costruire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/129275-the-lego-movie-videogame-licenza-di-costruire.html", "text": "The idea of a film entirely focused on LEGO and not so much on the individual licenses had been greeted with no small amount of skepticism, then transformed into pure and simple curiosity trailer after trailer, finally resulting in a practically unanimous consensus after the film was finally screened in the halls. Because apparently The LEGO Movie looks like a little girl, and if it is true that it will drive the little ones crazy, it is equally true that it is anything but a children's film. On the contrary, it conveys a profound message, which will touch the heart of the older ones, especially if at least once in their life they have built something with the legendary Danish bricks. We advise you to go see it, in short, and we pass it with flying colors because it is damned funny. The same cannot be said of the videogame tie-in, developed by the always good TT Games following their now canonical formula of ~LEGO games~. Why it didn't hit us that much is quite complicated, so be patient and read the next few lines if you want to know more... The LEGO Movie Videogame finally clarifies what's magical about TT Games tie-ins... It's wonderful...? If there is one thing that unites all opinions on all TT Games LEGO games, whether negative or positive, it is that the writer always and only recommends them to those who are fans of this or that license. We would never have dreamed of recommending LEGO Harry Potter to those who viscerally hate the British wizard, just as it would have made no sense to suggest the purchase of LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean to those who could not stand the films with Jack Sparrow. Keep this premise in mind, because we will be back. The LEGO Movie Videogame, from this point of view, does its job very well, faithfully adapting the story of the film. The protagonist is Emmet, an ordinary minifig who finds himself involved in a hallucinatory mission to save the world from the threat of Lord Business, the bad guy voiced by Will Ferrell. Emmet is ~the special one~ because he has found the Strong Piece and has caught a glimpse of the Business plans, which intends to fill the world of LEGO with glue to immobilize the bricks and marry his cause of absolute order. Emmet, however, is clumsy and even a little dumb, and will have to enlist the help of a series of characters who in their absurdity will prove indispensable: the beautiful Wyldstyle, with whom he will fall madly in love, and the wizard Vitruvius, but also Batman and a whole series of extras that refer to the really existing LEGO games. For TT Games it was easy, they practically played at home since there are already LEGO games with Batman, Superman, Gandalf and so on, and in this sense The LEGO Movie Videogame could be considered as a kind of encyclopedia/crossover that includes lots of minifigs belonging to different licenses. The problem is that it includes many more that come from the film of the same name and are therefore completely anonymous and unknown. The main flaw of The LEGO Movie Videogame is in fact this: there is no link between the player and the film. LEGO games are certainly not gameplay masterpieces, mind you, but they leverage the nostalgia effect and the bond that has been created between players and brands that have existed for years, if not decades. Even the weakest license among those proposed by TT Games, Pirates of the Caribbean, counts at least four films! In short, Emmet, Wyldstyle and associates have existed for too little to push us to play in their shoes and to collect legions of characters, well, useless. And then there is another problem, namely the fact that The LEGO Movie Videogame translates the film too slavishly, interspersing the various levels of sequences taken from the film and transforming some key scenes into interactive sequences such as the initial musical or the final battle . In short, anyone who has seen the film will know exactly what to expect, and this greatly undermines curiosity and the stimulus to continue the adventure. You could say that all the other LEGO tie-ins also reproduced the important scenes of films such as The Lord of the Rings and the various Harry Potters, and you would also be right if it weren't that, in those cases, TT Games had taken the liberty of making fun of the script, sometimes changing it to tease the story and characters with hilarious results. In The LEGO Movie Videogame, however, this does not happen, and the result is a boring progression with no surprising or memorable moments. Playstation 3 trophies No less than forty bronze trophies, five silver and three gold, crowned by the final platinum: fans of TT Games games will already know that to unlock them all they will not only have to complete the game, but also commit themselves to finding every secret and amass hundreds dthe thousands of bricks. The LEGO Filler From a gameplay point of view, The LEGO Movie Videogame is yet another TT Games proposal that exploits the experiments carried out in the previous games, perfecting them and framing them with some more or less interesting novelties. Which essentially means two things: first, the game is rich in content and well thought out as per tradition; second, anyone who's played at least one of TT Games' most recent LEGO games will know exactly what they're getting into. The fact that TT Games has recently increased the pace of production of its tie-ins has not played much in favor of The LEGO Movie Videogame, released a few months after the excellent LEGO Marvel Super Heroes and a few weeks before LEGO The Hobbit; in fact, one feels the lack of that flicker of originality that gives spice to an abused structure that would need a little more breathing space in order not to saturate its fans. Not that this means that The LEGO Movie Videogame is a bad game, mind you, also because it manages to integrate into the normal scrolling of the levels some good ideas that we would like to see in the next LEGO games, such as rhythmic quick time events and shoot 'em up sessions. There is also space for a nice mini-game, inspired by Emmet's ~powers~, which allows you to build a realistic LEGO model by choosing from the missing bricks indicated by the instructions. However, the development of the various levels follows the process already seen in all the other TT Games games that preceded it: a mixture of platform and action framed by many (sometimes too many) puzzles to be solved using the specific skills of the characters , which will then be combined in ways other than those suggested by the game to rummage in every secret corner of the stages. Returning to the subject of the license, it must be said that some missions of The LEGO Movie Videogame seemed somewhat forced and filler to us, since after all a game that lasts about eight hours had to be inflated based on an hour-long film and barely half. In short, some levels appear too long and rather redundant, and what is worse is that from a visual point of view the game is an almost perfect transposition of the film: this means that each setting has been rebuilt with LEGO bricks and that, therefore , there is no surprise in exploring the scenarios. In short, it is a completely different feeling from exploring the village of Brea or New York in a LEGO style. Apart from this absolutely subjective consideration, the work done by the guys at TT Games is very good as usual, but the hiccup frame rate and the various glitches of the PlayStation 3 version, especially in the most chaotic moments, seem to confirm the impression - already gained in occasion of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes - that the time has come to move definitively to the new generation consoles and express a technical potential which, right now, appears clearly in a precarious balance.", "date": "2014-03-10", "grade": "7.0"}
