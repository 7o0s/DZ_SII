After making us fight in the trenches on the Western Front in Verdun and following the bloody battles on the Eastern Front in Tannenberg, the independent developers have decided to move to the Italian front in the historical period between 1915 and 1918. The new multiplayer shooter video game, available on all new and old generation gaming machines, it bears the same name as the Isonzo river on which the twelve battles between the Italian and Austro-Hungarian armies took place. Despite being an exclusively multiplayer-oriented title, as per tradition for the series, Isonzo wants to offer a realistic experience and make us perceive the fragility of the many human lives involved as the famous Italian poet Ungaretti majestically summarized. It is like autumn leaves on the trees Looking away from these characters for a moment and looking out the window, the writer of this review can see Mount Sabotino, one of the defensive bulwarks for Gorizia next to the Isonzo river. As if that weren't enough, in addition to being born and raised in these areas, the undersigned has relatives from the Carso, another place where thousands of soldiers from both factions lost their lives, from whom I have learned various anecdotes, stories and stories over the years handed down from generation to generation. We can therefore confirm with certainty that all these and other settings have been faithfully reproduced in the video game created by BlackMill Games and M2H. Since this territory was particularly marked by the horrors of the First World War, many enthusiasts still organize historical re-enactments and continue to study, preserve and disseminate the facts, uses and customs of the twelve battles of the Isonzo. It was therefore all too easy to contact one of them, a dear friend who contributed his knowledge of the Great War to write this review and confirm the excellent work of the developers done not only on the settings, but also on the arsenal of weapons. costumes and other elements that characterized these battles. Having made these premises, we hope we have captured your attention and we invite you to continue reading the review of Isonzo, the new shooter game signed by BlackMill Games and M2H with which they want us to relive the bloody battles on the Italian front during the first world War. What is Isonzo? A part of the ~Gorizia~ map inside the Isonzo videogame Before going into our review we have to ask ourselves an important question: what kind of game is Isonzo and what goals did the developers set themselves during the development phase? An absolutely fundamental question, because at first glance the BlackMill Games and M2H game might seem like a classic shooter, clearly not up to the big triple A we often hear about. First of all, it is a production that we can define without too many words an indie, therefore certainly made with a limited budget, albeit by two different development teams who now enjoy a good degree of experience gained with the previous chapters of the series. Comparing Isonzo to a Battlefield 1 or the more recent Call of Duty: Vanguard is absolutely out of the question. However, Isonzo remains a first-person multiplayer title in which we will be deployed on the Italian front during the First World War between the ranks of the Austro-Hungarian army or that of the Kingdom of Italy. But how does it distinguish itself from many others of the same genre? Well, Isonzo doesn't just want us to have a ~run and gun~ experience with WW1 uniforms and arsenal. The entire game is designed to emulate, within the limits of a multiplayer game, the frontline experience. It is therefore a tactical and strategic shooter, which rewards teamwork and punishes any attempt at personal heroic enterprise. The player will feel small and powerless in front of the front and will have to act carefully to attempt to penetrate enemy lines in a well-planned offensive. Conquering key points on the map, such as elevated outposts, bunkers with machine gun emplacements and command centers to obtain new respawn points will be crucial to ensure the advancement of our platoon towards victory. Game modes in different environments The Soa Dolomites Have this idea of gameplay and structure very clearof game is fundamental to face the bloody multiplayer matches of Isonzo. The main game mode with which they wanted to simulate the typical trench warfare of the Great War is called Offensive. During the review it was also the only mode available, but as happened with the other titles in the series, we expect other modes to be added in the future, such as the classic team deathmatch or all-against-all. However, the Offensive mode remains the focal point of Isonzo with its peculiar structure designed exclusively for a title of this type. Inside the video game we will have three different settings available, inspired by as many distinct phases of the First World War on the Italian front. Those who have studied a little history will know that the conflict between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy has moved from the Isonzo to another river - the Piave. This heavy defeat, the ~defeat of Caporetto~, allowed the Austro-Hungarian forces, with important help from the German army, to penetrate the enemy lines and advance several tens of kilometers towards Milan. The developers of BlackMill Games and M2H therefore wanted to replicate different war scenarios, very distinct from each other in the conformation of the terrain and therefore also strategically from a military point of view. In particular we find the Mountain War, set in the Dolomites, the Strafexpedizion with two maps dedicated to Cengio and Fior and finally the Sixth battle of the Isonzo divided into three settings: Carso, Sabotino and Gorizia. On Mount Sabotino featured in the Isonzo game The Offensive mode therefore places us among the ranks of one of the two armies covered by the game. Unfortunately, the German one is also not present, despite having played a fundamental role in the clashes represented within the video game. However, we understand the willingness of the developers to create two distinct factions, without a third wheel that would have made balancing more difficult. For each setting divided into several maps, we will be called upon to face two or three games in which we will move following the chronological order of the offensive. For example, in the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo we will pass from the Carso to Sabotino and then cross the river to Gorizia. If the attacking army wins a battle, in the next battle it will have more tickets available to fight again. Offensive mode The tool for cutting the barbed wire on the front But how does Offensive mode work once you take to the battlefield? Each game consists of 48 players, 24 for each army. Should there be free slots, these will be occupied by bots to ensure a good balance in the number of players. In online matches there will be one army that will have to carry out an offensive, while the other will have to try to stem it. The objective of the attackers will be to advance, passing between the holes dug by the enemy artillery, the barbed wire and the dangerous trenches where bloody hand-to-hand combat will take place. There will be key enemy points on the map, so the attacking army will be called upon to conquer them with numerical superiority, or by detonating a bomb. Once the objectives have been conquered, the front will move until the attackers run out of all the tickets made available to them for respawns. Between the two armies on the map you will also find various points of interest, such as places to place barbed wire, mortars or command centers from which artillery interventions or a gas bombardment can be called. Told in this way, the Offensive could strongly recall the Rush mode of the Battlefield series, except that this game also features a reversal of sides, with the defenders who will be called to attack. When the attackers are strongly repulsed, the defending army will have the opportunity to implement a counter-offensive and try to regain previously lost points. This makes the games very dynamic, because both armies will be called upon to both defend and attack. The mortar can be used to displace and destroy enemy lines As previously mentioned, the gameplay is very tactical, because it's really easy to die. In most cases our alter ego will lose his life with a single well placed shot. It is therefore essential to move slowly, with caution and knowledge of the facts in order not to use up the tickets of one's faction unnecessarily. In certain games you may decide to stop next to a mortar to fire shots into enemy lines, in others you will find fstand next to a machine gun to prevent opposing soldiers from overtaking a particular strategic point. In short, a gameplay that is sometimes very stationary, as in fact the Great War was, but no less fun for this. There are clearly also moments in which one must act and charge. Even in this case, however, it is better to do it by thinking with your head and above all by collaborating with the other players. Before attempting an advance we found ourselves having to wait several times for other soldiers to join us and then attack together, perhaps with the cover of a sniper from the rear and some artillery shots to displace the enemy. We then headed to the first elevated post to secure a good tactical position from which to plan the next attack and so on. Offensive on the Karst in the Isonzo game By combining the elements described above, a rather solid gameplay structure is obtained, at least of the key points determined by the developers. However, Isonzo remains an uncompetitive game, because the players have enormous freedom of action. This makes the games very unpredictable and in some cases quite confusing. The gameplay is also influenced by the player/bot ratio present in the game, by the skill of the players themselves and by the ability of the platoons to organize and coordinate themselves in the various phases of the match. If at first glance this aspect might seem exclusively negative, on the other hand we can say that since the matches are very different from each other, we really appreciated the unpredictability of the clash. Classes and Arsenal The uniforms and textures in Isonzo The infantry classes present in the Isonzo are historically accurate and reflect the field forces deployed by the two armies in that specific historical period. For both factions we find the officers, stormtroopers, engineers, Alpini, snipers and riflemen. Each soldier belonging to a class can carry a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, one or more skills, specific equipment and various tools available to everyone. For example, the bandages to heal or the miter saw to break the barbed wire are present in all classes. The two armies have different weapons, but it may happen that a weapon is available to both one faction and the other. This also turns out to be likely, as in those years it was quite common for armies of different nations to have weapons from other countries. All the armaments present have been made with extreme care, both from an aesthetic point of view and from their behavior on the battlefield. However, the developers have also taken liberties, for example rifles cannot be reloaded unless the magazine is completely emptied. However, this is a choice applied more from the point of view of game balance than for an oversight in terms of historical truthfulness. The total number of weapons satisfied us with several very distinct options available for the various soldier classes. Soldiers surrounded by gas in the Isonzo game By playing with a certain class we will accumulate experience points to unlock new weapons, equipment and bonuses. Furthermore, as we advance in level we will have the opportunity to access new uniforms and pieces of armor, which in some cases enhance our soldier. The progression is once again faithful to the development of the arsenal that took place in those years. In fact, we will start with equipment from 1915 and then obtain elements that arrived in the subsequent years of the battle. Having a higher level, therefore also greater experience, will give you advantages on the battlefield. As already discussed above, this could have repercussions on the balance of the games, especially when you find yourself facing a team that is much better leveled than yours. The game contains a fair amount of uniforms and other exclusively aesthetic elements. However, World War I enthusiasts may be disappointed that much of these elements are paid for through microtransactions. Italian army in the Isonzo videogame The use of the different classes is fundamental from a strategic point of view for the outcome of the clashes. When entering a match, each class, except the rifleman, will have limited slots available. This is important for game balance, because there can't be too many officers or too many snipers, which would undoubtedly ruin the game experience. Soldiers of each class will have to try to use their bonuses and skills to help the entire faction. For example the officer can call on the field of b", "date": "2022-09-13", "grade": "7.5"}
