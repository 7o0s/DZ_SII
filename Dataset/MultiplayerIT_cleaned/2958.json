We are in a Greece fragmented into many small kingdoms, in the time of the myth. With the help of the gods Paris, the son of King Priam of Troy, has kidnapped Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, considered to be the most beautiful woman in the world, unleashing a large-scale war that will last ten years. At the head of the Achaean army is Agamemnon, brother of Menelaus, who really did not like the behavior of the kidnapper and his sister-in-law. Along with him a bunch of other heroes, including the fantasist Pelide Achilles, sung by muses or divas, depending on the translation of the Iliad, whose fatal wrath caused endless mourning to the Achaeans and... you understand. In philological terms Troy is the new exponent of the mini-series ~Total War Saga~, whose previous chapter was the questionable Thrones of Britannia, remembered by many as the worst Total War ever. Here things are much better, despite some major problems that we will illustrate by analyzing it. Basically it seems that the developers have failed to amalgamate the various ideas they have put in place to differentiate Troy from the other Total War, penalizing in particular the game structure, despite some excellent intuitions. Game structure In terms of game structure, Troy looks like a classic Total War, therefore characterized by two distinct phases: the strategic one, in which the troops are moved and the cities owned are managed on a general map of the game world, and the tactics, in which you lead armies into battle. At the start of the game, you must select one of eight available factions, each featuring a different main hero, a different amount of resources, and a unique epic quest tied to the selected hero. However, the ultimate goal is the same for all: to destroy Troy or to defend it. In this sense A Total War Saga: Troy presents itself as the most guided chapter of the entire saga, in which all efforts end up converging in a single direction, although the gameplay itself remains open to the initiative of the player, who can choose how to behave to defeat Ettore and his. Divinity The scenario of Troy is a mixture of mythology and realism. On the one hand there are game systems that draw liberally from the epic tale, involving the divinities of the Olympian pantheon and their influence on heroes and armies, on the other Creative Assembly has carefully avoided introducing fantastic creatures, despite having kept the nomenclature. So giants, minotaurs, centaurs and so on are just men with peculiar characteristics, which are reflected in their way of fighting. For example, the giants are rough and hairy big men, while the centaurs are mounted troops, particularly effective given that for the rest of Troy there is no cavalry at all. The deities are the best and most successful novelty. Basically, the player must be able to obtain their favor by building temples dedicated to them and performing sacrifices in their honor. In this way, different passive bonuses are obtained, very precious in battle or in the simple micromanagement of our kingdom, such as improvements in production or special units. Pleasing the deities is demanding and costs a lot of resources, but in the long run it proves to be the best choice to have advantages over the opponents. Furthermore, it is a system that is well integrated into the game, which increases the depth of the gameplay without distorting it. Resources There are five resources that determine the wealth of our possessions: food, timber, bronze, stones and gold. Each owned city produces a certain amount of them, with some specializing in specific fields. In the event of a shortage of a given resource, it is possible to use diplomacy to make exchange agreements with the other factions, with the latter giving more or less value to certain resources depending on their availability. Diplomacy is one of the weaknesses of the game. The factions led by artificial intelligence have the strange tendency to torment us with continuous and often absurd requests, demanding help even when they don't strictly need it, without respecting the balance of power. In the fortieth turn, a faction with two cities that threatens another, ours, with more than fifteen cities, to have a little bronze brings joy, as it brings joy to see the AI guide moving its troops in an anomalous way for whole map, almost as if she were undecided about what to do. The main resource for maintaining the army is food, while the rest are mostly used for recruitment and construction or extermination.board of buildings. In the event of a food shortage, troop morale will drop below zero and our armies will start to suffer defections. Avoiding growing the army beyond the guard level is one of the biggest worries of the initial stages of each game. As the rounds go by, the situation improves and, having extended one's possessions to the other provinces, the latter always formed by a capital and some minor cities, resources become a less felt problem. After all, it is precisely the resources that guide the initial conquests, directing the player's expansion towards the regions that guarantee the necessary supply. However towards the middle of the game the sources of resources are so numerous, between territories, buildings that increase productivity, edicts that reduce army expenses and more, that you can focus on the military aspects, in particular on collecting strength to go and take Troy. Battles When trying to conquer a city or facing a rival army, you can go straight to the battlefield. In reality, you can also opt for the automatic resolution of the clashes, an excellent option if the forces in the field are unbalanced and you don't want to waste time. But what would a Total War be without mass battles? Those of A Total War Saga: Troy do not differ much from what has been seen in the other chapters. The interface remains identical, as well as the phases in which the battle is divided: troop placement, battle and resolution. The most relevant change is the absence of cavalry, which forces us to rethink the use of some units, such as those armed with spears and shields, which can alternate in defense and attack depending on the occurrences and which are unusually fast (after all Achilles, the fastest hero, is armed with a spear.) Let's say that the clashes take place largely between infantry units, which is not bad, given the era represented. The latter are divided into classes and react differently to the terrain they are on. On smooth terrain, heavy units have great advantages over light ones, but when fighting in a swamp, for example, it is the latter that have the upper hand, as they are slowed down less by adverse terrain. Their heroes are less decisive than the focus of the game on their presence suggests, to the point that it is more convenient to equip them with skills that influence the whole army, rather than focus on those that enhance them individually. Their impact on battles is decent overall. So don't expect them to be able to resolve a fight by themselves. Sometimes we even end up forgetting they are there. Strange given that instead in the strategic phase they are the absolute protagonists and it is around them that all the campaigns develop. During battles the artificial intelligence proves to be much more adept than on the strategic map. After all, after so many Total Wars it is no longer surprising to see rival armies try to surround us or actively exploit the resources on the map, such as hills or woods, to gain advantages. As always, we'll have to move our armies with some sense, developing tactics in real time to compensate for the opponent's moves. Moving your entire army at once is never an option, at least not when you're close to the enemy. Instead, it is better to address the individual units, perhaps pausing the action to take the right time, so as not to be overwhelmed. This is especially true when assaulting the walls of a city, where you are usually targeted by enemy defenders right away and you have to move quickly and decisively to limit losses. Let's say that the battles are the most successful phase of the game... shame about the lack of battles at sea. In a scenario where units move a lot on water, something could have been done to take advantage of this element. Problems A big problem with A Total War Saga: Troy is the return of agents. The last few chapters had been cleansed of these annoying units, but here Creative Assembly has decided to reintroduce them, but failing to eliminate the profound annoyance they represent. Basically the agents, whether priests, spies or wanderers, function as if they were a kind of intelligence, performing various actions on rival cities and armies to weaken them and, perhaps, cause some insurrection. On paper they work perfectly, but when you find yourself with dozens of agents roaming the map and, consequently, with dozens of notifications for their actions, the slowdown they produce in gameplay becomes really annoying. Soon we find ourselves dreaming that they vanish into thin air. Of course, inin this way the strategic phase would lose some weight, but the satisfaction of being freed from it would be infinitely more satisfying. After all, a single agent costs more than an army of giants in terms of food per turn, so it's not even trivial to keep them. Another problem with Troy is its funnel structure. Creative Assembly has done everything to add variety and make each faction unique, including epic missions, peculiar characteristics of the heroes and so on. Too bad, however, that the goal for everyone is always the same, namely the destruction of Troy, and, therefore, the final stages of each game inevitably end up similar, whether you have chosen the diplomatic path and bring the attack together with a large number of allies, whether you have opted to expand as much as possible and carry out the final mission practically alone. This makes Troy much less flexible than other Total War games. So, after having exhausted the campaigns, the incentives to play are a little less and the heart leads back to the larger and better structured Three Kingdoms and Warhammer 2. Cosmetics Graphically, Creative Assembly has done a fluctuating job: on the one hand it has carefully reconstructed the armor of the time, aiming for good realism for the individual units and armies, on the other it has not exploited the scenario as it could have, making choices very conventional stylistics. In fact, apart from the various menus, the sky of the strategic map, designed as if it had come out of a Greek ceramic, and a color palette that recalls them, everything else is really anonymous, even when well done. In particular, the heroes seem to be heroes by chance and do not stand out in anything, apart from the armor that seems to suggest their status and, in part, their character. Speaking of pure technique we are faced with the usual, great work of Creative Assembly, which as always stands at the top of the genre. In particular the battles, which see hundreds, if not thousands of units confront each other at the same time, are a spectacle. Known show, since it doesn't differ much from that of other Total War, but always effective in a genre that has never made pumped graphics its strong point. The substance is that A Total War Saga: Troy inevitably appears as a minor Total War, one of those with which you have tried to do some gameplay experiments, but without believing it much. It is certainly better than the aforementioned Thrones of Britannia, Total War for dummies, but it is certainly not one of the essential chapters, the ones without which one could not live happily. Having been given to the players there is little to complain about, but the bitterness of being faced with only a good title which however seems to lack the favor of the gods remains.", "date": "2020-08-14", "grade": "7.0"}
