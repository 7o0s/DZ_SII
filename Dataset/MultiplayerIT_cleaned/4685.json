Incredible is the adjective that best matches the results of Rainbow Six: Siege in the last year. Few would have bet on it and instead the community, demonstrating attachment and support even when things weren't exactly going great, convinced Ubisoft to believe and insist on the project. The results are there for all to see for a title that has received constant free updates and above all aimed at improving the gameplay from time to time. It all started with Operation Health but Blood Orchid takes it a step further by modifying so many of those elements that it profoundly changes the metagame, without giving up the foundations that the community liked so much. Almost a week has passed since the launch of the third season and although players are still getting used to the news and the many balances we can already make a judgment on this huge update. Intense development Let's start with the essential information: the Operation Blood Orchid update, followed by another patch for further fixes, weighs the beauty of 42 GB on PC in case you want the complete package containing HD textures, 26 GB for the update normal and about 15 GB instead for the update on Playstation 4 and Xbox One. It is fortunately not a cumulative update to the client present on your hard drives, which translates into a lower weight of the game thanks to the optimization of some elements. Excellent news especially for those who play on consoles, with an increasingly tight space to deal with. The optimization also brings some improvements in performance, especially as regards loading times. Mesh and Texture have been made lighter, weighing less on memory and transforming some very heavy maps, such as Kafe Dostoyevsky, into settings that are better digestible even by slightly older systems. Unfortunately on the best performing PCs all these changes will be almost irrelevant but those who are used to playing on medium / low-end PCs will notice significant improvements in almost all environments. However, be careful not to confuse these optimizations with a reduction in general quality, given that Rainbow Six: Siege continues to maintain itself on the standards dictated by its release, indeed, many small tweaks cannot fail to escape the most attentive eyes. Staying on the subject of Texture, in fact, many of the pre-existing operators have been revisited to align them with the new inputs and the visual impact has been perfected thanks to a solid update of the construction of the skeleton for the animations, further improved compared to a few months ago. In short, this Blood Orchid is a real revolution and classifying it as a simple DLC would be at least reductive, if not completely wrong. A work of this caliber on a free update is not usual to see but the technical and aesthetic changes do not stop at the operators alone. The most important change is related to the new lighting system, which has moved away from realism to offer players better gameplay. In fact, it is now possible to see through windows and cracks without being blinded by excessive reflections and lens flare, a solution that has led defenders to act more aggressively than in the past, being able to anticipate the movements of the attackers or at least have the same chance of hitting first. Also improved reflections on surfaces and even the effect of smoke grenades, a defect that Rainbow Six: Siege has been carrying since its very first appearance. Now the smoke is thicker and more credible but above all it is read correctly by the client making it displayed in the exact same way to all the players in line of sight, which unfortunately did not happen before, giving unwanted and random advantages. Balances, tons of balances It's practically impossible to tell you about all the improvements and changes made to Operators and weapons with this patch. Just know that all guns have been revised: we have different values for the number of ammo and magazines available, a leveled effectiveness for all burst weapons, and a different placement of the sights for some classes. Given these massive changes, Ubisoft then decided to do a complete reset of all the settings, which will force you to review the setup of each available operator. However, Blood Orchid also brings new content ranging from simple skins for weapons and various equipment, passing through a new map up to an attacking and two defensive operator. As far as operators are concerned, we don't want to go into too much detail since a few days ago we already offered you a broad overview of thisthat they are able to do, putting their strengths and vulnerabilities at the center of attention. Just know that Lesion, Ela and Ying bring new gadgets and your new favorite operator could be hiding among them. For example, we found ourselves particularly well with Lesion, a Chinese soldier who can place invisible poisonous mines on the floors and capable of devastating attack teams thanks to a silenced shotgun with an exaggerated rate of fire. Ela, on the other hand, is armed with flashbangs that can shoot through walls (a bit like Fuze does with his grenades) while Ying places bombs that stun and briefly blind the attackers. Perhaps we would have preferred a little more variety between the features of the new grafts but we can't complain about the addition of three characters who are still played in an extremely fun way and who have brought a lot of fresh air to the servers of game. A new map is also arriving: Theme Park, however excluded from the competitive circuit of the new season, and which we will see in more detail tomorrow with a completely dedicated article. Just know that the setting is, as can be easily understood from the name, that of a huge Chinese playground and for this reason it presents a variety of situations probably superior to all the other maps seen to date. There are areas lit only by the faint light of candles and perfect for ambushes, other much more open areas that allow clashes from medium distance and obviously there is also a good verticality, classic in Rainbow Six Siege, for a package that really has very few weaknesses. There's really no complaining about how Ubisoft is treating both fans of Rainbow Six: Siege and the aforementioned title. User feedback seems to be the main driver of all the changes and the game continues to improve season after season thanks to targeted content and updates. In short, Operation Blood Orchid is yet another proof of the affection that the French company feels for this production, especially if we consider that all these innovations continue to arrive on the servers completely free of charge. Therefore, we can only promote this expansion too, advising you to try the three new operators and test the new map, for sure you will find something to keep playing for a long time to come. Great job Ubi!", "date": "2017-09-09", "grade": null}
