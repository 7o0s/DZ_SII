{"name": "Golden Axe: Beast Rider - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/golden-axe-beast-rider-recensione.html", "text": "Game mode In addition to the story mode, Golden Ax: Beast Rider offers us the possibility of playing the stages already completed, individually, in the ~challenge~ mode (in this situation, we will be able to use the extra weapons and costumes earned during the adventure) or to try our hand with ~the trials of Tyris~, or six very challenging arenas, full of enemies that arrive in waves, as in a sort of survival. Everyone is crazy about Tyris Flare On the occasion of this remake, the plot of the original Golden Ax has been practically rewritten from scratch: the beautiful but lethal Tyris Flare sees her tribe exterminated by the army of the powerful Death Adder, who, not happy with the destruction caused, also captures the white dragon protector of the amazons. Motivated by the desire for revenge, the warrior then sets off in search of the evil tyrant: only killing him can appease his anger. But how can you kill what is in all respects a supernatural being, coming from the underworld? The answer is provided by lord Gilius Thunderhead, the strongest fighter that the dwarves have ever had: Gilius gives Tyris the legendary Golden Axe, a magical and extraordinary weapon, which has been reduced to various fragments by the Death Adder himself but which can be reassembled to regain its power. In command of the Amazon, we will therefore have to face thirteen stages divided into various sections, exterminating all the enemies that we will face and taking advantage of the help of some beasts that we will sometimes be able to ride. As the title of the game states, in fact, in some cases we will have the opportunity to jump on the back of four very different types of creatures: a sort of lizard capable of spitting fire and hitting opponents by twirling its tail (just like that of the original Golden Axe); a strange cross between a billy goat and a tiger, who can make himself invisible and shoot bolts from his horns; a massive rhinoceros-like beast, which can knock over anything in its path and create devastating shockwaves on the ground; finally, a being similar to a gigantic gorilla, which with its strength can literally tear enemies to pieces and create whirlpools with its fists. Each beast has an energy bar independent of that of Tyris, which however can be unseated with relative ease and which can count on the support of the creatures only for short periods: we will hardly be able to complete the stages while always remaining on our favorite monster . We will hardly be able to complete the stages while always remaining on the saddle of our favorite monster. Blows here, blows there: what will happen? The structure of Golden Ax: Beast Rider is basically based on fighting, given that exploration is reduced to a minimum and the only puzzles present are quite simple and don't take more than a few minutes. The stages are divided into various phases, each characterized by the encounter with a group of enemies, which gradually become stronger and more numerous. To defend ourselves we will be able to count on three types of attack (~light~ sword strike, ~heavy~ strike and kick) which can be combined in a certain number of ways, as well as executable while jumping. A combo will be enough to season the ground with the blood and entrails of the most insignificant opponents (the game is visually very violent), but at a certain point it will become essential to learn the parrying and dodging maneuvers, which are operated using the upper back keys. When enemies attack, they produce a spark of a different color: if it's blue, then we'll have to parry the blow; if it is yellow, we will have to dodge it; if it's green, we'll be able to do one or the other. Responding to attacks with an evasive maneuver will allow us to counterattack immediately and in a truly effective way: our blow will be crossed by flames and will inflict serious damage on the enemy on duty, even cutting the less resistant ones in half. The problem is that we will almost always find ourselves facing several opponents at the same time, therefore taking damage will become inevitable and the control system will not meet us: although the ~suggestions~ say that we can interrupt a combo to resort to evasive actions, in reality this it doesn't happen and from time to time you have to invent something to resist the charge of increasingly dangerous troops. As in the original Golden Ax, in some moments gnomes will come out and we will be able to hit them to collect food, coins and blue pots: the latter fill an indicator located at the bottom of the screen, which regulates our ability to cast fire spells. We will have two available: a light and directional one, which sees us launch a fireball towards a target that is in front of Tyris, and a ~zone~ one, which hitsall nearby enemies. The third ~magic~ available concerns the evocation of the Golden Axe, which, although incomplete, can be used as a throwing weapon, possibly to destroy statues that act as switches for opening gates and doors. Technical realization As with all the latest SEGA productions, the game uses the Havok engine and shows us typically fantasy locations between villages, mountains, fortresses and deserted plains. Unfortunately, the level of interactivity is reduced to a minimum, in fact the only thing we can destroy are the boxes that contain food or magical pots, as well as sometimes the gates that separate one area from another. There is also an overabundance of invisible barriers, which effectively repress any exploratory ambitions: in Beast Rider we will simply have to go forward and fight, without thinking of anything else. At the very least, we will be able to enjoy the respectable polygonal models: the protagonist is very well designed, and the same can be said of the numerous opponents she will find on her path: the types of enemies are different and always characterized by a certain care. Some warriors even wear armor that needs to be broken piece by piece before being able to sink blows. It is really a pity that during the most agitated situations (for example when two or more creatures are involved together with some character on the ground) there are very heavy slowdowns, which together with the instability of the frame rate (which goes from being very fluid to clicks) indicate an optimization work that is really too superficial. As for the sound, there's not much to say: the music is a bit anonymous, the effects do their job in a dignified way and some take up the original sounds of Golden Ax, which will at least make the nostalgic smile. Comment Gamers are used to remakes that are disrespectful of the originals, unfortunately. These are operations that should be carried out with greater care and attention, respecting the times that were; and instead we find ourselves with products that not only have nothing to do with the original series they are inspired by, but which are qualitatively below average. In the case of Golden Axe: Beast Rider, we have a third-person action game that is valid in terms of character design, but technically inadequate due to the instability of the frame rate and insufficient interactivity with the environment. The combat system has its own why as long as you are facing one opponent at a time, but in melees it inevitably ends up becoming frustrating and limited. And what about the lack of any multiplayer mode? The original Golden Ax provided an important example of this, and it is unthinkable to make a remake in which you play only in single. In short, the new SEGA title disappoints everyone a bit, nostalgic and not: if you want a product belonging to this vein, luckily the competition is fierce and of great quality. Pro Character design well done Riding beasts can be fun Con Combat system very limited in melee Unstable frame rate Often frustrating No multiplayer", "date": "2008-11-11", "grade": null}
