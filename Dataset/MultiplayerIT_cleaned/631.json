Metal Slug represents the pinnacle of Neo Geo hardware exploitation, and in general of 16 bit machines. Impossible to ask for more in any genre of game. Graphic and audio compartment are pushed to the highest levels and border on the incredible in certain situations. Nowadays many may not understand what such a title represents, the artisan programming work that is hidden behind it and the skill of the SNK designers. Metal Slug 5 compared to the previous chapters makes a slight leap forward, refining even more what was already wonderful in previous incarnations. The game immediately appears very colorful, much more than the third and fourth. Despite this, the chromatic choices remain impeccable and skilfully spot on. The first level has very fast scrolling and is set on a raft that sails in the fast currents of an Amazon river, and lets you glimpse a meticulous forest of details, just as the water is full of small effects that a 3D graphics would define as particles. Although many sprites have been recycled, in good SNK tradition, there are dozens of new ones Let's decontextualize it. Immediately afterwards, the first light effects are noticed: the torches inside the temple shine and their brightness is perfectly animated pixel by pixel. Although many sprites have been recycled, in good SNK tradition, there are dozens of new ones. The enemies are completely new, very funny and very comical at times, like the ones with the Aztec masks. But on the other hand irony is a typical feature of this series. Even the ~Slugs~ are new and are animated by God. One is even an Alien2-style bio-armor which, by pressing the down arrow, becomes an assault Tank, transforming itself with an animation that leaves you stunned. The sound trend of the whole game is heavily Heavy Metal, right from the start, until it reaches its peak in the Bosses at the end of the level: huge and bad. It is incredible to note how well the Audio processor has been exploited, which demonstrates its ability to process sounds of unspeakable quality and variety for a vintage 16-bit. The Slugs and the characters As the title itself says, slugs are the recurring element of this side-scrolling shooter. There are new ones, and also very beautiful ones, such as the one mentioned in the previous paragraph. Helicopters, dromedaries and robotic elephants give way to the Spider Slug, a mechanical spider capable of spitting fire in infinite bursts, with devastating bombs for the enemy. Too bad it's not used much throughout the game and we'll find it in some stages unfortunately not very ~full~ of enemies. We will also find the ~Slug Mobile~, with infinite missiles and fire cannons. Instead, we will find the initial Mach almost at the end, and it is perhaps one of the most beautiful Slugs ever: double configuration, robot or tank to our liking, simply by pressing down or up. The feeling of devastation is, as usual, the leitmotif of the series. Fulfilling and fun, with its platform phases almost like a Super Mario. The selectable characters, including the legendary Marco, have a new move: the slide. Pressing X and Y together will perform a nice slide which in the most chaotic situations allows the player in difficulty to extricate himself from the enemies. Finally, the story is only the pretext to take us to the war field: the usual criminal organization has stolen the construction plans of the Slug and is building huge Robots to be able to conquer military domination. Let's contextualize it Metal Slug in 2006 means many things. First of all, 2D is not dead, and still has its small market of enthusiasts. According to the fact that there are still real video game ~craftsmen~ who, untied from large corporations and ever more powerful hardware, continue to work with limited resources, managing to obtain astonishing results. This is the point, the amazement. Although few can appreciate the work that SNK has done with the latest Metal Slug, the vast majority of people will cry foul seeing such a ~backward~ title running on high-performance hardware such as Xbox or PS2. Each game should be played on its original machine, but above all in its historical context Let's contextualize it Each game should be played on its original machine, but above all in its historical context, to be better appreciated and to receive fair criticism. However, it is possible to make a comparison between Metal Slug and modern titles, such as Alien Hominid, a very entertaining title in the same genre that introduces high resolution. Metal Slug is a ~primitive~ game, past, which unfortunately or fortunatelyna always proposes and repeats the same concepts and the same game mechanics. For this reason it can be a bit past even from the point of view of playability, always green, fun, but the same for a little too many years. Comment Metal Slug 5 is a great arcade shooter. However, it arrived on the mass market with a huge delay compared to its arcade counterpart, which was also technically behind the rest of the competition. Despite this, it is an extremely enjoyable title, albeit short (it is precisely an arcade), but only for those who love it madly or who have never tried it. In the latter cases it can represent a very pleasant surprise, as well as for lovers of retrogaming and 2D, which never gives up and is not dead yet. Fortunately. Pros: Simple and fun gameplay Great 2D graphics for the hardware Sound pushed to the max Cons: Outdated title Very short, it's an arcade Some slugs are rarely used Cross-platform Metal Slug 5 is available for both PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The versions are virtually indistinguishable, the choice will therefore depend on which of the two joypads you prefer or on the console you own. Neo Geo dies hard.. and it still pays off A few years later, Metal Slug 5 arrives on our TV screens. The original came out in 2003, on 16-bit Neo Geo hardware. Today it is proposed again, for all those who missed it in the arcade and for those (many) who had not bought the Neo Geo cartridge, at a budget price with an obviously impeccable conversion, given the hardware disparities to the advantage of the machine Microsoft. Metal Slug is a historic title, loved, very famous even today. However, reviewing it represents a real challenge, as it is a valid game, but now proposed in a period too distant from its original context. Already in 2003 Metal Slug represented an anachronistic title, different in some ways. We try to play this title in two ways: the first by decontextualizing it from modern times, the second by inserting it in the modern videogame panorama, far from the glories of the bitmap and two dimensions.", "date": "2006-02-06", "grade": null}
