Rocket League immediately won the favor of the general public, reaching 40 million players within three years. The console versions therefore arrived, inevitable, and a further expansion of the public, season after season, until the acquisition of the team of development by Epic Games and the remodeling of the economic model in the free-to-play format, which brought the game to almost 100 million players. Only iOS and Android devices were missing now, but how to adapt that type of gameplay to touch controls and a small screen? The answer to these questions in the Rocket League Sideswipe review. Contents Rocket League Sideswipe, shots become more spectacular depending on the impact If you remember the announcement of Rocket League Sideswipe, you will know that the game does not try to adapt the original formula of the Psyonix title, but reinterprets it, placing it in a more contained and strictly two-dimensional context, with challenges lasting two minutes that reach involve a maximum of four participants in three different modalities. After completing a short tutorial that will immediately make us familiar with the touch controls of the game, from the start screen we will be able to access the Duel mode, with its one-on-one clashes ; to the Doubles mode, for highly spectacular couple challenges; or finally to the Hoops variant, in which instead of the nets we find baskets, with all that follows. Rocket League Sideswipe, the Hoops mode with its baskets Similar to the original Rocket League, winning games allows you to earn experience points, level up and unlock cosmetic items with which to customize your cars or user profile, as well as virtual currency with which to purchase further embellishments. In short, the freemium mechanics of Rocket League Sideswipe are decidedly elastic and not at all oriented towards pay-to-win. Despite this, the sense of progression is perceived in a concrete way from the first games, the list of objectives is quite rich and includes also the Rocket Pass of the first season, which has just begun. It is also nice to spruce up your vehicle with colored rims or an alternative exhaust, as well as freely change the color of the paintwork. Gameplay Rocket League Sideswipe, a flying finish to the net Of course the outline and progression are important to keep the interest in the game alive, but it is the gameplay that dictates the law and this is especially true for a title like Rocket League Sideswipe, which on the one hand inevitably simplifies the dynamics that fans of the Psyonix little gem know it well, asking us to push the huge ball into the net more times than our opponents; on the other it does not give up a certain degree of thickness. The controls are extremely simple: a repositionable virtual analog stick, located on the left side of the touch screen, allows you to move and orient the car, while on the right side of the screen there are two buttons : one for jumping and double jumping, the other for a turbo regulated by a special indicator that recharges only when the wheels touch the ground. There's no need for anything else: combining these commands and adapting the actions to the physical context of the game immediately creates literally explosive situations, in which perhaps you can already go online with a well-calibrated first touch or make saves that you define ~ borderline~ sounds euphemistic. The fact that the control system is absolutely precise and responsive, of course, is vital for the success of the experience. Likewise, the matchmaking works well, it's fast and effective and it seems there are always opponents ready to challenge us. Not only that: their ability is selected with a minimum of criteria to create challenges that are as balanced as possible, and you will easily realize this after a couple of initial matches in which you will massacre your opponents by winning by three goals to zero , only to come across decidedly more cunning players. Graphics and sound Rocket League Sideswipe, a spectacular aerial evolution The transition to the two dimensions inevitably reduces the visual impact of Rocket League Sideswipe compared to what is available on PC and consoles, but nevertheless the developers have done a great job in making the graphics of the game as pleasant as possible and at the same time avoid commit too much the GPU of your smartphone or tablet, which in fact never ends up warming up. The sound sector can count on a piece of the electronic genre, which accompanies the action in a lively way, but without being too intrusive. The audio effects, for their part, try to make the most of the many impacts that occur on the screen but end up a bit too often muted.", "date": "2021-12-05", "grade": "8.0"}
