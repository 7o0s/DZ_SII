{"name": "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grand-theft-auto-vice-city.html", "text": "Cheers! Action! Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a third-person three-dimensional adventure in which the player takes on the role of an expert criminal grappling with the daily problems associated with the still immature illegality of a stereotypical US city, explicitly modeled on the canons of a Miami made of poignant evening colors and quintals of lead spat out from the barrels (cut off) of inexhaustible shotguns... Tommy Vercetti - the protagonist of the story - is in big trouble, since he had a mountain of money destined for his 'purchased a large batch of coke, and now his boss demands that he take steps to recover all the loot. It's not a delicate business, but Tommy knows how to handle such matters; he needs informers and allies, but it will not be easy to secure the favor of one and the loyalty of the other. In a city dominated by the logic of exchange and violence, Tommy will have to put his own person on the line to track down the money and recover his freedom. Cheers! Action! The narrative cue of the game responds to the most abused clichs of stories dealing with crime, and in general this judgment can be referred to the whole narrative system underlying the Rockstar title, which is populated by an endless sequence of specks whose splendid characterization it reaches peaks of macabre humor that are difficult to narrate. This observation, far from representing anything negative, clearly reveals the full caricature of Vice City: the grotesque colors of the game betray its self-deprecating attitude, preventing it from being taken too seriously. The screenplay, full of references to the cinematic classics of the genre, is marked by the presence of numerous films that intersperse the missions in which the player can try his hand; these interlude sequences, displayed in real time, are the worthy frame that enhances the overall picture outlined by the now famous game structure of the GTA series. Their measure gives us a sample of the skill of the writers of Vice City, always careful not to suffocate the gameplay with endless or too frequent interludes. In such a context, the choice not to proceed with the dubbing of the game in Italian does not arouse too many perplexities: the skill of the original actors (among which Ray Liotta must be mentioned in the role of the protagonist) is such as to justify the simple accompaniment subtitles in Italian; the perceptible vocal nuances, in fact, restore a sensation of acting authenticity worthy of commendation. Inevitably, the written translation fails to convey in their entirety the jokes that the characters dribble on the screen, but nevertheless we can only declare ourselves satisfied with its quality. Music, master! For example, music is the one that travels in the ether and which, returned by the car radios of all the vehicles circulating in Vice City, goes to compose one of the most complete soundtracks ever created for a video game: we are talking about no less than 113 musical tracks belonging to most disparate genres, which infallibly provide an answer to the tastes of any player. Music, understood otherwise, is also the rhythm that permeates all of Vice City's gameplay and that can be freely interpreted by the player. In fact, similarly to what happened with GTA III, Vice City also lends itself as much to a calm and reasoned walkthrough as to a faster and more direct, or even furious, gaming experience. The possibility of facing a disproportionate number of secondary missions, or even that of improvising firefighters or taxi drivers or nurses or policemen and pizza boys, means that the player can always slow down the pace of the narrative, getting lost in the maze of a metropolis that - however much care we may devote to its exploration - it always reserves novelties and unexpected events which soon translate into new stimuli for the gameplay. Vice City, with a larger floor plan than Liberty City, is a gameplay vault waiting for a player willing to break into it. Nothing new under the sun, it would seem, since the above goes without any difficulty even to the previous title of the GTA series; and in fact this Vice City aspires to be nothing more than a game capable of perpetuating all the fun dispensed by that. The protagonist is new, the script and the setting that welcomes the player's ups and downs are new, but apart from these elements, only a few (but potentially fruitful) additions to the game structure should be noted. Alongside a tasty expansion of the fleet made available to TommyVercetti, as well as his arsenal, there is the unprecedented possibility of buying some buildings in the vast Vice City, as well as the need to go inside others to complete some missions. The purchased buildings, then, instantly transform into safe havens from which to direct all the criminal activities of the protagonist. Music, master! Although the figure of the gameplay of GTA is (and remains) anchored to the ~on the street~ action of the player, punctuated by countless car thefts, we can only welcome the timid introduction of similar innovations that we want to imagine fully developed in the inevitable fourth episode of the series; as of now, however, we underline how they contribute to making the life of our digital alter ego even more credible and congruent, designing a city ever closer to being a faithful replica of the real data. Another innovation is represented by the introduction of a new aiming system which, in the intentions of the developers, should make a clean slate of all the perplexities that the one present in GTA III raised and which was the source of the most serious headaches with which he had to do the player. In Vice City the aiming reticle, which can be activated by pressing the R1 key, automatically locks onto the most dangerous target among those positioned within the range of action of the weapon being held, without prejudice to the possibility of selecting a different target using the R2 key. Unfortunately, the reactivity of the viewfinder leaves something to be desired due to the stubbornness with which it remains centered on the corpses of the killed enemies despite the requests made with the aforementioned R2 key and, as if this were not enough, it appears prey to schizophrenia when one has to dealing with a large group of enemies: the evasive maneuvers of the latter do not correspond to an equally rapid repositioning of the reticle, with deleterious consequences on the outcome of such situations. Vice City gives other oddities under the heading ~Artificial Intelligence~, but in this case we limit ourselves to pointing out how certain behaviors of the non-playing characters, policemen on the front line, appear decidedly ~alternative~; although everything can be traced back to the paradigm of non-compromising playability, it now appears decidedly anachronistic - for example - for a law enforcement officer to watch the deliberate and repeated collision of a passer-by or the demolition of his own car impassively. The grand overview of the DMA game prevents capitalizing on such observations in a negative sense. What is certain is that they begin to appear more evident than they were in the past, perhaps due to the fact that the surprise effect on which GTA III could count has been exhausted. Black Rain Even from a purely technical point of view, Vice City carries with it both the undoubted qualities and some annoying defects of its predecessor, thereby revealing how Rockstar's attention has focused more on creating a new ludo-narrative background. Vice City, as regards the graphic sector, is comparable to the first three-dimensional episode of the series; son of a stubborn exploitation of the Renderware engine, it does not differ from GTA III for particular merits. The color palette appears to be more vibrant and bright, and the visual distance is once again impressive. The recurring pop-up episodes do not cause any kind of alarm as they do not affect the gameplay in any way. Stronger criticisms could be brought to the general fluidity with which the impressive game scene is set in motion: often, in the most stressful situations from a computational point of view, the frame rate allows itself to fall downwards such as to cause concern in the player, but nothing more. In fact, the graphics engine always manages to ensure at least decent fluidity, even if below the fateful thirty frames per second. Today as yesterday the metropolis appears alive and pulsating, populated as it is by people who really seem engaged in keeping up with their business; the weather conditions vary in concert with the passage of time, giving the player visual glimpses that border on the sublime during sunsets or certain showers. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is ultimately the worthy half-brother of the epochal GTA III, of which it recovers the many merits and few defects. Although the innovations introduced do not have significant effects in terms of playability, resolving more than anything else in an alibi for the marketing of a title that adds nothing to what was said by theits predecessor, we can only say we are convinced by this umpteenth proof of the skill of the Rockstar guys. We are faced with a compelling game capable of enchanting all gamers accustomed or indifferent to the immorality of the GTA series. A game with extremely violent and vulgar tones but also damnably sarcastic and witty, with a very solid playability that contemplates a disparate series of videogame mechanics within itself; mechanics held together with ease by that quick-setting cement called fun.
