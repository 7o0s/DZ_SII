{"name": "Impatto definitivo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/96004-naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-impact-impatto-definitivo.html", "text": "After offering us a different fighting game from the usual with the first episode of the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja series on PlayStation 2, back in 1995, the developers of CyberConnect2 have gradually adjusted the shot towards the genre of third-person action games, eliminating quite the dynamics typical of beat'em-ups. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Impact presents itself with this new approach, retracing the narrative arc of the anime that goes from the return of Naruto and the kidnapping of Gaara up to the last sagas seen in Italy, for a single player campaign that reaches last about twenty hours, while also including quite a few dialogues in the calculation of the total. The main mode is flanked by two secondary ones with a good number of extra missions, to be tackled alone or with a friend in cooperative multiplayer, which help to draw the picture of a fairly full-bodied product, able to offer Naruto fans PSP owners have long-lasting entertainment, waiting to migrate to PlayStation Vita and/or Nintendo 3DS. The campaign is titled ~Supreme Road~, and is accessed via a Japanese-style main menu, with screens scrolling from right to left rather than the other way around. The structure behind this mode is simple: each chapter is made up of a variable number of missions, which we see represented on a map with Naruto's pawn that can move from one area to another. Even the dialogues, devoid of any interactivity, contribute to enriching the number of missions, and therefore they too must be completed (but it is possible to skip them beautifully, once started) to increase the completion percentage of each section. There are also boxes that are used exclusively for us to earn a card, or the shop in which to spend the money earned precisely with the purchase of these cards, each of which can equip our characters with extra skills. In action The actual playable phases follow the style previously adopted by the Ultimate Ninja series, also on PSP, and therefore see us control a different ninja according to the narrative needs, in a third-person action context where we are gradually provided with instructions on what to do. In the upper right part of the screen we see the scenario map, on which the objectives to be achieved are highlighted from time to time. Often these are handfuls of enemies to fight, almost like in an episode of Dynasty Warriors, but which we will be able to defeat without any effort, despite the overwhelming numerical inferiority. In fact, the lack of complexity of the artificial intelligence of the opponents immediately catches the eye, who limit themselves to numbering and often do not even attack us, standing there waiting for us to eliminate them with some combos. A similar situation occurs with bosses, whose presence defines each mission. Even in this situation, the depth of the fighting leaves much to be desired, the parry becomes almost a superfluous maneuver and in the same way the degree of challenge increases simply because the enemy moves continuously, escaping our assaults and making the clash a sort of pathetic tag. In short, the problems in terms of balancing are evident, and it is not even possible to immediately select the highest difficulty level to make things more interesting: it is unlocked only after completing the campaign at the normal level. The strengths of the experience, at this point, reside solely in the spectacularity of the moves that we can perform. Rasengan! The game control system follows that of the fighting game-style episodes, with the Circle button to perform combos, the Triangle to activate chakra, the Square to throw shurikens and X to jump, while the L and R backbones are used respectively to center the view (which can be managed directly by acting on the d-pad) and to carry out the parry or the ninja evasive maneuver (yes, the one in which the enemy finds himself punching a piece of wood). The attack maneuvers are therefore fairly numerous, although they depend directly on the chakra bar (which must be filled continuously, by holding down the Triangle button - no problem, the enemies don't seem to want to hit us anyway...), and the most spectacular ones start the classic high-impact alternative sequence. The point is that, as in the aforementioned Dynasty Warriors, you have to repeat them endlessly to eliminate the heaps of weaker enemies and then still use the most powerful moves to take out the bosses. A pinch of extra challenge, fortunately, comes from the extra missions, which you unlockno as soon as we complete the first chapters of the ~Supreme Road~. In many cases, in fact, these stages provide for the clash with several bosses in sequence but using a single vital energy bar, which will force us to use the parry, evasive maneuvers and a minimum of strategy to survive. Finally, a few words for the technical sector. The cel shading graphics really work very well for the characters, very similar to those that can be seen in the Naruto anime and equipped with a good set of animations. Moreover, the engine used by CyberConnect2 manages to manage a large number of moving objects on the screen without the slightest slowdown, but the price to pay is high in terms of quality of the scenarios and drawing distance. The latter is in fact very scarce, with trees and walls that appear a few meters away and contribute to the feeling of emptiness of the locations, which in the end must be explored only to achieve the objectives of the moment but leave much to be desired. On a positive note regarding the sound: it is possible to silence Naruto's obnoxious hoarse American voice in favor of the Japanese dub.", "date": "2011-12-01", "grade": "6.7"}
