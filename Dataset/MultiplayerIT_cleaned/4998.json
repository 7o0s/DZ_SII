Available both on PlayStation Vita and on PlayStation 4, the latest title from Gust Corporation and Koei Tecmo Games aims once again to improve itself by delving into some important aspects of the gameplay, but without neglecting the story and the characterization of its pretty alchemist girls, always dedicated to the study of materials and formulas to combine them. Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey is a great alternative for JRPG lovers A new world In this second chapter of the trilogy, the protagonist is the young Firis Mistlud, a young girl who lives in the small mining village of Ertona, a handful of houses built in the bowels of a mountain whose inhabitants are all dedicated to mining. However, Firis is not just any girl but has a sort of sixth sense that allows her to identify where the minerals are located, thus proving to be a fundamental resource for her fellow citizens. Ertona, however, is a small village surrounded by a high wall that has the task of defending the inhabitants, but such a young and curious girl can only feel an immoderate impulse to leave the nest to fly to the outside world and explore its wonders. Parents are obviously against this impulse, afraid of all the dangers that await out there, but one day, meeting a new girl, completely changes the perspectives of the young Firis. In fact, not so much time passes from the beginning of the game that an old acquaintance of ours, Sophie Neuenmuller, protagonist of the previous chapter, bursts onto the scene offering the girl a one-way ticket to the outside world: Alchemy. Learn how to mix the right ingredients to create healing medicines or explosives to defend yourself from dangerous monsters that might attack you. However, the journey to alchemy is not a walk in the park and Firis will have to be able to pass the alchemist exam within a year to finally have her freedom; if she fails, her sister Liane, a skilled fighter with a lot of experience in the world outside the village of Ertona, will bring her home by writing an end to any dreams of changing things. Recipes for all tastes Just the expiry of the exam justifies the reintroduction of the time limits, one of the most discussed game mechanics among fans of the series and abandoned in the last chapters. In this sense, Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey goes against the trend, immediately highlighting the constant threat represented by a counter that flows inexorably towards zero to put an end to our adventure. However, it must be said that after turning up his nose at a basically tedious mechanic, we had to change his mind after a few hours of play, noting that the countdown does not particularly affect the enjoyment of the story given the abundant time available. It is a good compromise that allowed us to play without haste by putting together a good team of alchemists, explore the different locations of the game world, fight the many enemies that have stood in front of us and learn new notions of alchemy that have made it possible to improve our virtual alter ego. Another change compared to the past is the possibility of setting up Firis' alchemical tent near the various outbreaks scattered around the game world in which to rest and regain strength, reorganize the inventory and, obviously, practice alchemy without the need for necessarily return to the city of origin as instead happened in Atelier Sophie. This is an excellent introduction considering that a large part of the gaming experience revolves around the exploration and collection of as many materials as possible. However, the harvest consumes stamina and therefore it is necessary to rest from time to time or near the practical outbreaks or in an inn to avoid losing all the painstakingly accumulated loot. The various alchemical formulas are enclosed within the recipe book, a manual which, in fact, articulates our actions within the game world. There are reported not only the recipes, but also the objectives to be completed to unlock them such as completing a specific task, defeating a rare monster or collecting an object. In this sense, perhaps the most evident limitation of Atelier Firis emerges: The Alchemist and the MysteriousJourney or the inability to be able to offer stimulating and well-characterized quests by always falling back on similar tasks. The synthesis of the ingredients is entrusted to our trusty pot which, unlike what we have seen in the past, is only one and will accompany us throughout the adventure. From here will come healing potions, bombs, pieces of equipment for Firis and her companions, and items needed to progress through the main storyline. Playstation 4 trophies Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey offers 45 trophies, many of which are hidden because they are related to the main plot. To get them all you will need to spend several hours on the game exploring every corner of the game world and unlocking many recipes. Cooking and fighting If on the one hand we have the collection, exploration and combination of elements according to the laws of alchemy, on the other hand the fights cannot be missing, rather standard when speaking of JRPGs. The combat system is a traditional turn-based one which sees at the beginning of the fight the four members of the party line up against the monster on duty in a standard formation with the tank in the front line followed by the other characters. Standard formation because another difference compared to the last chapter is the impossibility of changing the module from offensive to defensive; however, this strategic lack is compensated by the Support Guard system which allows the player to choose which other member of the party will take the damage addressed to the pretty Firis, avoiding her losing her skin in a couple of attacks since in comparison to her companions she remains the weakest of the group. However, this function must be used carefully since the interaction between the characters consumes the Chain Burst bar, also very useful for unleashing devastating fundamental combined attacks against the most aggressive enemies. The result is a rather classic combat system which, although not particularly strategic, is always enjoyable and engaging, without ever getting boring during the dozens of hours of gameplay offered by Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey. On the technical front, the work of Gust Corporation defends itself well, showing off 1080p and 60 images per second on PlayStation 4 and cel shading graphics that go well with the beautiful polygonal models of the main characters. Too bad for the non-player characters who decorate the various locations and as per tradition they are all very similar to each other, sometimes giving the feeling of talking to the same person after moving from one part of the game world to another. In terms of settings, the most successful are undoubtedly the green forests, luxuriant and full of details, the exact opposite of the closed dungeons which for the most part are bare caves that are always the same scattered around the immense game world. The audio sector is excellent with a soundtrack that will constantly accompany us along the adventure without ever being too invasive, while only English and Japanese are available for dubbing, as per tradition. Usual warning instead for localization: texts and game menus are all completely written in the Albion language, therefore necessary to understand the title in all its facets.", "date": "2017-03-14", "grade": "8.0"}
