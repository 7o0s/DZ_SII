{"name": "Kill la Kill: IF", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kill-la-kill-if-recensione.html", "text": "Out of time, and almost six years after its conclusion, it was decided to dust off the anime directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi - the same as the equally legendary Gurren Lagann - to churn out a licensed arena fighter. This was done by exploiting the Arc System Works trademark, a bit like one does with those films in which the name of a famous producer, such as Steven Spielberg, appears on the poster, but which in the end are directed by Ciccio Pasticcio with a penny of budget. Arc System Works in this case has only put the name, because Kill la Kill: IF, developed by A + Games, has little to do with titles such as Dragon Ball FighterZ or Guilty Gear Xrd. Except for the visual sector, because that exists and it's a bomb, but a bit like the original work it is a clash between form and substance, with the difference that the Kill la Kill video game is much less fun than the souls. The alternate history Kill la Kill: IF wonderfully evokes the atmosphere and dynamism of the anime with defined graphics, colorful and full of energy. The cel shading fits perfectly with the style of character designer Toshio ~Sushio~ Ishizaki , reproducing the spectacular and snappy movements of the fighters, the frenetic action and sinuous shapes. If the arenas in which the clashes take place may appear lacking in detail, it must be admitted that during the fights the eye hardly falls on the surrounding environment, also because the interface is constantly filled with large warnings, messages and reminders. We would probably have liked more sophisticated arenas, perhaps partially interactive, instead of simple circular rings, but it is impossible to deny that Kill la Kill: IF is a visually spectacular title both during battles, in which the frame rate does not drop a frame, and during story mode cutscenes. Story mode will be your first approach to the gameplay of Kill la Kill: IF for the simple fact that the first time you start there is nothing else to do. Every other mode must be unlocked by progressing in Story mode, which is divided into two parts and begins with the one focused on Satsuki Kiryuin, student council president of Honnji Institute. The Story mode briefly tells the plot of the anime, making some variations here and there in the plot, which explains the subtitle IF which in Japanese productions usually distinguishes an ~alternative~ version. In reality, the script is simply very condensed and assumes that the player already knows the world of Kill la Kill and its characters well enough, without indulging too much in explanations that make sense of every absurdity, from the ultra uniforms that give the students powers to the Scissor Blades wielding Ryko Matoi and Nui Harime. The second part of the story mode focuses on the first, which is the true protagonist of the anime, accessible only after completing that of Satsuki, and which is practically the same story from Ryko's perspective. As such, it too completes in a couple of hours. The specular structure of the two campaigns, which is already particularly lacking in creativity, has the obvious disadvantage of resulting in a repetitive experience in which the matches between one long cinematic and another are all a bit similar. A+ Games tries in every way to stimulate the player with some variation on the fighting formula, for example by pitting multiple opponents at the same time or challenging him to defeat dozens of Covers in a row, practically sentient suits that nobody wears, even if we were in a musou. In the end, the Story mode fails on two fronts: in terms of content, it is a sequence of uninspired fights with unbalanced difficulty, and on the narrative front, although they are almost indistinguishable from a real cartoon, the cinematics - dubbed in Japanese and subtitled in Italian - are so long as to tire even the most avid fan who knows the best version of the same story, let alone the neophyte who will understand little or nothing of the characters, who are already abstruse in their own business, and their motivations. Naked fights However, completing Story Mode is a mandatory step not only to unlock the other modes - including standard multiplayer and competitive online which, unfortunately, we were unable to test - but also the other fighters in the roster, which numbers just a dozen. including two versions each of Satsuki and Ryko. It's a meager roster even if the various fighters are sufficiently diversified in fighting styles, however there are few truly fun characters to play sincesome are too slow or too limited in the range of their attacks. Unfortunately the Tutorial and the Training mode do not exactly explain the strengths of each fighter, educating the player in a loose way on the mechanics of the game. Fortunately, you don't need a degree in astrophysics to play Kill la Kill: IF, a title designed also and above all for those approaching the genre and want to twirl around the arena in a spectacular way without learning complicated combos. Obviously this approach backfires with the almost non-existent depth of the gameplay. The basic commands are practically identical for each fighter who thus has a melee attack, a ranged attack and a Breakthrough attack useful against opponents who parry too much. Each attack can be chained to the others with an imaginative order that guarantees great freedom, a refined way of saying that Kill la Kill: IF is essentially a button masher in which you press keys at random and everything explodes on the screen, at least pleasing to the eye . Of course, there are the key combinations that allow you to pounce on the opponent and shorten distances in a flash, and the special moves that consume two notches each of the SP indicator four notches below the fighter's vital energy. These spectacular techniques, usually introduced by short cinematics, deal a lot of damage, but perhaps not as much as we would have expected from an attack that consumes a resource shared with another ability called Blood Valor. In fact, the umpteenth key combination consumes at least two notches and serves not only to interrupt an opponent's combo, but also to trigger a kind of cinematic mini-game inspired by the Chinese morra. Each player must then choose a bonus - life energy regeneration, SP meter regeneration, increase to damage dealt - and hope that the opponent chooses the wrong option. The player who wins the Blood Valor challenge earns a star on his portrait and if he manages to get two more he gets a permanent boost that can lead to a kind of Fatality, an extremely spectacular coup de grace that is directly inspired by the cartoon. It is clear that this is a cumbersome and not very intuitive mechanism, moreover much less attractive than the immediacy that the special attacks guarantee, which consume the same SP indicator and fit better into the flow of combat. The problem with the animation that triggers the Blood Valor - and which often fails - and which more specifically affects every moment of the fight is, however, the framing. Kill la Kill: IF is one of those arena fighters that are so fashionable, like the recent Jump Force, with the camera that shoots the action behind the character and who, in this case, doesn't bother to follow him when he moves to the other end of the arena, continuing to frame him from afar. This translates into the objective difficulty of evaluating distances during the conflict: most of the attacks risk failing, especially the special moves or the aforementioned Blood Valor, with the consequent waste of SP notches. In the confusion generated by the screen effects and the frenzy of the animations, Kill la Kill: IF reconfirms its mainly button masher nature, distancing itself from the more technical and reasoned fighting games produced - and developed! - from Arc System Works. It wouldn't be a big problem if the fanservice wasn't limited to the beautiful graphics and the original voice actors of the anime, but unfortunately the extra content also leaves something to be desired, among which only the illustrations to be unlocked by earning points in combat and with which it is possible to compose custom dioramas. A little bit even for the most hardcore fans.", "date": "2019-07-30", "grade": "4.5"}
