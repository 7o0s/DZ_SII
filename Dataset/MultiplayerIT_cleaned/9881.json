The first attempt to compress the excellent Paradise on portable platforms was not received with the utmost enthusiasm: the version adapted to the Nintendo DS had in fact lost the appeal of the original along the way, with incoherent puzzles and a disappointing use of the touch screen. The fact that the Bulkypix guys had based themselves on that porting to create the iPhone and iPod Touch version had so disheartened the press and players right from the start. The platform changes, but the story remains the same: the plane on which Ann Smith, the young protagonist of the adventure, is travelling, crashes in the African country of Maurania, causing the girl a severe migraine and, predictably, a tragic amnesia. The player, starting from the town of Madargan and without knowing why Ann was going to that dangerous place, must therefore explore every corner of the country and interact with the inhabitants of the different cities, in an attempt to return home safe and sound. I remembered this Maurania differently The Last King of Africa opens with an excellent computer graphics film, moreover enhanced by an over the top Italian dubbing; dubbing which, unfortunately, is limited to these rare filmed interludes, totally missing during the traditional gameplay sessions. In the wake of the Nintendo DS version, this new port abandons the 3D game moments of the original Paradise, thanks to which it was possible to move more or less freely in the various scenarios: in their place there are now static backdrops on which it is possible to interact through particular icons. The illustrations of the characters are well done, but too static and unable to give expressiveness to the dialogues which, if we consider again the lack of dubbing, are even more flat and monotonous. Another cold shower arrives with the first puzzles proposed by the game: most of the puzzles offered to the player are absolutely out of context and inconsistent with the scene; having to overcome a guard becomes an excuse for a challenge to a board game, a minigame in which moving bricks inexplicably serves to open a trunk, while the player is forced to go on an absurd treasure hunt to turn on a water heater. But it could also be postponed, except that many of these puzzles have not been adapted in the least in the transition from Nintendo DS to iPhone. For example, a puzzle that asks you to pick a door with a lockpick is almost unplayable with your fingers, while it would certainly be suitable for the precision of a stylus. To top it all off, as if the game didn't already have enough problems, a bad distribution method takes care of it: The Last King of Africa has in fact been divided into an unspecified number of small episodes, and the chapter currently available on the App Store allows to face only the very first part of the adventure; a couple of scarce hours are enough to complete this first episode but not to emotionally involve the player, who will be disoriented by a badly presented and brutally interrupted plot. In the hope of inviting you to replay the same adventure, the developers have well thought out to include a series of unlockable objectives, which however are obtained by simply collecting hidden crystals in the various screens. The game is far too linear, and even if you want it will not be possible to re-explore the old rooms in search of the missing crystals. The tested version is 1.1.
