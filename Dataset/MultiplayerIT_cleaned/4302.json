With the abandonment of the cards of Whispers of the Old Gods, A Night in Karazhan and Mechanic Slums, the decks that dominated the standard format until a few days ago should have disappeared in a puff of smoke, replaced by new interesting and challenging proposals . This, at least, has always been the fundamental idea behind every single expansion. On the other hand, it is essential for a game to know how to renew itself from month to month to keep the user interest bar high, but after all these years it would seem that something, in terms of ideas and originality, has been lacking, returning a strong sense of deja v to those who have already spent many hours on Hearthstone. So Boscotetro is a flop? Surely not, since Hearthstone remains one of the best card games on the market, but something hasn't exactly gone right. Let's try to find out together what and ask ourselves if it can be fixed. New keywords That everything is not as expected can be seen immediately by analyzing the new keywords entered for the occasion. Lackluster as a gimmick, potentially having little impact on the gameplay and generally easy to read even for newbies, the new card powers do not give the appearance of being able to give that extra edge to Hearthstone as it had been for the Death Knights or legendary weapons . In short, there is not an upheaval in the game such as to sweep away the old decks and make new ones arrive and hanging out on the ladder in these first few weeks it is clear how the more solid decks such as Cubelock or Aggro Paladin still do the trick and bad weather. Certainly there are experiments and some classes are back to being usable - first of all the Quest Warrior - but the general feeling is that after this first period where curiosity is the master, the goal will once again flatten violently towards the solidity expressed by the same decks that dominated last season. This is simply because the Onslaught mechanic, which allows allies to attack other creatures as soon as they are played or Echo, thanks to which the same card once activated will return to your hand every time until the end of the turn, fail to drive decks to victory . It must also be said that these mechanics are not entirely new to Hearthstone and this is perhaps the thing that makes you turn up your nose the most. For example, Assault had already been implemented in the Fulminating Gigantosaurus (even if it took it from the battle cry) and a similar concept had already been seen in the Icehowl Yeti while as far as Echo was concerned, Unstable Evolution replicated it on its own. Really new then remain the Worgen that change life and health at every turn while you hold them in your hand and the possibility of creating decks based only on even or odd cards, a real new innovation of this Boscotetro and unique, at least for now, a source of pride . Little innovation but it's the right way It's true, we have been very critical about the new keywords, but the first expansion of the new year is the one that lays the foundations for showing the path that Blizzard intends to follow and somehow we notice the willingness to abandon the much hated randomness in favor of more controllable mechanics. In short, the direction is right, a pity that these good intentions are gradually limited by some single cards that still make fate their most important aspect. Let's talk about the Harassing Crow for example, capable of summoning a two-mana minion every time a spell is cast, or the evil Ciciazampa: the most conceptually incorrect card ever in the history of the Blizzard card game. All the hype these days comes from the power of the aforementioned monstrosity that will replicate every single Battlecry launched in the match. It's a shaman class card and works particularly well only in a certain type of deck, but it creates again that very unpleasant situation where you get to win or lose without being able to apply an effective response and, above all, without the use of any skills particular. Just play a series of cards in sequence throughout the game to ensure victory: really nerve-wracking. To make the situation even worse, it takes the time of the animations that can even take several minutes in turns, an absurdity that really seems to have escaped any type of quality control in Blizzard, despite even Ben Brode having already warned the Team 5 and the same players. Why then release such a card? How is it possible not to notice in advancewhat about the consequences? Mysteries of an expansion that doesn't quite seem to be in its best shape. What awaits us in the future? Taking note of some big problems that this expansion brings with it, the time has not yet come to tear your clothes and throw your card collection into the virtual fireplace, given that the corrections to the most obvious defects should arrive within a few days. Even the balances in the arena are not yet perfect and the new cards, as it was for the latest expansions, are struggling to appear in the draft, leaving the classes that dominated this format until April 12 substantially unchanged, with mage, paladin and thief firmly at the top of the standings. One of the strong points of the Hearthstone experience is still missing and that is that glorious PvE against artificial intelligence which in the last period has been able to fill and fill the moments of tiredness by giving players many extra hours, without the need to spend and giving as I also award some tasty rewards. Let's close, then, hoping that when the changes arrive, the situation on Hearthstone has gradually improved, perfected and varied a meta that seems to always run aground on the proposals of the latest expansion. Perhaps some pieces of the puzzle are missing to understand exactly the future, missteps that Hearthstone can afford not having real competitors on the market, capable as it is of offering a fun and not too technical experience really suitable for anyone.", "date": "2018-04-16", "grade": "7.5"}
