We are talking about Sports Interactive, the study behind the Football Manager series that has managed to wipe out any type of competition. Even those of a certain importance, such as FIFA Manager for which EA Sports hoisted the white flag in 2014. Just as for some time now, Football Manager 2017 therefore also remains for this year the only representative of depth in the historic genre of managerial football, where the fruit of the effort of the group led by Miles Jacobson has established itself with undoubted merit. However, the laws of the market teach that the absence of valid competition can hold back growth: a risk that for an annual brand like Football Manager becomes even more pressing, accentuated by development times that open and close within a few months. After seeing the news of Football Manager 2017 on paper a few days ago, the time has come to find out what kind of experience the boys from Islington have carved out for us, beyond the inevitable update of teams and leagues for the 2016/2017 season with a lot of simulated Brexit. Football Manager 2017 is a solid managerial experience, which however lacks particular novelties Coach life In a title that presents the amount of information that populates its database as its flagship, having the opportunity to effectively enjoy all that it has to offer is not so obvious. As early as Football Manager 2015, the developers embarked on a process of redesigning the game interface, which at the time led to the definition of an overall optimized management experience. The path then continued over the course of these two years, and we believe we can say that it is now complete in Football Manager 2017. Any element you are looking for is now within reach of one - maximum two - clicks from the main menu, which therefore does not hide multiple areas impossible to find. At the same time, the developers have focused on the way in which the game presents us with all the data we need, completing the migration from a predominantly textual representation to one more graphical-oriented, and therefore more understandable at first glance. To give just a few examples, old scout reports on the next game now show clear indications of the type of opposing formation to expect on the pitch, just as injury assessments clearly show us whether a player can be fielded or not, leaving little room for play. 'interpretation. In Football Manager 2017, greater visibility has also been granted to the staff, in particular as regards the various advice that its members come to give us. At periodic intervals, the evaluations of trainers and observers are offered to us in a single screen placed in our inbox, from which we can decide with a simple click whether to listen to one or more recommendations among those made to us. This is a big step forward compared to the cumbersome procedure that was in force until last year, which effectively discouraged the player from making use of the opinions of collaborators. Speaking of inboxes, this year's new features include the section dedicated to social networks, intended in the mind of Sports Interactive to simulate the Twitter feed, where you can read the reactions of the fans and follow players and teams from all over the world . Having glanced at it from time to time in the early game, we can say that we completely forgot about it as time went on, as the posted reactions proved to be quite predictable and without any impact on the other components of the game. New year, old problems The innovations concerning the interface are once again accompanied by a series of interventions on the various aspects of the game, starting as usual from the agreements with the players. The Higuain affair teaches us that every single clause of a contract is to be evaluated with extreme importance to avoid finding yourself unprepared: Football Manager 2017 reflects all of this by introducing pre-contractual discussions, as well as a series of new conditions to be included in the agreement . At this point it is a must to mention the criticisms that are cyclically leveled at the Football Manager on duty: although they are often motivated by subjective standards of realism, to which the game should adhere according to each of us, the presence of prhistorical problems still unresolved. In the specific case of Football Manager 2017 we have noticed a few too many injuries especially in training, even if fortunately we are far from making the career unplayable. As regards the price tags, on the other hand, we point out conflicting experiences, divided between cases in which the evaluation expressed was all in all correct and others in which the cost tended to rise excessively. The economic problem is accentuated when we find ourselves agreeing on contractual terms with players, who are often too demanding due to their age or their actual importance in our squad. We close the paragraph with the dialogues, both with the players and with the press. After the long presentation video we had hoped to finally see something new, but in the end everything is presented again in a rather disappointing way: usual uninteresting lines of dialogue, and the usual desire to send the deputy to answer repeated questions ad nauseum. This time we are really out of time, given that we have been waiting for years for news in this sense which unfortunately do not arrive. Training as announced Unlike last year's edition, the list of modes in Football Manager 2017 does not present anything new. However, it is worth carrying out a quick overview, starting from the Draft mode introduced with Football Manager 2016. In this case, the most important change made by the developers concerns the introduction of coaches controlled by artificial intelligence, thanks to which players intending to try their hand in this way they are no longer obliged to find some other human being to organize themselves with. Although the latter case remains the most engaging to give life to a competition in this sort of fantasy football 2.0, the arrival of the teams controlled by the CPU gives the Draft the opportunity to present itself as a further alternative to the main career, alongside the Football Manager Touch introduced a year ago as an evolution of the Classic mode. The mode that allows you to create a team to be included in one of the real competitions existing in the game also returns, however, made unattractive in our opinion by a series of stakes that do not give way to create a completely personalized company. Engine in great dust On balance, the most evident innovations of Football Manager 2017 are those concerning the 3D engine with which the matches are represented. This year the twenty-two in the field can benefit from over 1,500 new animations, created in collaboration with Creative Assembly. From a graphic point of view, we are obviously far from what is possible to see on the soccer fields of FIFA 17 or PES 2017, but for the first time it must be said that one gets the impression of watching a soccer match without the woody movements that it was possible to notice earlier. Likewise, players stay on the pitch better by avoiding weird positioning or other bizarre things. Some doubts remain about the animations of the goalkeepers, but since they are the most complex ones to create, it is normal that they may require additional work. Steps forward have also been made in terms of atmosphere, with the introduction of a small part that precedes the match, where we are shown the teams entering the field, some warm-up phases and the inevitable handshake between the coaches. Speaking of the latter, in Football Manager 2017 the editor dedicated to our ~character~ returns, enriched with the possibility of uploading one's own photo for the generation of the facial model to be applied to our alter ego sitting on the bench . The end result isn't exceptional, although it must be said that there are other titles where similar experiments have led to far worse results. Returning to the 3D engine, the match is now more appreciable also thanks to the new shot placed behind the goal line, through which to better appreciate both the depth and breadth of the game expressed by the two teams. We also point out the presence of the Serie A and B championships with complete licenses for all the teams involved, complete with shirts and crests. Instead, the Lega Pro is missing. In terms of performance, finally, the introduction of the 64-bit executable makes itself felt: if you notice a general reduction in loading times while playing, you know what to thank.", "date": "2016-11-01", "grade": "8.5"}
