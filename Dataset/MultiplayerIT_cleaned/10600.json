Our friend worked at SNK in its heyday, and then veered sharply, but deliberately, towards a lower-profile ecosystem with independent colors. A very eccentric character, capable of publishing a technically very immature game. And if that technique is only part of the whole thing, it's much more complex to turn a blind eye to game design and general mechanics. Given the affection for Swery, the strangeness of his ideas, his abstruse ways of approaching game design, today we will pretend to be bees and have five eyes, so that we can close them all and try to tell you what went wrong in this title, but also some positive side. Follow us in the review of The Good Life by Suehiro Hidetaka, born in 1973. A mysterious case It would be nice to say that The Good Life offers a beautiful world to explore, but unfortunately it is not The incipit of The Good Life is quite bizarre, as expected: the protagonist, a journalist, finds herself in a remote English village to repay a debt with her agency. Armed with a camera and patience, you slowly enter the happy village of The Good Life, a small cluster of houses immersed in a bucolic countryside. One of the houses, however, is assigned to us as a support base in which to sleep, eat and do other things. So let's get to know the small cast of plot supporting characters, let's get to grips with the controls to soon discover one of the secrets of this village: the inhabitants of the night turn into cats and dogs. But that's not all: going forward, the initial plot will in turn allow us to transform into affectionate quadrupeds when we want. Therefore, it must be said that the story and the setting have their own reason: weird characters and a rural, but sometimes surreal environment accompany up to the first plot twist, a breaking moment linked to a murder mystery that functions as a welcome to the new world of Swery. The plot will thicken, inserting elements related to pagan mysticism, history, religion with a slight background of the occult, albeit always diluted by the colors of the setting, trying to drag you and make you passionate about the story. Well, we could say that the positive sides of The Good Life end here. Lots of design flaws The interlude scenes are quite aseptic and the characters not very fitting Unfortunately, the idea we got is that Swery wanted to insert too many dynamics, but without fully developing one. To give you some examples: the game inserts a photographic system at the beginning in which to track down objectives through tags. The tag of the old piece of furniture, the lit lamppost and so on, in the hope of putting them online on an invented social network, solving some side missions and earning money to buy more. The mechanics is really sketchy and quite rough in its proposition: coming from a five-year period of approaches to photos in video games, what has been inserted by The Good Life seems like a sort of class assignment for game design lessons, with a significant amount of shortcomings. The story recurs in the dialogues, often quite silly, in the gameplay that makes us become a dog or a cat, unfortunately broken in the platforming and very poor in diversity, even resulting in a barely sketched combat system. There is a dynamic linked to the factions they love more dogs as opposed to those who love cats, but here too a lot of inconsistency and little fun in taking part in it, made worse by unclear management of the menus, by the difficulty of crossing the amount of technically useful things to advance the character - such as eating - but very badly explained, as well as managed in a not very fluid and congenial way. A whole structure that forces the player to perform redundant and boring actions. Navigation in the game world is jerky, the open world - and we are paying a compliment - is ill-proportioned and linked to the movements of the protagonist who, instead of simplifying the movements, also add parameters that weigh down the gameplay such as stamina, after all quite useless item accounts. In short, maybe you can even go on in the story, but the heaviness in digesting everything else makes it really difficult to advance or find pleasure in doing a side quest. Technical Problems The platforming phases would also be nice, but the platform design is completely missing Unfortunately playing The Good Life on Switch didn't help: on Nintendo's hybrid console the game is inexplicably technically disastrous. Despite a very small polygonal mass, the work of Swery offers a park of textures, models and anti-aliasing algorithms that, at best, are three generations old. Interpenetrations, frame drops, expressions, animations, ability to transmit village life, visual horizon: there is not a single element that, nowadays and seeing the work of independent teams with clearly less experience than Swery, is frankly explainable with a little reasoning. Sure, the money requested by the kickstarter wasn't (relatively) much, just over 600,000, but was it worth dividing the development resources to make a multiplatform title right away? The writer is very far from applauding the technical elements of the games when they are an end in themselves, but matter instead when they should be an integral part of the experience and in The Good Life, sadly, they ruin the experience enormously. Some parts are clearly two-dimensional, legacies of the 16 and 32-bit generation, others have a number of polygons that can be counted on one hand and being the title in three dimensions, unfortunately, all this emerges with great impact. Let's throw a small spear in favor of the sound sector, which can boast a couple of nice tracks, and Swery's evident desire to paint a world of humans and animals that can affirm his sense of belonging.", "date": "2021-10-14", "grade": "5.0"}
