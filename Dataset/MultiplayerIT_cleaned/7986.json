An apparently suicidal mission, given the very high caliber of the source and the traditional lack of feeling between action games properly speaking and touch support. Yet, this The Gods: Rebellion manages to convince in several respects ... Oh my Gods! Similar to God of War already from the application icon, with the angry face of the protagonist in the foreground to remember the traditional shot of Kratos that opened each exponent of the Sony series, The Gods: Rebellion doesn't get lost in too much talk about it concerning the plot, reduced to the usual clich of the solitary hero who must fight for the salvation of humanity. It's all the better, because the Chillingo product showcases its remarkable qualities right from the very first moments of the game, starting with the graphic aspect. Taking advantage of the Unreal Engine, Calvi Games' work sports a decidedly above-average polygonal cosmetics, more impressive in the overall rendering than in the individual details, thanks to a wide framing cut that makes the characters on the screen rather small. Fluid and varied animations, well-constructed scenarios and commendable visual effects are therefore accompanied by an impeccable frame rate, for a title that is not visually convincing only when it comes to a menu design that is anything but irresistible. Moving on to the field of gameplay, The Gods: Rebellion has the advantage of maintaining a certain humility, inspired by God of War but without the presumption of incorporating all the numerous playful elements that make up the Sony masterpiece: the gaming experience is therefore completely focused on bare-handed clashes, leaving any platform or puzzle nuance outside the door. In the seven levels that make up the package, your task is therefore to proceed until you find a group of enemies, destroy them, accumulate experience, upgrade the character and repeat the process until you get to the inevitable boss fights. As limited as you want, but at least competent in its narrow field of action, starting with a sufficiently varied and articulated combat system to guarantee fun and a good dose of longevity: in addition to the basic attack, our hero can count on a magical ax to insert into combos and with which to carry out devastating final blows, while in terms of defense there is the possibility of parrying, dodging or carrying out powerful counterattacks . Such a quantity of moves connects directly to a slightly more complicated control system than usual, with the classic virtual stick flanked by four virtual keys, rather small in size and very close to each other: an obviously not optimal solution , which could cause more than a few problems especially on the iPhone, given the impossibility of changing the size and position of the buttons. Nothing too much to complain about for a title offered at a bargain price, and which despite this does not abuse the use of in-app purchases: you can reach into your wallet to access experience packages in case you want to access immediately to a greater number of upgrades, or to buy bonuses capable of immediately restoring the energy of the character (really indispensable only at the more advanced difficulty levels), with the kit of some extra paid costumes that you can easily do without.", "date": "2013-02-26", "grade": "8.0"}
