Patches and expansions have followed one another over time, which have gradually refined the game system and expanded its world. For this reason, the decision made by Turbine initially caused a stir: the game would become free-to-play. In the past this almost unequivocally meant the failure of the project, however recently the western market has also been moving profitably in this new direction: eastern developers have been adopting this model for years and, precisely by studying their success, Turbine has decided to apply it to its titles. The rest is history: Dungeons & Dragons Online became playable for free on September 9, 2009 in the United States and, a year later, Turbine announced an increase of approximately two million players. Such a striking success finally convinced the parent company, in the meantime acquired by the giant Warner Bros., to take the plunge even with its most acclaimed product: The Lord of the Rings Online, in fact. VIP, Premium or Free? Let's analyze it, therefore, this ~free~ version. First of all, it is worth clarifying that with this typology there is a considerable series of limitations, which can be removed individually by purchasing from the LOTRO Store, the real star of the made in Turbine microtransaction system. A ~Free~ player has limitations on character server slots (two, unlike 3 for the Premium category and 5 for subscribers), on the chat system (you can send private messages only to players previously added via friends list, or who started the conversation first), mail (the space for subscribers is unlimited, for Premium and Free not), inventory (5 bags with the subscription and 3 for Premium and Free players) and many other things more or less relevant, among which it is worth mentioning the trait system and the priority of the login. Finally, the unique form of PvP featured in The Lord of the Rings Online, called PvMP or Player-versus-Monster Play, is only available to VIP players. We were talking about the LOTRO Store. Here it is possible to unlock all the various additional contents, from mission/expansion packs more properly called to consumables, cosmetic items, convenience items (for example, to speed up the obtaining of experience points). At the time of the first purchase in the Store, whatever it is, the Free user automatically passes to the Premium rank, which lightens some of the limitations in the way already described. Every purchase in the Store is made using Turbine Points, virtual currency which, fortunately, it is possible to earn not only through the obvious conversion of real money (in this case, dollars) but also by completing some objectives in the game, in particular the ~ deed~. Each region has specific ones and they are often connected in some way to the game missions; it happened to us, with our human character, to earn 15 Turbine Points together with the title of ~Enemy of the Spiders~ after having exterminated 90 specimens of arachnids, naturally in the context of one of the last quests of the initial area. In the depths of the Great Net it is possible to find very detailed guides on all the deeds that give Turbine Points, however it is better not to deceive yourself: if up to the 25th level life as a ~Free~ user seems almost a dream, apart from some communication limitations , then the situation is destined to worsen inexorably. In fact, from that point on, only two options remain available to the player: the main story (also called ~epic~) and pure grinding, or the serial killing of ~mobs~ (slang definition for the common monsters of a MMO) without a specific purpose, to reach the coveted level 65, the current maximum limit for each character in LOTRO (after the purchase of the expansions). It will be necessary to buy the Quest Packs individually, with prices ranging between five and ten dollars to avoid a very long period of play in the name of repetitiveness; in this sense, it is significant that many guides available online explicitly recommend subscribing for a month, in order to obtain, in addition to the 500 Turbine Points that every VIP automatically receives every thirty days, the unlocking of some limitations and missions which, remaining active, they can still be completed even after returning to the ~Premium~ status. However, despite the barriers and palsets placed before the ~Free~ players, being able to play freely, at least from the point of view of exploring the world, is a great way for anyone who wants to get an idea of the Turbine title. It can be seen as a test version without the typical time and space limits and, from this perspective, it is undoubtedly a situation that the Anglo-Saxons would define as ~win-win~, i.e. convenient for both parties: the user and the development house. A crowded andmultidimensional return While the servers were far from deserted previously, they are now in a real buzz thanks to a constant influx of new and old players, all eager to take advantage of such a huge opportunity. Unfortunately every medal has its downside and there is no exception here, given that, to the disappointment of quite a few users, Turbine has been forced to insert a ~layer~ or instance system into the game: when the player limit is reached for a given game area, a copy of the same is created in which the other players will flow from that moment on, in a completely analogous way to what was seen in Age of Conan. This means, in layman's terms, that you won't meet every player on your server. Naturally, the system manages to keep the members of a group in the same version of the world, however purists of the MMO genre cannot avoid turning up their noses at what has always been considered, among the most hardcore users, as a deduction from the key experience of an MMO, i.e. everyone living together in the same world. Beyond this little nuisance, the return to Middle-earth is extremely pleasant and in the small details you can see the painstaking care with which Turbine has improved the game. From the reorganization of the character creation screen to that of the NPCs in the initial city, the changes are aimed at better guiding the user's first steps; the help system for quests on the map has also been enhanced, giving players the ability to change the color of each quest's indicator at will, for a better distinction between the various quests that are active at the same time. Middle-earth has had a makeover Among the multiple changes of the patch that accompanied the relaunch of the title, the inclusion of DirectX 11 as regards graphics and of LUA Scripting for the interface. In the case of DirectX, Turbine had already pioneered with the tenth version, having given both The Lord of the Rings Online and Dungeons & Dragons Online the update in 2008, at the beginning and end of the year respectively. Also this time the original house of Maryland had announced its support for the new graphics libraries and, after months of testing, the relative update to the client was finally released. The novelties mainly concern ambient occlusion, a technique that gives a more realistic effect to the shadows and consequently to all the lighting in a scene, and the movement of bodies in liquids, much more pleasant in terms of ~waves~ produced by exploiting the DX11. As regards the implementation of support for modules written in the LUA language, this is a very important change: it is thanks to the LUA addons that the World of Warcraft interface has become so famous and flexible, customizable in dozens of different ways for both aesthetics and functionality thanks to the inexhaustible development of that part of the user with the necessary skills. At the moment it is still a limited support compared to the Blizzard title, but Turbine has already promised to have further developments in store for this feature and certainly some players / programmers are already gearing up for the production of addons aimed at improvement and customization of the interface.", "date": "2010-11-03", "grade": "8.4"}
