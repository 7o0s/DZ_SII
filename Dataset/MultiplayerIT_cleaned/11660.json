{"name": "Saint Stone Knights Legend", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/saint-stone-knights-legend.html", "text": "China is one of the countries where RPGs, especially online games, have really made their way into people's hearts. It is no coincidence, therefore, that many Chinese developers have long since begun to grapple with this kind of product. It was only a matter of time for something to arrive here too, albeit limited to the mobile sector. Saint Stone Knights Legend is an excellent example of RPG, with a simple but very robust structure, as well as full of thickness. Of course, the plot on which this new adventure is based will receive no prize for its originality: there is the usual demon who breaks free and threatens the world, as well as the usual orphan who discovers he is descended from a lineage of warriors, takes up a sword and out of the blue he finds himself the paladin of the kingdom... As written above, the game has a simple structure, which is well suited to impromptu use: by pressing the asterisk key, in fact, we will be able to check the active quest at any time, moreover with geographical indications useful for its pursuit. As a good classic RPG, Saint Stone Knights Legend asks us to talk to all the characters to find out what missions still await us, then move from one location to another to continue the story. Obviously our alter ego can (and must) grow as we go forward, leveling up thanks to the fights. Furthermore, the latter are not random: the enemies are clearly visible on the screen, so we will be able to decide whether or not to engage in a duel with the monster on duty, possibly evaluating the amount of residual vital energy. The combat system is all in real time, therefore it adds a nice action element to the product: by pressing the 5 key (or FIRE) we can attack (if desired, after having ~hooked~ the target with the 0 key), being careful to move before that the enemy strikes back so as not to take damage. Each battle won translates into a certain number of experience points, and at each level-up we can decide to increase the value of our strength, our agility or magical energy. How we decide to upgrade the character will reflect on his inclination to be a warrior, a knight or a wizard. The technical implementation of the game is good, let's say that the graphics are average for mobile role-playing games: somewhat trivial and repetitive settings as regards the arrangement of the elements, with good use of colors and discreet scrolling. The characters are very small and therefore poor in detail, but with animations of sufficient quality. A great job has been done for the enemies, quite varied and curious in appearance. There's plenty of on-screen text in English, which fortunately uses a fairly large and readable font even in the higher resolution version. The sound sector is made up of ups and downs, as it is composed only of fluctuating quality music: some good, others decidedly short, repetitive and not very suitable for the context in which they were inserted (circus-style music when you are in the forest and fight?). Finally, the control system is really simple and straightforward. Furthermore, the game gives us the possibility to customize it to our liking... PRO Simple and immediate Good amount of quests Nice action elements AGAINST Technically average Very trivial plot All too simple", "date": "2008-01-23", "grade": "S.V."}
