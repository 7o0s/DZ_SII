The background to the adventure is therefore once again the wizarding school of Hogwarts, within which the user will guide Harry in his fight against the perfidious Dolores Umbridge and the archenemy Voldemort. In this regard, applause goes to EA Mobile for the care taken in the graphic creation of the scenarios, truly majestic: framed from an isometric view, the settings abound in details and tasty light effects, capable of giving the game a unique. The remaining elements of the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix cosmetics are also remarkable (especially the character sprites and the visual rendering of the spells are good), but it is the backdrops that give the title an edge. And it is undoubtedly a pity to have to note that such a graphic opulence is not accompanied by an equally positive play structure, which if on the one hand entertains and involves, on the other it shows some very evident limits. It can be said that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is essentially a stealth game - which requires the user to move from point A to point B without being seen - interspersed with dialogue sequences, magical duels and some minigames. Unfortunately, the most substantial part is also the least convincing part of the package: thanks to a certain cumbersomeness of the control system and a not exactly friendly level design, moving in the shadows in Harry's shoes is not what is defined as an exhilarating experience, which on the contrary it can end in frustration since at the slightest mistake it is necessary to start the entire section from scratch. Fortunately the rest of the game is much better, especially during duels: here you have the task of pressing the OK key at the right time in order to charge up enough magical energy to launch your attack, all in the shortest possible time in order to anticipate the opponent's move. A certainly imperfect system (at the more advanced difficulty levels it becomes almost impossible to win), but still quite convincing and which is also used in the title for some simple puzzles focused on magic. During the approximately five hours needed to complete the adventure, one therefore has the feeling that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is certainly an unbalanced and incomplete game in some ways, but overall superior to other tie-ins that are around.
