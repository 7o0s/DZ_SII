{"name": "Voglia di Europei? C' UEFA Euro 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/voglia-di-europei-ce-uefa-euro-2004.html", "text": "UEFA Euro 2004 is a direct descendant of the latest incarnation of Fifa, from which it takes most of the innovations to offer an exclusive version for the 2004 European Football Championships. Gattuso and Rui Costa practice at EURO 2004! Strangely, unlike the previous titles, we do not see any presentations with testimonial players of the type to which EA has accustomed us; you immediately enter the initial menu from which you can select the following options: quick game, Euro 2004 (the main mode), choose game (from which you can play various types of game), my Euro (where we find all the options at the game). The decision to face the Europeans takes place starting from the friendlies to go through the qualifiers, the various groups, up to the elimination round, from which the final winner will be decided. Among the new additions compared to Fifa we find first of all a better implementation of short passes, absolutely essential for combining important actions. In fact, it is necessary to practice continuous team play given the enormous difficulty in advancing with dribbling. Then there is the introduction of the choice of corners to beat or free-kicks, which allow the adoption of various tactics to hit the opponent's goal. Finally, the factor of each player's morale, which will influence their performance depending on the progress of the tournament. During the championship you will have the opportunity to indulge yourself with the team and with the information available: there will even be scouts who will inform you of the opponents' game data in order to adjust accordingly. Then there are all the changes of the case, such as the disposition of every single man on the field and the substitutions. The 51 teams are recreated faithfully and with great detail, especially in the excellent reproduction of the faces of the players. The artificial intelligence behaves appropriately according to each team: England is markedly different from Albania (and God forbid) and players can make mistakes and be booked or sent off. The difficulty levels appear well calibrated and playing as professionals it will be difficult to win. Our companions are almost always where they should be and you can forget the idea of continuing with a single individual (as happened in the old Fifa); but learning to exploit the steps properly. With these you can achieve spectacular actions which, in the event of a goal, are displayed in spectacular replays (unfortunately it is not possible to save them). Unfortunately it should be noted that in matches the ball still behaves in a not entirely realistic way, practically without rebounds, and it is too easy to beat the opponents in 1 against 1. The tricks derived from the various FIFA and the addition of the viewfinder on direct free kicks allows you to always score with a moment of practice. The road to simulation (if that was the development team's goal) is still far away and the latest PES, although not free from defects of various kinds, is decidedly on other levels. Totti and the tuxedo As far as the visual aspect is concerned, we are faced with the same Fifa 2004 engine retouched for the European championship. The 51 teams are recreated faithfully and with great detail, especially in the excellent reproduction of the faces of the players. By selecting Italy you will immediately recognize Totti, Vieri and all the others, never so faithful to the real counterparts as in this latest version. The biggest defect is to be found in the total absence of a specific menu for the graphics where you can select the various parameters. Only the choice of resolution and a generic ~level of detail~ are available and what is immediately noticeable is the use of low-resolution textures; both in the players and in the stadiums we find grainy skins, pixelated walls which, if they can be forgiven in distant shots from close up, make the whole graphic sector not a little ugly. For the moment there are no patches available to remedy the problem so much so that some enthusiasts have already set up editors to modify these gaps. For the rest, the various environments are recreated with great detail, offering us different stadiums and climatic conditions and, as in this year's Fifa, we find a considerable improvement in the animations of the players (below the optimal) and the possibility that the their clothes get dirty when they hit the ground. Note for the menus: even these, despite being fairly well made, are in low resolution and with the navigation commands too far apart. Italy! Italy! Another important aspect is given by the sound of the production: each team has its own cheering audience,identical and exciting as in reality! You can then hear your players shouting words like Bravo! and Pass it! offering a good dose of realism that never hurts. Cheers to the commentary: gentlemen, this is probably the best around! Edited by Bruno Longhi and Giovanni Galli, it is plausible and well acted even if unfortunately not free from defects that are repeated with a certain frequency such as completely wrong or not well synchronized sentences penalize a little the emphasis that accompanies the game action. We wish for a corrective patch. Also noteworthy is the music that accompanies the menus and breaks, all very catchy and produced by more or less famous artists. Europeans online UEFA Euro 2004 also lays its foundations for multiplayer on EA's online service. It is usually paid but in the box you will find a code to take advantage of a totally free year of subscription, which doesn't hurt. Also noteworthy is the menu for multiplayer games: here you can see the available servers, the world rankings, chat with other opponents and participate in single events or championships. The matches prove to be competitive at best, especially depending on the player you are dealing with. The feeling of participating in the Europeans is masterfully recreated! An ADSL line is recommended to solve any latency problems that could greatly disturb the games, where timing is of the essence. Final comment This UEFA Euro 2004 is proposed as a complementary addition to the Fifa series, offering us an insight into the European championship and the introduction of some innovations such as morality and the management of punishments. Those who expected a revolution will be disappointed, we are faced with an ~expansion~ of the classic series sold at full price; EA returns with a method already seen with Euro 2000 even if it would be better to take the path of the data disk for FIFA sold at a reduced price. However, it remains a title treated in almost all respects and successful in the reconstruction of this variant of the classic competitions. Recommended for those who have not yet seen Fifa up close and for true fanatics of the saga, UEFA Euro 2004 nonetheless has the advantage of offering an experience like the European football championships up close, almost from within one might say. The charm of official licenses, all very well cared for, still has its appeal. Pros: The only title that simulates the 2004 European Football Championships Graphically satisfying Fun gameplay Cons: It's still too easy to beat your opponents in 1 to 1 ball rebounds and animations that can still be improved Few new features compared to Fifa 2004 The coach in the ball In addition to the main mode, we find the possibility of facing various competitions such as friendlies, home and away matches, penalties, training sessions and the brand new All Stars career: in practice, it is possible to create a team made up of players from any country in order to have a team (almost) invincible! At the beginning you will start without reputation from a suburban stadium, if victories follow one another you will have the climb to success. This mode will help ensure further longevity to the game, even beyond the end of the European Championships. WIN ITALY'S OPENING MATCH WITH EA AND MULTIPLAYER.IT!
