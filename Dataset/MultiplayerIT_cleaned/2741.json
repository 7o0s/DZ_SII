The craziest, as well as the only real rhythm game of 2020 worthy of note was missing; which among other things lands exclusively on the Nintendo hybrid console. What exactly is Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack? and how is it different from the older Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun? We've spent dozens of hours in the company of drums and crazy melodies, and we're finally ready for the verdict. The contents Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack is a package that appears particularly sensible on the western market: inside you will find Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure 1 and Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure 2, the remasters of two titles previously released only in Japan. The contents are therefore not really new, but it is highly unlikely that you have already had the opportunity not only to play, but also simply to get to know these very particular chapters of the franchise. Details, exactly. As you probably know, and as we also underlined in the review of Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun! For Nintendo Switch, the rhythm game was born at the time in Japanese arcades, and came with two giant drums mounted on the spot, to be beaten with sticks to the rhythm of the music. Bandai Namco has tried to bring this experience back to consoles as well, with the necessary limitations. But Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack goes even further, it represents a group of episodes in its own right, which choose to draw heavily from the world of JRPGs. The purchase will therefore allow you to play both chapters of the franchise, the Adventure Pack 1 and the Adventure Pack 2. Both will offer a particularly long-lived story (although not always interesting) and JRPG mechanics (albeit very simplified). In total you will also find yourself with 130 songs, which can also be performed separately within the game menus (they are still less than those offered by Drum 'n' Fun!) and something like 250 collectibles. In the face of a discreet list price (49.99 euros) the proposed contents are therefore correct from the point of view of quantity; a little less than that of the variety, as we shall see. The gameplay In terms of gameplay, Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack does not betray the soul of the series, making some minimal changes. The rhythm game therefore remained the same as always: the colored faces of Don and Ka, red and blue respectively, scroll on the screen at variable speed, from right to left. The player must perform the known date at the right time, immediately getting an on-screen response: ~bad~, ~ok~, ~good~. The execution of the entire song is rewarded with a final score: this is the Taiko no Tatsujin ever, as well as the one you will find in Taiko mode, which will also contain all the songs unlocked up to that moment. In all there are 130 of them. Playing remains the most important aspect of the production, but this time it's not the only one. Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack is also a JRPG, i.e. a Japanese RPG: therefore the player will control the character on duty (Don, the red drum) by exploring more or less circumscribed levels, carrying on a real main narrative. Almost all game areas will allow you to meet and face random enemies: to understand each other, this is exactly what happens in the dungeons of any RPG or in the tall grass of the Pokmon series. And here comes the kicker, because the fights actually happen at the top of the screen, automatically. It is the player himself who determines the outcome, by playing the pieces that in the meantime scroll in the lower part: for every perfect execution of a certain number of notes, an attack corresponds. If you're not particularly good at it or lack any sense of rhythm, enemies will beat Don and his teammates to the punches. The party and the battles Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack never reaches the levels of complexity and depth of any true JRPG. His light-hearted and funny style makes him only try to vaguely imitate his characteristics; in short, he rejoices in never taking himself too seriously, and perhaps it is precisely this aspect that always keeps the player's attention alive. This does not mean, however, that there are some game elements to keep in mind. The mechanics related to the party, for example. The two proposed adventures offer a total of 250 absurd and improbable monsters, all encountered randomly in the levels. The majorMost of the time you'll eliminate opponents never to see them again, but some will want to join your team. You will thus be able to recruit them and make them fight, alongside the main heroes; they will also level up, powering up throughout the story. Since the party allows you to deploy four characters at the same time, our advice is to deploy them all right away: otherwise winning the challenges, even with perfect musical performances, will be impossible. Because you will not physically have heroes ready to inflict damage on an increasing number of enemies. The fights are at their best during the boss fights, which also manage to become quite challenging. In these cases it is advisable to resort to the super rhythm bar, a special power that is activated independently after you have accumulated a certain number of perfect notes in a row; and above all it is necessary to study the enemy powers well. The bosses put Don in difficulty by momentarily obscuring the note bar in different ways, thus making it more difficult to read; this is obviously aimed at leading the player to make a mistake. The defects Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack is a very fun title, yet another mandatory purchase for fans of the franchise and also for those who appreciate rhythm games in general. However, this does not mean that it is without defects, on the contrary. The plot, for example, does not represent anything exceptional: it is a set of funny and amusing skits, almost never really connected to each other, which follow one another in bulk. Friends to help, bad guys to stop, companions lost and to be recovered, worlds in space and time to bring back to order. After all, this is part of the desire never to take oneself too seriously, which has already been mentioned. Even the JRPG mechanics do not shine in a particular way: the party with collectible monsters is fine, the dungeons to explore are fine, the fights and boss fights are also fine. But everything was developed a little ~with rose water~, contenting oneself with seasoning a game philosophy that basically already worked perfectly, the one at the base of Taiko no Tatsujin, with something different. And finally the technical sector: the backdrops in HD and the two-dimensional drawings are all perfect; the problems come with the true 3D game elements and especially with the areas to explore freely. The sense of precariousness (and poverty) of these environments is remarkable.", "date": "2020-12-09", "grade": "7.2"}
