In Hero Emblems, these mechanisms are enriched by an in-depth analysis of jRPG themes, with characters who acquire different objects or abilities, but who can fully exploit them only if the combinations on the board are favorable. The plot behind the game refers to the canons of the genre, producing boring dialogues (completely in English) which fortunately it is possible to skip to get to the point, or rather explore a map made up of a series of dungeons and try to clean them of the presence of enemies , during a mission in which we will have to rescue a princess kidnapped by the forces of evil. The simple passage from one place to another, which according to a questionable design choice requires pressing a confirmation key instead of a very simple double tap, eventually leads to exposure to random fights, certainly useful for doing a little grinding but at the same time at the same time guilty of breaking the rhythm of the action and ~unfairly~ increasing the duration of the experience. Beyond the limits we have just talked about, and which unfortunately are combined with a systematic repetitiveness of situations, Hero Emblems manages to offer solid and engaging gameplay, which hides an unexpected strategic depth and a respectable degree of challenge, both that we will often have to repeat some dungeons from scratch or return to them after pursuing the growth of our characters. Hero Emblems stands as a benchmark for titles a la Puzzle Quest The four of the Ave Maria The party members are a cunning and deadly warrior, a paladin skilled in defensive maneuvers, a witch capable of casting powerful spells and a priestess with the ability to heal herself and her companions. Four characters who have to deal with as many elements on the board which is placed in the lower part of the touch screen, and which appears whenever there is a fight to be had. By eliminating the swords it is possible to proceed with an attack by the warrior, while by pairing the stars the witch is brought into action with her magic. On the defensive front, however, shields increase our defense energy, which goes hand in hand with health, increased by the combination of hearts. The key is to alternate the two phases, offensive and defensive, to deal as much damage as possible but at the same time avoid being too exposed. Creating combos with the various elements results in spectacular chained sequences, capable of eliminating any opponent; but it is clear that in this sense also the luck factor takes over. Furthermore, when the eliminated objects are four or more, enhancement mechanisms are activated that lead our heroes to perform devastating special moves, determined by the skills that we have purchased for them at the shops on the map, possibly together with elixirs for restoring the 'power. The interesting thing, however, is that in the game there are no in-app purchases, therefore the balancing of the difficulty does not have to obey monetization logics and it is therefore possible to overcome an arduous test even without possessing the necessary experience, by carefully planning the moves and perhaps trying to create eliminations in sequence to get the better of our enemies. Of course, there is certainly the frustration of a game over right at the end of a dungeon and the obligation to start it all over again in order to continue the adventure, together with the repetitiveness we have already mentioned, but within the confines of its range of The Hero Emblems action proves to be competent and well structured, with beautiful graphics to accompany our sorties between the forces of evil, fairly varied enemies and a selection of well-chosen music.", "date": "2015-03-05", "grade": "8.0"}
