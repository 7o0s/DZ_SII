{"name": "Earth 2160 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/earth-2160-recensione.html", "text": "There is life on Mars The events narrated within the campaigns concerning the three terrestrial factions all start from the arrival of these on Mars, but initially we will only have those dedicated to the Eurasian Dynasty and the Lunar Corporation available. As also recommended in the game manual, it is wise to start playing with DE, in order to access a fairly complete tutorial on the game, included in the first mission. The first character we find ourselves controlling is one of the so-called heroes of the factions, which brings us to the first of the game features of Earth 2160: nothing original, you will say, since things like this can now be seen in almost all RTS extension. This partially corresponds to the truth, but Reality Pumps have also thought of introducing an inventory system, very similar to what RPG players are used to seeing but obviously adapted to the strategic: in other words, heroes and virtual agents have the possibility of using items such as medical kits, repair tools, shields, camouflage, bombs and firearms with different characteristics (accuracy, ammunition consumption, firing speed, range). The virtual agents mentioned above are nothing more than mercenaries, therefore linked to our army only on the basis of the economic resources we will give them: as we have already noted, these have the possibility of using the same objects as the heroes, effectively constituting a Enhanced combat unit compared to normal ones. The possibility of recruiting agents is signaled through an icon on the left side of the screen, once we click which we have the possibility to count on a new member within our army. Mercenary ~rates~ will vary based on various factors such as the faction we currently control (for example, if we fire agents before their term expires, we will have a bad reputation and pay dearly for new recruits) and whether other agents work for us they like it or not. Returning to the campaigns, we can say that these are well differentiated from each other, which makes all 28 missions playable with gusto which, if we really wanted to make a criticism, taking advantage of the number of armies available in the game, could perhaps have been in a bit more. On the skirmish mode, to be played as we have said also in multiplayer, there is practically little to say, except that the maps available are quite numerous (in case they are not enough, there is still a special editor) and that starting from minimum level of difficulty, in case you want to play single, the computer will be able to give you a hard time. There is life on Mars Coming to one of the bases of any self-respecting RTS, the collection of primary resources, we are not faced with anything new, except for the division that the three raw materials (metal, water and crystals) have between the four factions: apart from the aliens who need all of them, each of the remaining collects only two different types. Among the many applications that have resources we find the field of research, through which it is possible to obtain ever better upgrades for your units and buildings, but it doesn't end there: thanks to the system studied by the development team, the improvements will be applicable and example not only to all the vehicles ~in series~, but it is also possible to choose to modify the additions to each single unit, in order to obtain, for example, a tank equipped with aerial weapons and another similar one, but with land-based weapons edge. All this translates into great variety, and I assure you that trying to create a set of vehicles that integrate with each other will be, as well as a lot of fun, one of the steps to success in the game. Wanting to nitpick, we can say that the game is too difficult right from the lowest difficulty level, which if on the one hand makes the challenge more stimulating for those who usually eat bread and RTS for lunch, on the other it could discourage novice players or players who don't want to apply themselves too much if they have selected ~easy~ as a level. The warring factions Let's take a quick look at the warring factions, not failing to notice the lack of originality of their names: United States of Civilization: before the Earth was annihilated, this power spanned all of America and for a short time even in Europe and Africa. Based on the use of robots even for the simplest tasks, it has an army made up mostly of battle mechs. The method of construction of the base is the closest to the classic RTS: using the work drones it is in fact possible to place the buildings in any punto of the map. Eurasian Dynasty: the army closest to what we are used to. Coming from Europe and Asia, it was the DE in 2148 that started the conflict that led to the destruction of the Earth. The peculiarity of the DE bases lies in the fact that all the structures, with a few necessary exceptions, are physically connected to each other, which leads the player to study well the land on which he intends to build his own settlement. Lunar Corporation: made up of only women, it was born in 2002 to explore the Universe and over the years has become an independent state from the Earth, located on the space base called LUNA1. After being initially conceived as a peacekeeping force, the CL has also become aggressive and not at all peaceful, although its motto is ~love and peace~. The foundations of the CL are made up of enormous towers on which floors the various buildings rest. The Aliens: little is known about this new threat encountered by armies once they arrive on Mars. Their characteristic is that they do not have a real base made up of buildings, given that all their units are made up of living beings who have the possibility of cloning themselves to create new units or transform themselves into pseudo-buildings or upgraded units. The technical sector Graphically, Earth 2160 has all the credentials to compete with the best titles of the genre: the models are quite accurate even at maximum zoom of the camera, through which it is widely possible to widen or narrow the field to your liking and depending on your needs of the moment. The animations and effects during the conflicts are quite realistic and also the alternation between day and night has been reproduced more than satisfactorily: perhaps the resemblance is a little accentuated with Ground Control, but probably this is mainly caused by the fact that genre and setting are very close between the two titles in question. Wanting to nitpick, a little anti-aliasing wouldn't have hurt. The interface also does its job very well and is extremely intuitive, offering the player the possibility of closing the panels in a simple way without having to do who knows what stunt to reopen them: through a simple click it is in fact possible to hide the panels that you do not needs at the moment, also obtaining benefits in terms of visibility on the map. As far as the sound is concerned, in addition to the very appreciable main theme, we are faced with pieces that fulfill the purpose for which they were created very well, even if they don't cry out for a miracle. The same thing goes for the voices of the characters (in English): they are credible but certainly normal. However, all lovers of the original game goodies will be pleased to know that the soundtrack CD is also supplied in the box with the DVD of the game. Since we talked about the box, let me finally praise the entire creation, complete with a luminous blue gadget and minibook where the media are kept: they seem silly but compared to many other games, the Earth 2160 box looks great of the the rest also the eye wants its part! The Earth series is enriched with this new light title: although it may not succeed in reaching the levels of 2150, considered by fans of the series to be the best of the two previous chapters, this Earth 2160 is still very pleasant to play and , although it does not introduce who knows what novelties within the RTS genre, it is never trivial or obvious, on the contrary it is very pleasant to play for all 28 missions, after which there is ample space for some single player skirmishes with PC or in multiplayer mode via LAN/Internet. However, some longtime fans of the series may not like it, while for all others looking for a good RTS this title can certainly be a valid solution. Pros: Graphics above the standard Good soundtrack Engaging and intuitive gameplay Cons: No particular innovations Difficulty above the norm The earth? Just a reminder! Those who have played the Earth series since its first episode will remember that TopWare was the development team at the time, while the publisher of the game was the dear Interplay. After signing an agreement with Zuxxez Entertainment, the name of the group was changed to Reality Pump, but in fact the members working on Earth 2160 are still those who created Earth 2140 in the ~far~ 1997 and, between 1999 and 2001, Earth 2150 with its expansion subtitled The Moon Project. The game we are talking about now begins where its predecessor ended: after their conflict pushed the Earth out of itsorbit, condemning it to destruction, the Eurasian Dynasty (DE) and the United States of Civilization (SUC) are forced to look for a new planet to colonize, to ensure the survival of the species: the choice falls on Mars, a long-standing destination for colonizers from our planet. As if that weren't enough, however, another faction has also set its sights on the red planet, it is in fact the Lunar Corporation (CL), also intending to battle the two corporations from Earth. While there are rumors of the existence of a new planet similar to the one now destroyed, a new alien threat puts its shadow on the fate of the conflict, transforming it into a real battle for the domination of the planets, which will not do without twists and turns such as betrayals and desertions by members of the fighting armies. The game modes present in Earth 2160 fully correspond to the standards we are now used to from the RTS genre: a series of 28 missions divided into 4 campaigns, each of them linked to one of the powers that are part of the game, and the very classic skirmish mode, also (and above all) available in multiplayer mode via LAN or via the Internet, through the EarthNet system.", "date": "2005-10-07", "grade": null}
