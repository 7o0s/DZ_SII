{"name": "Il Gioco degli Dei", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-gioco-degli-dei-recensione.html", "text": "Il Gioco degli Dei, the title inexplicably translated into Italian of the original Game of Gods, combines the traditional mechanisms of tower defense with a terribly immediate touch control system and a very intriguing setting. In fact, in the game we play the role of a deity with special powers related to the elements, who must use their abilities to defend a series of locations from the onslaught of increasingly dangerous creatures. The progression is exactly what one might expect from such an experience, with different scenarios that see a gradual increase in difficulty, a very rich achievement system to revive interest and the continuous unlocking of new powers to be used to make facing opponents who at a certain point begin to develop a resistance to certain attacks, forcing us to find alternatives. That the game is devoted to immediacy can be understood immediately from the choice of the view, in portrait style, which if desired allows you to pilot the maneuvers and move the view using a single finger. The action takes place as follows: at the center of each stage there is an altar towards which infernal monsters and human beings head, the former to try to destroy its components (thus determining game over) and the latter to save themselves going through a portal. We can choose whether to kill or spare humans, attracting the sympathy of some of our colleagues from the diametrically opposite philosophy (specifically, the god of death and the goddess of life) and pursuing a different growth, which also translates into peculiar moves and abilities . Instead, there is no need to make any choice about the opponents, who must be eliminated by throwing everything we have at them to prevent them from inflicting excessive damage on the altar, which stands as an earthly representation of our vital energy. Gameplay and graphics The interface of Il Gioco degli Dei is very well organized, according to a style that is now the most popular in the field of freemium productions. Between one mission and another it is in fact possible to manage a whole series of issues, ranging from the purchase of new upgrades to the unlocking of skills, passing through the aforementioned achievements, the purchase of allies who support us in the field (to be paid with real money, however) and obtaining extras that also have an aesthetic value for our deity, who initially appears in a shirt, tie and trousers, like a modern bank employee, to transform into something different as he we provide armor, reinforced clothing and various accessories, such as a nice pair of wings. However, the fun is all concentrated in the in-game action, when we use attacks to eliminate hostile units by drawing spells from the slot and waiting for the mana to recharge enough to be able to cast them, but above all when we combine two attacks together to obtain results surprising. For example, we can make metal spikes come out of the ground and then throw a bolt of lightning to see its effect amplified, or make a tree grow out of nowhere to slow down enemies and then use a shock wave to make it collapse on our target . The tenth mission of each scenario is a challenging boss fight in which we will have to deal with a hostile god with great resistance, to be weakened by using our weapons intelligently and placing as many combinations as possible to maximize the results. In short, the system developed by Foursaken Media works very well, and if we really want to find fault with the game, we can speak of a level of difficulty that winks a bit at grinding from a certain point on, or to the rather invasive advertisements between one mission and another, with fairly long waiting times that break the rhythm. The technical sector is excellent, with a good design for the gods and enemies, a valid rendering of the visual effects and an engaging sound, which accompanies the action very well.", "date": "2019-03-29", "grade": "8.0"}
