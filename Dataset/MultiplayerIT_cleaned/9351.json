After the glorious glories of the series on the old Sony console and the bad approach to the next gen, with SOCOM: Confrontation, the guys at Zipper are ready to honor one of the longest-running series in Playstation history with this latest chapter. One of the factors that helped the SOCOM series - now in its seventh chapter and with a total of twelve million units sold worldwide - has always been the excellent combination of single and multi player modes. Precisely for this reason, the fans had turned up their noses a little when they saw that a single player mode was totally missing in Confrontation. The developers, taking advantage of this reproach, have decided to reinsert a substantial single-player campaign into ~Forze Speciali~. History will see us in command of a handful of soldiers, all part of a group of leatherheads, who are found in Southeast Asia. Unfortunately for them, due to a series of events, to which we leave the pleasure to you to discover, the soldiers will find themselves in the middle of a real revolt led by a man halfway between a mercenary and a political leader, who wants take control of one of the most important maritime communication routes on earth: the Strait of Malacca. It will be up to us and our comrades to avert this looming and dangerous threat. The story unfolds in fourteen missions, which cover a span of six days within the game. The locations that we are going to visit have proved to be quite varied, ranging from urban areas, lush forests, night sections and various others. During our mission we will have the opportunity to put ourselves in the shoes of the commander of this group who will have the task of coordinating the troop in the field. That's right, one of the hallmarks of the series, returns more effective than ever. Through the D-pad we will have the possibility to issue orders to our soldiers, divided into two groups of two elements each. The blue group will specialize in heavy weapons and close combat, while the yellow group will specialize in ranged combat and silent kills. This variety of soldiers will prove to be useful for gameplay purposes and compared to the previous chapters, giving orders and planning moves in advance will prove to be essential for completing the various game missions, especially at high difficulty levels. As if that weren't enough, the developers, in some missions, will make us impersonate a female spy of South Korean origin called ~45~, infiltrated between enemy lines, who is assigned the task of sabotaging or destroying enemy installations. These typically stealth missions serve to vary the gameplay, breaking up the game action and diversifying the player's approach. To complete the single player campaign, playing at a normal level, it will take more or less five or six hours of play, which increase if you choose higher difficulty levels or if you are less skilled in this genre of games. Small curiosity: the developers have included patches - the typical logos on the uniforms of soldiers - from twelve different countries. In our case, for example, we will have the Italian army patch, unfortunately, it will only change the logo and not the uniforms and type of equipment. A nice gimmick, but which in hindsight could be exploited in a much more interesting way. The power of the upgrade The title provides us with a large number of weapons ranging from long and short range rifles, automatic machine guns and sniper rifles, as well as the inevitable shotgun and the ubiquitous grenades. All these objects will be editable only with experience. In fact, progressing in the game we will unlock and use our favorite weapon, as we will unlock silencers, red hot, Acog and more capacious magazines. This is an excellent gimmick by Zipper to make the player loyal to a type of weapon, and at the same time, lengthen the longevity of the title if you want to unlock the upgrades of all weapons. Playstation 3 trophies SOCOM: Special Forces offers the possibility to unlock 45 trophies. Many of the bronze ones will be linked to single, co-op and multiplayer game progression. The remaining silver and gold will range between carrying out a certain number of kills, and recovering all the collectibles present in the various game levels. The only mention of note belongs to the trophy called ~45th~ which will ask us to kill 45 enemies during the stealth phases in the singlegame player. The task will be decidedly difficult, since we will have to kill without being discovered. All together happily Obviously the heart of SOCOM is multiplayer, and here too the guys from Zipper didn't spare themselves. The title supports thirty-two players, who have the possibility to choose between four game modes. The first called Suppression, will see the classic team deatchmatch between teams with the sole purpose of making more kills and points than the enemy. ~Uplink~ is the equally classic capture the flag where, however, instead of the flag there will be very important secret information to be recovered in order to win the game. ~Last defense~ will see us busy having to conquer different points located on the map; only once conquered all we will have the possibility to access the enemy base to destroy it. The mode certainly more fun and original proved to be ~Bomb squad~. The aim of the game is to defuse a bomb. In turn, for the team responsible for this task, there will be a player dressed in the classic bomb squad costume used to defuse this type of bomb, and the rest of the team will have the task of escorting him to the point where the bomb is located . Given the heavy clothing, the blaster will move much more slowly than the others, and this will involve coordinated and effective cover work on the part of the team, on pain of death of the soldier and defeat in the match. Finally, the developers have decided to please even longtime fans by inserting the ~Classic~ mode, with game settings that are very reminiscent of the original SOCOMs and without any type of respawn. The nine maps within which the clashes will take place have been extrapolated from the locations already visited in the single player campaign. Fortunately, the construction of the various arenas is quite varied, with strategic covers, raised places where you can make wise use of the sniper and a discreet size suitable for containing the contenders who form the match. Furthermore, the player will be given free choice to assemble the character as he sees fit, avoiding class restrictions, but with the possibility of choosing at each respawn: primary weapon, secondary, equipment, clothing and even the point on the map where he wants to be reborn. For cooperative lovers, the title offers a campaign for two to five players, with two game modes: ~Takedown~ and ~Espionage~. In the first we will have to neutralize an enemy leader, in the second recover key pieces of intelligence. These will be fully editable by location, difficulty and density of enemies. Furthermore, the random generation of objectives will make the missions always different. The game also offers a valid and renewed matchmaking with the now famous team support. Unfortunately, the lobbies for the clans are still absent, a feature that had been repeatedly requested by fans of the series. In any case, it is reasonable to hope that the latter will be added in a future update, given that the developers have ensured constant monitoring of the game online and the feedback they will receive will be used to improve the running title. Let's do alternatives SOCOM: Special Forces also gives us the opportunity to play with Move and the new rifle peripheral called Sharp Shooter, developed in collaboration between the developers of SOCOM and Killzone. Using Movesi aims by pointing the device at the enemy. This way of playing, although functional, significantly shortens the game sessions due to the inevitable soreness of the upper limbs, making them even more complicated due to a mapping of the rest of the controls that is not exactly happy. However, it remains a valid game alternative to try every now and then, but completing the entire campaign in this way is frankly heavy and uncomfortable. The Sharp Shooter on the other hand, which always uses the Move strategically positioned within the peripheral, although it immerses the player in the role of the soldier, on balance is not very precise and difficult to use due to a calibration that is not always perfect and for the mapping of the commands, even more awkward than the Move. In short, as fun as they may be, these two ways of playing have more the flavor of added value for the players than a valid game alternative. Technically speaking From a purely technical point of view it cannot be said that SOCOM: Special Forces has been developed badly. The textures are well made, and the polygonal models of the various characters are more than fair. The same goes for the bump mapping of the various surfaces (particularly those in the rain) and for the various particle effectslari of the game. What SOCOM: Special Forces lacks is in the level design: in general, during the whole mission there are really excited moments or in which even just for a second you can hold your breath with a lump in your throat, and the hope of passing that particular section . This also derives in part from the poor management of the narrative plot, which while boasting an extremely fascinating and valid setting, does not offer big ideas in terms of twists and breathtaking sections that have been seen in other titles of the genre. More than good, both in single and in cooperative multiplayer, the artificial intelligence of the enemies was found with quite varied routines contextualized to the environment in which the battle takes place, provided of course that the title is played with rather high difficulty levels. The game also supports stereoscopic 3D, and unlike other titles, the technology seems well exploited with excellent depth of field and classic effects that come off the screen congenial to the action in which the player is immersed. Final mention to the audio sector, which settles on discrete levels. The sampling of the sounds is just enough, with the shooting of the various weapons and explosions that do not always convey the feeling that one could feel by shooting a real weapon. The Italian-language dubbing is rather anonymous, with a shallow characterization of the various characters by the voice actors, but unfortunately this is an all too common problem in our own titles. On balance and with its ups and downs, SOCOM: Special Forces turns out to be what fans have always wanted. A single player campaign, albeit not very incisive, well built and absolutely enjoyable from start to finish. Complete support for multiplayer, with the novelty of the Bomb Squad mode, and a more than discreet technical realization give a positive judgment to the title. Obviously, those expecting something highly innovative will be disappointed, the title is more of a more of the same than what has already been seen in previous SOCOMs. However, it remains highly recommended to fans of the saga and lovers of online gaming sessions.", "date": "2011-04-13", "grade": "7.4"}
