{"name": "Pathfinder: Kingmaker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pathfinder-kingmaker-recensione.html", "text": "The first words that come to mind for the Pathfinder: Kingmaker review are ~Pillars of Eternity~. The title of Owlcat Games is in some ways so similar to that of Obsidian that at the beginning the sense of dj vu is very strong, especially if you are fresh from the Pillars of Eternity 2 campaign. The interface is practically the same, with lots of movement icons and identical target indicators. The visual rendering is also similar, but in Pathfinder there is a greater recycling of objects, evidently due to the lower budget available. Fortunately, after the first impact, the obvious differences begin to appear, mainly due to the different systems of rules used. Pathfinder is in fact the official transposition of the 2009 paper role-playing game of the same name, based on the 3.5 edition of Dungeons & Dragons, published in response to the fourth edition of Dungeons & Dragons, which greatly dissatisfied fans. So far the only video game of a certain weight that has been dedicated to it is Obsidian Entertainment's mediocre Pathfinder Adventures, a very forgettable minor production that has dissatisfied fans with its hybrid nature that is excessively prone to the canons of mobile role-playing games. game system Create a character or choose one of the ready ones, Pathfinder: Kingmaker begins with a hearing in which we and a swarm of other adventurers are asked to capture a criminal who threatens the territories of the Stolen Lands, the region in which the game. Unfortunately, the organization of the expedition is interrupted by the night attack of a group of assassins who enter the castle to try to take possession of the kingdom. It is here that we get to know the characters who will be part of our party and that we are called to make some decisions, which will determine their initial loyalty. As already mentioned, the interface is identical to that of the Pillars of Eternity and, more generally, to the games of the Baldur's Gate vein; even the game view follows the same stylistic features, with the maps that are framed from a fixed perspective, of which the player can only decide the zoom level. In general, those who have tried any of the titles mentioned will find themselves at home and won't even need to follow the brief initial text tutorial to understand what to do. The very management of the party, made up of up to six characters, is a big deal already seen, just as the textual interludes are identical to those introduced in the latest Obsidian titles (do you know the multiple-choice events told by the books in PoE?). The party itself can be controlled as a group or, depending on the circumstances, by selecting individual characters; in case of skill rolls, both in game and in the aforementioned narrated events, the system will always select our partner with the highest value, so as not to waste time. It seems bad to say, but the combat system itself strongly recalls that of PoE 2, there are so many similarities. In short, if we add the choice to focus on an ultra-generic fantasy style, you will understand why defining Pathfinder: Kingmaker as a derivative title is not an exaggeration, but a simple observation. Fortunately, playing for a few hours, some important differences emerge that manage to give him his own identity. Gameplay It soon turns out that Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a damn hard title, even played on the medium difficulty level (Normal). The growth of the party is very slow, the fights are challenging even in the early stages of the game and the cumulative encumbrance management system of the party is much more present and decisive than those of other titles, as is the rest mechanic that requires a little attention to be understood (you have to assign the characters to various tasks such as hunting, cooking, patrolling, disguising the camp and taking care of special tasks, also deciding how much to make them sleep to recover tiredness, skills, spells and Health). The impression is that the developers wanted to follow the rules of the paper manual to the letter, thus creating situations that can displace the player not accustomed to taking care of certain details. Around we read that the game would need more balance in the fights and fewer clashes with enemies with insurmountable resistance. From our experience we can tell you that it is not true, ie that evidently many have played it without bothering to study the functioning of certain mechanics and have remained bogged down. For example, killing a troll requires fire or acid, while a werewolf requires magical weapons. Attacking with your head down means having the party wiped out in a few moments, even whendo you have reached a good level. There are not many similar games that require you to resort to tactical pause even in seemingly trivial situations, but Pathfinder: Kingmaker from this point of view does not make discounts. Once you understand this, it is much more satisfying, often even than its sources of inspiration. Hardcore nature Sure, some design choices leave you dumbfounded and can be incomprehensible. For example, one of the hireable characters in our party is a warrior with paladin features. The reason for this strangeness is explained by speaking to her and narratively it makes sense, but in essence it makes it really difficult to use it well, especially for newbies. Another controversial choice is that of some prices, in particular those of healing potions. Now, Pathfinder (even paper) requires having a healer in your party if you want to do anything decent. In the video game, unfortunately, the first healer is obtained after a few hours, except in the case in which a cleric has been created as the main character, and the only way to heal is to use healing potions, which however cost very much. Unfortunately camping is not an alternative because natural cures require many hours of rest (we are talking about several days of game time), too many if you consider that there are many timed quests, including one of the main ones, and that not carrying them out can lead at game over. In short, investing money to hire a cleric in the hub area (the classic area which, once freed, hosts party characters and other friendly people, including merchants) becomes almost a necessity, if it weren't for the absurd price requested even from a simple second-level mercenary. After all, the exquisitely hardcore nature of the title emerges from many other systems: we have already mentioned the timed missions, which require careful planning of movements, but we can also add the management of rations, essential for camping in places where you cannot go hunting, such as caves, dungeons or other dungeons. Unfortunately, they weigh a lot and wear out incredibly quickly, so much so that in the early stages of the game you practically give up taking them with you so as not to risk hindering the party's movements. The management part takes care of adding more pepper to the recipe. Without going into the details of the plot, at a certain point you find yourself having to manage an entire kingdom; it is therefore necessary to collect the resources that can be found on the map, create an army, improve the infrastructural level and send our companions to carry out generic missions. If desired, we can consider it an advanced version of what we saw in PoE with the management of the fortress of Caed Nua or in Neverwinter Nights 2. Its management part is not very deep, but it is still an excellent diversion and combined with all the rest it is really effective ; the less willing can still automate it, thus getting it (almost) completely away. Storytelling One of the aspects that left us cold most about Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the narrative side. Unfortunately, Chris Avellone's consultancy was not enough to make a plot interesting which, by tightening, turns out to be full of clichs. Even the screenplay isn't great, with some dialogues that don't seem natural at all, while some themes seem forced into the story, without having any sensitive implications on it. In general it's all very average, so to speak, and it's really hard to get into some of the side stories, even if they're party members and quest-related. In the long run something good emerges, but in general the exploratory part turns out to be much more interesting than the narrative one. It is a bit what also happened in Pillars of Eternity 2, in which the structuring of the game world in islands favored free wandering over following the main story, which resulted in atomization. There are no ships or islands here, but the tiled map almost makes you forget that you have a mission to accomplish. For the rest, there is little to say: many have encountered bugs that did not manifest themselves during our game sessions, apart from some little thing. The only one that has been heard a bit concerns the pathfinding of the characters, sometimes not exactly very precise ... of course, in a game called Pathfinder we can almost consider it a feature. A final note of merit goes to the soundtrack by Inon Zur, a composer that Baldur's Gate fans will know well and who has also created wonderful songs for the Owlcat Games title.", "date": "2018-10-03", "grade": "7.0"}
