Super Stardust Delta is partially approaching this niche, but the fasting of fans has finally ended thanks to the release of Sine Mora on PSN. After conquering Xbox 360 and PC users, the Digital Reality and Grasshopper shooter finally arrives on Sony consoles, but on this occasion we wanted to focus on the portable version, to find out if the frenetic and spectacular game experience also maintains the same charm on the small screen of Vita. For a more complete opinion on the home version, we suggest you read the article published on the occasion of the launch on XBLA. Catapulted into the fascinating world of Seol, the player is told a story that is absolutely atypical for the genre, the result of cross-influences from the Japanese culture behind Grasshopper and from the Eastern European styles of Digital Reality. The Eternal War fought by Imperials and Rebels is a seemingly endless conflict, thanks to the ability of one of the two factions to make time jumps and take refuge in different places and eras. An apparent mix between Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars, behind which however are hidden characters that are anything but conventional, such as anthropomorphic beings moved by blackmail or by the desire for revenge. The plot is however communicated through rather simple means, with the predominant use of text-only screens and dialogues between the various characters. Tic, tac, boom! If on the one hand it may seem like a disengagement, the intention of the developers to find a compromise that does not annoy the purists of the genre is instead evident: the short interludes with dialogue and the scripted scenes that interrupt the action can in fact be accelerated with the pressure of a key, a function that satisfies those who want to launch themselves into a barrage of bullets without too much talk. But where Sine Mora stands out compared to other bullet hell is in its game mechanics entirely based on the passage of time and the possibility of rewinding it. You are not destroyed with a single hit, nor is there a health bar that decreases gradually, but with each damage suffered the timer of the level receives a malus, leading to game over once it reaches zero. Collecting power-ups thus becomes essential, not only to increase the attack power of your aircraft, but also to recharge the timer and have enough time available to complete the level. Added to this is the ability to temporarily slow down everything that happens on the screen, so you can weave between bullets and clean up your opponents. Playstation 3 trophies Given how short the main campaign is, it's a good thing there's so much to do in the extra modes, with a whole host of challenges and Trophies to keep the player engaged. To rise in rank (and therefore unlock the equivalent Trophy) it is necessary to complete a series of tasks, ranging from crashing into a certain number of enemies to completing a level with the highest marks, passing through the use of a specific boosting or destroying a set amount of opponents. Pulchra Vita est It is remarkable how everything is perfectly usable even on Vita: in the most frenetic moments the screen fills up with a shower of bullets, yet the smaller screen does not represent a major handicap for the player, and indeed allows you to have a more complete view of the what is happening. Of course, on Sony's portable console it is more difficult to appreciate in detail the enormous work done by the developers in terms of graphics, but even on the magnificent OLED screen the visual impact remains excellent and, above all, quite fluid, with a high frame rate even in more chaotic moments and in epic battles with gigantic bosses. Those who expected big enrichments given by the tactile functionalities of Vita will be partially disappointed, but from such a precise and frenetic shoot 'em up, moreover designed for traditional control systems, we did not expect otherwise. As already happens on smartphones and tablets, the player is in fact free to move the plane by dragging a finger on the touchscreen, but clearly this is a very uncomfortable and imprecise solution, and in the blink of an eye you end up going back to preferring keys and analog stick. The most original addition does not affect the gameplay of Sine Mora in any way: using the console's GPS, you can unlock a whole series of splendid concept art simply by leaving the house and covering a certain distance with the game in the background. The weight of a campaign is still felt ratheror short, although to make up for the enormous delay of the PSN version, the authors have added an exclusive aircraft to unlock and use in the arcade mode or in the boss battle option. This is a tiny novelty, but sufficient to make the Vita version the richest in terms of content. If the portability factor is added to this, it is evident that Sine Mora represents a must for shoot 'em up enthusiasts in possession of the Sony portable console.", "date": "2012-12-10", "grade": "8.9"}
