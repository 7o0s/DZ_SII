As in the first Yakuza, also in this sequel our ~dragon~ will be able to freely roam the streets of the city, indeed, ~the streets~, given that in addition to Tokyo (the semi-reinterpreted district of Kamuro) now the beautiful Osaka will also be available ( Soutenbori and Shinsei, including the famous Tsuutenkaku tower, which someone in the Land of the Rising Sun has renamed ~the Japanese Eiffel Tower~), getting into occasional fights, talking to people or acquiring various items useful for the adventure. Not to mention the countless new mini-games and sub-adventures in which the good Kiryuu can try his hand. In the first case, in addition to a restyling of those present in the previous chapter, there are new ones that are very fun, such as bowling or golf, while in the second one almost delirium (in the positive sense of the term): in addition to the dating simulator (with the entertainers who can now be invited outside the clubs) the game includes other captivating aspects from a ~sexual~ point of view, given that Kazuma will be able to become the manager of one of the ~hot~ clubs in the area, hire new escorts, change the It's a bad thing to go work as a gigolo in a ~host club~ to get money back. In short, Ryo Saeba's reputation as a ~Shinjuku stallion~ (from the anime and manga City Hunter - Ed) is at risk. The hard life in the city And if things should go badly with certain customers or with the henchmen of the opposing clan, our tattooed friend will always be able to lead his hands. And here we will see some good ones. The fights in Yakuza 2 have in fact been improved and a lot, and this helps to make them much more engaging. First of all, let's say immediately that the opponents' coupling system has been revised: now if you want to switch from one opponent to another during a fight, just press the lever towards him to move the target from one enemy to another. Plus there's more interaction with supporting characters and the occasional brawler audience. Whether they are allies or simply curious, occasionally, depending on the type of Pg, they will lend you a hand by throwing you some knives to use as a defense weapon or by holding your opponent when you throw him against the crowd, thus facilitating the beating. New moves, such as the one that allows you to make the weapon jump out of the hands of an opponent, to bang the heads of two opponents together or to counterattack immediately by taking the enemy open by pressing a key in just the right time make it much more gratifying these events. Even more new combos to perform in two with a friend and without forgetting the terrifying ~Heat Action~ executable with the Triangle key, made even more devastating. A heavy legacy The ~orphaned~ public of that videogame jewel that was Shenmue (1 and 2) just under two years ago was able to find comfort in part in a title that if it is not specifically equal to the saga of Ryo Hazuki, we are close, at least for many items. We are obviously talking about Yakuza, a game that has revived the SEGA brand and which has thrilled millions of gamers all over the globe, to the point of pushing the Japanese company to conceive an entire saga and a film directed by the director under this title Takashi Miike. In recent weeks, among other things, SEGA has announced a third installment of the series, this time for PS3, something made possible thanks to the sales success recorded by this second episode which we will discuss shortly. An authentic triumph that cannot fail to please videogame enthusiasts, especially in view of a possible resumption of the Shenmue 3 project... But let's analyze why it is so successful, based on what we have been able to test in person by playing the incomprehensible Japanese version. In Yakuza 2, the gamer will reprise the role of Kazuma Kiryuu, the member of the Japanese mafia protagonist of the first game. The story is set a year after the events narrated in that episode and we already anticipate that the plot will resume many of the obscure points left open therein, unraveling a story that if on the one hand will reveal some unpublished details, on the other will develop new elements. Everything will mainly revolve around the criminal rivalry between the ~Doujima Dragon~, Kiryuu, and the ~Kansai Dragon~, Gohda Ryuuji, head of the Osaka mafia, as well as the clash between two worlds, two cultures, two ways of conceiving and being yakuza . Even if in the eyes of us Westerners it does not seem seen from the outside, there is in fact a certain cultural difference between the two aree, and this can obviously also be seen at the level of local delinquency, with the Tokyo mafia tending to be more rigid, tough, and the Osaka mafia apparently more relaxed, calm, but no less violent and dangerous than the other. East vs. West, in short, along the lines of the rivalry between the gangs of the western and eastern coasts of the USA. But let's get back to the game and its storyline. Koryuu, no longer head of Toujoukai, and Haruka (the girl saved in the other episode who now lives with him) go to the cemetery to pay homage to the deceased, when the ~boss of bosses~ Terada, ex member of the Osaka yakuza, now transferred to a Tokyo clan, with his personal escort. While the two stop talking, a commando of killers shoots at the boss, killing him. Before exhaling his last breath, he delivers a letter to Kazuma for the head of Oumi Rengou, the main clan of the yakuza in Osaka, with whom Terada wanted to enter into a peace agreement. And from this moment on, a very engaging story begins. Several of the old characters from the previous episode will make their appearance again, some more, some less, and many new characters, among which a beautiful policewoman from Osaka, Kaoru Sayama, who will have an important role in the adventure, and who despite the nickname , ~Yakuza-Hunting Woman~, has a soft spot for ~our mobster~. Japan in one game From a technical point of view, Yakuza 2 is a feast for the eyes. Let's face it: wandering through the streets of Tokyo or Osaka in the game, with their streets crowded with people, their characteristic clubs with colorful and winking signs, one really has the sensation of being physically in those two splendid cities, like our good Tanzen, who has visited them several times in person, can confirm. From this point of view, the graphics have made a further qualitative effort, recreating the reality of certain neighborhoods even better than the first episode, we repeat, perhaps a little reinterpreted for script needs, but still faithful to the style and local reality. Of course, there are still some small flaws such as certain NPCs who suddenly appear out of nowhere, but nothing compared to so much splendor, it would be like nitpicking bordering on the ridiculous. In short, to be honest by now better, at least with this title, it can't be done on PS2. As for the sound, what can I say except that here too everything appears almost perfect: noises, voices, tunes, all faithfully recreated and of sure impact.", "date": "2007-10-17", "grade": "8.5"}
