The choice of the videogame category in which to insert this bizarre concept could only fall on the endless runners, not only for their great hold on the mobile public but also and above all for their undoubted affinities with the subject matter: let's see, therefore, if Hammy Go Round can to make the practice of endlessly going in circles fun... The world goes around The bizarre premises of Hammy Go Round have immediately visible repercussions on the gameplay, given that the action does not develop on a standard two-dimensional plane: the protagonist hamster runs on a curved surface, as if it were precisely part of a wheel . An undoubtedly nice and original solution, which however is not without side effects: especially when the speed becomes higher, the circular scrolling of the scenario can cause a sort of centrifugal effect which in the long run is a bit nauseating. Apart from this little conceptual gaffe, the Happymagenta title follows the manual of the perfect mobile game to the letter, starting with a control system that couldn't be simpler: the hamster runs autonomously, and the user is called to interact with one or two tap on the screen to perform a single or double jump respectively or swipe down with one finger to make the protagonist roll on the ground. These two simple actions allow you to overcome all the obstacles encountered along the way, whether these are rocks, tree trunks or various insects: the challenge, as happens in many similar titles, lies in evaluating in time which movement is appropriate and put it into practice with prompt reflexes. In this sense, the particular curved shape of the scenario on the one hand allows you to identify the dangers slightly in advance, but on the other it makes it vaguely more difficult to correctly evaluate the distances, and the result is a gameplay that - although belonging to one of the most inflated in the mobile sector - undoubtedly has its own particular taste. Also because Hammy Go Round differs from the canons of the genre for a single but fundamental detail: coming into contact with an obstacle does not lead to game over, but only causes a loss of a few seconds of the countdown that marks the time allowed to the user to go as far as possible, and which can be increased by special bonuses that appear randomly along the way. Hammy Go Round has some interesting ideas that are not enough to make it a memorable title To give the user a minimal feeling of progression, Hammy Go Round uses the inevitable ruse of collectible items to then be spent to enhance certain parameters. In this case, this purpose is covered by the acorns that are found in one's path, often positioned in such a way as to force the player to take some more risks in order to be able to collect them. The loot obtained in the various games can be invested both to increase the duration of the initial countdown and to increase the effectiveness of the only two types of power-ups made available to the game and which respectively allow you to stop the passage of time for a few seconds and to send the hamster flying with a jetpack which allows him rapid progress along the course. More could have been done in this sense, and compared to its most renowned competitors, Hammy Go Round appears decidedly poor in the offer of power-ups: in the (clumsy) attempt to put a little more meat on the fire, the Happymagenta developers have inserted a second character to be unlocked by paying out the insane amount of 15,000 acorns that hardly anyone will take the trouble to collect, let alone buy through the appropriate in-app purchase packages. Even with a few too many blunders, Hammy Go Round remains a light and fun title, downloadable for free and which for this very reason can be a valid pastime for some sporadic games. It is a pity that the title is content to be only this without aiming for something more, also because the technical bases were all there, with colorful and pleasant graphics and a sound that does its duty in an excellent way.", "date": "2015-01-28", "grade": "7.0"}
