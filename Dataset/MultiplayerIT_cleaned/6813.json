The protagonist of Skullduggery! (with an exclamation point at the end to distinguish it from another otherwise homonymous game on the App Store) is in fact a skull, belonging to a certain Doug Skullery, rather dynamic and mobile despite the absence of limbs. These premises surround the new title of Clutch Games, an Oregon studio made up of industry veterans and now in its second production, after the very pleasant Little Chomp published almost 2 years ago. Skullduggery! is an original and fun platformer that lacks only for an inconsistent level design Skullduggery! it is essentially a platformer, even if this is not the most correct definition: instead of jumping, the skull moves within the levels thanks to the trajectories given by the player, who actually ~launch~ it like a catapult. Did Angry Birds come to your mind? That's right, the control scheme is practically identical. Basically dragging your finger behind the skull you get the tension of the pink brain contained in it (nice macabre, huh?), which once released propels the bizarre protagonist forward. To act with greater precision, you can maintain the pressure of the fingertip on the screen, an action that generates a sort of slow motion that is very useful for this purpose. And it is precisely in this way that the levels of Skullduggery! are crossed, with one launch after another: in reality, in order not to bore the player too much through a control system that is however challenging if repeated in an exhausting way, the guys from Clutch Games they stuffed the settings with bouncing springs, cadaverous hands and buffers so as to ensure the fluidity of the action, breaking it up as little as possible. A goal that is actually achieved in most cases, even if not everything goes smoothly: the level design is in fact quite fluctuating, alternating excellent and exciting sections with other less brilliant ones, perhaps due to peaks of difficulty that force numerous repetitions of the same area. Let's be clear, we always remain largely in the field of tolerable: Skullduggery! it is a quality product, made with care and attention, which is evident from every element. The exploration of the settings is then an important aspect of the progression, because it allows you to reach secret areas in which to collect treasures of various kinds and complete secondary objectives. Too bad that it is an effort that is quite an end in itself, as there are no real and concrete advantages for completing the levels 100%. In any case, for users looking for a good challenge, Skullduggery! is capable of guaranteeing different levels of depth such as to satisfy even lovers of slightly more ~hardcore~ challenges. Obviously there are also enemies, all skeletons but characterized by different looks and weapons: since being hit with a baseball bat or a bullet is not the best even for a skull, a certain strategy must be employed trying to avoid the area of action of the opponents, perhaps bypassing them and then hitting them from behind. Where the Clutch Games title shows some of its greatest strengths is in the technical component, which can be appreciated through a retro but certainly not poor graphic style: the sprites and the settings are well designed and equipped with good detail, but above all it is the remarkable characterization granting Skullduggery! not to go unnoticed. Eventually a greater variety of locations would have been appreciated, but the promise of new levels arriving with future updates should bring some relief in this sense, at the same time offering content capable of more convincingly justifying the premium price requested.", "date": "2014-10-24", "grade": "8.0"}
