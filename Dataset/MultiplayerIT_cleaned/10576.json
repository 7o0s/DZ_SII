The game in question deals with physical training and body toning, and to achieve this purpose it will also use the Wii Balance Board. In ~My Fitness Coach: Toning the Body~ we will have to follow the instructions of a trainer to train, but first we will have to create our character using a special graphic editor and write our personal and physical data. Unfortunately, the Balance Board is not used to control our weight, neither during registration nor ever, making useless a function that would have been very suitable for such a product. No graphs on the performance of our line, therefore, for that you have to go back to WiiFit. There are 8 places available for rescues so that any family member or person who wants to try can create their own profile effortlessly. Once the preparations have been completed, always guided by our tutor, we will be able to begin to discover the first workouts. First we will be taught how to keep our guard. Legs in front of each other, left under the chin and right on the nose. Being able to move in time without stumbling will take some effort, but it is necessary work, since all boxing exercises, whether it is punching, dodging or varying the footwork, are develop on this position. To these exercises must then be added those that can only be achieved with the Balance Board and which will therefore be obscured if the peripheral is not connected. We burn calories The package is divided into two categories of tests. In the first call ~Shape Boxing~, the tutor will guide you in the progression of exercises where you will have to learn how to perform the various boxing strikes such as hooks, straights, crosses and uppercuts, or dodge fake punches by bending over at the torso. The whole game is controlled by holding Wiimote and Nunchuck in hand or even with two Wiimotes if you want to get rid of the wires. This is even when you have to bend on your knees. Using the balance would have improved the accuracy of the controls, but the developers' choice was to reach as many players as possible, even those without the additional Nintendo device. Even for the rest of the package, however, detection isn't always flawless. The many different types of shots that we are led to make are all actually carried out by moving the corresponding controller. The game wants to make you move and sweat, and it succeeds even without giving weight to these significant details, leaving to the good will of everyone the desire to perform the gestures correctly, which certainly involves more physical effort and more concentration. All the exercises are marked by a musical theme chosen from thirty, including a very elementary arrangement of ~Eye of the Tiger~. Moving on these rhythms, when you get to the end of the exercise you will have sweated and consumed a lot of calories. The game will tell you how many, after which it will add points to a daily counter which serves to remind us how much we have played on any given day. Ritual stamp, and if you want you have already done your part. More exercises In addition to the main exercises there are also several others: two are unlocked immediately, while four must be unlocked by playing. In one you have to hit the boxing gloves that will be brought to you by the coach: also in this case according to the game you should hit in at least 6 different ways, but just use left and right to figure it out. In another we have to dodge the punches of a robot. This game can be played both with and without a balance board. Among others we also point out the sack and jumping rope. If you have the Balance Board, it is in this section of the game that you will be able to use it properly, and you will be given access to 8 other exercises, some of which have already been seen in WiiFit such as push-ups, abdominal exercises and push-ups. Although these tests are of a sufficient number, they risk taking a back seat since they are not part of the training package, almost as if they were an extra side dish. Compared to ~WiiFit~, this game offers a welcome additional function, namely that of submitting daily exercises. Just choose from time to time between light and normal training and the program will select the type and duration of the tests. What is missing, however, is a graphical trend of progress, a trend that is calculated only by youtime spent on the game, and not from a real analysis of your body. ~My Fitness Coach: Toning Your Body~ is definitely suitable for those looking for a fun way to get moving, even if the title doesn't care that you do everything right, leaving you to play in a rather free way.", "date": "2009-08-12", "grade": null}
