It often happens when we talk about mobile games, even more often when we try to somehow reduce famous and consolidated experiences in the simplified form of an arcade-style title for iOS and Android, although in this case Capcom has gone further by choosing an approach from ~ clicker~. No, we are not talking about the disturbing creatures that inhabit the post-apocalyptic world of The Last of Us, but about the ~games~ (it is appropriate to define them this way, this time) which imply minimal interaction, which translates into a few taps of the screen or even in the activation of an automatic mode that carries on the progression for us. Street Fighter: Duel, Cammy's artwork is a good start These are bizarre derivatives for a market made up mostly of casual users, who only vaguely know the videogame medium and are looking for a pastime that can entertain them extemporaneously, while they are on the bus or in line at the post office. , the spin-off developed by A Plus and produced by Crunchyroll meets these criteria? The answer in the Street Fighter: Duel review. Gameplay: Don't call it a beat 'em up Street Fighter: Duel, chained special moves create a show of light and color It is immediately clear that Street Fighter: Duel is not a fighting game like the many episodes of the series on which it is based. Although, in fact, there were all the conditions to be able to create a solid and competent ~gestural~ beat'em-up, as indeed there are many on the App Store and Google Play (see for example the review of Shadow Fight Arena), in this case it was thought more of exploiting the characters and the universe of the Capcom series to create something simpler. The various Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Cammy and singing company engage in spectacular team fights on screen, sure, but their actions are almost completely automated. The only thing we are allowed on the gameplay front is to activate their special moves as soon as the relative bar is full and possibly chain them using the classic ~elemental~ system which creates synergies and produces more or less relevant effects depending on of the adversaries we face. In this sense there is a further strategic mechanic, if we want to define it that way, which consists in organizing the positions that our team will assume once on the field, as well as any support characters who will multiply the statistics of the individual warriors , increasing the effectiveness of their blows and their resistance to obey a very banal concept: apart from rare cases, the strongest on paper wins. The cancellation of the human factor inevitably weighs on Street Fighter: Duel's ability to escape to the inevitable logic of a free-to-play model which consists in making the characters grow, increase their level, equip them with the best items, possibly ~merge~ them in case you have several duplicates and carry on this discussion indefinitely in order to obtain the degree of competitiveness necessary to progress through the campaign and missions. Structure: the numbers are not lacking Street Fighter: Duel, team setup at the start of the campaign In terms of content, clearly, Street Fighter: Duel does not miss anything and indeed grinds level after level, drawing on a very large roster, as part of a long single player campaign to keep us engaged as much as possible and make us slam into a paywall A few hours later. It was inevitable, the F2P model works like this, but fortunately there is a whole series of ~lateral~ challenges that can be pursued for the purpose of progression to circumvent these obstacles. From this point of view it would be unfair to accuse the Crunchyroll product of be ruthless: a system of tickets or consumables for recharging energy has not been introduced and therefore it is possible to play for as long as you want, opting for other paths where the campaign has become too difficult at that moment. Of course, as soon as the asynchronous multiplayer mode is unlocked (which is totally automated, in order not to really leave anything to chance) the monetization orientation becomes clear. Optional but obvious. Technical realization: damn it, it's a little gem Street Fighter: Duel doesn't skimp on scenarios, characters and animations When someone pulls out a clicker from a historic fighting game, obviously he's not an inexperienced madman but someone who has done the math very well, and net of the criticisms on the actual quality of this type of experience, one cannot really say that the rThe guys from A Plus have done a bad job on a technical and artistic level, indeed visually Street Fighter: Duel is a little gem. Yes, the almost chibi connotation of the characters needs to be digested, but between chained special moves, animations, scenarios and artwork there is really a lot, a lot of substance able to excite the historical fans of the Capcom series. And if we add the remastered original music to this pleasant system, the result is a truly remarkable show, which alone is worth the price of the download. Which is zero, of course: so to speak.", "date": "2023-03-06", "grade": "6.5"}
