{"name": "Roadkill", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/roadkill.html", "text": "I have a job for you The roar of the engine deafens the prostitutes on the street and instills fear in the elderly who still shuffle through the filth of the Lava Falls neighborhoods. During a chase, when you have two armed jeeps chasing you all too insistently to punch you, there's little time to think... and it happens that you find your fenders covered in blood. Worse, sometimes people don't resign themselves to their fate and stick to the side of the car, at least until you unload it on some sidewalk, during the reversal that puts you face to face with the enemy and allows you to eliminate the hassle once once and for all: a few bursts of machine guns in the right places and the jeeps blow up, throwing their passengers into the void like fireworks. But without a final bang. Well, this nice little picture describes the nature of Roadkill in quite detail, so anyone who can't stand gratuitous violence and senseless massacres will have already understood that this is not the video game to buy for your little brother for Christmas. The main game mode consists, precisely, in completing a certain number of missions. The tasks are assigned by your supervisor on duty, and the quality of the work will earn you approval from those in charge, so much so that you deserve ~promotions~. Sometimes you will have to kill members of a rival gang, other times it will be necessary to clarify the ideas of some merchant who does not know who is boss. In any case, on the roads you will find dozens of enemies, equipped like you with unconventional means of transport and with a great desire to harm others. Weapons can damage you, while inexplicably direct confrontation has no effect... which is really a shame: solving fights with a ~breakthrough~ was one of Twisted Metal's strong points. The control system, as expected, is extremely simple. What disappoints is the dynamics of the vehicle, in my opinion unrealistic and cumbersome: in clashes you get a lot of blows because you can't direct the car where you want. Fortunately, the aiming of the weapons is automatic, but this, together with the possibility of repairing all the damage simply by collecting a power-up on the road, takes away from the involvement and satisfaction of the game. The additional vehicles, the submissions and the extra weapons with limited ammunition are of little use: the animated sequences and the excellent dubbing (in English) create a series of expectations that Roadkill disappoints, basically due to the lack of depth. Old lady taken in full! Investments and blood are two of the things best reproduced in Roadkill. Try to throw yourself at a pedestrian and you'll reduce him to a pulp, or worse you'll drag him along with you for a good stretch of road, while he screams and drips with blood. Well, can someone explain to me how all this can make up for the lack of a solid and well-studied game mechanic? Technical features As I have already had the opportunity to say, the animated sequences that intersperse the game are well done, mostly in terms of ~direction~. In practice, polygonal models are nothing special by today's standards, and the situation at stake is much worse. The polygons are there, but the textures look like they did on PSone and the environments are dull. Both the vehicle and character designs show nothing that suggests a so-called ~next generation~ game, and on top of that, there is a noticeable drop in frame rate during crowded situations. Absurdly, the best done details are blood and investments... a worrying thing, in my opinion, as one wonders if the developers wanted to make a good game or something that appeals only for their background. The sound sector, on the other hand, shows a certain quality: while driving around and facing shootings, it is possible to hear different themed radio channels and a series of signed music tracks. Comment Roadkill is a game with a solid and interesting storyline, and the idea of tackling numerous armed vehicles to get into the good graces of those in power can be engaging. The problem is that everything was done in an approximate way, both from a technical point of view (a few famous songs can't make a difference) and as regards the game structure. It is not a question of repetitiveness, because other games have even made it their workhorse, as much as a lack of depth: the ideas present are inevitably borrowed from other titles and there is little incentive to move forward. pro: Interesting plot. Raw and well acted dialogues. But in English Signed soundtrack Cons: Graphics not up to the situation Cumbersome control system Not very engaging There is probably something fascinating in the combination of motors and violence. Or at least it seems that American gamers really appreciate the possibility of driving armed vehicles and destroying anything that comes within range, whether they are passers-by or potential enemies. If Twisted Metal (which some time ago made its debut on PS2) emphasized the power of armored cars as well as their picturesque appearance, and Carmageddon unceremoniously shifted the focus to free investments, Roadkill tries to put the two together and to use an unoriginal but engaging plot as a glue, which unfolds through animated sequences of a certain thickness. After the spread of a deadly virus, the world has lost its facade and has begun to impose the rule of the strongest in no uncertain terms. For everyone. As Mason Strong, roam the city in your supercharged car like a new Mel Gibson looking for a master to please to make ends meet. Under the orders of the boss on duty, you will have to move to three different cities and complete a large number of missions, mainly based on the use of force: killings, devastation, etc. etc.", "date": "2003-12-18", "grade": null}
