So let's see how things went in practice... The less we are the better off? We have already talked at length about the exceptional value of Rayman Legends as a two-dimensional platformer in our review based on the Wii U version, to which we refer you in case you want to know the details of the Ubisoft production. Here we prefer to focus on the features of the PlayStation Vita port, as the gameplay and content of the title are basically the same. The differences in the field of play had already been abundantly announced during the last months of the game's development, with the exception of the Invasion levels which had already made potential buyers turn up their noses: fortunately Ubisoft confirmed that these stages will be added via a patch, even if you don't know the update date yet. It was also known that multiplayer - one of the absolute strengths of Rayman Legends - would be limited to only two users via an ad hoc connection or via Wi-Fi. If you lean towards the second hypothesis, from the main menu you can choose to join another user's game or to act as a host, playing alone while waiting for someone to join. The system is undoubtedly valid, and if on the one hand it is a unique feature (in the other versions only local multiplayer is contemplated, with the participants who must all physically be in front of the same screen), on the other it is inevitable that the experience loses more than something when it is not possible to share it with three other people at the same time: above all, the lack of a closer communication component between users is felt, which is an integral part of the fun of playing Rayman Legends together. That said, the Ubisoft product remains an excellent experience even in single player, taking full advantage of the PlayStation Vita hardware, starting with an extremely reliable control system, equipped with the ideal precision and responsiveness to face the pitfalls of the most demanding levels . The splendid two-dimensional cosmetics created by the Montpellier studios then stands out even more clearly on the highly defined display of the Sony laptop, proving to be an authentic feast for the eyes. And if something appears too small from time to time, simply spread two fingers apart on the touchscreen for a comfortable zoom. Rayman Legends on PlayStation Vita is a gem, even if it's not the best version ever Murphy's Law Thanks to its characteristics, PlayStation Vita is the only console together with Wii U through which it is possible to play the levels starring Murfy in the way in which they were originally conceived, that is by acting on the touchscreen. It is therefore necessary to touch, drag or move certain elements on the screen to allow another character to continue, occasionally also taking advantage of the gyroscope of the console in some segments in which it is necessary to rotate the scenario. If in the Wii U review we underlined how Murfy's stages were fully enjoyable only in multiplayer - given that the artificial intelligence responsible for controlling the second protagonist hardly proves to be an ideal partner - here on PlayStation Vita this assumption loses part of its validity if you rely on the connection via Wi-Fi: the lack of clear and direct communication between users in this case can prove to be a serious limitation for segments like these, in which the coordination between the two characters on the screen is fundamental. From this point of view, the addition of an exclusive section for PlayStation Vita dedicated to five levels all focused on the use of Murfy pleases up to a certain point, given that it is certainly not the spearhead of Rayman's play offer Legends. And if Ubisoft's commitment to offering the possibility of exploiting the rear touchpad while leaving the screen completely free is commendable, on the other hand it takes a few seconds to realize that it is a configuration that sacrifices precision to be extremely sertaken into consideration.", "date": "2013-09-13", "grade": "8.9"}
