Of course, one could argue that the reason behind such behavior is due to the inability to find a really convincing formula to expand in subsequent updates, but at the same time the Wii versions of FIFA have always made up for the inevitable technical gaps with interesting ideas , although you don't always succeed in examining the facts. Wait a minute, something is wrong. Where have we read these lines before? Of course, in the review that the good Fabio Palmisano wrote for FIFA 12! Well yes, we were tempted to offer you the exact same text, thinking we could get away with it, but we didn't succeed; and after all Electronic Arts didn't succeed either with FIFA 13 which, as you may have read, has an extraordinary series of similarities with the previous edition. All right, let's just say it's the same, apart from the logo, the roses and some other small details. So the interesting concept of FIFA City returns, the city that grows and develops as we obtain positive results within the various modes, thus urging us to try our hand at everything the game has to offer. Everything except online multiplayer, because that doesn't exist and, we assume, will never be implemented. The city of terror We have not noticed any substantial changes in the dynamics governing the development of FIFA City. It starts with a bare and sparsely populated center to then arrive at the construction of sports and television facilities, buildings of various kinds and even statues celebrating our glory. To obtain this development, just win a tournament among those available (for example a season of the Italian Serie A, or the Premier League, or even the Spanish Liga), try the full-bodied Coach mode or the even more interesting career mode, ~Dalle Strade to the Stadiums~, which puts us in the shoes of a player who we can customize in name and physical appearance, enhancing his skills as we gain experience points and following him on the long journey that will lead him to play in the big international stadiums starting from the small pitches of the suburbs. The idea of pre-match bets is nice (although there are conflicting opinions on the matter, ask the former Siena coach for information - ok, ok, we're kidding), which allow us to ~bet~ on specific events (a goal, an assist, etc.) which, if verified, will multiply the prize up for grabs and allow us to make our climb more quickly. The structure of FIFA 13 is therefore confirmed to be very solid and promises lasting entertainment, thanks to a sufficiently varied offer, which we would have liked to see renewed in some of its facets rather than re-proposed as if nothing had happened. And once on the pitch... The same interface, the same methods and even the same gameplay: the commitment that Electronic Arts has made in the creation of the game, it seems ungenerous to say, borders on the ridiculous and has irreparable repercussions on the numerical judgment, which we invite you to consider higher than two points in the in case you don't have FIFA 12 for Wii. Never change a winning team? Maybe yes, but in this sense we cannot explain the persistence of a series of problems affecting the gameplay, from the mediocre control system with Wii-mote and Nunchuk (which we invite you to replace with the Classic Controller, preferably Pro, in case have the opportunity) to artificial intelligence, which during our tests showed performance that was decidedly below expectations; both as regards our team mates, who don't participate enough in the action (not to mention the goalkeepers' postponements...), and as regards the opponents, who rarely produce anything more than an attempt to break through the centre. Playing a few games is pleasant, we don't say no, but the comparison with the ~real~ FIFA is merciless and we don't see what difficulties the developers may have had in implementing at least some of the aspects that over the last few years have made the simulation of EA Canada the best available on the market. A consideration that naturally extends to the graphics, which adopt a questionable cartoon style for the players, with ~old gen~ animations and, above all, the lack of any aesthetic correspondence between the virtual player and his real counterpart.", "date": "2012-10-09", "grade": "5.5"}
