{"name": "Murderous Pursuits", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/murderous-pursuits-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Murderous Pursuits comes at the end of a long period in soft launch which has allowed the game, as per tradition, to build a solid user base with which to crowd the servers in order to guarantee a very rapid matchmaking. Compared to the version PC, released on Steam two and a half years ago, the Blazing Griffin title is presented on iOS and Android in the classic freemium format, downloadable for free but with a set of optional microtransactions that can accelerate progression and which, inevitably, translate into a advantage for those who use them. Gameplay You know The Ship, the original Half-Life mod that transformed the Valve shooter into a competitive experience set on a boat, in which the participants had the objective of eliminating a randomly drawn target among the other players? Here, Murderous Pursuits draws heavily on those atmospheres, while the gameplay mechanics clearly refer to the multiplayer sector of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. After selecting our character from an ever-growing shortlist and completing some tutorials, in fact, we will be able to access the main mode of the package, Classic Hunt, and thus participate in a silent confrontation between eight potential assassins, each of whom has the task of finding the targets of the moment among the participants in a large gala party organized in four different halls of a huge colony ship from the 1800s. The touch controls are great, as far as possible, but a physical alternative would clearly have allowed for greater agility when on the move. In any case, to manage the character we will be able to count on a repositionable virtual stick, rotating the view with the right thumb and activating contextual actions as soon as they appear on the screen, see for example a lethal attack against our intended victim or another hunter, that in this way we will be able to stun for a few seconds before moving away and perhaps changing clothes after the first corner, or entering a shadow area in Assassin's Creed style. To understand who our targets really are, we will have to refer to a light indicator and perhaps use a special ability that detects nearby characters, just like Eagle Vision. Wrong target can be risky, as it will burn our cover exposing us to potential attacks. Structure The Murderous Pursuits system is certainly not devoted to frenzy and is certainly very derivative, but in the mobile sector there do not seem to be many productions of the same genre, and this undoubtedly represents a strong point for the Blazing Griffin title. Another is found in the rich structure, which unlocks new content as we level up. And so the aforementioned Classic Hunt mode is joined by others, in this case the Stronghold Assault team stipulation and two further all-against-all, namely Elimination and Spy VS Assassin. At the same time, earning experience points allows you to access new skills and thus enhance your hunter, who will be able to react promptly to any sorties or enjoy amplified perception. In addition to the competitive experiences, however, Murderous Pursuits also boasts narrative insights focused on individual characters, with backstories organized at crossroads that therefore provide a story for each protagonist of the game. It's a pity that Italian is not among the supported languages, which makes these stories a bit boring to follow. Technical realization On the technical implementation front, there is little to say: the graphics are practically identical to the PC version, and on the iPad Pro we were able to adjust the parameters so that it ran at 60 frames per second with maximum details. In this sense, the glance is remarkable, the settings are large and detailed, and the basic animations convey a sense of quality, but the character models are unfortunately always the same and so we find ourselves moving within these sumptuous events where all the guests are the same. The sound, on the other hand, is excellent, embellished with music and dialogues that help create a certain atmosphere. Too bad for the effects, which are a bit lacking.", "date": "2020-09-15", "grade": "7.5"}
