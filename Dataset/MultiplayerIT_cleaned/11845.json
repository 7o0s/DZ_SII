{"name": "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-recensione.html", "text": "Unique, great developer capable of boasting the title of creator of the two sagas that literally defined the genre of first-person shooter with a war setting, Infinity Ward finally returns to the videogame scene after almost three years of intense work. And the result of so much effort is the masterpiece that you find reviewed in these pages. After creating the Medal of Honor series, with that Allied Assault that made PC owners discover the possibility of experiencing interactively what they had seen at the cinema a few years earlier with Saving Private Ryan, a large part of the software house ( which was called 2015 at the time), decided to start a new company following its takeover by Electronic Arts. The result of this daring attempt was the birth of Infinity Ward and the development of a new war saga - Call of Duty. Also in this case the success was incredible, with two chapters with stratospheric sales and a third title entrusted to another software house (Trecision), which came out a little quietly and only for consoles. It is on this long preamble that Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is grafted; still a war title, epic, engaging, noisy and extremely linear but which enters the market with a preponderant innovation: the Second World War is finally left aside (we couldn't stand it anymore) to immerse the player in a fictitious story set Nowadays. Fiction or reality? We are grappling with the main fears of the Western world: a group of Russian ultranationalists has seized a series of nuclear warheads and, thanks to some alliances in the Middle East, is making all the main allied armies worry that they will have to face an escalation of terror born from the destabilization of some Arab territories, following a military coup, and which will lead to the incredible and atrocious launch of a nuclear bombardment against the east coast of America. We stop here with the spoiler even if, it must be said immediately, the plot perhaps lacks a little originality. Don't expect big twists or strange narrative entanglements: there are the good guys and the bad guys, both rather stereotypical, and you will obviously be part of the first. But where Call of Duty 4 absolutely does not sin is in the quality of the narration. Unlike what was seen in the first two titles, the single-player game unfolds through a single campaign where the player will play the role, quite alternately, of a soldier of the first reconnaissance force of the US Marine Corps and those of a military of the 22nd British SAS Regiment. What amazes about the single player is an extremely high variety of settings which, thanks to an unfortunately very limited duration of the game, will surprise the player with continuous changes of style in gameplay and action. You never find yourself doing the same thing twice, or feeling a sense of dj vu as the campaign progresses: you are drawn into pitched battles trying to defend a perched position on a Russian farm, after taking it by assault, a long foray into a Chernobyl devastated by the radioactive accident, in full camouflage and armed with a sniper rifle, in the company of a captain who will be our shoulder to reach a privileged position to attend a meeting between terrorists. On another occasion, the three different cannons of a C-130 flying over enemy territory are controlled and, with an entire mission whose only view will be that from above and in black and white to which many reports of aerial bombing on the news, we will find ourselves covering a group of fleeing allies. And then urban warfare actions, an assault on a missile station in the middle of the Russian steppe and of course the classic rail missions which are in some way the hallmark of Infinity Ward productions. On one occasion we will be aboard a fleeing jeep, while in another mission we will have the command of a cannon mounted on the side door of a transport helicopter, during a raid on an Arab village which, later on, will turn in a race against time to try to save a pilot shot down by enemy flak. In short, at this point it will be clear: Call of Duty 4 can be played literally in one go, without a moment of breath, and invests the player with adrenaline-pumping sensations and engaging, making him feel in the midst of a perfectly narrated action, where the regiment mates almost become people in the flesh, such is the empathetic bond that is created in the continuation of the campaign. But... as mentioned above... everything lasts too little. CoD4 playedat ~Regular~ level (the second of four difficulty levels) it lasts no more than 6 hours. If they manage to earn a maximum of 2 more by playing it at the ~Veteran~ level (even if the degree of frustration will rise more than exponentially) but once the final sequence of credits is reached, the desire to have a hypothetical Call of Duty 5 or even just an expansion, is grossly atrocious and it's not enough fun but simplistic Arcade mode that is unlocked. Is it just a length issue? In reality, remaining anchored to the single player, it is not only the duration of the campaign that is lacking. Call of Duty has always historically stood out for its incredible linearity and for the action at the highest possible levels of scripting. The road to follow while advancing in the map is always and only one; sometimes we are given a secondary way to try to flank the enemy instead of assaulting him frontally but it is very little. Usually you are always in the company of 3-4 other soldiers who cannot be controlled or commanded in any way: everything is scripted to the thousandth and each event will be activated as we pass in the way it was programmed. Until we advance to a certain location, our comrades will remain undercover firing at waves of enemies relentlessly and won't attempt to advance to try and complete mission objectives. It is the player who will have to dare and will have the task of setting events in motion. On the other hand, our most faithful companions and related to the main plot are practically immortal and cannot be killed, so it would have been far too easy to let them do the dirty work. Probably the mix between entirely scripted levels, a rather evident form of respawn and the presence of allied soldiers with infinite life will make those looking for an Operation Flashpoint or Rainbow Six-style simulation in CoD4 turn up their noses. But approaching the game with this conviction is wrong: Call of Duty is an interactive war film, where every element of the story is perfectly blended in the action that permeates each map and proceed along artfully designed levels with the precise aim of immersing the player in this modern warfare it is a feeling that gives great satisfaction and a sense of absolute completeness when, at the end of a raid on enemy territory, you find yourself getting together around your captain. Among other things, with a rather bold and original gesture, Infinity Ward has decided to also introduce dogs among the enemies that can be faced during the missions. And they are damn hard to fight: perhaps a little too unrealistically they move with great speed and never in a straight line, always with a lateral strafe that makes them very difficult to hit from a distance and you will find them in the blink of an eye in the throat. At this point a mini-game will be activated, which couldn't be more mini, where you will have 1-2 seconds to press the V key at a precise moment to break the dog's neck, otherwise you will be bitten and you will die instantly. We like to be technical However, the artificial intelligence remains noteworthy, especially of the enemies, who manage to assume a very high degree of hostility towards the player. They move in a rather realistic way, in an attempt to never show the side to the player, make the most of the covers and, above all, make perhaps exaggerated use of grenades and rockets. To be picky, they seem to perform better when taken in small numbers, given that in a couple of missions in which we find ourselves desperately facing large enemy assaults, the ultranationalists advance in a straight line without worrying at all about being in an open field or to have someone stationed behind a window holding a huge machine gun and making a clean sweep of the entire assault line. The interlude sequences between one mission and another deserve an applause, with a very refined technological style. They are a little gem of immersion and perfectly hide the uploads which, especially for the PC version, are disarmingly short. Turning instead to a more in-depth technical analysis, the title manages to give great satisfaction also in terms of graphics. Call of Duty 4 on our test system always ran at maximum fluidity, never dropping below 40-50 frames per second with all graphic details at maximum (including anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering) and at a resolution of 1680x1050. But its engine is very scalable and with a minimum of work on the settings, it can run more than decently even on mid-range systemswith a few years behind them. Only note is a swap problem of a few seconds at the beginning of each mission, caused by the loading of textures and which triggers video and audio. But it's completely negligible and seems to exclusively affect the PC edition. Absolutely noteworthy are the dynamic lighting with a consequent system of shadows in real time that really manage to offer that extra touch of realism in indoor environments and during explosions and a particle system of great relief and aesthetic beauty, in capable of handling the smoke from blasts and smoke grenades perfectly. The same goes for the models and animations of the other soldiers, in particular of their companions who, on more than a few occasions, take on extremely realistic movements such as when they crouch one behind the other before blowing up a door, or when they take cover each other during the ascent on a helicopter at the end of the mission. As it was reasonable to expect, even the weapons are not far behind with a very full-bodied and well-groomed armament in every detail: M16A4, MP5, AK47, heavy machine guns such as the M249, various pistols and rockets (above all the magnificent Javelin capable of any tank in the air thanks to its parabolic attack trajectory). But even in this case we like to be fussy because some details didn't convince us: the vegetation in particular, immobile and with a rather low detail which, on the occasions when we find ourselves crawling on the ground, strikes us like a bolt from the blue for its graphic poverty and the absolutely static sky devoid of any effect which, especially in daytime missions, will make you turn up your nose, catapulting you back in time to when the game horizon was a simple bitmap (even quite grainy to be honest ). Absolutely nothing to complain about as regards the soundtrack, curated by Harry Williams (Metal Gear Solid 3 and 4 and the Narnia saga among his other works), in classic wartime orchestral style and able to underline the moments of greater pathos with incredible sonic precision. The same goes for the speech, dubbed into Italian more than decently (the game is completely localized in our language) and for the sound effects of weapons and explosions, absolutely perfect and very realistic especially when heard from a distance or coming from closed places. To summarize everything, we can add that Call of Duty 4 offers a top-level technical sector capable of surprising Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 users while, on PC, the result is perhaps slightly below expectations, certainly lower than the future Crysis (as was logical to expect) and perhaps even a hair behind Gears of War. Multiplayer mon amour It seems obvious to say this thinking of the incredible success of the Call of Duty 4 beta for Xbox 360 but we like to be repetitive: the real strength of CoD4 is the multiplayer. The single player is played in one breath and is soon left aside, while the multiplayer is extremely powerful longevity with a practically zero learning curve and the possibility of immediately entering the game, having fun. The multiplayer offers, on all three release platforms, 16 maps, some specifically designed for this mode, others extracted directly from the single player campaign. They are all maps with an excellent mix of indoor and outdoor environments, where the level design is the master and manages to perfectly manage a very variable number of players. On 360 and PS3 up to 18 challengers are supported simultaneously while on PC it can go up to 32. In terms of modes we have the classic Free-for-All and Team Deathmatch where you just fragga with or without friends and some more tactical modes with objectives: Domination, where you have to capture and defend some flags scattered around the map, Search and Destroy where, in classic Counter-Strike style, a team has the task of placing an explosive in the opposing base which must instead prevent it or defuse the explosive , Sabotage, where the explosive is placed in the center of the level and the team that manages to collect it must place it in the opposing base and, finally, Headquarters, where a randomly appearing point on the map must be conquered and defended for one minute. Each of these modes can be accompanied by two different modifiers: in fact, it is possible to activate the Classic mod which disables the classes while the weapons and bonuses are scattered on the ground across the map and also partially modifies the physics (you die less easily and jump more up and faster) or you can enable Hardcore mode which disables it", "date": "2007-11-09", "grade": null}
