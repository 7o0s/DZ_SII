{"name": "Rocky", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rocky-2.html", "text": "THERE'S NO EASY WAY OUT Precisely because of the difficulty in reproducing this ~magic~, the announcement of the development of a tie-in based on the Italian stallion generated as much enthusiasm as perplexity in the Rocky-fan community: moreover, the responsible team, the English Rage, did not represent certainly synonymous with quality. Nonetheless, the final result managed to go far beyond the expectations deriving from these premises, so much so that on balance it is a purchase seriously to be considered not only for boxing or film enthusiasts, but also for casual gamers looking for a good fighting game full of charm. Unlike most video games based on successful films, the real strength of the Rage effort lies in the fact that, fortunately for consumers, the programming has been entrusted to a group of true Rocky fans, who are therefore able to know what made the saga great to be able to reproduce it as faithfully as possible on consoles. The main game mode, called ~movie~, puts the player in the role of the young Stallone at the time of the first episode, when he was nothing more than a complete stranger with a great talent for boxing. So starting from the very first meetings, the effort of the British team reproduces the main stages of the series and the most important meetings: Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, Ivan Drago are all present, together with a good number of athletes created from scratch by Rage. The presence of a handful of CG sequences that reproduce the key passages of the films is the icing on the cake; although the technical quality of the latter is questionable and the dubbing is bad (it is not the original one), they more than sufficiently fulfill their purpose of identifying the player as much as possible in the role of the Italian stallion. Furthermore, the idea of inserting training between one match and another is definitely apt, essential for strengthening one's boxer under a whole series of characteristics such as strength, speed, resistance, movement, etc. Therefore, the possibility of seeing your digital Rocky grow and evolve not only aesthetically, but also on a technical level, only further cements the feeling of identity between player and digital alter-ego. Which, in a video game based on such a charismatic character, is a huge plus. IT DOESN'T HURT, IT DOESN'T HURT! Obviously, such fidelity to the original would be useless if the purely playful structure were of bad quality: fortunately, Rocky, in addition to being a good reproduction of the film, is also a good fighting game, extremely rich in moves that can be performed and very playable. The excellent training method, essential to start with, immediately reveals the care taken by the English programmers regarding the amount of attacks that can be performed: there is everything, from the simple direct or hook to the articulated face-body-face combos. Unfortunately, however, this variety of blows is overshadowed by an artificial intelligence subject to numerous criticisms, which in fact makes the opponent boxers rather vulnerable to some blows, towards which they often and willingly do not oppose any resistance, making victories possible without effort. Fortunately, these bugs occur quite rarely, and in any case they do not represent a defect such as to heavily reduce the quality of Rage production. From a graphic point of view, Rocky stands at discrete levels, but far from the potential of Ps2; probably due to its multi-platform nature, the creature of the British programmers is aesthetically just above average, with good polygonal modeling, appreciable light effects but also evident defects especially in the realization of the public, awkward and badly animated. Also to be reviewed are the proportions of the bodies of some boxers, including Rocky II, with an enormous head compared to the body. The sound is subdued, and not only due to the aforementioned poor dubbing: of the songs that helped create the atmosphere of the cinematic Rockies, only a couple remained, with the most famous ones probably excluded for copyright reasons. Comment Rocky, as already mentioned, is a product whose final quality has proved to be far beyond expectations. Rage has in fact succeeded in the arduous task of reproducing the unique atmosphere of the film in an appreciable way, also thanks to a main mode that puts the player in the role of the Italian stallion allowing you to relive the rise of the most famous boxer in history firsthand of the cinema. Such great onesresults are enhanced by an enjoyable game structure, not without defects but definitely spot on. Pros: a must for Rocky fans good fidelity to the film definitely valid on a playful level Cons: some bugs in the AI of the opponents graphically improveable missing the most important music tracks Rocky Balboa, the Italian stallion. A name that was, and still is, capable of arousing great emotions in a huge number of people fascinated by the events of the most famous Italian-American boxer in the world of cinema. The perfect alchemy created by Sylvester Stallone, combined with an easy identifiability in the ideals of the protagonist and the excellent narrative rhythm are just some of the aspects that made Rocky the phenomenon that he was; the reality, despite a decidedly disappointing fifth chapter and some inevitable style falls, the fact that after many years it still enjoys an indisputable popularity today is the clearest and most incontrovertible sign of the ~magic~ contained in the saga.", "date": "2002-12-24", "grade": null}
