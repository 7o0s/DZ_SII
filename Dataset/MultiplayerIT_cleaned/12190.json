{"name": "Rafa Nadal Tennis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rafa-nadal-tennis.html", "text": "Developed by the Spanish Virtual Toys, Rafa Nadal Tennis immediately denotes a certain ~psychological subjection~ towards the athlete, perhaps caused by the fact that both he and the development team are of the same nationality: the fact is that in the game it is only possible to impersonate the good Rafa, and not choose between different characters as in Tennis Open 2007. Similarly to the Gameloft product, however, even here the opponents are not digital counterparts of real champions, and therefore one will find himself colliding with unknown emeritus. But this is perhaps the only link between the two products, as a few play sessions are enough to notice how Rafa Nadal Tennis lacks many of those elements that made Tennis Open 2007 excellent. To begin with, the main menu is not very rich: it is possible to try your hand only in exhibition matches, a basic championship and a tutorial useful for learning all the techniques of the case. As if that weren't enough, there are only four selectable fields (related to as many different surfaces) and very few possibilities for customizing the game. In short, one player, three meager modes and four scenarios are already few in an absolute sense, but they really become a trifle when compared to the plethora of material offered by Tennis Open 2007. The situation is relieved by a functional multiplayer section via bluetooth, which at least gives Rafa Nadal Tennis the minimum amount of longevity that otherwise would have been denied. However, the Virtual Toys work appears rather poor, both in content, in the graphics of the menus, and in the in-game visual impact: while boasting motion capture animations by Nadal himself, the title does not surprise that much, revealing itself also in this sense inferior in all respects to the Gameloft product. The sprites of the players - although globally discreet - are very small, the scenarios are quite accurate but too static and the animations appear good but not very varied. This condition of inferiority is not overturned even by the gameplay, which is still the most successful element of the whole package. Compared to Tennis Open 2007, Rafa Nadal falls more within the sphere of one-thumb gaming, and is therefore substantially playable using only the thumb, using the directional cross and the OK key. By pressing it, shots are carried out (which can be given an effect with the side selection buttons and which can be ~cut~ using one of the four directions), and by keeping it pressed, the athlete is ordered to position himself automatically in the trajectory of the ball, one feature that really doesn't always work as it should. Even if not very dynamic and exciting, so Rafa Nadal's matches flow quite calmly, accompanied by rather successful sound effects: but, once again, Tennis Open 2007 is a completely different thing... PRO Effective as a one-thumb game Appreciable multiplayer via bluetooth Good sound effects AGAINST So-so graphics Noticeable lack of content Poor longevity", "date": "2007-06-18", "grade": "S.V."}
