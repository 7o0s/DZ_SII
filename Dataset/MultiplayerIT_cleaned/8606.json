Perhaps the hunger for JRPG or the strength of the support that only a platform like Steam can give has finally allowed XSEED to re-propose its great little jewel on Valve's digital delivery service. Sold for just over eleven euros, it offers a faithful transposition of the strong original of the English localization (no Italian). After such a long time, can it still be considered as a valid and interesting title? Let's save the lands of Fleghana Adol and his traveling companion Dogi are two adventurers who discover, in the incipit of the title, how Felghana is besieged by monsters of various kinds. Since this is Dogi's homeland, the two cannot remain indifferent and hurry towards the village to find out what is happening. Along the way Adol meets a damsel in distress named Elena, not just any girl but a childhood friend of his colleague. Rescued by a horde of ferocious wolves, this grateful one takes them to Redmont where it will be discovered that monsters are only the smallest of their problems, given that Count McGuire has been taking advantage of the citizens of Fleghana for two decades now with exorbitant taxes and is even came to close their main source of livelihood, i.e. the mines of Tigray. Adol and Dogi are immediately welcomed as a sign of hope, so the player in the role of the first will soon find himself having to complete the most disparate missions. We are not, as can be guessed, talking about a plot that will go down in history, but thanks to the well-characterized characters and an excellent adaptation, the plot of YS: The Oath in Felghana succeeds very well in its task of linking the various events and as a basis for the full-bodied gameplay. A formidable warrior YS: The Oath in Felghana offers an action RPG style gameplay that divides the experience between exploration and interaction with other characters in the various cities on the one hand, and unconditional extermination of monsters in the various dungeons on the other. The fights, the true heart of the game as usual, are in real time and require you to control Adol. This features a sword attack, a magic strike, jump and dodge. By viewing the action with a three-quarter camera, you need to acquire an excellent mastery of the mechanics in order to be able to get the better of the hordes of creatures that the title makes us face. Adol is very fast both in his movements and in his swings, which makes the game very dynamic and a harbinger of great satisfaction. Upon their death, the monsters leave objects on the ground that do not constitute a real loot, but allow you to recover life points or give a boost to the various statistics, guaranteeing a more powerful attack for a few moments rather than a more effective defense. Furthermore, carrying out sequences of attacks increases an experience point multiplier. Finally, after the carnage, but also hidden in the classic chests, it is possible to find the precious Raval Ore, the mineral that allows you to upgrade your equipment. Adol is not only a skilled swordsman, but by equipping himself with special bracelets he also acquires magical powers linked to the four elements: earth, air, fire and water. Not only that: by discovering some special gems, it is possible to improve each spell by activating the enhanced versions in combat simply by holding down the key to cast the spells. Finally, ours is equipped with a sort of ~berserk~ state that can be used after loading the relative bar, thus acquiring higher speed and attack power for a few moments. YS: The Oath in Felghana is a title designed primarily for a very specific and demanding audience, for this reason the level of challenge already on Normal difficulty is significantly high, especially in boss fights. These are the real flagship of the whole experience, and involve the user in fights with creatures of more than considerable size, equipped with really difficult attack patterns. It is a must to get the most out of what was learned during the exploration of the dungeons in order to get the better of these situations, but the title chooses to remain open also to an audience less accustomed to difficulties, or simply not inclined to frustration. allowing you to lower the level of challenge in case the game over screen appears too many times. Furthermore, it already has different degrees of difficulty from the very beginning, starting from Very Easy to get to Nightmare (plus an additional one to be unlocked by finishing the title) and although it is not possible to change it into running at any moment, after a few deaths you canare temporarily reduce the stats of the boss of the turn. Old school The XSEED title is not only old school in the successful gameplay, but also from a graphic and technical point of view. YS: The Oath in Felghana has several years behind it and perhaps for this reason too, comparing it with modern productions would be merciless, as well as unfair given the reduced price at which it is offered. However, it must be admitted that the general picture is decidedly pleasing to the eye, thanks to the simple but successful backdrops in three dimensions and the good character design. The combination of polygonal elements of the environments and the two-dimensional sprites is well done, even if sometimes the perspective fails to give the right sense of depth, bringing too many problems in aiming enemies rather than in executing a jump with the right precision. Furthermore, the 4:3 origin of the characters is felt, which if you choose a 16:10 resolution appear slightly crushed, while as regards the movies and the interface we would have liked an improvement in the resolution, unfortunately instead it stops at the original material . Nothing to say about the sound sector which, apart from effects linked to the JRPG tradition of the past, boasts a really well done soundtrack, strong in captivating themes that you will find yourself whistling even with the computer off.", "date": "2012-04-11", "grade": "8.0"}
