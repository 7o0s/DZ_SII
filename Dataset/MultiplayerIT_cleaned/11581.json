The new Battalion Wars is always edited by Kuju Entertainment, and is set before and after the war of the prequel, in the ancient land of Asilvania. Lord Ferrok raised a mighty army called the ~Steel Legion~, with which he attacked every free nation in the world in the ~Lightning War~. The coalition of good, called the Solar Empire, launched a powerful attack thanks to a devastating weapon that harnessed the power of the Sun, defeating him and restoring world order. After centuries, the new lord of Asylvania again attempted to conquer the world by declaring another war, narrated in the first Battalion Wars. The world is divided into six nations, all at war despite the peaceful nature of some (the Solar Empire) and the desire to conquer others (Asilvania with its dictator Kaiser Vlad). The story is well told through well-crafted cut scenes between one mission and the next, and introduces numerous characters and events as the game progresses, a factor that greatly helps the immersion and the creation of a good general feeling with the game itself. Battalion Wars 2 faithfully follows the playability of the first, proposing a purely action style rather than a strategic one like the Nintendo DS chapter. Despite the real-time nature of the combat, however, many elements in common with the portable editions still survive, for example the large amount of specializations for the soldiers, the numerous armored vehicles as well as fighter planes and warships, a novelty of this chapter. In any case, each must be used wisely, at the right time and against the right enemy. Just as if it were a strategic piece, each ~pawn~ has a certain resistance and a given firepower: before launching an attack it is always good to weigh our destructive and defensive capacity. There are 19 missions, divided into five campaigns (two of which are set in the past) all well structured, very varied both in the locations and in the actions to be performed. Battalion Wars 2 is set on beaches, hills, tundras, mountains and cities, and we will find ourselves in the midst of naval wars in the ocean, air battles and furious combat between land troops. During the game we take control of dozens and dozens of different elements: soldiers, jeeps, tanks, submarines, frigates, aircraft carriers, fighters, helicopters, bombers, artillery and anti-aircraft vehicles. The variety of gameplay is impressive and for the duration of Battalion Wars 2 you never do the same thing more than once.

Each character or vehicle moves through the nunchuck analog, while pointing the remote at the screen changes the view and fires by pressing the trigger. The remote is very responsive and you have to constantly point it at the TV precisely and firmly, otherwise the game camera is panned or moves too fast. The remote control is innovative but not quite as precise as the classic GameCube pad was, and forces us to a certain effort to never miss the best shot, as well as using the nunchuck movement to jump and swim instead of a comfortable key. In the final levels of the game, the camera can give more than one problem in some particularly agitated phases. It is possible to set the rotation speed of the camera by defining the movement ~box~, but the problem is that we still have to remain too concentrated and still with the wrist towards the TV. Furthermore, while we command our character, it is possible to issue orders to the rest of the troop, indicating an objective and confirming it with the A key, as happens for example in Ghost Recon. The right mix between strategy and action Every time we complete a mission, we are given a grade ranging from ~superb~ to ~C~. In the first case, by obtaining the maximum score for all missions, extra game content such as artwork and documents are unlocked. The general difficulty of Battalion Wars 2 seems to have been tweaked downwards, compared to the first chapter, especially for the entire first part of the game which runs linearly and smoothly. Getting the maximum score in all missions, however, will not be easy at all. Battalion Wars 2 makes extensive use of online connectivity via Nintendo Wi-Fi, with a wide-ranging multiplayer mode and three different options: skirmish, assault and co-op. In the first case it is a question of fighting against an opponent, arranging one's armies on the field in a battle to the last soldier. It can be challengedand a friend through the famous ~codes~, or a random user of the network. There are no particular lag problems and the game always proceeds without jerks. In assault mode you have to face a series of missions, advancing from objective to objective, while our online enemy tries to stop us with every defensive means at his disposal. The cooperative mode, as the name already suggests, instead allows you to face levels together with a friend. Unfortunately this is not the campaign already seen in the single player, but levels specifically designed for two players. The problem, once again, turns out to be the total lack of communication with the second player: in such a game it is essential to share tasks and strategies, but everything is simplified with colored pointers on the screen that manage to convey very little what we mean. Battalion Wars 2 makes extensive use of online connectivity via Nintendo Wi-Fi, with a large multiplayer mode The right mix between strategy and action Regardless of that, all online modes are very entertaining and well thought out, even if there are few levels. Strangely, no split-screen option has been included, so it's not possible to play each of those modes in multiplayer with a friend next to you - a rather bizarre if not inexplicable decision. The style of Battalion Wars 2 follows once again that of the first GameCube chapter: the environments are made in a realistic way, while the characters and vehicles are super deformed and animated in a funny and cartoonish way. The soldiers move a bit like Rayman, with caricatured and exaggerated movements, while the vehicles move with decidedly realistic and well-maintained physics. From a technical point of view, Battalion Wars 2 sets new standards on Nintendo Wii: there are many polygons on the screen, but above all many effects. Very well done water and explosions, rain, smoke, refractions, animated vegetation, wind and also a convincing HDR on the sun, which gives off a very realistic light effect. The field of view is also good, with long glimpses and evocative panoramas that sometimes stretch all the way to the horizon. The technical sector is accompanied by excellent audio, with music that is well suited to a war climate, various and well-sampled effects, and professional dubbing performed with very spot on voices, albeit in English. However, the game is all subtitled in Italian, impeccably as per Nintendo style. Battalion Wars 2 is an excellent game, although it follows the previous chapter in all respects. However, there are some novelties: the addition of warships is very welcome, and the support of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection with an excellent multiplayer mode which significantly extends its longevity. Too bad for the lack of any communication during online sessions and the split-screen options to play with a friend next to you. From the point of view of the controls, these are less precise and effective than the ~old~ gamepad. The technical sector is more than valid, as well as music, dubbing and sounds. Battalion Wars 2 is the game for those looking for the right mix of strategy and action, for fans of the series and for all those who want a deep but extremely enjoyable title. Pros Many weapons, characters and vehicles Technical realization Online play Cons Sometimes imprecise controls No split-screen multiplayer No online communication", "date": "2008-03-10", "grade": null}
