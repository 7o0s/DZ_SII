One of the amazing thing about 007 Nightfire is that it's one of those rare games released on all the existing gaming platforms in the market and so some might take it to compare the various platforms, but we avoid such an exercise and focus on the PC version, subject of this review. 007 Nightfire is a classic FPS with a good storyline, accurate and effective graphics, but which adds nothing to what has already been seen previously. Basically a good job but it doesn't excel in any field, and these days, this can be a serious flaw. But let's proceed with the right order of things by starting to tell you about the plot. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Money is bad for the psyche. The plot is the usual ones, in fact our favorite Secret Agent will find himself having to thwart the usual madman but very rich industrialist, who is no longer happy with making lots of money and decides he wants to conquer the world thanks to the use of nuclear warheads stolen from the former Soviet Union. It makes me smile when I think of the fact that in almost every Bond film there is a megalomaniac rich man who, instead of enjoying his riches, is dedicated to conquering the world. Bah! This is a question that can never really interest me. sigh. Our Bond will be surrounded by the usual crowds of beautiful women, who will take an active part in the events narrated in the game. For example, in the initial mission we will have to protect the beautiful CIA Agent Zoe Nightshade. Unfortunately, the game shows a disconcerting linearity and therefore we will always know exactly what to do, for the simple reason that it will always be the only thing we will be able to do. Of course there are the usual secrets to be discovered, but I think this in 2003 is a little bit. Don't you agree? [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] A polygonal Bond equipped with a sea of Gadgets The graphics are very good especially for the beautiful levels that are made with taste and care, of course the polygonal models of characters are a bit poor, as well as the animations do not excel, but the overall level is absolutely above the sufficiency. The enemies are sensitive to the part of the body in which they are offended, and therefore a blow to the head will be lethal, while if we hit the limbs, the effects will be decidedly lower, even their AI does not make one cry for a miracle, but neither does one turn up one's nose too much , in short, like almost everything else, they are not noticed, but not appreciated either. The gadgets of Bond are very beautiful, ranging from the lighter that serves as a camera, to the pen with soporific darts, to electrifying keys or the Laser watch, up to the beautiful glasses that allow various visions and which prove to be very useful in most situations. They are a bit reminiscent of the Predator's vision modes, but that's okay. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] and a vast arsenal. Unfortunately the legendary WALTHER PPK 7.65 is missing, replaced by a Wolfram P2K, but in order not to make us regret the small but lethal pistol that made Bond famous, there is an arsenal made up of the best weapons available on the market today, from precise and lethal shotguns accuracy, to the equally lethal, but less accurate, shotguns. And if things get complicated, we can always use a nice guided missile. But there is no shortage of grenades, bombs, cannons and many other beautiful trinkets. Not bad! Instead, our safety will be donated to a bulletproof vest whose status is displayed at the bottom left and once exhausted there will be no possibility of replication, since there is no life indicator. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] The last words Meanwhile, the game is afflicted by some annoying bugs, such as that of corpses, which respond to pressing the Action button or to some sporadic system crashes, nothing very serious, but I hope that some patches are already in the works. That said, it should also be emphasized that I didn't really like the Multiplayer, which doesn't seem up to the Single Player experience (which features interesting ideas such as the nice level set inside the space station where we'll have to move with gravity 0), especially for some questionable choices like silent weapons, which don't do any kind of rmood and therefore make the gaming experience frustrating. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] The last words Ultimately Nightfire is a good game, with a good plot and a well-designed design, which however does not stand out for any feature, but you know, when James Bond is involved, you can definitely do without the rest or no? PRO We impersonate James Bond Some levels very well done Good sound and equally valid translation Many weapons, all well done CONS Some bugs Polygonal models of people not exciting Multiplayer Not very innovative James Bond. When just the name is enough. 1997 and one of the most revolutionary games of the time was released for Nintendo 64, the title that demonstrated how it was possible to create an excellent FPS for consoles, but not only that, it also demonstrated that it was possible to exploit a high-impact Merchandising with a very high-quality product quality. The older ones of you know that I'm referring to the excellent Goldeneye by RARE, which was the first title to question the then absolute dominance in this field of Id. Well with great pleasure today I find a new title on my desk, this time published by EA, starring the most famous British Secret Agent in the world.", "date": "2003-01-21", "grade": null}
