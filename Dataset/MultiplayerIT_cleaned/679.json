{"name": "Buzz! The Music Quiz", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/buzz-the-music-quiz.html", "text": "I guess it with a note Sony must have taken a liking to reviving the not very agitated scene of party games, first with Eye Toy, then with Singstar and now with this Buzz!. Yes because, similarly to its illustrious predecessors, the work Relentless Software presents itself as a real revolution in this area: a revolution which, paradoxically, appears to be nothing more than the fulfillment of two basic requirements so far totally ignored by purely cash productions -oriented like those mentioned at the beginning. Basically all the quiz-games released up to now, in fact, have proved to be susceptible to heavy criticism in terms of the quantity of questions offered, as well as that concerning the rationalization of the game peripheral. It therefore often happened to be faced with titles whose questions were repeated even after a few hours of use, or whose play structure did not contemplate a satisfactory multiplayer mode - or worse - confined it to the very few users equipped with Multitap. Well, Buzz! it solves both problems brilliantly, starting with the latter: the SCEE product is in fact marketed together with a curious dedicated peripheral, made up of four controllers in full quiz-show style. Composed at the top by a large red button below which there are four keys of as many different colors, these delightful gaming devices not only help to make the gaming experience more vivid (although given their apparent fragility, it is advisable not to squeeze them too much ), but above all they trace the path of a simple, immediate gameplay and a sure grip on the public. While following the essential dictates of the genre, Buzz! performs its task in an intelligent and complete way, offering the user the beauty of a thousand different songs on the basis of which questions are developed ranging from the simple identification of the title, author or year of release of the piece up to more complex questions, often involving details about the artist in question. It goes without saying that the amount of material is undoubtedly considerable, to the point of avoiding the risk of repetitions for quite some time. Ask a question and give an answer Buzz! allows you to launch into single and multiplayer sessions customizable in terms of game length (short, medium or long) and music selection (new, old songs or a mix of both), thus meeting everyone's needs and knowledge. Before starting the real quiz, you go through the screens for selecting the character and the sound to be assigned to your buzzer, as well as the one relating to entering the name: being able to use only the dedicated peripheral and not the pad, these settings don't shine for ease of execution, but it's still a minor factor. Finally you are introduced to the game by Buzz, a caricatured presenter of the quiz who accompanies the entire session with his comments, capable of becoming a bit annoying in the long run; in any case, he and the ever-present valet Rose mark the times of the game, defining the situations in which the various participants find themselves and illustrating the playful mechanics to newbies. Nothing too complicated or bizarre, however, considering how the big red buzzer of the controller generally serves to book while the four keys below are always assigned to one of the many response opportunities displayed on the screen. However, simplicity does not always rhyme with banality, and in fact Buzz! offers a good variety of playful types, all fun, immediate and exciting to the right point: in addition to the conventional Point Builder, in which it is sufficient to guess the correct answer within the time limit, there are modes based on reaction speed (Snap, Fastest Finger ) alongside others with a high level of risk (Pass The Bomb, Look Before You Leap), ending with the inevitable opportunities offered to users to get in each other's wheels (Point Stealer, Offloader). In short, the irons in the fire in Buzz! is really a lot, even if the SCEE production is not totally free from defects: first of all it should be pointed out how the presence of a certain number of covers within the musical selection makes it more difficult to recognize these tracks compared to the originals, even if the purchase of royalties for each single song would have been economically impracticable. Still, despite Buzz! still offers a completely satisfying playful experience, there is a bit of a lack of some type of extra question, or perhaps the use of music videos in dedicated games, or some supplementary mode. All things that, however, are forgiven for the title Relentless Software, which in its first edition already imposes itself as one of the most successful party games of recent times. Sorry if it's too little. Comment Buzz! The Music Quiz is undoubtedly the best you could want from a trivia game: complete in terms of quantity and variety of questions, with a base of over 1000 songs and enriched by a simple but very effective device, Buzz! it is an excellent party game, usable even by those who are not familiar with the videogame world and fun in any case. Born exclusively from a multiplayer perspective, the SCEE product has no complete sense of existence except as an accompaniment to a party or an evening with friends, and for this reason we recommend its purchase only to those who can count on a solid base of challengers in the flesh. Pros Immediate and fun Large amount of songs and questions Optimal peripheral Cons Virtually non-existent single player Some small omissions here and there It certainly cannot be said that the quiz-games trend is one of the most respectable in the videogame sector, on the contrary: there are few examples of productions in this sense, which are almost always created ad hoc under the license of a successful television program. And it is certainly no coincidence that titles such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire or The Legacy have very little to show apart from a glossy package on which the image of the presenter on duty stands out: poor in content and technical quality, similar products do not provide certainly a good image of a genre decidedly exploited to the minimum of its potential. At least until Buzz! The Music Quiz...", "date": "2005-12-21", "grade": null}
