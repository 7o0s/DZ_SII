Released in July 2019 on PC and then the following year on Nintendo Switch, A Short Hike has finally landed on PlayStation and Xbox as well. We take this opportunity to tell you about our experience with this great little game created by the multifaceted Adam Robinson- Yu. It's a simple adventure, but one that manages to captivate. Here is our review of A Short Hike. A short training story A Short Hike: The story of young Claire and her ascent of Hawk Peak The title of the game contains the different souls of the adventure that it intends to propose. One of these is certainly the story of a real excursion, undertaken by the young Claire on the advice of her aunt during a day (apparently endless) in the Hawk Peak Island National Park. In this microcosm inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, our goal is to to accompany Claire on this climb, which will lead her to meet bizarre individuals and, as in the more traditional coming-of-age stories, even herself. Climbing up to the peak of the mountain is precisely the metaphor of the growth of this character. Yet, the narrative seems to focus more on fleeting encounters than on the characterization of the main character, relegated to the sole function of exploring this strange world. You don't hear the actual evolution of Claire's character. More than a seminal experience in this individual's life, it seems like one of those summer adventures that come to mind years later during a dinner with friends. Although the intention was legitimate, the narrow development of the character of the little protagonist fails to hit the mark. Despite this, A Short Hike stands out precisely for the casual encounters, not strictly necessary to reach the top of the mountain. Each of the characters you meet along the way has its own history and peculiarities, both in character and physical, which makes them easily recognizable and traceable within the game world, which is not always obvious (but it must also be said that the map isn't among the biggest out there). So, it's a game that focuses more on the social ecosystem surrounding the protagonist than on the protagonist herself. A choice not for all palates, we realize, but which also manages to have its own charm, if you prefer to immerse yourself in an environment rather than stepping into the shoes of a third character. Animal Crossing seeds in gameplay A Short Hike: the game of volleyball on the beach with sticks like rackets Like it or not, the Animal Crossing series has marked the minds of many individuals, developers included. Also in the case of A Short Hike, the influence in the realization of the gameplay was there. Not only that: even at an iconographic level we are faced with an operation that, for some, could have the flavor of shameless plagiarism (we are referring to the star-shaped furrows in the ground to indicate to the player where to dig or to the ~drop~ shapes of fish to be able to catch, but also, trivially, to the characters with animalistic and minimal features). It must be said, however, that this process has been camouflaged with some success, since in any case A Short Hike manages to obtain its own identity specific, while drawing from the great classics of the past. A dynamic that also somewhat represents the intrinsic soul of the videogame industry (and not only), or rather knowing how to capture the most functional mechanics and trends and adapt them to one's narrative through images. A Short Hike: gliding is fundamental to gameplay The primary objective of the game is to get to the top of Hawk Peak. Hence, one of the key features of the gameplay is the ability to climb rock faces. This can be done from any location and anywhere on the map, as long as you have enough stamina for climbing. This is symbolized by the golden feathers, collectible objects that allow us to increase our resistance, but also to make more jumps (wing beats) consecutively. In addition to this, Claire can also perform an infinite glide, which does not consume stamina, but which also does not allow you to recover it. The balancing act lies in dosing the jumps with the climbing sections, since the ~feathers~ will only recharge once you find yourself with your feet on a flat surface. The stamina management mechanic has its variations as you progress in the adventure, but nothing excessively complex: just knowing how to sip your strength properly and explore the game map a bit to increase your energy reserve. For the rest, the title provides a whole series of secondary activitiesdarie, from the aforementioned fishing (complete with diversified specimens depending on the place) to the possibility of driving a motorboat or playing volleyball with a stick. In short, those holiday activities and ~young marmots~ that identify the imaginary of the North American national park. A really short climb A Shot Hike: Actually, it doesn't take long to get to the top of the mountain Another of the souls that arise from the title of the game is precisely the brevity of the adventure. A Short Hike can be completed in about an hour and a half, definitely a time that is tight for the construction of a narrative that goes beyond the intriguing nature to reach the shores of expressive satisfaction. It should be noted that we are not talking about an hour and a half to reach the end credits without doing anything else, but by thoroughly exploring and also completing many (if not all) secondary activities. However, a very important stake must be placed on these measurements: the title absolutely does not want to push to interactive compulsion, on the contrary, it was designed precisely with the intention of providing an experience adaptable to one's own times. As far as we are concerned, you may even just want to fish or roam freely with the motorboat for hours and hours, perhaps reopening the game even after the main adventure has been completed. The philosophy of the title is to use it in the way you prefer, without limitations of any kind. And we can only welcome this choice with joy. The indecision of the stylistic line A Shot Hike: artistically the game is very good Like many independent titles developed by individuals who have a certain regard for the aesthetics of their product, A Short Hike is immediately striking for its artistic sector. Punctuated by a balanced and harmonious color palette, the game offers a graphic style that owes much both to experimentation in the artistic field with pixel art, and to the minimalist research of textures and models, whose thickness is given more by the colors and light than affects the latter only by the effective structural complexity that defines them. The care, from this point of view, is impeccable, truly impactful, if you think that it is the work of a single hand (although some external contributions are reported as regards the artistic side). Even in terms of sound, the game does not disappoint , bringing the mind back to Nintendo territory again, with recurring musical themes (composed by Mark Sparling) that have a marked nostalgic touch. A Short Hike: The developer didn't rely much on the impact of his stylistic choices What made us turn up our noses a bit, however, was a choice on the part of the developer, that is to give the possibility to set the intensity of the pixel level that makes up the image, up to canceling its effect. If it is a behavior that we have seen in various titles in recent years, it is still strange to us, as it is usually associated either with a nostalgic issue linked to the remastering of an old video game, or with a ~retro~ effect applied to a product that is somewhat ' refers to the ~arcade~ atmosphere. In this case, the game already starts with the intention of proposing an adventure in pixel art. The fact of giving the possibility to change the actual final aspect of the image is not necessarily regrettable, but it still results in a lack of confidence in one's own vision, which is never a good thing when one wants to share a work with the world of ingenuity (it's like choosing to shoot a film in 4:3 format film, but being afraid that the audience might not like the choice and also supplying a 21:9 version shot digitally).", "date": "2021-12-02", "grade": "8.5"}
