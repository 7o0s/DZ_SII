The reason is easy to say: the amazing franchise set up by Rocksteady (which then passed the baton without major problems to Warner Bros. Games Montreal) undoubtedly appears as the best tie-in ever made. In short, it is a work that on the one hand ensures recognition and solid foundations, on the other it requires great commitment and valid ideas so that we can be up to a difficult task such as that of making a spin-off for PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS. Even more so when the project is linked to a particular trend, that of ~metroidvania~-style action platforms, which draw their cue and inspiration from two absolute classics and therefore imply a certain type of approach to level design, which often and willingly uses the backtracking and gimmick of the extra capabilities that need to be acquired that allow now to start that particular device, now to access that particular step. The first images released had brought to mind the extraordinary Batman for the NES, and we wondered if the Armature Studio guys (who, incidentally, are not newbies at all, given that the team is made up of former Retro Studios members) ) would have managed not to succumb under the weight of such expectations. Well, how did it go? Let's find out together. The cat goes to the lard anyway... The first sequences of Batman: Arkham Origins - Blackgate are purely introductory and revolve around the first encounter between the Dark Knight and Catwoman, with the latter forcing us into a frantic chase on the rooftops in which the 2.5D dynamics of the game give a first, convincing proof of their validity. The idea, also and above all confirmed in the subsequent phases, is to deliver to the fans of the DC superhero a not indifferent visual system, which draws liberally from the assets of the major series to present us with a detailed, convincing, determined and well-animated Batman. even if the choreographies of the fights are not exactly the same as we have been able to see on PC and home consoles. However, the clash system is the same, made up of combos and a particular emphasis on timing, given that you have to be very precise with counterattacks in order not to suffer damage and carry out particular maneuvers where the opponents are armed with knives, electrified batons or machine guns. Think of a miniature Arkham Origins, with two-dimensional gameplay, and you'll have a pretty good idea of how the fights work in Blackgate. The developers have not forgotten even the stealth actions, the underground passages from which to pop up to instantly KO an enemy and the handholds from which to descend for a dive kick or a quick maneuver aimed at capturing the prey of the moment. Quickly assimilate the mechanics and commands, here we enter the heart of the plot: the Joker, Black Mask and the Penguin have organized a revolt in Blackgate prison and now in fact control it, holding all the staff hostage, including the director. Each of these crazed criminals manages an area of the massive penitentiary, and it's up to Batman to break in to fix the situation. Batman: Arkham Origins - Blackgate is an interesting title, with many valid ideas and some shortcomings The best detective in the world The formula adopted by the Armature Studio title sees us explore the levels in search of enemies to kill but also and above all of hidden devices and passages, to be identified by activating the now well-known Detective Mode. On PlayStation Vita this mechanism is simple and intuitive: just touch the touch screen to enjoy a ~tactical~ view of the location, which includes the field of view of any criminals who may be there (in case we want to eliminate them silently, attacking them from behind ). To find the objects that interest us, however, simply switching from one view to another is not enough: we have to drag our finger around and linger on the areas that determine the start of a scan, after which we will be able to interact with them by throwing them at the batarang, the explosives, the grappling hook and so on, depending on the stage of the campaign we are in. Those who know the Rocksteady-branded series know well how much Detective Mode can prove to be a double-edged sword, in the sense that you risk proceeding by keeping it always activated to avoid losing any clues, but thus renouncing to enjoy graphics which, as already said, even in the portable field it manages to have its say with great personality. The obligation to keep your finger on the screen and deeply inspect the highlighted devices partially limits this problem, since it is an operationwhich takes a few seconds and which should only be done when stationary. PSVita trophies Also considering Platinum, there are thirty-one Trophies contained in Batman: Arkham Origins - Blackgate. The most coveted are naturally obtained by defeating bosses, but there are also trophies related to fights and combos. The more complicated ones to obtain are undoubtedly linked to the investigations that we will carry out during the adventure, since we will have to really strive to find all the required objects. Along the way Ordunque: Batman: Arkham Origins - Blackgate is nice to see, offers interesting mechanics and is also quite substantial, given that the story is completed in no less than seven hours but there are three possible endings depending on the boss that we leave for last, the which opens up to some degree of replay value. What went wrong? Let's say that the developers have taken risks, knowingly or not, and some unpleasant situations are unfortunately the consequence. Backtracking, which as mentioned is a characterizing element of metroidvania-style productions, in this specific case was not managed in the best possible way: first of all because the many graphic contortions give life to at least complex architectures, whose connotation is in no way clarified by the two-dimensional map; secondly because the areas cleared of enemies remain so, leaving us alone with ourselves during the long walks that take us back to one place or another. Instead, we refuse to brand the courageous approach to the bosses, which we would define as ~old school~, in which you have to figure out how to defeat the enemy and then act, at the cost of trying ten times in a row. The clashes with Black Mask, Deadshot, the Joker and all the others are anything but trivial, and although sometimes they are resolved in an instant, they have the great advantage of proposing interesting variations on the theme.", "date": "2013-11-25", "grade": "7.2"}
