Techland wanted to approach survival horror with a decidedly particular approach, both in terms of game mechanics and for the setting, proposing an apocalypse of the living dead on a wonderful tropical island off the coast of Papua New Guinea, called Banoi. To get an idea of the game it doesn't matter to know anything else, because in fact there isn't much else to see, as the plot and the dialogues don't seem to have been really among the developers' priorities: after an unedifying introduction common to all the characters you find yourself playing one of the four possible protagonists, all characterized by being immune to the strange contagion that has invaded the island, transforming the quiet tourists into bloodthirsty undead monsters, therefore obviously the ideal people to carry on hopes of those who survived and hope to escape hell. Thus there is the evident contrast between the natural wonders of the tropical island, the colorful and cheerful structures of the resort and the breathtaking views on one side and the rotten and bloody horror on the other, but under this first impact there is a hybrid game structure that traces a new path in the field of survival horror, merging features from different genres and harmonizing them in a rather convincing way. The result is a title that certainly stands out from the crowd both for the playful solutions adopted and for its particular appearance, a game that is not without flaws and roughness but that has the ability to immerse the player in a profound way, also by virtue of that first-person shot all immersion and involvement, but also the cause of many problems in terms of playability. First person combat We talked about a hybrid structure to define the gameplay studied by Techland for Dead Island, which is essentially a first-person action game that draws elements from FPS and RPGs in a rather balanced measure, seasoning everything with typical characteristics of survival horror such as monsters in overwhelming quantities and a situation of constant threat. The main point of contact with the FPS is obviously the first person shot, a solution that significantly increases the immersion in the game but conversely complicates the action somewhat during the fights, given that in most cases the latter take place with ~melee~ weapons of various types, and the impossibility of seeing more extensively the portion of the scenery surrounding the character, as well as the position of the latter with respect to the enemies, often makes us regret the third-person view typical of survival horror. Similarly, the excellent ~dismemberment~ system developed by Techland, on the basis of which it is possible to carry out differentiated damage with a certain precision based on the parts of the body hit and therefore create studied weak points on the opponents, gets lost a little ' in the furious melees with the sound of clubs, iron pipes and sticks that hardly allow you to precisely target the vulnerable areas of the enemies, instead working properly with firearms, which however are not abundant. The RPG elements instead permeate the rest of the game beyond the combat system, in the vast insistence on the exploration and evolution of the characters, as well as on the care of weapons and their careful management. The ~role-playing~ sphere therefore includes the development of the character and his various combat and non-combat skills, which we will discuss later, and the large space reserved for the management of the arsenal. A wide range of objects can be used as weapons, with different effects: each of these objects has its own characteristics in terms of attack strength, defense capacity, handling and durability, which can also vary according to the specific skills of the character, but which can also be actively modified by crafting such items at workbenches scattered throughout the world. In these areas it is possible to repair weapons, upgrade them or even create new ones if you have specific projects (similar to those present in Fallout 3, for example) and the right objects collected around. Hell tourism FPS, RPG and survival horror: these three genres are joined by a further feature chosen by Techland, namely ~free roaming~. As happens in RPGs with a more open setting (the Bet productions come to mindhesda, with which Dead Island has more than one feature in common) we find ourselves freely exploring a huge game area by carrying out various quests, with each progress made which is accompanied by the conquest of experience points capable of giving new skills to the protagonist . The island of Banoi was built meticulously and realistically as a complex system of hotels, recreation areas, beaches, lighthouses, security structures and villages, all freely reachable on foot or by car (a choice which often proves to be obligatory given the long distances and the risk associated with travel) and can be explored more or less at will and in a non-linear order. Scattered around the big island we find events and characters arranged according to a sandbox system, so some meet simply by continuing in the game according to the lines imposed by the main quests, closely linked to the progression of the plot, but many characters and events can only be found by exploring the areas of our own mind and in a more in-depth way. The characters with which it is possible to interact have specific requests that trigger quests, each characterized by a level of difficulty and by different rewards in terms of experience points, money or special weapons. Unlike what happens, for example, in Dead Rising, there are almost never time limits linked to the execution of the quests, which leads to accepting as many of them as possible at the same time, carrying out different ones in the exploration of the island far and wide . Almost always it is essentially a matter of recovering objects or finding missing people, in some cases of escorting survivors or eliminating specific enemies but in principle these are missions with little narrative impact, which however do not propose very varied situations, yet their location and organization make it natural to accept large quantities of them, even simply to assume objectives that give meaning to the exploration of the island. Four characters in search of an author Dead Island is a game designed to be enjoyed in multiplayer (online only, split screen is not foreseen), or in any case offering the possibility of switching from single to multiplayer and vice versa at any time, and it is something that is noticeable right from the story and character setting. The four selectable fighters have different looks and each have a preference for a specific weapon or approach to combat (melee, firearms, thrown weapons and blades) but beyond the basic elements they are essentially shells to be filled at pleasure, while the same evolution of the story regardless of the protagonist chosen is a clear consequence of the neutral setting necessary for a system based on cooperative multiplayer in the ~drop in-drop out~ style, which can be activated and deactivated at will at any time. The evolution of the character is decided by the player by spending experience points within three different skill trees: one dedicated to the ~fury~, i.e. the special combat skills specific to each character, one dedicated to the standard characteristics of combat and exploration and one to the character's own stats. In this way it is possible to build your own specific fighter potentially different from the one carried out by another player, in order to enrich the possible combinations by playing in cooperative mode. Another element clearly derived from the trend towards multiplayer is the management of the death of the character, which basically does not bring great losses as it simply requires waiting a few seconds for a comfortable ~respawn~ near the last place visited, leaving the progress made so far. These are characteristics that streamline the structure, necessarily directing it towards more direct action, lightening its narrative characteristics and diluting the level of challenge and commitment towards a more immediate and action conception of survival horror, but which for these very reasons could be seen as heresies by the most intransigent fans of the genre. On the other hand, there are positive elements both in the single player game, which increases identification and amplifies the fear and sense of constant danger given by being alone on an island full of zombies, and in the one in multiplayer, where obviously the possibility of sharing the experience with up to three other players exponentially increases the fun and strategic solutions to combat, especially as regards the more challenging monsters, with some situations that closely resemble the cooperative situations of Left 4 Dead. There is also a certainsimplicity and speed in entering multiplayer matches (with a fair limitation imposed on the basis of the level of experience, so only characters of a nearby level can cooperate), a feature that underlines that fluidity of passage between single and multi sought by the developers as a basis for the Dead Island experience. Xbox 360 goals The unlockable objectives are 48 for the usual total of 1000 points to collect. Dead Island's achievements are integrated according to a system similar to the one studied by Valve in its games, i.e. largely linked to the amount of actions performed and to the progression in certain performances with constant progress signaling towards each of these, so as to always have an idea of what to do and how many times to do it to get the achievement. This system largely eliminates the mystery of knowing what to do to unlock the achievements, but the collection is still a demanding undertaking. Creepy paradise The setting chosen for Dead Island is one of the characteristic elements of the game, whose aspect is entirely played on the continuous and strident oxymoron between the beauty of the tropical sceneries, the cheerfulness and the colors of the holiday structures which dominate the island of Banoi and the devastating nightmare that fell on this one night. Techland's Chrome Engine 5 graphics engine has already demonstrated excellent capabilities in other previous productions of the Polish group and in this title perhaps it reaches one of the best applications in terms of detail and above all vastness of the explorable scenario. However, there are several texture loading problems, sporadic busted interpenetrations between polygons and something remains to be recorded regarding the modeling of the characters, in particular their faces. The limits in terms of physics management of the Chrome Engine appear here perhaps more marked due to the great freedom of action, which is hampered by a limited interaction with the objects and elements of the scenario (except those - well highlighted - which can be collected, of course), while the differentiation of the effects of the blows on enemy bodies according to the point of impact is well implemented, albeit with the aforementioned tactics and aiming problems in ~melee~ situations. The beauty of the scenarios and the great freedom of movement obviously concerns the exteriors since on the contrary the interiors - which are also present in a certain percentage among the various quests present - as already noted in the preview, prove to be rather flat and generally weak in terms of level design, moreover characterized by an annoying idiosyncrasy with perspective and subjective camera movement, this being evidently a game born and raised to be free roaming in the open. The audio accompaniment is composed of well-integrated music and standard environmental sound effects, with some annoying insistence on the same exclamations of surprise by the protagonist, but above all the ~verses~ of the contaminated ones capture the attention, a real own sensory support to detect the presence of hidden enemies nearby.", "date": "2011-09-05", "grade": "8.0"}
