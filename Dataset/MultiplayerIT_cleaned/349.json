{"name": "Football Manager Campionato 2007 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/football-manager-campionato-2007-recensione.html", "text": "Databases Let's start the analysis of the stock from a fundamental aspect: the database. Football Manager Championship 2007 presents all the real names of the players and 20 championships from which to choose the team to lead: the players of England, Germany and Scotland will be very satisfied, who will have 4 leagues available, while the video coaches of Holland, France, Spain, Portugal and Italy will have to settle for two championships (for us clearly Serie A and Serie B). To these tournaments, we must also add the teams of 50 other countries from all continents that we will be able to challenge in friendlies but which will also be raw material for ~exotic~ and good quality purchases. Note how the database in the initial version was updated at the beginning of August: Codemasters has already made available an updated patch at the beginning of September with all the necessary changes to the squads. On the other hand, we regret having to report the total absence of national teams, an element traceable in all competing productions. Another element whose lack is immediately noticeable is the multiplayer substituted by the possibility of uploading our best scores to the net at the end of the championship: a meager, meager consolation... Difficult does not rhyme with beautiful Once our customizable digital alter ego has been created using a not too elaborate but easily manageable editor, it's time to start our season on the bench not before choosing the level of complexity of the simulation. FMC2007 played without aids and with maximum complexity proves to be not only inferior to Football Manager, the real benchmark for the genre, but not even up to the Scudetto. Better therefore to make it more simplified and accessible to all. In this way the production of Codemasters, as well as for a very ~user friendly~ interface, can be appreciated precisely for the speed with which the validity of a footballer is understood and the comparison with another athlete in the same role: through a bar summary of the characteristics, the data will be easily understood in a few moments. Even the management of the transfer market, although more ~alive~ than the automatisms of the previous editions, will not require excessive efforts other than trying to raise the sales and purchase prices. And then you have to manage the actual game... even the management of the transfer market, even if more ~alive~ than the automatisms of the previous editions, will not require excessive efforts other than trying to negotiate sales and purchase prices Cover the flanks, press the attacker, go offside, don't insult the referee... However, the core of the Codemasters series has always been the possibility of viewing and intervening in real time in the unfolding of the actual game. Anyone who wants can also decide to read the result at the end of the contest, but in this way, a large part of the pleasure of the proposed gaming experience will be lost. Despite some limitations of artificial intelligence, FMC2007 simulates a football match in a pleasant way: moreover, the commands that we will be able to give as a coach (change of tactics, substitutions, special orders to be given) will have perceptible consequences in almost real time. From a graphic point of view, we are certainly not dealing with a graphics engine capable of dueling with Fifa (nor with Pro Evolution Soccer) especially as regards the similarity of the players with their real counterparts (almost non-existent at all) but inside of the reference genre, that of football management, we are a step above all other productions and this element undoubtedly plays in favor of the production of Codemasters. Moreover, it will be nice to see our stadium expanded after the renovation works, even if it leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth not seeing the various phases of construction of the new stands but only the final moment of the construction work. Finally, with regard to the commentary, once again this year the voice of Sandro ~Eurostar gone mad~ Piccinini will comment on our performance with results, however, not exactly exciting. Remaining on the subject of football and TV, it is worth mentioning the presence of Football One, a sort of interactive channel that will allow us to review the main actions of our team and the opponents as well as being able to analyze various game statistics both to understand the possible shortcomings of our team but also to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the next opponents. the core of the Codemasters series has always been the ability to view and intervene in real time as the actual game unfolds Cross-platform Football Manager Championship 2007 is also available for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2. In addition to the due differences in the management of the commands for the differences between mouse and joypad (the programmers have however thought of various adjustments such as the use of the back keys to simplify the passages of screens), the only substantial variations concern the PS2 version which has some reduction such as the impossibility of seeing the actions of the opponents on Football One and the availability of less statistical data. However, given the hardware differences, we also confirm the vote given to the PC counterpart for the two console versions. Final comment Football Manager 2007 Championship is a title that must be considered due to its specific nature: we are certainly not dealing with a competitor of Sports Interactive's productions as much as a manager suitable even for the more ~casual~ users who do not want to analyze thousands of pages for make an impressive number of choices to help your favorite team win the Scudetto. A game that makes the match itself the heart of the interactive experience with the good feeling of having a direct influence on the progress of the match with the decisions taken. Some shortcomings are decidedly unjustifiable (absence of multiplayer and national teams) but the Codemasters series will certainly carve out its own audience who will be satisfied with the proposed experience. Pros Immediate and simple Management and 3D visualization of the match in real time Updated database Cons Absence of multiplayer Where are the national teams? In the ~complex~ version it does not reach the competition We could start this review with the usual introductory hat on Moggiopoli, the wiretapping scandal and company but whoever is writing this article wanted to emphasize the beauty, indeed the beautiful ones of Italian football... But no more introductory incipits and let's find out immediately more closely the title of Codemasters which, despite the almost similar name with the production of Sports Interactive, reworks this kind of videogame interaction in a very different way from its competitor. Football Manager Championship 2007, like its predecessors, is a product aimed at those who don't want to consider a billion statistics and have to decide even the most marginal aspects of team training. FMC2007 is the Virtua Striker of managers, a product also suitable for the more ~casual~ player who wants to train his favorite team.
