{"name": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-3.html", "text": "Ghost troops in action The game has 3 difficulty levels, for those unfamiliar with the old ~Rainbow Six or Rogue Spear~ even the easiest will not be a walk in the park, the parameters that distinguish the various levels of difficulty are many, the enemies will have a field of action greater, they will be more reactive and accurate in fire, they will use secondary weapons in their equipment such as grenades, and so on. Ghost Recon features 15 single player missions, which can be completed either in a ~quest~ mode following the predefined story, or without following an order via the quick mission mode. Although the difficulty is quite high, especially for beginners, the game allows you to save the mission at any point, in this way you avoid a lot of anger due to a continuous restart mission. During the briefing at the beginning of the mission it is possible to select both the members of the team and their equipment to your liking, by completing the various levels, you can in fact increase the skills of each soldier, and also unlock ~kits~ of objects that can be used , of course also in multiplayer games. Ghost troops in action The controls of the soldier are very similar to those of halo, both for the movements and for the reload button of the weapon and the various actions in general, for those who have played the now famous title bungie (if you have not done so .. fix it immediately ! ) there will be no difficulties in this sense, the commands to be assigned to the other members of the 2 teams are simple and essential, but they manage to satisfy all needs. The control of the soldiers on your team is one of the most important things in the game, using the skills of the individuals correctly, it is in fact possible to change the marines you want to use at any time of the game among those still alive obviously, while you give orders to the teams greatly simplifies the unfolding of the mission. The settings are varied, ranging from forests, city environments, countryside or military installations, such as a prison for example, we will also find different atmospheric conditions, both due to the alternation of night and day, and such as the presence of snow or rain, which obviously will affect the visibility conditions, increasing the realism of the game. Graphics and Sound The technical aspect is up and down, certainly not the best game technically speaking on Xbox, and the port of the pc version hasn't improved much the engine of Ghost Recon, although the final result renders fairly well, the Ubisoft title does not excel in any field, presenting square elements, certainly not very high resolution textures, and some elements such as the bushes that do not do justice to the Xbox potential, the effects of light or the frame rate which always remains stable. The positive points instead come from the animations and the graphic detail of the individual soldiers, two aspects that are decidedly well done, and above all from the Audio department, which by presenting excellent support for Dolby Digital 5.1 manages to completely immerse a player in the battlefield. Battles on Xbox Live I left the multiplayer section for last, because it deserves to be considered not as an ~accessory~ to the game itself, but rather as its greatest strength. Ghost Recon offers full support for online play on Xbox Live, and thanks to its structure, and the game concept itself, it is perhaps the game that best fits the online service for Xbox. Ghost troops in action It must immediately be said that of all the titles, Ghost Recon is the one that makes the most use of the amount of available bandwidth and the connection itself, in fact, before creating a game, a (very short) test is always performed on our connection, and then the recommended number of players supported, without any lag problems, it is of course possible to ignore the suggestion, but all users who join our game will be warned of the non-~ideal~ conditions. Out of the purely technical discourse on use of Xbox Live, let's move on to the practical one, the possible game options are numerous, mainly divided into ~Solo~ mode, ~cooperative~ and ~Team~ have other sub-categories: - Solo: these are obviously the game sessions carried out in the more classic all against all, without possible allies among the other opponents, the single player mode offers 4 sub-categories  Last Man: like the most classic of the HighLander .. Only One will remain!  Sharpshooter: here whoever kills the most enemies at the end of the mission wins  Hamburger Hill: in the center of the map there isa zone to be conquered whoever has the most time left wins  Cat and Mouse: (to be unlocked) where each player killed becomes the prey of all the others and armed only with a pistol - Team: obviously the player in the game lobby is positioned in a of the teams present and has the other teams as an enemy, obviously here the communicator allows you to speak only to the members of your own team.  Last man standing: as in Solo mode, the last team remaining on the map with at least 1 player wins  Search And Rescue: in the center of the map there are 3 hostages to be returned healthy to their control center, whoever brings the most wins !  Hamburger Hill: as in Solo mode, obviously here you play in teams  Domination: in the map there are areas to conquer, as soon as a member of the team enters it, he becomes the color of the team and for every second passed he earns a point, he wins who has the most points  Siege: a team leaves in a base to defend, for a certain period of time, if it succeeds it wins. -Cooperative: two teams available, you play all together to complete the mission against the cpu, perhaps the most suitable mode for ghost recon is this, certainly the most engaging and the one where the use of the communicator is certainly fundamental, it is divided in:  Mission: as in the offline game, you have to complete the missions, only here all the soldiers can be real  Clash: there are enemy soldiers on the map, the only goal: Kill them all.  Reconnaissance: you must reach a sampling area after having carried out an exploration of the territory. Ghost troops in action The way to use the communicator in Ghost Recon is decidedly atypical, to talk to the members of your team, or to the opponents you have to hold down a button on the pad, impractical perhaps, but also decidedly atmospheric, as if you were activating a radio virtual transmitter, only in cases of need, remaining focused on the mission for the rest of the time. Ghost Recon, at the moment it is the least immediate to play on Xbox live but also the one that offers the greatest longevity, thanks to the numerous modes and the involvement offered by other human components. Obviously Live is not the only possibility to play in multiple players, Ghost Recon fully supports the Lan connection and the 2-player splitscreen mode, with the same modalities. Mission Complete .. In conclusion I can do nothing but recommend the Ubisoft title to everyone, perhaps it will not shine in terms of graphics compared to many other productions on Xbox, but it does not disappoint in the least in terms of gameplay, almost the same thing for those who own Xbox Live , or in any case it has the possibility of playing in multiplayer, here Ghost Recon becomes one of the most fun and long-lived games available on Xbox. Promoted with full marks! PROS: +Adrenaline +Audio +Long-lived +It's Ghost Recon! CONS: - Graphically not the best Ghost troops in action Tom Clancy makes an encore on Xbox, after the great Splinter Cell, here comes the console version of Ghost Recon, another title that boasts the now famous license. The plot of the game is certainly not very original, but decidedly compliant with the ~standard~ setting of Clancy's novels, in practice it is a question of coordinating a group of American soldiers, equipped with the best military technologies, trained in the most advanced combat techniques, called i  Ghosts against the new Russian threat that wants to rebuild the old Soviet Empire So here we are catapulted in 2008, in Russian territory, fully armed and ready for combat. The key word of the game is ~strategy~, Ghost Recon is certainly not a Quake 3 clone, everything we do during the missions must be dictated by calm, the ~rambo~ sorties will only lead to certain death.", "date": "2003-03-21", "grade": null}
