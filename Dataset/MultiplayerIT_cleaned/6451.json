The complete series consists of five English-language episodes. The text is reasonably lacking in anticipation. A complex relationship is developing between us and Life is Strange. We've played the first two episodes and will gladly play the third one as well. At the same time we would like to have a copy of the game and make a liberating gesture like throwing it very hard against the wall. That's because Life is Strange manages to be both very engaging and very obnoxious at the same time. The voice of the game, that is the tone with which the plot develops, is that of an adult who occasionally feels forced to play the kid, with embarrassing effects. When Max talks to Joyce in the diner we see a touching and natural moment, but when Max talks to a desperate homeless woman as if she were his dear grandmother, the game takes over that idealized vision of life typical of those who have not yet caught a train of pain between the teeth. Or he pretends he didn't get it and keeps sprinkling sugar waiting to open his eyes. Compared to the first episode, which was almost a virtual tour of Max's world, Out of Time highlights this contrast in tone of voice more. In fact, he talks about hard topics such as bullying, drugs, sexual abuse, corruption; destructive behaviors for which many people suffer a lot, but it does so with the brilliant and variegated colors of a mythical autumn that makes us not believe those who say that in the small Arcadia Bay people die of boredom and mediocrity. Among these singers of decadence Chloe stands out, our sad and ~crazy~ friend, who, however unpleasant, still manages to make herself loved, like almost all the other main characters, after all, including the antagonists. Here, perhaps the best quality of Out of Time is the compassion with which he portrays each of the human beings who populate his world. There are large gray areas in this game and the developers have been very good at hiding important choices behind simple gestures, only letting us guess what the consequences might be so that when the final blow comes, it surprises us without being arbitrary. And there, at that dramatic moment, we will be able to save the life of someone close to our hearts. Provided, however, that you have listened carefully to the people who confided in us and that you have observed their private lives in detail. The fact that the final result depends on the level of identification of the player in Max's life is appreciable, but it comes after a long digression that has left us feeling like a wasted opportunity. The developers have a potential in their hands that they still can't master, but which when expressed at its best, is certainly worth a long walk in the streets of Arcadia Bay. Out of Time goes too far into daydreaming, but ultimately hits hard The right girl at the right time About ups and downs. You may remember from the first episode that Max discovered he has the power to rewind time. In Out of Time this power is used convincingly only on two occasions, the second of which is also the climax of the episode. We avoid going into specifics so as not to spoil the surprise, but both scenes repay the long wait made up of solitary meditations and chats with any passerby who happens to be close to Max. In our opinion, it would have been fine like this, then leaving the player the possibility of choosing whether or not to rewind time in the face of difficult decisions. Instead, using Max's power to fix a glass or keep a bottle of beer from falling is a silly excuse to add it one too many times. Not to mention the very long scene in which we have to convince Chloe that we are really capable of going back in time by passing two consecutive memory tests. We believe that Life is Strange creates a world thanks to the minute information with which it fills the dialogues and settings, but Out of Time wastes too much energy skirting around the issues rather than trying to penetrate them deeply. In short, there is a lot of atmosphere and little narration. Yet something is moving. As if the writers were aware of having to tame their pen before it loses its way, we suddenly find ourselves at a crossroads where the subplots intersect and explode in a powerful and initially unexpected way. We say initially because a moment is enough to review with the mind the small clues that had been sown without them being too obvious. And it is in this that Life is Strange recovers. Even more than in the first episode we have so many decisions to make, both of the sensational ones sia of the seemingly insignificant ones like watering a plant or not. Eventually it turns out that these decisions are connected dots capable of producing important effects. And perhaps irreversible. Max isn't the center of it all this time, but he's the center of it all. How we behave in his shoes will make all the difference.", "date": "2015-03-29", "grade": "7.0"}
