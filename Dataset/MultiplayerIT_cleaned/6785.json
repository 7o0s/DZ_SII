If you have read our trial of the beta, you will already know what we are talking about: a turn-based strategy characterized by an excellent technical sector, complete with a kill cam when our character enters ~rage mode~, which stages one of the chapters most fascinating of the franchise (that of the Space Wolves) within increasingly more complex missions, regulated by distinctly hardcore mechanisms. The game follows too rigid tracks, see for example the obligation to orient the units in one of the four directions at the end of a movement and the impossibility of attacking an enemy who is in an adjacent square, if we don't ~look~ towards of him; or the management of the turn order, regulated by a mechanism that is a little complicated to understand and in any case lacking the freedom that it would be legitimate to ask of a strategist of this type. Edges that do not affect the thickness and goodness of the product, but which inevitably make its use slower and heavier, thanks to an execution speed that on the iPhone 5s did not seem extraordinary at all: despite the presence of a forward button rapid, each character takes a few moments before making his move, giving rise to even unnerving expectations in the more advanced stages of the campaign, when the missions become long and multifaceted. Warhammer 40,000: Space Wolf is a hardcore strategy game, with an indisputable charm but many edges Card wins, card loses Commanding a squad consisting of a main character and two support units, your task during the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine campaign, divided into three parts (with a fourth to be added soon, plus a multiplayer mode) , is often to eliminate the enemies present within the scenarios, reach a certain area unharmed or escort an ally. As already mentioned, the game boasts a technical sector of excellent quality, also equipped with a view that can be rotated freely in four angles (therefore always remaining in an isometric perspective), with the action being accompanied by sounds and music that are up to the situation . However, some important elements of the interface are missing, for example an indicator that makes it clear immediately whether or not the selected weapon can hit one of the enemies in the vicinity, or what its range is. In the lower part of the screen there are five collectible cards that determine the actions that can be performed during each round, connected to weapons with different ranges and degrees of effectiveness, all of which can also be used to perform a simple movement if a specific card is missing. With a little familiarity, deck management and card crafting proves to be one of the pleasant aspects of the game, while on the freemium dynamics front, a separate discussion must necessarily be made. In fact, when we tried the beta, we had the feeling that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine didn't push too much on monetization, and that it could be played for free without too many headaches. Well, playing with the final version we have some doubts about it, especially if we consider the balance of the difficulty. The missions that make up the first part of the campaign, for example, are completed without feeling the need to dig into the wallet and with the feeling that it doesn't take much to collect the 5000 coins needed to unlock one of the many packages present, i.e. the extra units and the two additional ~classes~ for the protagonist, each featuring unique abilities. However, when you reach the central part of the adventure, things begin to get heavy and the challenge takes on tougher connotations, which makes it almost mandatory to use the possible aids available. While not considering this aspect of the experience limiting in an absolute sense, and also bearing in mind the rigidities we mentioned above, unfortunately we cannot reward the Herocraft title with the vote it would have deserved if the developers had better balanced certain aspects of the gameplay and the freemium model.", "date": "2014-11-06", "grade": "7.5"}
